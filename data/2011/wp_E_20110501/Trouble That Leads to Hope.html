<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 TIMOTHY 3:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">HAVE you heard about<wbr />—or witnessed—<wbr />any of the following sad events?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● A fatal disease claims dozens of lives.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● A famine sends hundreds to their grave.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● An earthquake kills thousands and leaves many more homeless.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">On the pages that follow, you will review some sobering facts about events like these. You will also see that the Bible predicted such conditions for the period of time called “the last days.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The purpose of these articles, however, is not to convince you that we live in a troubled world. You likely see this trouble firsthand. Rather, they are designed to give you hope. They will show that the fulfillment of these six prophecies means that “the last days” will soon end. This series will also consider some common objections to this evidence and will provide good reason to believe that something better lies just ahead.</p>

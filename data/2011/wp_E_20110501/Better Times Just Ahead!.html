<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more . . . But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">PSALM 37:10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WOULD you like to see the above-quoted prophecy come true? No doubt, you would. There are solid reasons for believing that it soon will.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The preceding articles discussed just some of the Bible prophecies that clearly indicate that we are living in “the last days.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>) God inspired the Bible writers to foretell those events so that we might have hope. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>) The fulfillment of such prophecies means that the troubles we now face will soon end.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What will follow the last days? God’s Kingdom will rule all mankind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>) Consider the Bible’s description of conditions on earth at that time:</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● <strong>Hunger will be eliminated. </strong>“There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:72:16-19:72:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 72:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">● <strong>Disease will be eliminated. </strong>“No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">● <strong>The earth will be renewed. </strong>“The wilderness and the waterless region will exult, and the desert plain will be joyful and blossom as the saffron.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:35:1-23:35:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 35:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">These are just a few of the encouraging Bible prophecies that will soon be fulfilled. Why not ask Jehovah’s Witnesses to show you why they are so confident that better times are just ahead?</p>

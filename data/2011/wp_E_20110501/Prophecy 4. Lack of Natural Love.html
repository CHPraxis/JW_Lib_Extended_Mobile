<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“People will . . . lack normal affection for their families.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 TIMOTHY 3:1-3</a>, God’s Word Bible</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● Chris works for a domestic-violence help group in North Wales. “I remember one lady coming in who was so badly beaten up I could not even recognise her from the last time I had seen her,” says Chris. “Other women are so emotionally damaged they won’t even lift their eyes off the floor.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>WHAT DO THE FACTS SHOW? </strong>In one African country, approximately 1 out of every 3 women has been sexually abused as a child. A survey conducted in that same country found that more than one third of men felt that it was acceptable to beat their wives. However, women are not the only victims of domestic violence. In Canada, for example, nearly 3 out of 10 men have been battered or otherwise abused by their partners.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>WHAT IS A COMMON OBJECTION? </strong>There has always been domestic violence. It is just receiving more attention today than it did in times past.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>IS THAT OBJECTION VALID? </strong>Awareness of domestic violence has been heightened in recent decades. But has greater awareness of the problem reduced the number of incidents of domestic violence? No, that has not been the case. A lack of natural affection is ever more prevalent.</p>

An estimated 50 percent of that litter is plastic that will drift for hundreds of years before it degrades. Besides polluting the earth, humans are depleting its natural resources at an alarming rate. Studies show that the earth needs one year and five months to regenerate what humans consume in a year. “If population and consumption trends continue, we will need the equivalent of two Earths by 2035,” reports the Australian newspaper <em>Sydney Morning Herald.</em></p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sc">  Since the Bible predicted the bad conditions we see today, does that make God responsible for them? Does he cause us to suffer?

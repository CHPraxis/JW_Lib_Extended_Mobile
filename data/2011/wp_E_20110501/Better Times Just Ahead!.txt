Better Times Just Ahead!
“Just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more . . . But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”—PSALM 37:10, 11.
WOULD you like to see the above-quoted prophecy come true? No doubt, you would. There are solid reasons for believing that it soon will.
The preceding articles discussed just some of the Bible prophecies that clearly indicate that we are living in “the last days.” (2 Timothy 3:1-5) God inspired the Bible writers to foretell those events so that we might have hope. (Romans 15:4) The fulfillment of such prophecies means that the troubles we now face will soon end.
What will follow the last days? God’s Kingdom will rule all mankind. (Matthew 6:9) Consider the Bible’s description of conditions on earth at that time:
● Hunger will be eliminated. “There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.”—Psalm 72:16.
● Disease will be eliminated. “No resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”—Isaiah 33:24.
● The earth will be renewed. “The wilderness and the waterless region will exult, and the desert plain will be joyful and blossom as the saffron.”—Isaiah 35:1.
These are just a few of the encouraging Bible prophecies that will soon be fulfilled. Why not ask Jehovah’s Witnesses to show you why they are so confident that better times are just ahead?

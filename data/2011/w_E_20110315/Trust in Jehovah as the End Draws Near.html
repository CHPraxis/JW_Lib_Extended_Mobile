<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">WE LIVE in a world where millions no longer know whom or what to trust, perhaps because they have been hurt or disappointed too many times. What a contrast to Jehovah’s servants! Guided by godly wisdom, they know better than to place their trust in this world or its “nobles.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:146:3-19:146:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 146:3</a>) Rather, they place their lives and their future in Jehovah’s hands, knowing that he loves them and that he always fulfills his Word.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:4-45:3:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 3:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:38-45:8:39" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 8:38, 39</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Joshua of old attested to God’s trustworthiness. Toward the end of his life, he said to his fellow Israelites: “You well know with all your hearts and with all your souls that not one word out of all the good words that Jehovah your God has spoken to you has failed. They have all come true for you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:23:14-6:23:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Josh. 23:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Jehovah fulfills his promises, not just out of love for his servants but especially for the sake of his own name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:3:14-2:3:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ex. 3:<span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/9:12:22-9:12:22" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Sam. 12:22</a>) Concerning the divine name, the introduction to <em>The Emphasized Bible, </em>by J. B. Rotherham, states: “[It] becomes a most gracious promise; the Divine capacity of adaptation to any circumstances, any difficulties, any necessities that may arise . . . [It is] a promise, . . . a revelation, a memorial, a pledge. To this Name, God will ever be faithful; of it He will never be ashamed.”</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Ask yourself: ‘Do I know Jehovah well enough to have absolute trust in him? Do I face the future with confidence, knowing that God is in full control?’ Says <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:26:4-23:26:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 26:4</a>: “Trust in Jehovah, you people, for all times, for in Jah Jehovah is the Rock of times indefinite.” Granted, God does not now miraculously intervene in people’s lives as he did on occasion in Bible times. Nevertheless, as “the Rock of times indefinite,” he can be trusted “for all times.” How does our trustworthy God assist his faithful worshippers today? Let us consider three ways: He strengthens us when we seek his help to resist temptation, he supports us when we have to deal with apathy or outright opposition, and he buoys us up when anxieties weigh us down. As we examine these areas, be sure to reflect on how you can strengthen your trust in Jehovah.</p>

<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 5. As to our trust in God, where may a great test lie?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>It is one thing to trust in Jehovah when it comes to his promise of Paradise or the resurrection<wbr />—things for which we yearn. But it may be an entirely different thing to trust in him in moral matters, to be thoroughly convinced at heart that submitting to his ways and standards is right and will lead to the greatest happiness. King Solomon wrote this admonition: “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5, 6</a>) Note the reference to our “ways” and “paths.” Yes, our whole way of life<wbr />—not just our Christian hope—<wbr />should reflect our trust in God. How can we show that trust when temptations arise?</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 6. How can we strengthen our resolve to reject bad thoughts?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Turning away from bad begins in the mind. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:5-45:8:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong><em>Romans 8:5;</em></strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:2:3-49:2:3" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> <strong><em>Ephesians 2:3</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>How, then, can you strengthen your resolve to reject bad thoughts? Consider these five ways: 1. Seek God’s help through prayer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:13-40:6:13" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 13</a>) 2. Meditate on Bible examples of those who failed to listen to Jehovah and those who listened.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:15:1-19:15:2" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 15:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Prov. 27:11</a>) You too can show you trust in Jehovah.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 7. What tests did Jeremiah face, and how did he at times feel?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Many of our brothers serve in territories where endurance is a special challenge. The prophet Jeremiah served in such an environment<wbr />—the kingdom of Judah during its tumultuous last days. Daily he was buffeted by tests of faith because he obediently announced God’s judgment messages. At one point, even his loyal secretary, Baruch, complained of weariness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:45:2-24:45:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jer. 45:2, 3</a>) Did Jeremiah give in to discouragement? Well, on occasion, he did feel depressed. “Cursed be the day on which I was born!” he exclaimed. “Why is it that I have come forth from the very womb in order to see hard work and grief and that my days should come to their end in mere shame?”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:20:14-24:20:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jer. 20:14, 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:20:18-24:20:18" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 18</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">8, 9. In line with <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:17:7-24:17:8" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Jeremiah 17:7, 8 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> Psalm 1:1-3</a>, what must we do to continue bearing good fruit?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Yet, Jeremiah did not give up. He continued to trust in Jehovah. As a result, this faithful prophet experienced the fulfillment of Jehovah’s own words recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:17:7-24:17:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jeremiah 17:7, 8</a>: “Blessed is the able-bodied man who puts his trust in Jehovah, and whose confidence Jehovah has become. And he will certainly become like a tree planted by the waters, that sends out its roots right by the watercourse; and he will not see when heat comes, but his foliage will actually prove to be luxuriant. And in the year of drought he will not become anxious, nor will he leave off from producing fruit.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Like a luxuriant fruit tree “planted by the waters” or in an irrigated orchard, Jeremiah never ‘left off from producing fruit.’ He refused to be influenced by the wicked ridiculers around him. Rather, he stuck to the Source of life-sustaining “water” and took to heart everything Jehovah told him. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong><em>Psalm 1:1-3;</em></strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:20:9-24:20:9" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Jer. 20:9</a>) What a fine example Jeremiah is for us, especially those of us who serve God in difficult territories! If that is your situation, continue to rely heavily on Jehovah, who will grant you endurance as you “make public declaration to his name.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:15-58:13:15" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Heb. 13:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>To help us cope with life during these last days, Jehovah has given us a truly verdant spiritual estate. Among other things, he has provided the complete Word of God, which is being accurately translated into more and more languages. He has made available an abundance of timely spiritual food through the faithful and discreet slave class. And he has given us the supportive companionship of a vast throng of fellow believers at meetings and assemblies. Do you take full advantage of these provisions? All who do “will cry out joyfully because of the good condition of the heart.” However, those who fail to listen to God “will make outcries because of the pain of heart and . . . will howl because of the sheer breakdown of spirit.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:65:13-23:65:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 65:13, 14</a>.</p>

Similarly, as the world’s problems mount, millions seek refuge in seemingly lofty financial, political, or religious institutions, as well as in science and technology. But none of these give real security. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:17:5-24:17:6" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Jer. 17:5, 6</a>) Jehovah’s servants, on the other hand, do have a sure refuge<wbr />—“the Rock of times indefinite.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:26:4-23:26:4" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Isa. 26:4</a>) The psalmist stated: “[Jehovah] is my rock and my salvation, my secure height.” <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:62:6-19:62:9" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong><em>Psalm 62:6-9</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>How do we make this Rock our refuge?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>We cling to Jehovah when we heed his Word, which often runs contrary to human wisdom.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Does your attitude toward “the world” and “the things in the world” reflect your complete trust in God?

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Consider the example of Richard and Ruth, parents of three young children. “My heart was telling me that I could do more for Jehovah,” says Richard. “I had a comfortable life but felt that I was just giving God my surplus, as it were. After praying about the matter and counting the cost, Ruth and I agreed that I would ask my supervisor for a reduced work schedule of four days a week<wbr />—even though the country was in the middle of an economic crisis. My request was approved, and I started working the new schedule within one month.” How does Richard feel now?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>“I get 20 percent less pay than before,” he says, “but now I have an extra 50 days a year to be with my family and train the children. I have been able to double my time in field service, triple my number of Bible studies, and take a greater lead in the congregation. And because I am more available to <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>help with the children, Ruth has been able to auxiliary pioneer from time to time. I am determined to maintain this schedule for as long as possible.”</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>Roy and Petina, who still have a daughter at home, were able to cut back their secular work so as to share in the ministry full-time. “I work three days a week,” says Roy, “and Petina works two. Also, we moved from a house to an apartment, which is much easier to care for. We pioneered before we had our son and daughter, and we never lost the desire to pioneer. So when our children had grown up, we got back into the full-time ministry. No amount of money can compare with the blessings we have received.”</p>

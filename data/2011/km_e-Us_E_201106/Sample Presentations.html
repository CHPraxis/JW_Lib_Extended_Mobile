Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.’ What do you think that Kingdom is? [Allow for response.] This Bible verse gives us a clue.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Mention a tragedy that is in the news. Then say: “Why do you think God allows such things to occur?

[Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:3:7-2:3:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 3:7</a>.] The Bible also tells us why God allows suffering and that he will soon end it forever. This magazine explains.”</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“In this modern world, many individuals assume that evolution is established fact. What are your thoughts?

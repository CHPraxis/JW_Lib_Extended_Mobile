Otherwise, offer any older field publications on hand in the congregation. <strong>July: </strong><em>Was Life Created? </em><strong>August</strong>: Any 32-page brochures that are in stock except <em>How Can Blood Save Your Life?</em>, <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses and Education</em>, <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses<wbr />—Who Are They? What Do They Believe?</em>, and <em>The Origin of Life<wbr />—Five Questions Worth Asking</em>. <strong>September: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call.

“How Much Time Should I Count?”
Have you ever asked that question? General guidelines are found on pages 86-87 of the Organized book. Additional direction is occasionally provided, such as in the Question Box of the September 2008 Our Kingdom Ministry. Since circumstances vary, we have not been given a long list of rules. Therefore, it would not be appropriate for elders or others to set forth additional guidelines.
If a question arises and there is no published direction on it, each publisher can consider: Was the time spent in the ministry? Or was it spent doing something else that is not actually part of that work? What we write on our personal field service report each month should give us joy and not pangs of conscience. (Acts 23:1) Of course, our primary concern is, not how to count time, but how to make our time count by being industrious in the ministry.—Heb. 6:11.

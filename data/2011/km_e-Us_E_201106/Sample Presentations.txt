Sample Presentations
To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in July
“Many have repeated these words from the Lord’s Prayer: ‘Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.’ What do you think that Kingdom is? [Allow for response.] This Bible verse gives us a clue.” Read Daniel 2:44. Then hand the householder a copy of the July 1 issue of The Watchtower and read and discuss together the material under the first subheading on page 16. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return and consider the answer to the next question.
The Watchtower July 1
“Because life is short and filled with problems, many wonder about the meaning of life. Have you ever thought about that? [Allow for response.] The Bible promises that life will not always be like this. [Read Revelation 21:4.] This magazine discusses God’s purpose for the earth and lists some things we can do to find real meaning in life even now.”
Awake! July
Mention a tragedy that is in the news. Then say: “Why do you think God allows such things to occur? [Allow for response.] According to the Bible, God feels compassion for those who suffer. [Read Exodus 3:7.] The Bible also tells us why God allows suffering and that he will soon end it forever. This magazine explains.”
Was Life Created?
“In this modern world, many individuals assume that evolution is established fact. What are your thoughts? [Allow for response.] Many others, after examining the facts, have found that faith in creation is based on solid evidence. [Read Hebrews 11:1, refer to page 2, and offer brochure.] I would like to return and discuss the question posed on page 29: ‘Does it matter what you believe?’”

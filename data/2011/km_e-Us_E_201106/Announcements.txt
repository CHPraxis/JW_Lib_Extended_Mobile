▪ June: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call. If householders already have the book, congregations that have a stock of Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life and Worship the Only True God may offer either of these books. Otherwise, offer any older field publications on hand in the congregation. July: Was Life Created? August: Any 32-page brochures that are in stock except How Can Blood Save Your Life?, Jehovah’s Witnesses and Education, Jehovah’s Witnesses—Who Are They? What Do They Believe?, and The Origin of Life—Five Questions Worth Asking. September: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call. If householders already have the book and do not accept the offer of a Bible study, offer an older magazine or any brochure that addresses the person’s interest.
▪ Since July has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.

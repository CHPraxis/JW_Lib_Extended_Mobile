<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>“Disabled Now but Not Forever!”</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">As told by Sara van der Monde</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sa">People often tell me, “Sara, you have such a lovely smile. Why are you always so happy?” I tell them that I have a special hope. I say, “I am disabled now but not forever!”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">I WAS born in 1974 in Paris, France. There were problems during my birth, and later the doctors told my parents that I had cerebral palsy. I had limited movement, and when I spoke, it was hard for people to understand me. In time, I also became an epileptic, and it was easy for me to get infections.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When I was two years old, my family moved to Melbourne, Australia. Two years later, my father left my mother and me. That was the first time that I remember feeling that God was my Friend. Mum was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and regularly took me to Christian meetings. There I learned that God loved me and cared for me. God’s comfort along with Mum’s love helped me to feel safe, even though our situation had changed.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Mum also taught me how to pray to Jehovah. Actually, it is much easier for me to pray than to talk. When I pray, I do not have to struggle to say the words, but the words are clear in my mind. And because it is difficult for people to understand me when I talk, it comforts me to know that Jehovah understands everything I say, whether I say it in my mind or struggle to say it out loud.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:65:2-19:65:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 65:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>HOW I ENDURED MORE PROBLEMS</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">At the age of five, I could no longer walk without the help of heavy splints. And even with them, it was very difficult to walk straight. By the age of 11, I could no longer walk. Later, I could not get in and out of bed without the help of a machine to lift me into my motorized wheelchair. I control my wheelchair with a hand lever.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Sometimes my disabilities discourage me. But then I remember that in my family, we always say that we should not worry about the things we <strong>cannot </strong>do, but we should continue to do the things we <strong>can </strong>do. This has helped me to do well at horseback riding, sailing, <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>canoeing, camping, and even driving a car around a track! I show my love of art by painting, sewing, quilting, embroidering, and making ceramics.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Because of my serious disabilities, some people have doubted my ability to make my own decision to worship God. When I was 18, a schoolteacher told me to leave home so that I would not have to follow my mother’s religion. The teacher even offered to help me find a place to live. But I told her that I would never leave my religion and that I would leave home only when I was ready to be more independent.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Soon after that, I was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Two years later, I moved into a small apartment. Here I am happy because I have both help and independence.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>AN OFFER I DID NOT EXPECT</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">In my life, many things have happened that have tested my faith. One day I was completely surprised when a disabled schoolmate asked me to marry him. At first, this made me feel good about myself. Just like most young women, I would like to get married. But no one can say that two people will have a happy marriage just because they both have a disability. More important, the young man did not worship Jehovah. Our beliefs, activities, and goals were completely different. How could we have a happy life together? I want to obey God’s command to marry only someone who serves Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:7:39-46:7:39" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>) So I kindly told the young man that I could not accept his offer of marriage.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Even today, I know I made the right choice. And I have no doubt that I will be happy in the new world that God promises. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:145:16-19:145:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 145:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:13</a>) Until then, I will do everything I can to continue to be loyal to Jehovah and to be content with my situation.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">I often think about the day when I can leap from my wheelchair and run as fast as I can. On that day, I will be able to say, “I was disabled, but now I have perfect health that will last forever!”</p>

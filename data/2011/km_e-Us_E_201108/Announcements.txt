▪ Literature offer for August: Any 32-page brochures that are in stock except How Can Blood Save Your Life?, Jehovah’s Witnesses and Education, Jehovah’s Witnesses—Who Are They? What Do They Believe?, and The Origin of Life—Five Questions Worth Asking. September: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call.

October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, present the tract Would You Like to Know the Truth? and endeavor to start a Bible study. November: The Bible—What Is Its Message?

We are pleased to report a new peak of 725,539 Bible studies in the United States for March 2011. This is an increase of 8,157 over the previous peak in October 2010. Also, Bermuda and the Turks and Caicos Islands had fine increases in return visits and Bible studies during March. How happy we are to see so many streaming to Jehovah’s pure worship!—Isa. 2:2-4.

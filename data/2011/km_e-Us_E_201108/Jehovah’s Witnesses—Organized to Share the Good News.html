<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">For over 100 years, Jehovah’s Witnesses have been organized to share the good news. In what has become the greatest preaching campaign the world has ever known, we speak this message in hundreds of languages and in more than 230 lands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14</a>) Why is this work necessary? How is it being accomplished on a global scale? The video <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses<wbr />—Organized to Share the Good News </em>answers those questions by providing a close-up look at the many facets of our international activities. After watching the video, give consideration to the following questions.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">How has this video enhanced your appreciation for <strong>(1) </strong>the effort Jehovah’s organization is making to share the good news? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:4:2-55:4:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:2</a>) <strong>(2) </strong>the Bethel families around the world? <strong>(3) </strong>the educational training provided for missionaries and overseers? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:2:2-55:2:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:2</a>) <strong>(4) </strong>the importance of starting each day considering a Bible text and preparing each week for congregation meetings? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:17:11-44:17:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 17:11</a>) <strong>(5) </strong>the benefits of attending our Christian gatherings? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) <strong>(6) </strong>the blessings you will receive when Paradise is restored on earth? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:11:9-23:11:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 11:9</a>) <strong>(7) </strong>the privilege you have to share in the ongoing harvest work?<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:4:35-43:4:35" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 4:35</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This video has proved to be an excellent tool for acquainting interested people with the worldwide work being done by Jehovah’s Witnesses. <strong>(8) </strong>When would it be good to show the video to our Bible students, relatives, and others? <strong>(9) </strong>What positive reaction have you seen when showing it?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">As we reflect on what Jehovah is accomplishing, we are moved to echo these sentiments of the psalmist: “Many things you yourself have done, O Jehovah my God, even your wonderful works and your thoughts toward us; there is none to be compared to you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:40:5-19:40:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 40:5</a>) May we make good use of this video to help others develop appreciation for Jehovah and his organization!</p>

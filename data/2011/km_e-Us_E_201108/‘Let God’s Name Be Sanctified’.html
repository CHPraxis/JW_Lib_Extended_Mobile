<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="qu"> 1. What is the theme of the circuit assembly program for the 2012 service year, and what is its basis?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[6]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>How privileged we are to bear the name of the Universal Sovereign, Jehovah! It was God himself who gave us his name to bear, and especially since the year 1931, as Jehovah’s Witnesses, we have been identified with Jehovah’s distinctive name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:43:10-23:43:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 43:10</a>) God’s only-begotten Son, Jesus, held God’s name in the highest esteem, giving it first place in his model prayer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9</a>) Jesus’ words provide the basis for the theme of our circuit assembly program for the 2012 service year. It is “Let God’s Name Be Sanctified.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 2. What information do we have to look forward to?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>What We Will Hear: </strong>On Saturday the talk “Make God’s Name Known as Full-Time Servants” will discuss why the full-time service is a rewarding way of life. We will also hear the symposium “Beware of Bringing Reproach on Jehovah’s Name,” which will help us to avoid becoming entrapped by four potential snares. The questions, What will help us to preach with zeal when people seem to show little interest? and, What will help us to carry out a meaningful ministry? will be answered in the talk “Why God’s Name Must Be Sanctified.” On Sunday we will enjoy a four-part symposium on how we can sanctify God’s name by our thoughts, speech, decisions, and conduct. New ones will especially appreciate the public address, “Jehovah Will Sanctify His Great Name at Armageddon.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 3. What privilege do we have, and how will the program help us?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Very soon Jehovah will act to sanctify his name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:36:23-26:36:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezek. 36:23</a>) In the meantime, we have the awesome privilege of upholding all that Jehovah’s holy name represents. We are confident that this circuit assembly program will help each of us to fulfill our serious responsibility as bearers of God’s name.</p>

“Offer an Older Magazine or Any Brochure That Addresses the Person’s Interest”




During the months that we offer the Bible Teach book and a study on the initial call, we are encouraged to “offer an older magazine or any brochure that addresses the person’s interest” whenever the householder already has the book and does not accept the offer of a study. Why?
Brochures and older magazines consider a variety of timely subjects. Something in one of those publications may touch the heart of the householder. Therefore, when packing your witnessing case, include several different brochures and older issues. If you do not have older magazines, perhaps you can obtain some from the magazine counter. Then, if the householder already has the Bible Teach book and does not agree to a Bible study, you can show him some of the magazines or brochures that you have and invite him to take what interests him. Thereafter, make arrangements to return to cultivate his interest. Perhaps a Bible study will eventually result.

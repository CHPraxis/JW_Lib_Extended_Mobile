Sample Presentations
To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in December
“I’m sure you will agree that everyone needs friends. What quality do you value most in a friend? [Allow for response.] Notice what this says about why we should select our friends carefully.” Hand the householder a copy of the December 1 issue of The Watchtower, and read and discuss together the material under the first subheading on page 16. Read at least one of the scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return and consider the answer to the next question.
The Watchtower December 1
“Have you ever wondered why there have been so many natural disasters lately? [Allow for response.] Interestingly, the Bible foretold a time that would be marked by disasters. [Read Matthew 24:7, 8.] This magazine answers these questions: Why are we seeing so many natural disasters today? Are they punishment from God? What reasons are there to believe that God will soon end all natural disasters.”
Awake! December
Read 2 Timothy 3:16. Then say: “Some agree that the Bible was inspired by God, while others do not. What do you think? [Allow for response.] Although opinions vary on that question, it is generally agreed that no other book has been the object of so many efforts to destroy it. This magazine describes some of the efforts to destroy the Bible and suppress the reading of it down through the centuries. It also explains why it has survived.”

“Take Refuge in the Name of Jehovah.”​—ZEPHANIAH 3:12.
“All creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together until now.” (Rom. 8:22) Those inspired words are beyond dispute. Millions of people have fallen victim to injustice, oppression, natural disaster, sickness, poverty, war, and crime. We who serve Jehovah are not immune to any of these things. In addition, we experience disdain, hatred, and persecution, just as Jesus did.
Despite the problems of Satan’s world, we do not despair. Instead, we rejoice in knowing that soon Jehovah will bring an end to all suffering on earth. Our hope, our trust, is in our God. Yes, we take refuge in Jehovah, who never disappoints his loyal ones.

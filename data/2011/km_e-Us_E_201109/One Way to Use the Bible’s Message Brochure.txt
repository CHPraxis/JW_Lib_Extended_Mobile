One Way to Use the Bible’s Message Brochure




Many in our territory, especially those who belong to non-Christian religions, are not acquainted with the Bible. When studying with such ones out of the Bible Teach book, some publishers have also used the Bible’s Message brochure to help their student gain an overview of the Bible. For example, one brother introduces section 1 of the brochure when considering chapter 3 of the Bible Teach book. Thereafter, he considers another section at the end of each study. Are you studying with someone who has had little or no exposure to the Bible? To help him learn ‘the holy writings, which are able to make him wise for salvation,’ consider supplementing the material in the Bible Teach book with the Bible’s Message brochure.—2 Tim. 3:15.

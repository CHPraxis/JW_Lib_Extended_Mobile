<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Many in our territory, especially those who belong to non-Christian religions, are not acquainted with the Bible. When studying with such ones out of the <em>Bible Teach </em>book, some publishers have also used the <em>Bible’s Message </em>brochure to help their student gain an overview of the Bible. For example, one brother introduces <a class="xt" data-xtid="24" href="jwpub://p/E:1102009451/1-11">section 1</a> of the brochure when considering <a class="xt" data-xtid="23" href="jwpub://p/E:1102005133/1-37">chapter 3</a> of the <em>Bible Teach </em>book. Thereafter, he considers another section at the end of each study. Are you studying with someone who has had little or no exposure to the Bible? To help him learn ‘the holy writings, which are able to make him wise for salvation,’ consider supplementing the material in the <em>Bible Teach </em>book with the <em>Bible’s Message </em>brochure.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:15-55:3:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:15</a>.</p>

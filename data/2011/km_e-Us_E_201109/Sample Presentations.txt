To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in October

“In these difficult times, we all face challenges that place stress on families. Where do you think we can find reliable guidance to help us make our family life happy?” Allow for response. Then hand the householder a copy of the October 1 Watchtower, and consider together material under one of the subheadings on pages 16 and 17 and at least one of the cited scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return to discuss one of the other questions.



The Watchtower October 1

Show the cover of the magazine, and ask, “How would you feel if you learned that you had been lied to about God? [Allow for response.] Notice what Jesus said about the way to distinguish the truth from lies. [Read John 17:17.] So the Bible alone tells us the truth about God. This magazine discusses five common lies about God that the Bible exposes.”



Awake! October

“We’re calling today as a public service to families. What would you say is the biggest challenge parents face today when raising children? [Allow for response.] Many parents rely on the Bible for advice. For example, these wise words are helpful when disciplining children. [Read Ephesians 4:31.] This magazine shows how the Bible’s advice can help parents at each stage of their child’s growth, from infancy through adolescence.”

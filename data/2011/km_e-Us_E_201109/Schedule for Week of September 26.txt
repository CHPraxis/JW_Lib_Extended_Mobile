10 min: Question Box. Discussion. Include comments on the March 2005 Our Kingdom Ministry, page 4.
15 min: Prepare to Offer the Magazines in October. Discussion. Use one to two minutes to point out some of the articles that may have appeal in your territory. Then, one article at a time, consider how two or three of them could be presented. Do this by inviting the audience to give suggestions on an interest-arousing question to ask and then asking for suggestions on a scripture to read. Since the October Awake! is a special issue, invite comments on whom this issue may appeal to and how we can give it wide distribution. Demonstrate how each issue may be offered.

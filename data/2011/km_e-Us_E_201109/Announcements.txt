▪ Literature offer for September: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call. If householders already have the book and do not accept the offer of a Bible study, offer an older magazine or any brochure that addresses the person’s interest. October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, present the tract Would You Like to Know the Truth? and endeavor to start a Bible study. November: The Bible—What Is Its Message? December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. If there are children in the household, offer Learn From the Great Teacher or My Book of Bible Stories.
▪ Since October has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.
▪ The special public talk for the 2012 Memorial season will be given during the week of April 2. The subject of the talk will be announced later. No congregation should have the special talk before the Memorial.
▪ Publishers auxiliary pioneering during March 2012 will have the option of working toward a 30-hour or a 50-hour requirement for the month. Additionally, if the circuit overseer is visiting the congregation in March, all who are serving as auxiliary pioneers, whether with a 30-hour or a 50-hour requirement, are invited to attend the entire meeting the circuit overseer has with the regular pioneers.
▪ In September, circuit overseers began giving the public talk entitled “Unite With God’s Happy People.”

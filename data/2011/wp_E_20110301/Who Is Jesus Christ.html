<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Unlike any other human, Jesus lived in heaven as a spirit person before he was born on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:23-43:8:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:23</a>) He was God’s first creation, and he helped in the creation of all other things. He is the only one created directly by Jehovah and is thus called God’s “only-begotten” Son. Jesus served as God’s Spokesman, so he is also called “the Word.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:1-43:1:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 1:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:14-43:1:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14</a>; <em>read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:8:22-20:8:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><em>Proverbs 8:22, 23,</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:8:30-20:8:30" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> <em>30;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:15-51:1:16" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> <em>Colossians 1:15, 16</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">God sent his Son to earth by transferring his life from heaven to the womb of a virgin Jewess named Mary. So Jesus did not have a human father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:30-42:1:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 1:30-35</a>) Jesus came to earth (1) to teach the truth about God, (2) to set an example in doing God’s will, and (3) to give his perfect life as “a ransom.”<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><em>Matthew 20:28;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> <em>John 18:37</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<h2 id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>3. Why do we need a ransom?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">A ransom is a price paid to release a person from bondage. Death and old age were not part of God’s original purpose for mankind. How do we know that? God told the first man, Adam, that if he committed what the Bible calls sin, he would die. If Adam had not sinned, he would never have died. Even though Adam’s life did not end until centuries later, he began to die from the day he disobeyed God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 2:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:5:5-1:5:5" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 5:5</a>) Adam passed on to all his descendants sin and its penalty, death. Thus, death “entered” the world of mankind through Adam. That is why we need a ransom.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><em>Romans 5:12;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> <em>6:23</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Who could pay the ransom to free us from death? When we die, we pay the penalty only for our own sins. No imperfect man can pay for the sins of others.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:49:7-19:49:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><em>Psalm 49:7-9</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Since Jesus did not inherit imperfection from a human father, he died, not because of his own sins, but for the sins of others. God sent his Son to die for us as an expression of His extraordinary love for mankind. Jesus also showed love for us by obeying his Father and giving his life for our sins.<wbr />—<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><em>John 3:16;</em></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:18-45:5:19" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> <em>Romans 5:18, 19</em></a><em>.</em></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:18-60:3:18" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:18</a>) Jesus then waited at God’s right hand until Jehovah gave him power to rule as King over all the earth.

To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in August

“People belong to various religions and worship God in many different ways. How do you think God feels about that? [Allow for response.] Notice what Jesus taught on this subject.” Hand the householder a copy of the August 1 Watchtower and consider together the material under the first subheading on page 16 and at least one of the cited scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return to discuss the next question.



The Watchtower August 1

“Should children be taught about God when they are young, or is it better to wait until they are older and allow them to choose their own religious beliefs? [Allow for response.] Notice what the Bible instructs fathers to do. [Read Ephesians 6:4.] This magazine gives some tips on how parents can teach their children about God.”



Awake! August

“I’d like to get your opinion on this verse. [Read 1 Samuel 16:23.] According to this, music has power. Do you think it is possible for some songs to have an unwholesome influence? [Allow for response.] This magazine discusses how we can make wise choices in our music and how we can help our children to do so too.”

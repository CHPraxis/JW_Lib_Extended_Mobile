Field Service Highlights




In the month of February 2011, the Turks and Caicos Islands reported two new all-time peaks: 295 publishers and 736 Bible studies. In the United States, when compared with the same six-month period last year, there were increases of 7 percent in regular pioneers and 8 percent in auxiliary pioneers. Bermuda too had an increase of 25 percent in auxiliary pioneers during the same time period. Truly, Jehovah’s servants are imitating his zeal for fine work!—John 5:17.

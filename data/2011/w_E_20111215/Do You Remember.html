<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you carefully read the recent issues of <em>The Watchtower? </em>Well, see if you can answer the following questions:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>• Who was Olivétan, and why should his work interest us?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">Frenchman Pierre Robert was known by that name. During the Reformation in the 16th century, he translated the Bible into French. He preferred “overseer” to “bishop” and “congregation” to “church.” In places, he rendered God’s name “Jehovah.”<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:2011648/1-25">9/1, pages 18-20</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>• What did God mean in telling the Levites: “I am your share”?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">Each of Israel’s other tribes got an allotment of land, but the Levites had Jehovah as their “share.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:18:20-4:18:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Num. 18:20</a>) They would not inherit land, but they received a special privilege of service. Still, Jehovah cared for their basic material needs. Today, those who have the privilege of advancing Kingdom interests can be confident that the necessities of life will be provided.<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:2011682/1-12:430">9/15, pages 7-8,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:2011683/10:433-15:535"> 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>• How do we know when ancient Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">Classical historians give mixed, conflicting details about the Babylonian kings and their reigns. Yet, scholars agree that Cyrus II conquered Babylon in 539 B.C.E., a pivotal date. The Jews were released, and they arrived in their homeland by 537 B.C.E. The Bible says that their exile was 70 years long. So Jerusalem must have fallen in 607 B.C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:36:21-14:36:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chron. 36:21, 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:29:10-24:29:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Jer. 29:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:9:1-27:9:2" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Dan. 9:1, 2</a>)<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="4" href="jwpub://p/E:2011736/1-39">10/1, pages 26-31</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>• What can help a Christian decide whether some type of recreation is beneficial or not?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">In determining if a type of recreation will be beneficial and be pleasing in God’s eyes, it is useful to ask: <em>What </em>does it include? <em>When </em>will I pursue it? <em>Who </em>will my companions be?<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://p/E:2011763/7:604-25">10/15, pages 9-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>• Why would it be wrong to have an abortion?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">God considers life sacred and views a human embryo as a distinct, living being. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:139:16-19:139:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 139:16</a>) Killing an unborn child is murder, as shown by the fact that under the Law a person would be called to account for injuring an unborn child. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:21:22-2:21:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ex. 21:22, 23</a>)<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="6" href="jwpub://p/E:2011802/16:116-25">11/1, page 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>• How can the account at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:7:6-20:7:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 7:6-23</strong></a> <strong>help us avoid viewing pornography?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">That passage tells of a young man who walked in an area where an immoral woman was known to live. She seduced him. Today, we do well to avoid Internet sites that contain provocative images, and it is important to seek God’s help in prayer <em>before </em>even encountering such images on the Internet.<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="7" href="jwpub://p/E:2011841/18:520-24">11/15, pages 9-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>• How do we know whether the earth will survive 2012?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">Because of cycles in an ancient Maya calendar, some feel that the world will end in the year 2012. But that is not possible, for Jehovah created the earth to be inhabited. The Bible says that the earth will endure permanently. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:1:4-21:1:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eccl. 1:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:45:18-23:45:18" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Isa. 45:18</a>)<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="8" href="jwpub://p/E:2011885/1-9">12/1, page 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>• Which Bible writers were present at Pentecost 33 C.E.?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn">It seems that six of the writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures were present. Three apostles were there<wbr />—Matthew, John, and Peter. Two of Jesus’ half brothers were too<wbr />—James and Jude. And it is likely that the young man Mark was present.<wbr />—<a class="xt" data-xtid="9" href="jwpub://p/E:2011890/1-9">12/1, page 22</a>.</p>

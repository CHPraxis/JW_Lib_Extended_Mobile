<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>The Fabulous Variety of Life in the Upper Amazon </strong>(April 2010)  Your article claims that the Awajun people (Aguaruna) worship five gods. As a member of the indigenous Awajun population, I disagree. I think you have made a mistake, because most Awajun people profess to be Christians and we do not worship five gods, as your magazine reports. Since the Awajun population frequently reads your magazine, please correct this mistake.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="si"><strong><em>“Awake!” responds: </em></strong>The writer gathered information from various sources, including personal interviews with former inhabitants of Aguaruna communities and a number of published sources. One of these, <em>Atlas Regional del Perú, </em>2004 Edition, gives the names and descriptions of five Aguaruna deities. However, as you note, inhabitants of some Aguaruna communities have converted to nominal Christianity. We apologize for any misimpression we may have given.</p>

How Can I Boost My Self-Respect? </strong>(May 2010)  I am 12 years old and live with my mother, who is seriously ill and raising me alone. When I read the question “Do you feel loved?” I honestly replied “No.” That upset me. So I spoke about it with some mature Christians and with my mother. This article helped me to understand that there is no reason to judge myself so harshly. Many people love me. Thank you for helping me to see how much Jehovah cares for us young people.</p>

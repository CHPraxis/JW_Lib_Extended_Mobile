The Wisdom of King Solomon
● A teacher asked a fourth-grade class of students what they knew about King Solomon who is mentioned in the Bible. Nine-year-old Sheena said that he was a very wise king and described how he solved the argument of two women who each claimed to be the mother of the same child. Her classmates were at first shocked when hearing Solomon’s way of handling the matter, but the teacher said that it was a good one.
Sheena explained that she had learned about this by reading My Book of Bible Stories, a book that includes the story about the wisdom of Solomon. “Six of my classmates became interested in having this Bible Stories book,” Sheena explained, and she added: “My teacher also asked for one. So all in all, I was able to place seven copies.”

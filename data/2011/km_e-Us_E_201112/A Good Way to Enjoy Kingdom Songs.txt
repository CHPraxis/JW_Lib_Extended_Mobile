A Good Way to Enjoy Kingdom Songs
God’s servants consider music to be a beautiful gift from Jehovah. (Jas. 1:17) Many congregations enjoy playing Kingdom songs softly before and after their congregation meetings. Playing theocratic music is a soothing way to welcome us to meetings. It helps us to get mentally prepared for worship. Additionally, playing newer tunes from our songbook acquaints us with the melodies and helps us to sing the songs properly. Such music played after the meeting maintains an uplifting atmosphere in which to enjoy encouraging association. Therefore, bodies of elders should make appropriate arrangements to play music from Sing to Jehovah—Piano Accompaniment before and after the meeting. They should make sure that the volume level is reasonable and does not drown out conversation.

To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in January
“Some people believe that the Bible is a reliable book of prophecy. Others feel that it contains vague predictions that could be interpreted in many different ways. What’s your opinion?” Allow for response. Then hand the householder the January 1 Watchtower, and consider together the material under the first subheading on page 16 and at least one of the scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return to discuss the next question.
The Watchtower January 1
“We can learn many lessons from the great men and women of history. Would you agree? [Allow for response.] This verse refers to one great man, the only one called ‘God’s friend’ in the Bible. [Read James 2:23.] This magazine explains why God considered him his friend and discusses what we can learn from Abraham’s example.”
Awake! January
“Bribes, kickbacks, and other forms of dishonesty have become quite common in the business world. Some feel that a certain amount of dishonesty in business is necessary in order to be successful. What do you think? [Allow for response.] Notice this thought-provoking proverb. [Read Proverbs 20:17.] This magazine explains why it is practical to be honest.”

Field Service Highlights
During the month of July 2011, there were 5,718 individuals in the United States branch territory who symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by water baptism. (Acts 2:41) Also, when compared to the same month last year, the number of Bible studies increased by 5.6 percent and the number of regular pioneers increased by 7.9 percent. We rejoice to see so many taking up the full-time service!

Next, using the cover series of The Watchtower, invite the audience to give suggestions on an interest-arousing question to ask, and then invite suggestions on a scripture to read. Do the same for the cover series of Awake! and, if time allows, for one other article from either magazine. Encourage publishers to make a special effort to offer the Awake! in business territories. Invite the service overseer to comment on local arrangements for doing this. Demonstrate how each issue may be offered. In the demonstration for the Awake! magazine, show how it may be featured when working business territory.

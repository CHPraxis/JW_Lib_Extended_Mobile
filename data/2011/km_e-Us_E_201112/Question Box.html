<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ <strong>What determines whether we will leave literature with someone?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The primary factor is the person’s interest. If he demonstrates genuine interest, we may leave him two magazines, a brochure, a book, or other literature that we are offering. This is true even if we discern that he has little or no money to donate toward the worldwide work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:34:19-18:34:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 34:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Rev. 22:17</a>) On the other hand, we would not leave our precious literature with those who do not appreciate it.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:7:6-40:7:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 7:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How might a householder demonstrate interest? A willingness to converse with us is a good sign. Paying attention while we speak, responding to questions, and expressing an opinion indicate involvement in the discussion. Following along as we read from the Bible implies a respect for God’s Word. Often, it is helpful to ask if he would read the literature being offered. Publishers should use good judgment to determine the individual’s interest. When doing street witnessing, for example, it would not be appropriate to hand out magazines, brochures, or books indiscriminately to everyone who walks past us. If we are unable to determine a person’s interest, it would be better to give him a handbill or tract.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Similarly, the amount of literature a publisher obtains from the literature counter should be based on what the publisher needs in order to carry out his ministry, not on his ability to donate. Donations are not to pay for literature but to support <em>all </em>aspects of our worldwide preaching activity. Regardless of our financial means, appreciation will move us to give generously out of our want, not out of our surplus, to support Kingdom interests. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:12:41-41:12:44" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 12:41-44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 9:7</a>) It will also prompt us to take only the literature that we need, thus not wasting theocratic resources.</p>

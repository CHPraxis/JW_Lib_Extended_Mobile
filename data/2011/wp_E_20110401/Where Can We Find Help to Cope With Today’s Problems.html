<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Where Can We Find Help to Cope With Today’s Problems?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There is no shortage of advice in today’s world. Books and TV programs dealing with self-help appeal to the masses. Yet, basic problems persist. You may wonder, ‘Is there a source of guidance that I can really trust?’ The answer is <em>yes!</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible, although thousands of years old, contains timeless principles that can answer such questions as these:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">▪ How can I resolve conflicts and enjoy better relationships with others?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">▪ How can I find happiness?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">▪ How can I deal with economic problems?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">▪ How can I relieve anxiety?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The answers to these questions will be discussed in the public discourse <strong>“Bible Principles<wbr />—Can They Help Us to Cope With Today’s Problems?” </strong>This Bible-based talk will be given worldwide in over 230 lands. In most places, it will be delivered at the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses on <strong>Sunday, May 1, 2011.</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The Witnesses in your area will be glad to provide you with the time and address. You are warmly invited to attend.</p>

What Is God’s Purpose for the Earth?
This article raises questions you may have asked and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible. Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you.
 1. What is God’s purpose for the earth?
The earth is man’s home. After creating angels to live in heaven, God made man to enjoy the earth. (Job 38:4, 7) Thus, Jehovah settled the first man in a delightful paradise called Eden and gave him and his future offspring the prospect of enjoying endless life on earth.—Genesis 2:15-17; read Psalm 115:16.
The garden of Eden covered only a small part of the earth. The first human couple, Adam and Eve, were to have children. As the human family increased in number, they were to cultivate the earth and make it a paradise. (Genesis 1:28) The earth will never be destroyed.—Read Psalm 104:5.
 2. Why is the earth not a paradise now?
Adam and Eve disobeyed God, so they were driven out of Eden. Paradise was lost, and no man has succeeded in restoring it. The Bible says: “Earth itself has been given into the hand of the wicked one.”—Job 9:24; read Genesis 3:23, 24.
But Jehovah has not forgotten his original purpose for mankind, nor can God ever fail. (Isaiah 45:18) He will restore the human race to the way he meant it to be.—Read Psalm 37:11.
 3. How will God restore peace to the earth?
For mankind to enjoy peace, God must first eliminate wicked people. At the battle of Armageddon, God’s angels will destroy all who oppose God. Satan will be imprisoned for 1,000 years, but people who love God will survive to enjoy a new system of things on earth.—Read Revelation 16:14, 16; 20:1-3; 21:3, 4.
 4. When will suffering end?
During the 1,000 years, Jesus will rule from heaven over the earth and restore it to a paradise. Also, he will cancel the sins of those who love God. Jesus will thus eliminate sickness, aging, and death.—Read Isaiah 11:9; 25:8; 33:24; 35:1.
When will God destroy evil on earth? Jesus gave a “sign” to indicate when the end is near. Present world conditions threaten man’s survival and show that we now live in “the conclusion of the system of things.”—Read Matthew 24:3, 7-14, 21, 22; 2 Timothy 3:1-5.
 5. Who will live in the future Paradise?
Jesus directed his followers to make disciples and to teach them God’s ways of love. (Matthew 28:19, 20) Worldwide, Jehovah is preparing millions of people for life in a new system of things on earth. (Zephaniah 2:3) At Kingdom Halls of Jehovah’s Witnesses, people learn how to be better husbands and fathers and how to be better wives and mothers. Children and parents learn together about the basis for believing in a better future.—Read Micah 4:1-4.
At the Kingdom Hall, you will meet people who love God and who want to learn to please him.—Read Hebrews 10:24, 25.

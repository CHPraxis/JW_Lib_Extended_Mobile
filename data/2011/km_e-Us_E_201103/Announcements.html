<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>March: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call. If householders already have the book and do not accept a Bible study, offer an older magazine or any brochure that addresses the person’s interest. <strong>April and May: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Where interest is shown, present the tract <em>Would You Like to Know the Truth? </em>and endeavor to start a Bible study. When making return visits on those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associating with the congregation, concentrate on starting studies using the <em>Bible Teach </em>book. <strong>June: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call. If householders already have the book, congregations that have a stock of <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life </em>and <em>Worship the Only True God </em>may offer either of these books. Otherwise, offer any older field publications on hand in the congregation.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ When witnessing to someone who speaks Chinese, show him the pages in the <em>Nations </em>booklet where Chinese (Traditional) (CH) and Chinese (Simplified) (CHS) appear, in order to determine what he prefers to <em>read. </em>As a general rule, people from Hong Kong or Taiwan prefer to read literature in Chinese (Traditional) (CH), whereas those from China usually prefer Chinese (Simplified) (CHS). With regard to <em>video or audio </em>publications, though, give consideration to which dialect the householder speaks and understands best. Generally, people from both China and Taiwan understand Chinese (Mandarin) (CHM), whereas those from Hong Kong understand Chinese (Cantonese) (CHC).</p>

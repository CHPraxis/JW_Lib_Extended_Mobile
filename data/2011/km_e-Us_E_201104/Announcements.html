<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>April and May: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Where interest is shown, present the tract <em>Would You Like to Know the Truth? </em>and endeavor to start a Bible study. When making return visits on those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associating with the congregation, concentrate on starting studies using the <em>Bible Teach </em>book. <strong>June: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call. If householders already have the book, congregations that have a stock of <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life </em>and <em>Worship the Only True God </em>may offer either of these books. Otherwise, offer any older field publications on hand in the congregation. <strong>July: </strong><em>Was Life Created?</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The meeting schedule for the week preceding your district convention may be adjusted to review counsel and reminders about attending the convention. A month or two following your convention, a local needs part may be used to review convention points that the publishers have found to be helpful in the ministry.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Beginning in May, all congregations should use the first Saturday of each month to concentrate on starting Bible studies. The <em>Watchtower </em>series “Learn From God’s Word” has been designed to help publishers do this. The back page of each issue of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>will contain sample presentations for the following month, including a suggestion for starting a Bible study on the first Saturday.</p>

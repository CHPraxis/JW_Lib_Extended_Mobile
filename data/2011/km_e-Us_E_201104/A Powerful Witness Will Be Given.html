<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="qu"> 1. In addition to the talk, what else may impress visitors at the Memorial? Explain.</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[6]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>When? On the night of the Memorial. Much effort has gone into inviting people to attend with us. What visitors <em>hear </em>is not the only thing that may impress them. After attending the Memorial, one woman specifically commented on what she <em>saw<wbr /></em>—the friendliness of everyone and the beautiful, clean building that was constructed and maintained by volunteers. Therefore, all of us, not just the speaker, share in giving a witness on this most important occasion of the year.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:16-49:4:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 4:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="qu"> 2. How may each of us give a witness to visitors?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[7]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Warmly Greet Visitors: </strong>Our warm smile along with a cheerful hello to visitors will give a witness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) Even if you are not able to speak to everyone, you can still warmly introduce yourself to people near you. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:1-58:13:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 13:1, 2</a>) Be watchful for visitors who do not seem to know anyone. Likely they received an invitation during the campaign. You might ask, “Is this your first time here?” Invite them to sit with you, and offer to answer any questions they may have. If your congregation must leave quickly so that another congregation can use the facility, you might say: “I’d like to know what you thought of the program. Is there a way that I can contact you?”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 3. How may we welcome those who are inactive?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Welcome the Inactive: </strong>No doubt, inactive publishers will be present, including some who limit their association with the congregation to their annual attendance at the Memorial. Welcome them, and let them know that you are genuinely happy to see them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:7-45:15:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 15:7</a>) Elders can go by their home soon afterward to encourage them to continue their association with the congregation. It is our prayer that many in attendance will be moved to glorify God not just because of what they hear but also because of what they see ‘as a result of our fine works of which they are eyewitnesses.’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:12</a>.</p>

Use Them Rather Than Store Them
Many congregations have accumulated a supply of older publications. Why not obtain copies for your personal theocratic library? Of course, likely you already have access to the contents of some of these older publications in Watchtower Library. However, there are benefits to having a hard copy too. Are you studying with a progressive Bible student? Then encourage him to obtain these older publications and begin building his personal library. The Theocratic Ministry School overseer should make sure that the Kingdom Hall library contains any older publications that the congregation has in stock. These publications still have value. It is better for us to make use of them than to leave them at the congregationâ€™s literature counter!

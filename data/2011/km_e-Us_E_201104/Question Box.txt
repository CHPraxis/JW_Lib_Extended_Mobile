Question Box
▪ How long should we study with a progressive Bible student?
It is best to continue studying with a progressive Bible student until he has completed two publications—What Does the Bible Really Teach? and “Keep Yourselves in God’s Love.” This is true even if the student gets baptized before finishing both books. After his baptism we may continue to report the time, the return visits, and the study. If a publisher accompanies us and participates in the study, he may also count the time.—See the March 2009 Our Kingdom Ministry, page 2.
It is important for new ones to have a good foundation in the truth before they are left on their own. They need to be “rooted” in Christ and “stabilized in the faith” so as to withstand the trials they are sure to face. (Col. 2:6, 7; 2 Tim. 3:12; 1 Pet. 5:8, 9) Additionally, to teach others effectively, they must have “an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) By completing two books with our students, we are helping them attain a solid footing on “the road leading off into life.”—Matt. 7:14.
Before approving someone for baptism, elders should ensure that he clearly understands primary Bible teachings and is living in harmony with them. Elders should be especially careful when considering a student who has not yet completed the first study book. If someone is not ready for baptism, the elders will make sure that he receives the necessary personal assistance in order to qualify for baptism in the future.—See Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will, pages 217-218.

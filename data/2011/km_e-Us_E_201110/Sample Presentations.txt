To start Bible studies on the first Saturday in November

“Do you think people who try to obey God are happier? [Allow for response.] This article makes some interesting points.” Hand the householder a copy of the November 1 issue of The Watchtower, and read and discuss together the material under one of the subheadings on pages 16-17. Read at least one of the scriptures. Offer the magazines, and arrange to return and to consider the answer to the next question.

It also explains how Bible standards benefit us.”

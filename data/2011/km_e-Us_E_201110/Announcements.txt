▪ Literature offer for October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, present the tract Would You Like to Know the Truth? and endeavor to start a Bible study. November: The Bible—What Is Its Message? December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. If there are children in the household, offer Learn From the Great Teacher or My Book of Bible Stories. January: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Endeavor to start Bible studies on the initial call. If householders already have the book and do not accept the offer of a Bible study, publishers may offer an older magazine or any brochure that addresses the person’s interest.

<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="qu"> 1. How does Jehovah feel about education?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[91]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jehovah, our “Grand Instructor,” wants us to be educated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:30:20-23:30:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 30:20</a>) He began teaching after he created his firstborn Son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:28-43:8:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 8:28</a>) After Adam’s rebellion, Jehovah did not stop teaching, but he lovingly provided instruction for imperfect humans.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:48:17-23:48:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 48:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:14-55:3:15" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 3:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p92" data-pid="92" class="qu"> 2. What educational campaign is now under way?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[92]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Today, Jehovah is directing the greatest educational campaign in history. As prophesied by Isaiah, millions around the globe are streaming to the figurative “mountain of the house of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:2:2-23:2:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 2:2</a>) Why stream there? To be instructed in God’s ways, yes, to be taught by Jehovah! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:2:3-23:2:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 2:3</a>) During the 2010 service year, Jehovah’s Witnesses spent over 1.6 billion hours witnessing and teaching people Bible truth. Additionally, each week spiritual instruction is imparted in more than 105,000 congregations earth wide, and educational Christian publications are produced by the faithful and discreet slave in well over 500 languages.</p>
<p id="p93" data-pid="93" class="qu"> 3. How have you personally benefited from the education Jehovah provides?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[93]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Benefit Fully: </strong>How we have benefited from divine education! We have learned that God has a name and that he cares about us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 83:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:5:6-60:5:7" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 5:6, 7</a>) We have learned the answers to some of life’s most important questions: Why do people suffer and die? How can I find real happiness? What is the purpose of life? Jehovah has also given us moral guidance that enables us to ‘make our way successful.’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Josh. 1:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="qu"> 4. What are some educational opportunities that are available to God’s servants, and why should we learn all we can from Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[94]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>In addition, Jehovah makes available specialized education to help a number of his servants expand their service to him. Pages 4-6 list opportunities that are available to some. Even if our circumstances prevent us from receiving the training that is listed, are we taking full advantage of the divine education that <em>is </em>available to us? Are we encouraging young ones, who are often steered by schoolteachers and others to pursue the world’s higher education, to set spiritual goals instead and pursue the highest education<wbr />—divine education? Learning all we can from Jehovah will help us to enjoy a happy life now and an everlasting future.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:119:105-19:119:105" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 119:105;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> John 17:3</a>.</p>

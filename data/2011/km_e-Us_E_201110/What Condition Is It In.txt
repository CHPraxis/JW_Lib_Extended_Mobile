What Condition Is It In?




That is a good question to ask about any piece of literature we plan to offer. Anything that is dog-eared, discolored, soiled, or torn will reflect badly on our organization and could distract the householder from the beautiful, lifesaving message the literature contains.
How can we keep our literature neat? Many find it helpful to organize their witnessing case so that similar items are together. For example, they have a place for books, another for magazines and brochures, still another for tracts, and so forth. Whenever they return their Bible and any literature to their witnessing case, they do so carefully so as to avoid causing damage. Some publishers keep their literature in folders or clear plastic bags. Regardless of the system we use, we do not want to give someone a legitimate reason to find fault with our ministry by giving him damaged literature.—2 Cor. 6:3.

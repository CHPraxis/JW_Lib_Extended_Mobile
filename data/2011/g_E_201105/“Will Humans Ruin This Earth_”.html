<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● From outer space, planet Earth looks like a beautiful blue-and-white jewel. But closer inspection reveals that our home is in trouble. Why? The answer is simple: Humans have been poor tenants. What is more, they are ruining the earth not only literally by means of pollution, deforestation, and exploitation but also morally and spiritually through violence, bloodshed, and sexual immorality.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This sad state of affairs was foretold some two thousand years ago in amazing prophecies recorded in the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:11:18-66:11:18" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Revelation 11:18</a>) The Bible also foretold that God<wbr />—not any human—<wbr />will fully correct matters. These important topics will be developed in the public talk “Will Humans Ruin This Earth?” The discourse will be delivered at the “Let God’s Kingdom Come!” District Conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses, beginning in May in the United States and continuing around the world.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">You are cordially invited to attend the convention nearest you. For specific details, please contact Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area or write to the publishers of this magazine. The Web site www.jw.org lists the convention locations in Canada and the United States.</p>

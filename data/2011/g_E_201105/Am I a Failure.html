<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">DO FEELINGS of inadequacy prevent you from taking on new challenges? Do the well-meaning comments of those you respect sometimes undermine your confidence? Does discouragement over past blunders hold you back from trying again? If so, how can you come to terms with your failures<wbr />—real or perceived?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">You have everything to gain by finding the answer to that last question because sooner or later everyone fails at something. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 3:23</a>) But people who can deal with failures are <em>resilient. </em>That means they can put their mistakes in perspective, get up, and try again. And next time, they’re more likely to succeed! So let’s see how you can cope with three challenges<wbr />—potential failure, perceived failure, and actual failure.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><strong>Bible example. </strong>When Moses was commissioned by Jehovah God to lead the nation of Israel, his first reaction was to think of what could go wrong. “Suppose everyone refuses to listen to my message?” he asked God. Then he started to dwell on his faults. “I have <span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>never been a good speaker,” he said. “I can never think of what to say.” Even after Jehovah promised to help him, Moses pleaded: “Please send someone else to do it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:4:1-2:4:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 4:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:4:10-2:4:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:4:13-2:4:13" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 13</a>, <em>Contemporary English Version</em>) Moses finally accepted his assignment, and the rest is history. Under God’s direction, Moses led the people of Israel for 40 years.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><strong>What you can do. </strong>King Solomon wrote: “All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:9:10-21:9:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>) So instead of letting fear of failure immobilize you, put your heart into the task. Why not think of an occasion on which you did <em>better </em>than you expected? What lesson did you learn about yourself from your success? How can that lesson help you conquer any fear of failure you may be experiencing now?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Hint: If necessary, get input from a parent or a mature friend who can help you build up your self-confidence.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>

<div class="boxContent"><blockquote><p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sc">  “If you do only things that you’re good at<wbr />—if you never try new things for fear of failing—<wbr />then you’re cheating yourself.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="se">  “You can learn from failure and be motivated to improve, or you can focus on what went wrong and stay within your comfort zone. It depends on what kind of person you choose to be.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="se">  “If I know I’m likely to fail at something, I make light of the situation. It’s better to laugh than to sulk. If your expectations for yourself are too high, you’ll never be happy.”</p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"><strong>Bible example. </strong>Cain was “hot with anger” when it became evident that Jehovah looked with favor on his brother Abel. Jehovah warned Cain about his jealousy, but he also expressed confidence that Cain could <span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>succeed if he chose to. “If you turn to doing good,” Jehovah said to him, “will there not be an exaltation?”<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span><wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:4:6-1:4:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 4:6, 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"><strong>What you can do. </strong>Instead of “stirring up competition”<wbr />—even if it is just in your mind—<wbr />acknowledge the accomplishments of others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:5:26-48:5:26" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Galatians 5:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:15-45:12:15" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Romans 12:15</a>) At the same time, without becoming boastful, recognize your own unique abilities. The Bible states: “Let each one prove what his own work is, <em>and then he will have cause for exultation in regard to himself alone.”<wbr /></em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:4-48:6:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Galatians 6:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb"><strong>Bible example. </strong>At times, the apostle Paul felt discouraged over his weaknesses. “What a miserable person I am,” he wrote. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:7:24-45:7:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Romans 7:24</a>, <em>CEV</em>) Evidently, though, Paul realized that his imperfections did not define him. He wrote: “I have fought the fine fight, I have run the course to the finish, I have observed the faith.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:4:7-55:4:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb"><strong>What you can do. </strong>Instead of focusing only on your faults, reflect on your good points as well. Jehovah certainly does. The Bible states: “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:6:10-58:6:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Psalm 110:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">Remember this: No one is perfect. <em>Everyone </em>fails at something, sometime. If you can learn to be resilient, you will have acquired a vital asset that will serve you well in adulthood. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:24:16-20:24:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:16</a> states: “The righteous one may fall even seven times, and <em>he will certainly get up.” </em>That’s the sort of person <em>you </em>can be!</p>

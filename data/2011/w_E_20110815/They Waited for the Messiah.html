<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 1. Certain shepherds heard what angelic announcement?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">NIGHT has fallen. Shepherds are out-of-doors, keeping watch over their flocks. How startled they are when Jehovah’s angel stands nearby and God’s glory gleams around them! Listen! The angel makes this dramatic proclamation: “Have no fear, for, look! I am declaring to you good news of a great joy that all the people will have, because there was born to you today a Savior, who is Christ the Lord,” the one who would prove to be the Messiah. The shepherds can find this infant lying in a manger in a nearby town. Suddenly, “a multitude of the heavenly army” begin praising Jehovah, saying: “Glory in the heights above to God, and upon earth peace among men of goodwill.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:2:8-42:2:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 2:8-14</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Of course, the Jewish shepherds know that “Messiah,” or “Christ,” refers to God’s “Anointed One.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:29:5-2:29:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex. 29:5-7</a>) But how can they learn more and convince others that the baby mentioned by the angel will be Jehovah’s appointed Messiah?

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>When John the Baptizer came on the scene years later, his words and deeds led some to wonder if the Messiah had arrived. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:15-42:3:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong><em>Luke 3:15</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>It is possible that some correctly understood a Messianic prophecy involving “seventy weeks.” If <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>so, they could have determined when the Messiah would appear. In part, the prophecy stated: “From the going forth of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until Messiah the Leader, there will be seven weeks, also sixty-two weeks.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:9:24-27:9:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Dan. 9:24, 25</a>) Various scholars agree that these are weeks of years.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Let us now consider a few of many other prophecies regarding the Messiah that found fulfillment in Jesus’ birth, early life, and ministry.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><em>The Messiah was to be born of Israel’s tribe of Judah. </em>In his deathbed blessing of his sons, the patriarch Jacob foretold: “The scepter will not turn aside from Judah, neither the commander’s staff from between his feet, until Shiloh comes; and to him the obedience of the peoples will belong.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:49:10-1:49:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Gen. 49:10</a>) Many Jewish scholars of the past associated those words with the Messiah. Starting with the rule of Judean King David, the scepter (royal sovereignty) and the commander’s staff (power to command) resided with the tribe of Judah. “Shiloh” signifies “He Whose It Is; He to Whom It Belongs.” The regal line of Judah would end in “Shiloh” as the permanent kingly Heir, for God told Zedekiah, the last Judean king, that rulership would be given to one having the legal right to it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:21:26-26:21:27" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ezek. 21:26, 27</a>) After Zedekiah, Jesus was the only descendant of David to whom kingship was promised. Before Jesus’ birth, the angel Gabriel told Mary: “Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule as king over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end of his kingdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:32-42:1:33" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 1:32, 33</a>) Shiloh must be Jesus Christ, who was a descendant of Judah and David.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:1:1-40:1:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 1:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:1:6-40:1:6" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:23-42:3:23" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Luke 3:23,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:31-42:3:34" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> 31-34</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup><em>The Messiah’s birth would take place in Bethlehem. </em>“You, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, the one too little to get to be among the thousands of Judah,” wrote the prophet Micah, “from you there will come out to me the one who is to become ruler in Israel, whose origin is from early times, from the days of time indefinite.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:5:2-33:5:2" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Mic. 5:2</a>) The Messiah was to be born in the Judean town of Bethlehem, evidently once named Ephrathah. Although Jesus’ mother, Mary, and his adoptive father, Joseph, lived in Nazareth, a Roman registration decree had taken them to Bethlehem, where Jesus was born in 2 B.C.E.

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">11. How was the way prepared before Jehovah’s Anointed One?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup><em>The way was to be prepared before God’s Anointed One. </em>Malachi foretold that “Elijah the prophet” would do this work, preparing the hearts of the people for the coming of the Messiah. <strong>(<em>Read </em></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/39:4:5-39:4:6" data-bid="25-1" class="b"><strong><em>Malachi 4:5, 6</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em>) </strong>Jesus himself identified this “Elijah” as John the Baptizer.

The activity of this foretold “Elijah” was done in harmony with God’s will as a means of identifying the Messiah.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">12. What commission helps to identify the Messiah?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup><em>A God-given commission helps to identify the Messiah. </em>In the synagogue at Nazareth, the town where he had been reared, Jesus read from the scroll of Isaiah and applied to himself the words: “Jehovah’s spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor, he sent me forth to preach a release to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away with a release, to preach Jehovah’s acceptable year.” Because he truly was the Messiah, Jesus could rightly say: “Today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:16-42:4:21" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Luke 4:16-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">13. How was Jesus’ public ministry in Galilee foretold?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup><em>The Messiah’s public ministry in Galilee was foretold. </em>Concerning “the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali . . .

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:12-40:4:16" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matt. 4:12-16</a>) In Galilee, Jesus gave his thought-provoking Sermon on the Mount, chose his apostles, performed his first miracle, and likely appeared to some 500 disciples after his resurrection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:1-40:7:27" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Matt. 5:1–7:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:16-40:28:20" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 28:16-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:3:13-41:3:14" data-bid="31-3" class="b"> Mark 3:13, 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:2:8-43:2:11" data-bid="31-4" class="b"> John 2:8-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:6-46:15:6" data-bid="31-5" class="b"> 1 Cor. 15:6</a>) He thus fulfilled Isaiah’s prophecy by preaching in “the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali.” Of course, Jesus went on to preach the Kingdom message elsewhere in Israel.</p>

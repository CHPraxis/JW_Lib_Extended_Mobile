<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● The above is what a woman in Illinois, U.S.A., wrote about reading the book <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. </em>She explained in her letter to the book’s publishers, “I just hope and pray that more people will enjoy reading about Jesus as much as I do.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The <em>Greatest Man </em>book gives an account of the life of Jesus based on the inspired writings of four of his contemporaries, namely, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Matthew and John were apostles and traveling companions of Jesus. Mark was a close friend of Peter, one of Jesus’ apostles. And the physician Luke was a traveling companion of the apostle Paul.</p>

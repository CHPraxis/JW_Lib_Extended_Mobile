That feeling might be especially common among those on a social network. “You could have a huge ‘friends list’ and look popular and awesome,” says 22-year-old Serena, “but in reality that list might be full of meaningless contacts.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Do your friends help you to reach your potential, or do you have to lower your standards to fit in with them? <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:20</a> says: “He that is walking with wise persons will become wise, but he that is having dealings with the stupid ones will fare badly.”</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sc">  A good friendship is built on the foundation of common <strong>values. </strong>That means your friend shares your spiritual, moral, and ethical convictions.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sc">  The next factor, matching <strong>traits, </strong>is less important.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sc">  And quite often, similar <strong>interests </strong>matter least. After all, you can be friends with someone whose hobbies and talents are different from yours.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sc">  Warning: Be cautious about friendships that are founded on similar interests <em>alone. </em>If that friend doesn’t share your values, the relationship will likely totter<wbr />—or worse, it may get you into trouble.</p>

You always go back to the few items that you know work for you. And that’s what you do with close friends too.”</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● The bird’s egg has been called “a miracle of packaging.” Why?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Consider: </strong>While it appears solid, the calcium-rich shell of a chicken egg can have up to 8,000 microscopic pores. These allow oxygen to enter and carbon dioxide to escape<wbr />—an important exchange if the embryo is to breathe. Yet, the shell and several membranes prevent bacteria from infecting the embryo. Albumen<wbr />—a gelatinlike substance with a high water content—<wbr />gives the egg its ability to absorb shock.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Researchers would like to imitate the structure of the egg to create products with better shock protection and a film coating that could protect fruit from bacteria and parasites. However, “copying nature is not so easy,” writes Marianne Botta Diener in <em>Vivai </em>magazine. Attempts thus far, she notes, have not been environmentally friendly.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>What do you think? </strong>Did this “miracle of packaging,” the bird’s egg, come about by chance? Or was it designed?</p>

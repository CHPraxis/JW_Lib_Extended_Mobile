How Do God’s Laws Benefit Us?
This article raises questions you may have asked and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible. Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you.
 1. Why should we obey God?
It is only right to obey God​—he created us. Even Jesus always obeyed God. (John 6:38; Revelation 4:11) God’s laws give us a way to prove that we love him.​—Read 1 John 5:3.
All of Jehovah God’s laws are good for us. They teach us the best way of life now and show how we can gain everlasting rewards in the future.​—Read Psalm 19:7, 11; Isaiah 48:17, 18.
 2. How do God’s laws benefit our health?
God’s law against drunkenness protects us from deadly disease and accidents. Overdrinking is addictive and leads to foolish conduct. (Proverbs 23:20, 29, 30) Jehovah allows us to drink alcohol but only in moderation.​—Read Psalm 104:15; 1 Corinthians 6:10.
Jehovah also warns us against jealousy, uncontrolled anger, and other destructive attitudes. To the extent that we apply his advice, our health will benefit.​—Read Proverbs 14:30; 22:24, 25.
 3. How can God’s law protect us?
God’s law forbids sex outside of marriage. (Hebrews 13:4) Couples who obey this law feel more secure and create a better environment for their children. On the other hand, sex outside of marriage often results in disease, divorce, violence, emotional trauma, and one-parent families.​—Read Proverbs 5:1-9.
By avoiding situations that tempt us to have sex outside of marriage, we protect our friendship with God. We also avoid harming others.​—Read 1 Thessalonians 4:3-6.
 4. How does respect for life benefit us?
People who respect God’s gift of life enjoy health benefits when they drop such habits as smoking and other life-threatening addictions. (2 Corinthians 7:1) God treasures even the life of a baby developing in the womb. (Exodus 21:22, 23) So we should not deliberately kill an unborn child. Also, those who appreciate God’s view of life take safety precautions at work, at home, and in a car. (Deuteronomy 22:8) In addition, they do not risk their life for sport, because life is a gift from God.​—Read Psalm 36:9.
 5. How does the sacredness of blood benefit us?
Blood is sacred because God says that it represents the life, or soul, of a creature. (Genesis 9:3, 4) God’s law, which equates the value of blood with that of life, benefits us. How? It makes possible the forgiveness of sins.​—Read Leviticus 17:11-13; Hebrews 9:22.
Jesus’ blood was especially precious because he was perfect. Jesus presented to God something that represented his life​—his blood. (Hebrews 9:12) His shed blood makes everlasting life possible for us.​—Read Matthew 26:28; John 3:16.

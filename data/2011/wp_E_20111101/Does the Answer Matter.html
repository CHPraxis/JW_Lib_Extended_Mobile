<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“I was ten years old when I began going out with boys. At first, we would hold hands and kiss. Soon, though, we were touching intimate body parts and experimenting with various sexual activities. When I was 15, I started working and was approached by men on the job who wanted to go all the way with sex. I wanted to be daring and join my workmates in whatever they were doing. I wanted my associates to accept me, which in turn led to more and more sexual experimentation.”​—SARAH,<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> AUSTRALIA.</p>

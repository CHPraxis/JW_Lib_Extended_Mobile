<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● A 19-year-old girl from the southern United States wrote: “I was raised in a churchgoing family and personally know Christ as my Savior. Yet, for years I have lived in fear of God’s judgmental wrath, of burning in a horrible hell. Then I began reading your book <em>What Does the Bible Really Teach?</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“After just a few chapters, I felt a huge amount of peace. I felt as if an elephant had climbed off my chest. I now see that Jehovah is a loving, kind, and merciful God. He desires a relationship with me and not one based on a dreadful fear of him. I am planning to visit the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses this Sunday! I am so excited. Thank you for showing me a Father of love and not one who created a fiery hell.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The <em>Bible Teach </em>book also discusses other important subjects. These include the condition of the dead, the resurrection hope, how to improve family life, the identity of God and Jesus Christ, and why God allows suffering.

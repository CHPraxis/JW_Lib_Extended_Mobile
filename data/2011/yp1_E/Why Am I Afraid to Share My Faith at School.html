<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Why </strong><strong>Am I</strong> <strong>Afraid to Share My Faith at School?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">“There have been some great opportunities to talk about my beliefs at school. But I let them pass.”​—Kaleb.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sa">“Our teacher asked the class what we thought about evolution. I knew this was a perfect chance to share my faith. But I completely froze and said nothing. Afterward, I felt really bad.”​—Jasmine.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><span id="page122" class="pageNum" data-no="122" data-before-text="122"></span>IF YOU are a Christian youth, perhaps you can relate to the experiences of Kaleb and Jasmine. Like them, you may love the Bible-based truths you have learned. You may even want to share them with others. Still, you might <em>dread </em>the thought of speaking up. But you can develop more courage. How? Take the following steps:</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>1. Define your fears. </strong>When you think about sharing your faith, it’s easy to imagine the worst-case scenario! Sometimes, though, you can shrink your fears simply by putting them into words.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si"><strong>Complete the following sentence:</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="si">● This is what I fear might happen if I talk about my beliefs at school: ․․․․․</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">If it’s any comfort, your fears may be a lot like those of other Christian youths. For instance, 14-year-old Christopher admits, “I’m afraid kids will make fun of me and tell everyone I’m weird.” And Kaleb, quoted at the outset, says, “I was worried someone would ask a question and I wouldn’t know the answer.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>2. Accept the challenge. </strong>Are your fears completely unfounded? Not necessarily, as 20-year-old Ashley recalls. “Some kids pretended they were interested in my beliefs,” she says. “But later they turned my words against me and teased me in front of others.” Nicole, 17, had this experience: “A boy compared a verse in his Bible with the same verse in mine, and the wording was different. He said <span id="page123" class="pageNum" data-no="123" data-before-text="123"></span>that my Bible had been changed. I was stunned! I didn’t know what to say.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Situations like these can seem pretty scary! But instead of running away, accept such challenges for what they are​—a normal part of your life as a Christian. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:12-55:3:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:12</a>) “Jesus said his followers would be persecuted,” says 13-year-old Matthew, “so we can’t expect everyone to like us for our beliefs.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:20-43:15:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 15:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>3. Think of the benefits. </strong>Can any good come out of a seemingly bad experience? Amber, 21, thinks so. “It’s hard to explain your faith to people who don’t respect the Bible,” she says, “but it helps you to understand your own position better.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 12:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="si"><strong>Look again at the scenario you described in Step 1. Think of at least two good things that could come out of that situation, and write them below.</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="si">1 ․․․․․</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">2 ․․․․․</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si">Hint: How might making known your faith lead to a decrease in the peer pressure you face? How will speaking up affect your self-confidence? <span id="page124" class="pageNum" data-no="124" data-before-text="124"></span>Your feelings for Jehovah God? His feelings for you?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:15-20:23:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 23:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>4. Be prepared. </strong>“The heart of the righteous one meditates so as to answer,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:28-20:15:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:28</a>. Besides meditating on what you’ll say, try to anticipate questions others may ask. Research those topics, and plan out answers you feel comfortable giving.​—See the chart “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102011141/49-89">Plan Your Response</a>,” on page 127.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>5. Get started. </strong>Once you’re ready to talk about your beliefs, how should you start? You have options. In a sense, sharing your faith is like swimming: Some people ease their way into the water; others jump right in. Likewise, you could start the conversation on a nonreligious subject and gradually test the water, so to speak. But if you find yourself worrying too much about what might go wrong, your best option may be to ‘jump right in.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:11-42:12:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke <span id="page125" class="pageNum" data-no="125" data-before-text="125"></span>12:11, 12</a>) <em>“Thinking </em>about sharing my faith was always harder than actually <em>doing </em>it,” says 17-year-old Andrew. “Once a conversation was started, it was much easier than I thought it would be!”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><strong>6. Be sensible. </strong>“Sensible people always think before they act,” wrote Solomon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:16-20:13:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:16</a>, <em>Today’s English Version</em>) Just as you wouldn’t dive into shallow waters, be careful not to jump into pointless arguments. Remember, there’s a time to speak and a time to keep quiet. <span id="page126" class="pageNum" data-no="126" data-before-text="126"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:7-21:3:7" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 7</a>) At times, even Jesus refused to answer questions.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:62-40:26:63" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 26:62, 63</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">If you do choose to reply, you might keep it brief and be discreet. For example, if a classmate taunts, ‘Why don’t you smoke cigarettes?’ you could simply say, ‘Because I’m not into body pollution!’ Depending on the response, you can decide whether or not to explain your beliefs further.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">The six steps outlined in this chapter can help you to be “ready to make a defense” of your faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:15</a>) Of course, being ready doesn’t mean that you’ll never feel nervous. But Alana, 18, observes: “When you explain your beliefs <em>despite being scared, </em>it makes you feel as if you’ve accomplished something​—you’ve overcome your fear and taken the risk that it might not go well. And if it <em>does </em>go well, you’ll feel even better! You’ll be glad you had the courage to speak up.”</p>

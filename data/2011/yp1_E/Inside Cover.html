<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Your heavenly Father, Jehovah God, loves you very much. He wants you to be happy. ‘But is it really possible to be happy today?’ you may wonder. The question is a good one. After all, our lives are far from trouble-free. It seems that challenges arise every day that could rob us of our joy. Ah, but our loving Father has come to the rescue! His Word provides the guidance we need in order to navigate the rough seas of life. Although the Bible was written a long time ago, its counsel is just as practical today as it was when it was first written.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:98-19:119:99" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 119:98, 99;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>.</p>

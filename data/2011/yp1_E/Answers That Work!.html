<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">‘How can I communicate with my parents?’ ‘How can I make friends?’ ‘What’s wrong with casual sex?’ ‘Why do I get so sad?’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If you’ve asked yourself such questions, you’re not alone. Depending on where you’ve turned for guidance, you may have been given conflicting answers. To help young people get solid advice they can rely on, <em>Awake! </em>magazine launched the Bible-based series entitled “Young People Ask . . . ” in January 1982. Decades later, the series still draws an enthusiastic response. Each article is the product of extensive research. In fact, to determine just how young people think and feel, <em>Awake! </em>writers have spoken to hundreds of youths all over the world! More important, though, the advice given in “Young People Ask” is based on God’s Word, the Bible.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The book you now hold was originally published in 1989. However, the chapters have been completely revised to address the issues of today. More than 30 chapters have been adapted from “Young People Ask” articles that were published between 2004 and 2011.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work, </em>Volume 1, will provide you with the tools you need to become a responsible adult. It is our hope that as you apply its advice, you will join the millions of people, both young and adult, who “through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:14</a>.</p>

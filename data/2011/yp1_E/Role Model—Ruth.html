<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The widow Ruth knows about <strong>loyalty. </strong>She has chosen to stay by the side of her aged mother-in-law, Naomi, rather than return to a more comfortable life in her hometown. Even though this choice lessens her chances of finding a mate, Ruth <strong>keeps focused </strong>on the big picture. Her <strong>love for Naomi </strong>and her <strong>desire to be with Jehovah’s people </strong>mean more to her than impulsively satisfying her desire for marriage.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:1:8-8:1:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ruth 1:8-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Are you thinking about marriage? Then imitate Ruth. Look beyond your emotions, and ask what positive qualities you would bring to a future mate. For example, are you <strong>loyal </strong>and <strong>self-sacrificing? </strong>Do you <strong>conform to Godly principles, </strong>even when your imperfect flesh begs you to do otherwise? Ruth did not desperately seek a mate. However, in time, she found a husband who proved to be a <strong>mature man </strong>who shared similar qualities​—above all, a <strong>love for God. </strong>The same outcome could be true for you.</p>

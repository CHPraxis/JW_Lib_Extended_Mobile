<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>How Can I Conquer the Habit of Masturbation?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">“I began masturbating when I was eight years old. Later I learned God’s view of the matter. I felt terrible every time I gave in. ‘How could God love someone like me?’ I asked myself.”​—Luiz.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">WHEN you reach puberty, sexual desires can become particularly strong. As a result, you might fall into a habit of masturbation.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Many would say that it’s not a big deal. “No one gets hurt,” they argue. However, there’s good reason to avoid the practice. The apostle Paul wrote: “Deaden, therefore, your body members . . . as respects . . . sexual appetite.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5</a>) Masturbation does not deaden sexual appetite but <em>fuels </em>it. In addition, consider the following:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">● Masturbation instills attitudes that are totally self-centered. For example, when masturbating, a person is immersed in his or her own body sensations.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">● Masturbation causes one to view those of the opposite sex as mere objects, or tools, for self-gratification.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">● The selfish thinking that is instilled through the practice of masturbation can make satisfying sexual relations in marriage difficult to achieve.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Rather than resort to masturbation to relieve pent-up sexual urges, strive to cultivate self-control. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:4-52:4:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians <span id="page179" class="pageNum" data-no="179" data-before-text="179"></span>4:4, 5</a>) To help you to do that, the Bible recommends that you avoid circumstances that might arouse you sexually in the first place. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:5:8-20:5:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 5:8, 9</a>) Still, what if you have become enslaved to the habit of masturbation? Perhaps you’ve tried to stop but without success. It would be easy to conclude that you’re a lost cause, that you’re incapable of living up to God’s standards. That’s how a boy named Pedro viewed himself. “When I relapsed, I felt terrible,” he says. “I thought that I could never atone for what I had done. I found it hard to pray.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">If that’s how you feel, take courage. Your case isn’t hopeless. Many young people​—and adults—​have overcome the habit of masturbation. You can too!</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Dealing With Guilt</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">As already noted, those who have fallen into the habit of masturbation are often plagued with guilt. Without a doubt, being “saddened in a godly way” can give you the incentive to overcome the habit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:11-47:7:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>) But excessive guilt can be counterproductive. It can make you feel so discouraged that you just want to give up the fight.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:10-20:24:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">So strive to put the matter in perspective. Masturbation is a form of uncleanness. It can make you a ‘slave to various desires and pleasures,’ and it fosters unhealthy attitudes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:3-56:3:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Titus 3:3</a>) At the same time, masturbation is not a form of gross sexual immorality, such as fornication. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:7-65:1:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jude 7</a>) If you have a problem with masturbation, you need not conclude <span id="page180" class="pageNum" data-no="180" data-before-text="180"></span>that you have committed the unforgivable sin. The key is to resist the urge and <em>never to give up your fight!</em></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">It is easy to become downhearted after a relapse. When that occurs, take to heart the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:16-20:24:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:16</a>: “The righteous one may fall even seven times, and he will certainly get up; but the wicked ones will be made to stumble by calamity.” A temporary setback does not make you a wicked person. So do not give up. Instead, analyze what led to the relapse, and try to avoid repeating the same pattern.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Take time to meditate on God’s love and mercy. The psalmist David, who was no stranger to personal weakness, stated: “As a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah has shown mercy to those fearing him. For he himself well knows the formation of us, remembering that we are dust.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:13-19:103:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 103:13, 14</a>) Yes, Jehovah takes into consideration our imperfection and is “ready to forgive.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:5-19:86:5" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Psalm 86:5</a>) On the other hand, he wants us to put forth effort to improve. So what practical steps can you take to conquer your habit?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>Analyze your entertainment. </strong>Do you watch movies or TV programs or visit Web sites that are sexually stimulating? <span id="page181" class="pageNum" data-no="181" data-before-text="181"></span>The psalmist wisely prayed to God: “Make my eyes pass on from seeing what is worthless.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:37-19:119:37" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 119:37</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>Force your mind to focus on other matters. </strong>A Christian named William advises: “Before going to bed, read something related to spiritual things. It is very important that the last thought of the day be a spiritual one.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:8-50:4:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Philippians 4:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>Talk to someone about the problem. </strong>Shame might make it difficult for you to bring up the matter to a confidant. Yet, doing so can help you to overcome the habit! <span id="page182" class="pageNum" data-no="182" data-before-text="182"></span>That’s what a Christian named David found. “I talked privately with my father,” he says. “I’ll never forget what he said. With a reassuring smile on his face, he said, ‘You make me so proud of you.’ He knew what I had to go through to get to that point. No words could have lifted my spirits and determination more.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">“My father then showed me a few scriptures to help me see that I was not ‘too far gone,’ and then some more scriptures to be sure I understood the seriousness of my wrong course. He said to ‘keep the slate clean’ until a certain time, and we would discuss it again then. He told me not to let it crush me if I relapsed, just go a longer period of time without giving in the next time.” David’s conclusion? He says: “Having someone else aware of my problem and helping me was the greatest benefit.”<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></p>

<div id="fn1" class="fcc"><p id="p21" data-pid="21">Masturbation is not to be confused with involuntary sexual arousal. For example, a boy might wake up sexually excited or have a nocturnal emission of semen. Similarly, some girls might find that they are stimulated unintentionally, particularly just before or after their menstrual period. In contrast, masturbation involves <em>deliberate </em>sexual self-stimulation.</p></div>

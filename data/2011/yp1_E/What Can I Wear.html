<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>What Can I Wear?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">Heather is ready to walk out the door, and her parents can’t believe their eyes.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sa">“You’re wearing that?” her dad blurts out.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sa">“Why not?” Heather replies, sounding astonished. “I’m just going to the mall with friends.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sa">“Not in that outfit!” her mom says.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sa">“But Mom,” Heather whines, “this is what all the kids are wearing. And besides, it makes a statement!”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sa">“Well, we don’t like what it’s stating!” Dad shoots back. “Now go upstairs and change, young lady, or you’re not going anywhere!”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span id="page78" class="pageNum" data-no="78" data-before-text="78"></span>WARDROBE wars are nothing new. Your parents may have fought similar battles with their parents when they were your age. And back then, they probably felt the same way you feel today! But now they’ve switched sides, and the issue of what you can wear causes one skirmish after another.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>You say: </strong>It’s comfortable.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>They say: </strong>It’s sloppy.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>You say: </strong>It’s so adorable!</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><strong>They say: </strong>It’s so provocative.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>You say: </strong>It’s half price.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>They say: </strong>It <em>should </em>be. . . . Half of it is missing!</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Is there any way to declare a cease-fire? Yes! Megan, 23, has learned the secret. “There doesn’t have to be an argument,” she says. “There can be an agreement.” <em>Agreement? </em>Does that mean you have to dress like a 40-year-old? Relax! To agree just means that you and your parents discuss your differences and brainstorm other options that they​—<em>and </em>you—​can be happy with. The benefits?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sm"> <strong>1. </strong>You’ll look your best, even to your peers.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sm"> <strong>2. </strong>Your parents will be less likely to criticize what you wear.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sm"> <strong>3. </strong>After seeing how responsible you are in this area, your parents may even grant you other freedoms.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">So let’s get started. Think of a “must-have” outfit that you’ve spotted online or at the store. The first thing to do is . . .</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong>Consider Bible Principles</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The Bible says surprisingly little about dress. In fact, you <span id="page79" class="pageNum" data-no="79" data-before-text="79"></span>could read all the Scriptural admonition that directly relates to the subject in just a couple of minutes! In that time, though, you would find solid, valuable guidelines. For example:</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">● The Bible advises women to adorn themselves “with modesty and soundness of mind.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">The word “modesty” might make you worry. ‘Do I have to wear a sack?’ you may wonder. Not at all! In this context, modesty means that your clothes show you have self-respect and consideration for others’ feelings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:3-47:6:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:3</a>) A wide variety of clothing fits those criteria. “It might be challenging,” says Danielle, 23, “but you <em>can </em>be fashionable without wearing extreme styles.”</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">● The Bible says that when it comes to appearance, you should focus on “the secret person of the heart”​—or, as <em>Today’s English Version </em>renders it, “your true inner self.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:4-60:3:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">An immodest outfit may momentarily turn heads, but it’s your inner beauty that will win the long-term respect of adults and your peers. Your peers? Yes​—even <em>they </em>may see the folly of excessive styles. “It’s sickening to see <span id="page80" class="pageNum" data-no="80" data-before-text="80"></span>the way women practically throw themselves at men by what they wear!” says 16-year-old Brittany. Kay would agree. Describing a former friend, she says: “Everything she wore had ‘look-at-me’ written all over it. She wanted the attention of the guys, and to get it she would wear the most eye-catching outfits she could find.”</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><strong>Get Your Parents’ Input</strong></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Stuffing a daring outfit into your backpack and changing into it at school is <em>not </em>the way to go. You’ll gain more trust from your parents if you’re open and honest with them, even in things that you think you <em>could </em>get away with. In fact, you’d probably do well to seek out their opinion when you’re considering an outfit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:22-20:15:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:22</a>)​—Use the “Wardrobe Worksheet” on pages 82 and 83.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><span id="page81" class="pageNum" data-no="81" data-before-text="81"></span>But why would you want to ask for their opinion? Isn’t it your parents’ job to <em>stifle </em>your fashion sense? Not really. True, your dad and mom’s perspective may be different from yours, but sometimes that’s what you need. “I appreciate my parents’ advice,” says 17-year-old Nataleine, “because I don’t want to walk out of the house embarrassing myself or to be the one that people are talking about negatively because of my appearance.”</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Besides, let’s face it: As long as you’re under your parents’ roof, you’re under their authority. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:20-51:3:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Colossians <span id="page84" class="pageNum" data-no="84" data-before-text="84"></span>3:20</a>) Still, once you understand their views​—and they, yours—​you might be surprised at how often you can come to an agreement. As a result, the wardrobe wars may finally be over!</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"><strong>Fashion Tip: </strong>When trying on clothing, think of more than what you see in the mirror. A seemingly modest outfit may change when you sit down or bend over to pick up something. If possible, get the opinion of a parent or a mature friend.</p>

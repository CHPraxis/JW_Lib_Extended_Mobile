<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Moses has many <strong>advantages </strong>in life. He was raised in the royal household of Pharaoh and <strong>educated </strong>in all the <strong>wisdom of Egypt. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:22-44:7:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 7:22</a>) What will he do with his training? He could gain fame, fortune, and power. However, he is <strong>not swayed </strong>by peer pressure nor enticed by selfish ambition. Instead, he makes a career choice that no doubt <strong>surprises many. </strong>He chooses “to be ill-treated with the people of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:25-58:11:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:25</a>) Does Moses lose out? No. Because of choosing to <strong>serve God </strong>and <strong>help people, </strong>he enjoys an exciting, rewarding life.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">If you are fortunate enough to have access to a good basic education, <strong>what will you do </strong>with that advantage? You could chase after money or power. Or, like Moses, you could do something <strong>truly worthwhile </strong>with your life. You could use your mental and physical assets to serve God and your neighbors. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:35-40:22:40" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 22:35-40</a>) No other course of life is as rewarding!</p>

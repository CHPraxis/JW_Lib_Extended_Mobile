Role Model​—Moses
Moses has many advantages in life. He was raised in the royal household of Pharaoh and educated in all the wisdom of Egypt. (Acts 7:22) What will he do with his training? He could gain fame, fortune, and power. However, he is not swayed by peer pressure nor enticed by selfish ambition. Instead, he makes a career choice that no doubt surprises many. He chooses “to be ill-treated with the people of God.” (Hebrews 11:25) Does Moses lose out? No. Because of choosing to serve God and help people, he enjoys an exciting, rewarding life.
If you are fortunate enough to have access to a good basic education, what will you do with that advantage? You could chase after money or power. Or, like Moses, you could do something truly worthwhile with your life. You could use your mental and physical assets to serve God and your neighbors. (Matthew 22:35-40) No other course of life is as rewarding!

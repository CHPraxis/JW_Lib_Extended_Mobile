Role Model​—Job
Job’s world is turned upside down. First, he loses his means of livelihood. Second, he loses his children in death. Third, he loses his health. All of this happens quickly and without warning. In utter despair, Job says: “My soul certainly feels a loathing toward my life.” He describes himself as “glutted with dishonor and saturated with affliction.” (Job 10:1, 15) Even in the midst of adversity, however, Job refuses to turn his back on his Creator. (Job 2:10) The changes in his life do not change him. Job thus stands as an example of endurance.
When confronted with problems, you too might feel a ‘loathing toward your life.’ Still, like Job, you can show yourself unchanging in the midst of change, unwavering in your determination to serve Jehovah God. James wrote: “Look! We pronounce happy those who have endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome Jehovah gave, that Jehovah is very tender in affection and merciful.” (James 5:11) He cared for Job, and he cares for you!

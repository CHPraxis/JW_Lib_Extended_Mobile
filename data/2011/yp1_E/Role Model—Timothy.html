<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Timothy is about to leave home​—not to run away from his family but to become a missionary companion of the apostle Paul! Possibly in his late teens, Timothy is already a <strong>responsible young man </strong>who has been “well reported on by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:2-44:16:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 16:2</a>) Paul is confident that Timothy can <strong>accomplish great things </strong>in God’s service. And he does! In the years that follow, Timothy travels extensively, establishing congregations and building up the brotherhood. Timothy’s <strong>fine qualities </strong>endear him to Paul, who some 11 years later tells the Philippians: “I have no one else of a disposition like his who will genuinely care for the things pertaining to you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:20-50:2:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Philippians 2:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Are you <strong>making yourself available </strong>to be used in God’s service? If you are, great blessings await you! Jehovah truly values young ones who <strong>“offer themselves willingly.” </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 110:3</a>) Furthermore, you can be assured that Jehovah God “is not unrighteous so as to forget your work.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:10-58:6:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:10</a>.</p>

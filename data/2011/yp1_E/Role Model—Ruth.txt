Role Model​—Ruth
The widow Ruth knows about loyalty. She has chosen to stay by the side of her aged mother-in-law, Naomi, rather than return to a more comfortable life in her hometown. Even though this choice lessens her chances of finding a mate, Ruth keeps focused on the big picture. Her love for Naomi and her desire to be with Jehovah’s people mean more to her than impulsively satisfying her desire for marriage.​—Ruth 1:8-17.
Are you thinking about marriage? Then imitate Ruth. Look beyond your emotions, and ask what positive qualities you would bring to a future mate. For example, are you loyal and self-sacrificing? Do you conform to Godly principles, even when your imperfect flesh begs you to do otherwise? Ruth did not desperately seek a mate. However, in time, she found a husband who proved to be a mature man who shared similar qualities​—above all, a love for God. The same outcome could be true for you.

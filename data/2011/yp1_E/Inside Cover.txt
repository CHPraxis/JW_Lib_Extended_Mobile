Inside Cover
To Our Dear Young People,
Your heavenly Father, Jehovah God, loves you very much. He wants you to be happy. ‘But is it really possible to be happy today?’ you may wonder. The question is a good one. After all, our lives are far from trouble-free. It seems that challenges arise every day that could rob us of our joy. Ah, but our loving Father has come to the rescue! His Word provides the guidance we need in order to navigate the rough seas of life. Although the Bible was written a long time ago, its counsel is just as practical today as it was when it was first written.​—Psalm 119:98, 99; 2 Timothy 3:16, 17.
We have had this publication prepared because we love you. We want you to be happy and to get the best out of life. To that end, we encourage you not only to read this publication from cover to cover but also to refer to it often as problems arise. One of the objectives of this book is to promote better communication between you and your parents. We hope that you will read or even study portions of it together. Take advantage of your parents’ wisdom and experience!
With every good wish,
Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses

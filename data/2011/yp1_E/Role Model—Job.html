<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Job’s world is <strong>turned upside down. </strong>First, he loses his means of livelihood. Second, he loses his children in death. Third, he loses his health. All of this happens quickly and <strong>without warning. </strong>In utter despair, Job says: “My soul certainly feels a loathing toward my life.” He describes himself as “glutted with dishonor and saturated with affliction.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:10:1-18:10:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 10:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:10:15-18:10:15" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 15</a>) Even in the midst of adversity, however, Job refuses to turn his back on his Creator. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:10-18:2:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 2:10</a>) The changes in his life do not change him. Job thus stands as an <strong>example of endurance.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When confronted with problems, you too might feel a ‘loathing toward your life.’ Still, like Job, you can show yourself <strong>unchanging in the midst of change, </strong>unwavering in your determination to serve Jehovah God. James wrote: “Look! We pronounce happy those who have endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome Jehovah gave, that Jehovah is very tender in affection and merciful.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:11-59:5:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 5:11</a>) He cared for Job, and <strong>he cares for you!</strong></p>

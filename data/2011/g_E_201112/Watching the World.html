<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">While Joseph Ratzinger was a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, he was an organ donor, says the Italian newspaper <em>La Repubblica. </em>Yet, since being elected pope, Benedict XVI is no longer an organ donor. Why not? “The body of a Pontiff belongs to the entire Church,” explains archbishop Zygmunt Zimowski, a member of the Vatican hierarchy. “It is therefore understandable that when a pope dies his body be preserved intact, since it is possible that in the future it will be venerated.”</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Would people be willing to trade a year of their life for a million euros? In Germany more than 1 in 4 men and 1 in 6 women would do so, says a survey conducted by the polling institute Emnid on behalf of <em>Reader’s Digest Deutschland. </em>The younger the people polled, the more inclined they would be to accept such a deal<wbr />—29 percent of the 14- to 29-year-olds and 25 percent of those aged 30 to 39 would make the exchange. The older people get, however, the more precious they consider life to be. Only 13 percent of the 50- to 59-year-olds and 11 percent of those over 60 years of age could imagine selling a year of their life.</p>

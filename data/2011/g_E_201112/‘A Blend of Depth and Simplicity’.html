<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● That is how a reader in Nebraska, U.S.A., described a book he had recently read. He wrote: “I am a 56-year-old single man who just finished reading <em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>Right away I began marveling at the ingenious blend of depth and simplicity of words that you brought together through a pen of love.” He added: “The illustrations are nothing but marvelous. I think if I were a dad or grandpa, I would help my little ones spend as much time with the pictures as with the text.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A woman in Georgia, U.S.A., wrote regarding the same book: “My six-year-old niece, Avery, took it to school to share with her first-grade class. After Avery shared a story with the class, her teacher was so impressed that she arranged for Avery to read a story from the book every day.” The aunt added, “What a great witness this has been for her classmates and her teacher!”</p>

The Bible—Do You Know Its Message?
● The Bible is the most widely distributed book in all history. People of all cultures have found its message to be a source of comfort and hope and its advice to be practical for daily living. Yet, many know little about this amazing book.
The fast-moving, tastefully illustrated brochure The Bible—What Is Its Message? can help you to understand the Bible. The first two sections describe God’s original provision of a paradise for humans and how it was lost. Later, we learn of the Creator’s purpose to restore Paradise by means of God’s Kingdom, a heavenly government in the hands of Jesus Christ.
Sections that follow focus on Jesus—his ministry, his miracles, his death, and his resurrection. We are also introduced to Jesus’ courageous early followers and their inspired writings, which became part of the Bible we know today.
Fittingly, the 26 sections of the brochure conclude with the beautiful theme “Paradise Regained!” The colorful facing page is entitled “The Bible’s Message—An Overview.” There you will see a summary of seven key developments in the outworking of God’s purpose for mankind.

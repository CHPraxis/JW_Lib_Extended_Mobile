<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● That is what a mother from California, U.S.A., wrote regarding a matter discussed in the book <em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>She explained: “Just last week when our son Javan, aged 3, saw his pediatrician, she asked if my husband and I had discussed safety with Javan regarding private parts of the body. I was so happy to tell her about the <em>Teacher </em>book, which explains that it would be wrong for anyone to play with ones’ private parts. The doctor was very impressed that we had discussed this.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The mother added: “The way in which these things are discussed in the book is perfect.” The chapter she was referring to is entitled “How Jesus Was Protected.” It describes how Jesus’ heavenly Father protected his Son from being hurt by wicked King Herod when Jesus was too young to protect himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:2:7-40:2:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 2:7-23</a>) The book then shows how even young children can be taught to protect themselves if someone tries to molest them.</p>

How Can You Draw Close to God?
This article raises questions you may have asked and shows where you can read the answers in your Bible. Jehovah’s Witnesses would be pleased to discuss these answers with you.
 1. Does God listen to all prayers?
Jehovah invites people of all nations to draw close to him in prayer. (Psalm 65:2) But he does not listen to all prayers. For example, when the Israelites persisted in badness, God refused to hear their prayers. (Isaiah 1:15) Also, the prayers of a man who mistreats his wife can be hindered. (1 Peter 3:7) Yet, God will hear even gross sinners if they repent.—Read 2 Chronicles 33:9-13.
 2. How should we pray?
Prayer is a privilege and a part of our worship, so we should pray only to Jehovah. (Matthew 4:10; 6:9) Since we are imperfect, we should pray in the name of Jesus because he is the appointed “way.” (John 14:6) Jehovah does not want us to repeat memorized or written prayers but to pray from the heart.—Read Matthew 6:7; Philippians 4:6, 7.
Our Creator can even hear silent prayers. (1 Samuel 1:12, 13) He invites us to pray on every occasion, such as at the beginning and the end of the day, at mealtimes, and when we face problems.—Read Psalm 55:22; Matthew 15:36.
 3. Why do Christians meet together?
Drawing close to God is not easy because we live among people who lack faith in God and ridicule his promise of peace on earth. (2 Timothy 3:1, 4; 2 Peter 3:3, 13) So we need to have encouraging association with fellow believers.—Read Hebrews 10:24, 25.
You can come near to God if you make friends with people who love God. The meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses provide opportunities to benefit from the faith of others.—Read Romans 1:11, 12.
 4. How can you draw close to God?
You can draw close to Jehovah by meditating on what you have learned from his Word. Contemplate his activities, his directions, and his promises. Prayerful meditation builds heart appreciation for God’s love and wisdom.—Read Joshua 1:8; Psalm 1:1-3.
You can be close to God only if you trust in him, if you have faith in him. But faith is like a living thing that needs to be sustained. You must constantly feed your faith by reviewing the basis for your beliefs.—Read 1 Thessalonians 5:21; Hebrews 11:1, 6.
 5. How will drawing close to God benefit you?
Jehovah cares for those who love him. He protects them from anything that could jeopardize their faith and their hope of everlasting life. (Psalm 91:1, 2, 7-10) He warns us against ways of life that threaten our health and happiness. Jehovah teaches us the best way of life.—Read Psalm 73:27, 28; James 4:4, 8.

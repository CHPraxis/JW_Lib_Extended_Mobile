<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT is how Dr. Jason BeDuhn describes <em>The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures. </em>He explains:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I have just completed teaching a course for the Religious Studies Department of Indiana University, Bloomington, [U.S.A.] . . . This is primarily a course in the Gospels. Your help came in the form of copies of <em>The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures </em>which my students used as one of the textbooks for the class. These small volumes were invaluable to the course and very popular with my students.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Why does Dr. BeDuhn use the <em>Kingdom Interlinear </em>translation in his college courses? He answers: “Simply put, it is the best interlinear New Testament available. I am a trained scholar of the Bible, familiar with the texts and tools in use in modern biblical studies, and, by the way, not a member of the Jehovah’s Witnesses. But I know a quality publication when I see one, and your ‘New World Bible Translation Committee’ has done its job well. Your interlinear English rendering is accurate and consistent to an extreme that forces the reader to come to terms with the linguistic, cultural, and conceptual gaps between the Greek-speaking world and our own. Your ‘New World Translation’ is a high quality, literal translation that avoids traditional glosses in its faithfulness to the Greek. It is, in many ways, superior to the most successful translations in use today.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures </em>is published by Jehovah’s Witnesses to help lovers of God’s Word get acquainted with the original Greek text of the Bible. It contains <em>The New Testament in the Original Greek </em>on the left-hand side of the page (compiled by B. F. Westcott and F. J. A. Hort). A literal word-for-word English translation is found under the lines of Greek text. In the narrow right-hand column is the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>which allows you to compare the interlinear translation with a modern English translation of the Bible.</p>

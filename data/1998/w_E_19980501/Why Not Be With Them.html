<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">NDJAUKUA ULIMBA is 73 years old, and last year he went on a journey of some 280 miles <strong>[450 km]</strong>. He walked the entire distance, and it took him 16 days.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This elderly gentleman made his long journey in order to attend one of the annual conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses. After the convention, overjoyed and spiritually strengthened, he walked home again—another 16 days. Was it worth the effort? Yes, indeed! Ndjaukua Ulimba has made this journey annually for some years.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This African man was one of more than 15 million from over 230 lands who attended the conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses last year. Most, of course, did not have to walk for days to the convention location. The majority arrived by car, bus, train, or airplane. Were you one of them?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In 1998, conventions will again be held around the world, mostly during summer months (or during the dry season). If health permits, Ndjaukua Ulimba will likely make the same long walk in order to attend. He and millions of others will hear a practical, faith-strengthening, and invigorating program. For all who attend, the convention will be a highlight of the year. You too are warmly invited to attend. Jehovah’s Witnesses in your locality will be happy to tell you the location of the convention nearest you.</p>

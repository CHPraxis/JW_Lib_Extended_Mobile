Jehovah Gives Power Beyond What Is Normal
1 A precious privilege of sacred service​—the Christian ministry—​has been entrusted to all of Jesus’ disciples. (Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20) But human imperfection and the pressures of this system of things may at times cause us to view ourselves as being quite inadequate.
2 When this happens we can be comforted by the apostle Paul’s letter to anointed Christians in Corinth. He wrote: “We have this treasure in earthen vessels.” (2 Cor. 4:7) Paul was confident: “Since we have this ministry . . . , we do not give up.” (2 Cor. 4:1) True, it is a challenge for every one of us, whether anointed or of the “other sheep,” to keep on declaring the good news and “not give up.” We need strength from God, who supplies “the power beyond what is normal.”​—John 10:16; 2 Cor. 4:7b.
3 Encouragingly, many Witnesses are zealous evangelizers despite having to contend with bitter opposition, serious health problems, or limited finances. All of us must realize that our assignment to preach has Jehovah’s backing. Rather than let discouragement or apprehension weaken our resolve to preach, let us “go on acquiring power in the Lord and in the mightiness of his strength.”​—Eph. 6:10; Prov. 24:10.
4 How to Acquire God’s Power: Persevere in prayer, asking for God’s help and strength. (Rom. 12:12; Phil. 4:6, 7) Then, with all your heart, trust in Jehovah to provide power beyond what is normal. (Prov. 3:5) Read the modern-day life stories in our magazines, for they give evidence that Jehovah is helping his servants today to endure trials. Keep close to the brothers in the congregation, and do not forsake the congregation meetings.​—Rom. 1:11, 12; Heb. 10:24, 25.
5 May we do all that we can to put ourselves in line to receive Jehovah’s power​—a power that is beyond what is normal and that will help us not give up in the all-important work of Kingdom preaching.

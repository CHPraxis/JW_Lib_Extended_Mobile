<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Prepare Now to Uphold God’s Law on Blood. Qualified elder discusses importance of filling out both the Advance Medical Directive/​Release card and the Society’s health-care power of attorney form. Inspired direction at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7</a> shows that <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a> is an expression of God’s perfect law on blood. Loyal worshipers strive to uphold that law. These documents make known your determination to do so and speak for you when you are unable to speak for yourself. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:3</a>.) A new card provides a current declaration of your refusal to take blood. Following this meeting, baptized Witnesses who desire to have a new card will be given one, and those with unbaptized minor children will receive an Identity Card for each child. These cards are not to be filled out tonight. They should be filled out carefully at home but NOT signed. Signing, witnessing, and dating of all cards will be done after the next Congregation Book Study, under the supervision of the book study conductor. This will ensure that all assigned to his group who want to execute this medical directive have the needed assistance. Those signing as witnesses should actually see the cardholder sign the document. Anyone missing at that time and who desires to fill out and sign a card will be assisted by conductors/​elders at the next Service Meeting until all baptized publishers have their cards properly completed. (Review letter of October 15, 1991.) By adapting language from this card to their own circumstances and convictions, unbaptized publishers may write out their own directive to use for themselves and their children. The durable power of attorney form on the other hand is a more comprehensive document and, since it is based on state statutory law, is respected by medical and legal personnel. (Refer as needed to the January 1997 sheet entitled “Information About the Society’s Health-Care Durable Power of Attorney Forms” and the Question Box in the December 1995 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry.</em>) For the best legal protection, it is recommended that both documents be filled out. On the front of the Advance Medical Directive/​Release card write, preferably in your own hand: “I have also executed a health-care power of attorney.”</p>

Acts of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Modern Times
Japan
Japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. It is known for the gracious manners of its people. It is also known as an industrial giant. And among Jehovah’s Witnesses, it has a reputation of having one of the highest proportions of Witnesses who are pioneer ministers. Learn why as you read this interesting report.
Martinique
Shackles of slavery have had a profound effect on the history of Martinique. But for half a century, a message of freedom has been announced there with increasing intensity. As you read this account, you will get to know the people of Martinique—their thinking, their customs, and their way of life. Learn how Bible truth has affected all of these.

The language spoken is not always Spanish. Most of the people speak Guarani. Others speak languages of Europe or of Asia. How is the good news reaching them?

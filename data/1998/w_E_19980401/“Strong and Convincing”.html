<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“STARTING tomorrow, I am going to use it in the preaching work, for the arguments it contains are really strong and convincing,” wrote one of Jehovah’s Witnesses from France. A Witness from the United States wrote: “I read it immediately and cannot wait to use it in the field ministry, as we meet so many people who are apathetic and who put no trust in the Bible.” What were they describing? The 32-page brochure entitled <em>A Book for All People, </em>which was released by the Watch Tower Society at the “Faith in God’s Word” District Conventions held during 1997/98.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This publication was prepared with a particular audience in mind—those who may be educated but who know very little about the Bible. Many such individuals have definite opinions about the Bible, although they have personally never read it. The purpose of the brochure is to convince the reader that, at the very least, the Bible is worthy of examination. The brochure does not push the reader to accept the view that the Bible is inspired of God. Instead, it lets the facts speak for themselves. The wording is not high-sounding but is clear and straightforward.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As the above-quoted comments indicate, those present at the conventions were eager to use this brochure in their field ministry. For example, in France a special witnessing campaign was organized for August 23 and 24 when hundreds of thousands of young visitors from around the world gathered in Paris for World Youth Day. About 2,500 Witnesses (mostly from 16 to 30 years of age) placed 18,000 copies of the brochure in English, French, German, Italian, Polish, and Spanish.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">By all means, let us use this brochure, <em>A Book for All People, </em>in our ministry. May this publication prove valuable in convincing reasonable people that they should examine the Bible for themselves.</p>

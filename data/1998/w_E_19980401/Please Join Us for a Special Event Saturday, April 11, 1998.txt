Please Join Us for a Special Event Saturday, April 11, 1998
JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES warmly invite you to remember with them God’s gift of his Son, Jesus Christ. This gift opened to humankind the prospect of enjoying everlasting life on earth.—John 3:16.
This year the Memorial of Jesus’ death will be observed after sundown on Saturday, April 11. That date corresponds to Nisan 14 on the Bible’s lunar calendar. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact meeting place and time.

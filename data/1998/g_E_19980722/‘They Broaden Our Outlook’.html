<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Your books and brochures help us very much in teaching English, German, Russian, Kyrgyz and Turkic languages under the conditions in today’s social and economic chaos. . . . Your brochures are in popular demand by those studying practical translation . . . Thank you for the books <em>Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?, The Secret of Family Happiness, </em>and <em>Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“We have many Jehovah’s Witnesses among the students. They read the <em>Awake! </em>articles with interest and use them when given homework.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The writer especially singled out <em>Awake! </em>for praise: “Thank you for the interesting and informative articles. . . .

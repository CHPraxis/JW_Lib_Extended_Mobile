‘They Broaden Our Outlook’
The head of the foreign-languages department at the Karakol Institute of Management in Kyrgyzstan, a former republic of the Soviet Union, praised the publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses. He wrote the following to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia:
“Your books and brochures help us very much in teaching English, German, Russian, Kyrgyz and Turkic languages under the conditions in today’s social and economic chaos. . . . Your brochures are in popular demand by those studying practical translation . . . Thank you for the books Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?, The Secret of Family Happiness, and Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work.
“We have many Jehovah’s Witnesses among the students. They read the Awake! articles with interest and use them when given homework.”
The writer especially singled out Awake! for praise: “Thank you for the interesting and informative articles. . . . They instill hope in us and broaden our general outlook. . . . All of us read with pleasure the section of Awake! ‘Watching the World.’”
If you would like to receive a copy of Awake! or would like to have one of Jehovah’s Witnesses call at your home to discuss the Bible with you, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address on page 5.

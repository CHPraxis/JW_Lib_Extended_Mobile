<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IF YOU were traveling on an unfamiliar road or pathway, would you view signposts as a hindrance? Not likely! Surely you would view them as an aid to help you from straying off the route leading to your destination.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What, though, of traveling life’s road? Can it be successfully negotiated without signposts? An ancient prophet of God acknowledged mankind’s limitations in this regard. He said: “I know, O LORD, that man’s ways are not of his own choosing; nor is it for a man to determine his course in life.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jeremiah 10:23</a>, <em>The New English Bible.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Where, then, can the needed direction be found? The reliable source of such guidance is man’s Creator, and the figurative signposts are to be found in the Bible. Jehovah, by means of his Word, says: “Your own ears will hear a word behind you saying: ‘This is the way. Walk in it, you people,’ in case you people should go to the right or in case you should go to the left.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:21-23:30:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 30:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Yes, God’s Word gives reliable guidance in every aspect of our life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>) Sadly, however, the majority of mankind travel life’s path independent of divine direction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:13-40:7:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 7:13</a>) Still, the signposts are immovably set in place! Will you pay heed to them as you walk life’s road?</p>

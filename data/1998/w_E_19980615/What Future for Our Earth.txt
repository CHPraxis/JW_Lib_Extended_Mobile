What Future for Our Earth?
“No other century on record equals the 20th in uncivilized civil violence, in the number of conflicts waged, the hordes of refugees created, the millions of people killed in wars, and the vast expenditures for ‘defense,’” states World Military and Social Expenditures 1996. Will this situation ever change?
The apostle Peter reminded Christians of a promise made by God centuries earlier: “There are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to [God’s] promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.” (2 Peter 3:13) Such words were originally part of the prophecy of Isaiah. (Isaiah 65:17; 66:22) Ancient Israel experienced an initial fulfillment when the nation was restored to its promised land after being held captive in Babylon for 70 years. By reiterating the promise of “new heavens and a new earth,” Peter showed that the prophecy would yet be fulfilled on an even grander scale—worldwide!
The establishment of righteous conditions in the whole earth is God’s will, and it will be brought about by his heavenly Kingdom with Christ as King. “Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore.” (Isaiah 2:4) Such complete peace and security on earth is what Jesus taught his followers to expect and to pray for in what is commonly called the Our Father, or Lord’s Prayer, saying: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.”—Matthew 6:9, 10.
Would you enjoy living in a world that is as righteous as heaven is? That is the hope that the Bible holds out to everyone who wholeheartedly seeks to know God and live according to his righteous ways.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Getting to the Meetings on Time. Discussion among two or three Congregation Book Study conductors or ministerial servants about the problem of arriving late for meetings. They acknowledge that unusual situations, including emergencies, weather conditions, traffic, and so forth, can cause anyone to be delayed. However, some are chronically late. In a positive way, the group discusses and illustrates what is needed to be punctual: (1) wholehearted appreciation for the privilege of attending meetings and for the spiritual food and association that are provided there, (2) good advance planning and organization of personal affairs, (3) willing cooperation among family members, (4) leaving early and allowing time for unexpected problems, and (5) being genuinely concerned not to cause distractions for others in attendance. All agree that this problem of arriving late can be remedied by putting forth a consistent effort to improve.</p>

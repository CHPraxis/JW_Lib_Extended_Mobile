Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 1999
Instructions
During 1999 the following will be the arrangements when conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.
SOURCE MATERIAL: The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures [bi12], The Watchtower [w], Awake! [g], “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” (1990 Edition) [si], The Secret of Family Happiness [fy], and Insight on the Scriptures Volume 2 [it-2] will be the basis for assignments.
The school should begin ON TIME with song, prayer, and remarks of welcome and then proceed as follows:
ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 15 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant, and it will be based on The Watchtower, Awake!, or “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” When based on The Watchtower or Awake!, this assignment should be delivered as a 15-minute instruction talk with no oral review; when based on the “All Scripture” book, it should be delivered as a 10- to 12-minute instruction talk with a 3- to 5-minute oral review following, using the printed questions in the publication. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the practical value of the information being discussed, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation. The theme shown should be used.
The brothers assigned this talk should be careful to keep within the time limit. If they are given private counsel, appropriate notations should be made on their speech counsel slip.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 6 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant who will effectively apply the material to local needs. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. A 30- to 60-second overall review of the assigned chapters may be included. The principal objective, however, is to help the audience to appreciate why and how the information is of value to us. The students will then be dismissed to their various classrooms by the school overseer.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 2: 5 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material to be given by a brother. This will apply in the main school as well as in the auxiliary groups. The reading assignments are usually short enough to permit the students to present brief explanatory information in the opening and concluding remarks. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, and application of principles may be included. All the assigned verses should be read without a break. Of course, when the verses to be read are not consecutive, the student may cite the verse where the reading continues.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 3: 5 minutes. This will be assigned to a sister. The subject for this presentation will be based on The Secret of Family Happiness or Insight on the Scriptures, Volume 2. (See Assignment No. 4 for information on how to develop the material based on a Bible character.) The setting may be an informal witness, a return visit, a home Bible study, or some other feature of field service. In some cases, it may include a parent sharing information with a minor child. The participants may be either seated or standing. The school overseer will be particularly interested in the way the student helps the householder or child to reason on the material and understand how the scriptures are applied. The student assigned this part should know how to read. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but an additional assistant may be used. The student may determine whether to have the householder read certain paragraphs when considering the Family Happiness book. Not the setting but the effective use of the material should be given prime consideration.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 4: 5 minutes. When this assignment is based on information dealing with a Bible character, it will be assigned to a brother or a sister. When it is based on the Family Happiness book, it will be assigned to a brother. For each assignment a theme is set forth in the schedule. When this assignment is based on a Bible character, information can be found in Insight on the Scriptures, Volume 2, under his name. The student should study Scriptural references in the material in order to get a clear picture of the Bible character​—the events of his life, as well as his personality, traits, and attitude. Thereafter, the student should develop the assigned theme for this presentation and select appropriate scriptures to be used. Additional scriptures that highlight Bible principles that tie in with the theme may be included. The purpose of considering a Bible character is to show what can be learned from his example. Acts of faithfulness, courage, humility, and unselfishness furnish good examples to be followed; unfaithful acts as well as undesirable traits stand as strong warnings to turn Christians away from an improper course. When assigned to a brother, this talk should be given with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind. When a sister is given this part, it should be presented as outlined for Assignment No. 3.
*SUPPLEMENTAL BIBLE-READING SCHEDULE: This is set forth in brackets after the song number for each week. By following this schedule, reading about ten pages a week, the entire Bible can be read in three years. No parts on the school program or the written review are based on the supplemental reading schedule.
NOTE: For additional information and instruction regarding counsel, timing, written reviews, and the preparation of assignments, please see page 3 of the October 1996 Our Kingdom Ministry.

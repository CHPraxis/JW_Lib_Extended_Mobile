<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Nearly 20 years ago, Dr. Alvin Silverstein wrote in his book <em>Conquest of Death: </em>“We will unravel the essence of life. We will understand . . . how a person ages.” He even predicted: “There will be no more ‘old’ people, for the knowledge that will permit the conquest of death will also bring eternal youth.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">More recently, an article in <em>The New York Times Magazine </em>of September 28, 1997, reported on the “life extension” optimism shared by a number of health-conscious people who are enthusiastic about the potential of today’s technology. “I really believe we could be the first generation that lives forever,” said one enthusiast. Another was said to be “blithely confident . . . that genetic augmentation techniques will become available in time to save [this generation] by halting aging, maybe reversing it.” Does such optimism surprise you?</p>

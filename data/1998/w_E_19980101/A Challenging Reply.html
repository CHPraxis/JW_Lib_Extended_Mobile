<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE <em>Catholic Herald, </em>a British Roman Catholic newspaper, recently published the following letter from a reader in Wales: “One night, two Jehovah’s Witnesses came to my door. I managed to say that it was the Catholic Church that guaranteed the authenticity of the New Testament they quoted. To my surprise, one of them agreed. ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘you guarantee it but you don’t follow it. Jesus said, “love one another as I have loved you,” but you kill one another. In the last war, Catholics killed Catholics, but no Jehovah’s Witness killed a [fellow] Witness.’ What could I do but agree? How can we pray for unity with our ‘separated brethren’ when there is no real unity among ourselves? Should we not first correct this scandal?”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:12-43:15:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 15:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The two world wars of this 20th century both started in Christendom and claimed some 50 million to 60 million lives. It can truthfully be said, though, that Jehovah’s Witnesses took no part in those wars, nor are they involved in any of the conflicts currently taking place. How is this possible? You owe it to yourself to find out more about the powerful bonds of Christian love and unity that over five million Jehovah’s Witnesses have worldwide.—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:4-23:2:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:4</a>.</p>

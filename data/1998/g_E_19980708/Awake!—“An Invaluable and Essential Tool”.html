<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“THANK YOU for your article entitled ‘RSD—A Puzzling, Painful Disorder,’ in the September 8, 1997, issue. As a court reporter, I am often called upon to record testimony on many diverse and complex issues. Recently I reported the deposition of an anesthesiologist specializing in pain management. The entire subject matter of the testimony was RSD [Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy]. Because of regularly reading <em>Awake!, </em>I was immediately familiar with the terminology and treatment methods, which were all clearly explained in the September issue. I was later able to share this article with some of the attorneys involved in the case.</p>

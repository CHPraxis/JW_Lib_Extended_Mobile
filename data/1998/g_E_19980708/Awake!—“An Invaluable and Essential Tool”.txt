Awake!—“An Invaluable and Essential Tool”
“THANK YOU for your article entitled ‘RSD—A Puzzling, Painful Disorder,’ in the September 8, 1997, issue. As a court reporter, I am often called upon to record testimony on many diverse and complex issues. Recently I reported the deposition of an anesthesiologist specializing in pain management. The entire subject matter of the testimony was RSD [Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy]. Because of regularly reading Awake!, I was immediately familiar with the terminology and treatment methods, which were all clearly explained in the September issue. I was later able to share this article with some of the attorneys involved in the case.
“I consider Awake! to be an invaluable and essential tool in my continuing education. It keeps me well-informed on a myriad of subjects.—G. M. A.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>How Did Our Universe Get Here?—The Controversy</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">ASTRONAUTS thrill to photograph the earth as it looms large through the window of a spacecraft. “That’s the best part of flying in space,” said one. But our earth seems very small when compared with the solar system. The sun could hold a million earths inside, with room to spare! However, could such facts about the universe have any bearing on your life and its meaning?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Let us take a brief mental trip into space to see our earth and sun in perspective. Our sun is just one of an awesome number of stars in a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy,<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> which itself is just a tiny part of the universe. With the naked eye, it is possible to see a few smudges of light that actually are other galaxies, such as the beautiful and larger Andromeda. The Milky Way, Andromeda, and some 20 other galaxies are bound gravitationally into a cluster, all of these being only a small neighborhood in a vast supercluster. The universe contains countless superclusters, and the picture does not end there.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The clusters are not evenly distributed in space. On a grand scale, they look like thin sheets and filaments around vast bubblelike voids. Some features are so long and wide that they resemble great walls. <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>This may surprise many who think that our universe created itself in a chance cosmic explosion. “The more clearly we can see the universe in all its glorious detail,” concludes a senior writer for <em>Scientific American, </em>“the more difficult it will be for us to explain with a simple theory how it came to be that way.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Evidence Pointing to a Beginning</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">All the individual stars you see are in the Milky Way galaxy. Until the 1920’s, that seemed to be the only galaxy. You probably know, though, that observations with larger telescopes have since proved otherwise. Our universe contains at least 50,000,000,000 galaxies. We do not mean 50 billion <em>stars</em>—but at least 50 billion <em>galaxies, </em>each with billions of stars like our sun. Yet it was not the staggering quantity of huge galaxies that shook scientific beliefs in the 1920’s. It was that they are all in motion.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Astronomers discovered a remarkable fact: When galactic light was passed through a prism, the light waves were seen to be stretched, indicating motion away from us at great speed. The more distant a galaxy, the faster it appeared to be receding. That points to an expanding universe!<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>Even if we are neither professional astronomers nor amateurs, we can see that an expanding universe would have profound implications about our past—and perhaps our personal future too. Something must have started the process—a force powerful enough to overcome the immense gravity of the entire universe. You have good reason to ask, ‘What could be the source of such dynamic energy?’</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Although most scientists trace the universe back <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>to a very small, dense beginning (a singularity), we cannot avoid this key issue: “If at some point in the past, the Universe was once close to a singular state of infinitely small size and infinite density, we have to ask what was there before and what was outside the Universe. . . . We have to face the problem of a Beginning.”—Sir Bernard Lovell.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">This implies more than just a source of vast energy. Foresight and intelligence are also needed <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>because the rate of expansion seems very finely tuned. “If the Universe had expanded one million millionth part faster,” said Lovell, “then all the material in the Universe would have dispersed by now. . . . And if it had been a million millionth part slower, then gravitational forces would have caused the Universe to collapse within the first thousand million years or so of its existence. Again, there would have been no long-lived stars and no life.”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>Attempts to Explain the Beginning</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Can experts now explain the origin of the universe? Many scientists, uncomfortable with the idea that the universe was created by a higher intelligence, <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>speculate that by some mechanism it created itself out of nothing. Does that sound reasonable to you? Such speculations usually involve some variation of a theory (inflationary universe model)<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> conceived in 1979 by physicist Alan Guth. Yet, more recently, Dr. Guth admitted that his theory “does <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>not explain how the universe arose from nothing.” Dr. Andrei Linde was more explicit in a <em>Scientific American </em>article: “Explaining this initial singularity—where and when it all began—still remains the most intractable problem of modern cosmology.”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">If experts cannot really explain either the origin or the early development of our universe, should we not look elsewhere for an explanation? Indeed, you have valid reasons to consider some evidence that many have overlooked but that may give you real insight on this issue. The evidence includes the precise measurements of four fundamental forces that are responsible for all properties and changes affecting matter. At the mere mention of fundamental forces, some may hesitate, thinking, ‘That’s solely for physicists.’ Not so. The basic facts are worth considering because they affect us.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span><strong>Fine-Tuning</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The four fundamental forces come into play both in the vastness of the cosmos and in the infinite smallness of atomic structures. Yes, everything we see around us is involved.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Elements vital for our life (particularly carbon, oxygen, and iron) could not exist were it not for the fine-tuning of the four forces evident in the universe. We already mentioned one force, <em>gravity. </em>Another is the <em>electromagnetic force. </em>If it were significantly weaker, electrons would not be held around the nucleus of an atom. ‘Would that be serious?’ some might wonder. Yes, because atoms could not combine to form molecules. Conversely, if this force were much stronger, electrons would be trapped on the nucleus of an atom. There could be no chemical reactions between atoms—meaning no life. Even from this standpoint, it is clear that our existence and life depend on the fine-tuning of the electromagnetic force.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>And consider the cosmic scale: A slight difference in the electromagnetic force would affect the sun and thus alter the light reaching the earth, making photosynthesis in plants difficult or impossible. It could also rob water of its unique properties, which are vital for life. So again, the precise tuning of the electromagnetic force determines whether we live or not.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Equally vital is the intensity of the electromagnetic force in relation to the other three. For example, some physicists figure this force to be 10,000,- 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (10<sup>40</sup>) <em>times </em>that of gravity. It might seem a small change to that number to add one more zero (10<sup>41</sup>). Yet that would mean that gravity is proportionally <em>weaker, </em>and Dr. Reinhard Breuer comments on the resulting situation: “With lower gravity the stars would be smaller, and the pressure of gravity in their interiors would not drive the temperature high enough for nuclear fusion reactions to get under way: the sun would be unable to shine.” You can imagine what that would mean for us!</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">What if gravity were <em>stronger </em>proportionately, so that the number had only 39 zeros (10<sup>39</sup>)? “With just this tiny adjustment,” continues Breuer, “a star like the sun would find its life expectancy sharply reduced.” And other scientists consider the fine-tuning to be even more precise.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Indeed, two remarkable qualities of our sun and other stars are long-term efficiency and stability. Consider a simple illustration. We know that to run efficiently, an automobile engine needs a critical ratio between fuel and air; engineers design complex <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>mechanical and computer systems to optimize performance. If that is so with a mere engine, what of the efficiently “burning” stars such as our sun? The key forces involved are precisely tuned, optimized for life. Did that precision just happen? The ancient man Job was asked: “Did you proclaim the rules that govern the heavens, or determine the laws of nature on earth?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:33-18:38:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:33</a>, <em>The New English Bible</em>) No human did. So from where does the precision come?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>The Two Nuclear Forces</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The structure of the universe involves much more than fine-tuning just gravity and the <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>electromagnetic force. Two other physical forces also relate to our life.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">These two forces operate in the nucleus of an atom, and they give ample evidence of forethought. Consider the <em>strong nuclear force, </em>which glues protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of the atom. Because of this bonding, various elements can form—light ones (such as helium and oxygen) and heavy ones (such as gold and lead). It seems that if this binding force were a mere 2-percent weaker, only hydrogen would exist. Conversely, if this force were slightly stronger, only heavier elements, but no hydrogen, could be found. Would our lives be affected? Well, if the universe lacked hydrogen, our sun would not have the fuel it needs to radiate life-giving energy. And, of course, we would have no water or food, since hydrogen is an essential ingredient of both.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>The fourth force in this discussion, called the <em>weak nuclear force, </em>controls radioactive decay. It also affects thermonuclear activity in our sun. ‘Is this force fine-tuned?’ you might ask. Mathematician and physicist Freeman Dyson explains: “The weak [force] is millions of times weaker than the nuclear force. It is just weak enough so that the hydrogen in the sun burns at a slow and steady rate. If the weak [force] were much stronger or much weaker, any forms of life dependent on sunlike stars would again be in difficulties.” Yes, this precise rate of burning keeps our earth warm—but not incinerated—and keeps us alive.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Furthermore, scientists believe that the weak force plays a role in supernova explosions, which they give as the mechanism for producing and distributing most elements. “If those nuclear forces were in any way slightly different from the way they actually are, the stars would be incapable of making the elements of which you and I are composed,” explains physicist John Polkinghorne.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">More could be said, but you likely understand the point. There is an amazing degree of fine-tuning in these four fundamental forces. “All around us, we seem to see evidence that nature got it just right,” wrote Professor Paul Davies. Yes, the precise tuning of the fundamental forces has made possible the existence and operation of our sun, our delightful planet with its life-sustaining water, our atmosphere so vital for life, and a vast array of precious chemical elements on earth. But ask yourself, ‘Why such precise tuning, and from where?’</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span><strong>Earth’s Ideal Features</strong></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Our existence requires precision in other respects as well. Consider the earth’s measurements and its position relative to the rest of our solar system. The Bible book of Job contains these humbling questions: “Where did you happen to be when I founded the earth? . . . Who set its measurements, in case you know?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:4-18:38:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 38:4, 5</a>) As never before, those questions beg for answers. Why? Because of the amazing things that have been discovered about our earth—including its size and its position in our solar system.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">No planet like earth has been found elsewhere in the universe. True, some scientists point to indirect evidence that certain stars have orbiting them objects that are hundreds of times larger than the earth. Our earth, though, is just the right size for our existence. In what sense? If earth were slightly larger, its gravity would be stronger and hydrogen, a light gas, would collect, being unable to escape the earth’s gravity. Thus, the atmosphere would be inhospitable to life. On the other hand, if our earth were slightly smaller, life-sustaining oxygen would <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>escape and surface water would evaporate. In either case, we could not live.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">The earth is also at an ideal distance from the sun, a factor vital for life to thrive. Astronomer John Barrow and mathematician Frank Tipler studied “the ratio of the Earth’s radius and distance from the Sun.” They concluded that human life would not exist “were this ratio slightly different from what it is observed to be.” Professor David L. Block notes: “Calculations show that had the earth been situated only 5 per cent closer to the sun, a runaway greenhouse effect [overheating of the earth] would have occurred about 4 000 million years ago. If, on the other hand, the earth were placed only 1 per cent further from the sun, runaway glaciation [huge sheets of ice covering much of the globe] would have occurred some 2 000 million years ago.”—<em>Our Universe: Accident or Design?</em></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">To the above precision, you can add the fact that the earth rotates on its axis once a day, the right speed to produce moderate temperatures. Venus takes 243 days to rotate. Just think if the earth took as long! We could not survive the extreme temperatures resulting from such long days and nights.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Another vital detail is our earth’s path around the sun. Comets have a wide elliptic path. Thankfully, this is not so with the earth. Its orbit is almost circular. Again, this prevents us from experiencing death-dealing extremes of temperature.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Nor should we ignore the location of our solar system. Were it nearer the center of the Milky Way galaxy, the gravitational effect of neighboring stars would distort the orbit of the earth. In contrast, <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>were it situated at the very edge of our galaxy, the night sky would be all but devoid of stars. Starlight is not essential to life, but does it not add great beauty to our night sky? And based on current concepts of the universe, scientists have calculated that at the edges of the Milky Way, there would not have been enough of the needed chemical elements to form a solar system like ours.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span></p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="ss"><strong>Law and Order</strong></p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">From personal experience, you likely know that all things tend toward disorder. As any homeowner has observed, when left to themselves, things tend to break down or disintegrate. Scientists refer <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>to this tendency as “the second law of thermodynamics.” We can see this law at work daily. If left alone, a new automobile or bicycle will become scrap. Abandon a building and it will become a ruin. What about the universe? The law applies there too. So you might think that the order throughout the universe should give way to complete disorder.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">However, this does not seem to be happening to the universe, as Professor of Mathematics Roger Penrose discovered when he studied the state of disorderliness (or, entropy) of the observable universe. A logical way to interpret such findings is to conclude that the universe started off in an ordered state and is still highly organized. Astrophysicist Alan Lightman noted that scientists “find it mysterious that the universe was created in such a highly ordered condition.” He added that “any successful theory of cosmology should ultimately explain this entropy problem”—why the universe has not become chaotic.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">In fact, our existence is contrary to this recognized law. So why is it that we are alive here on earth? As previously noted, that is a basic question that we should want answered.</p>

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sc">  It is estimated that the Milky Way galaxy has more than 100,000,000,000 (100 billion) stars. Picture an encyclopedia devoting one page to each of these stars—our sun and the rest of our solar system would be limited to one page.

If the encyclopedia contained a page for each of these stars, it would not fit on all the library shelves on earth. “The more we know about the universe,” notes the book, “the more we come to see how little we know.”</p>

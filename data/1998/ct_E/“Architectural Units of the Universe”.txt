“Architectural Units of the Universe”
That is how a modern encyclopedia of science describes the chemical elements. There is amazing variety among the elements of our earth; some of them are rare; others are abundant. Elements such as gold may attract the human eye. Others are gases that we do not even see, such as nitrogen and oxygen. Each element is made of a certain kind of atom. How the atoms are constructed and relate to one another bespeaks economy and awesome organization in chartlike order.
About 300 years ago, only 12 elements were known—antimony, arsenic, bismuth, carbon, copper, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver, sulfur, and tin. As more were discovered, scientists noticed that the elements reflected a distinct order. Because there were gaps in the order, scientists such as Mendeleyev, Ramsay, Moseley, and Bohr theorized the existence of unknown elements and their characteristics. Those elements were subsequently discovered just as predicted. Why could those scientists predict that there were forms of matter that were unknown at the time?
Well, the elements follow a natural numerical order based on the structure of their atoms. This is a proven law. Thus, school textbooks can set out a periodic table of elements in rows and columns—hydrogen, helium, and so on.
The McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science & Technology observes: “Few systemizations in the history of science can rival the periodic concept as a broad revelation of the order of the physical world. . . . Whatever new elements may be discovered in the future, it is certain they will find a place in the periodic system, conforming to its order and exhibiting the proper familial characteristics.”
When the elements are arranged in the rows and columns of the periodic table, a remarkable relationship is seen between elements that share a column. For example, in the last column are located helium (No. 2), neon (No. 10), argon (No. 18), krypton (No. 36), xenon (No. 54), and radon (No. 86). These are gases that glow brightly when an electric discharge passes through them, and they are used in some light bulbs. Also, they do not react easily with various elements, as do some other gases.
Yes, the universe—even down to its atomic particles—reveals astonishing harmony and order. What is responsible for such order, harmony, and variety among the building blocks of the universe?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A woman from the North Island of New Zealand wrote concerning the book <em>The Secret of Family Happiness: </em>“When I first sat down to study the publication, I felt as if my marriage was at a point where I could either ‘make it or break it.’”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">She explained her background. “My mother had been through two very abusive marriages. As a result, we were always taught that men were nothing and that they were only out to oppress women. So I grew up a very stubborn, headstrong woman who would not back down from an argument.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The woman recognized the need for changes. “I realized that because of not being in subjection to my husband and because I was too proud, I was giving up the chance for family happiness.” So she made vital adjustments, as she explains: “My husband and I are now studying the book as a family, and I’m still learning how to be a Christian wife. We are very happy with where we are now but still have a long way to go.</p>

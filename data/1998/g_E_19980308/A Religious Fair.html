<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IT WAS in February 1995 that reports began to circulate regarding what was thought to be a modern-day miracle: A statue of the Madonna in Civitavecchia was supposedly observed crying tears of blood. Since that time, Catholics from all over the world have made a pilgrimage to see the statue for themselves.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Yet, according to the newspaper <em>La Repubblica, </em>many Catholics are irritated by the “atmosphere of a fair” surrounding the tourist site. Even a number of theologians are uneasy about the masses who are flocking to venerate the statue. For example, Luigi Pizzolato, a teacher at the Catholic University of Milan, criticizes the church for being content with an “emotionally aroused” faith. He notes that the fruitage that is being produced by this so-called miracle is “spoiled by superstition.” Another theologian, Carlo Molari, reminds us that “in the New Testament, a certain Simon Magus uses extraordinary powers for his own ends—to make money, we would say today.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:9-44:8:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 8:9-24</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jesus warned his disciples to beware of those who would perform “great signs and wonders.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:24-40:24:24" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 24</a>) Even when such signs seem authentic, a Christian’s faith cannot be based on supposed miracles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:1-58:11:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 6</a>) Rather, it is by acquiring accurate knowledge of God’s Word and applying its counsel that a solid faith may be attained. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 17:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:10-45:10:10" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Romans 10:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:17-45:10:17" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:16</a>) Would you like to have that kind of faith? Why not let Jehovah’s Witnesses help you the next time they call?</p>

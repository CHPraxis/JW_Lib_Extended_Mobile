Help for a Collapsing Marriage
A woman from the North Island of New Zealand wrote concerning the book The Secret of Family Happiness: “When I first sat down to study the publication, I felt as if my marriage was at a point where I could either ‘make it or break it.’”
She explained her background. “My mother had been through two very abusive marriages. As a result, we were always taught that men were nothing and that they were only out to oppress women. So I grew up a very stubborn, headstrong woman who would not back down from an argument.”
The woman recognized the need for changes. “I realized that because of not being in subjection to my husband and because I was too proud, I was giving up the chance for family happiness.” So she made vital adjustments, as she explains: “My husband and I are now studying the book as a family, and I’m still learning how to be a Christian wife. We are very happy with where we are now but still have a long way to go.
“Our home has never been as loving and peaceful as it is today.”

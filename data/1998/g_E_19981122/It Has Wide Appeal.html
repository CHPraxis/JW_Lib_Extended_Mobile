<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“THE brochure you publish <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>was very good. I’m only ten years old, but I understand it, and it was easy to read. I followed it very well, and when I got to lesson 16, I didn’t want to read it at first because I liked the brochure so much. I wanted there to be more.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The brochure, the cover of which you see reproduced here, was not published for children only. Yet the material is presented in such a clear, simple way that children can understand the basic teachings of the Bible and the kind of conduct that God requires of us. For example, the brochure answers such questions as: How should we view lying? Is gambling proper? Is it wrong to get drunk? Is it proper for unmarried people to have sex relations?</p>

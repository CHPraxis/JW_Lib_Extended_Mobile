If It Gets Results, Use It!
1 Our Kingdom Ministry continually provides us with a variety of suggested presentations for use in the ministry. This gives us fresh ideas on how to create interest in the Kingdom message. It may be that you make an effort each month to learn one or more of these presentations. However, some publishers may find that by the time they have used one of them a few times, another issue of Our Kingdom Ministry provides new presentations. Obviously it may not be possible for everyone to learn a new presentation before mastering a previous one.
2 There are, of course, thousands of pioneers and other publishers who spend much time in field service. Furthermore, many congregations work their entire territory every few weeks. In these circumstances, publishers appreciate having new approaches and ideas for presenting the message. This helps them to enhance their skills. It also makes their ministry more interesting and fruitful and helps them to meet the challenges encountered.
3 In any case, if you have prepared a presentation that works well in cultivating interest, by all means continue to use it! It is not necessary to discontinue using an effective presentation that is getting results. Simply adapt it to the literature offer for the current month. As you review the suggestions offered in Our Kingdom Ministry, look for interesting points that you may wish to work into your presentation.
4 So when you receive a new issue of Our Kingdom Ministry, remember that the presentations it contains are simply suggestions. If you can use them, fine. But if you have already found a presentation that gets results in your territory, use it! The important thing is to “fully accomplish your ministry” in a fine manner, finding the deserving ones and helping them to become disciples.​—2 Tim. 4:5.

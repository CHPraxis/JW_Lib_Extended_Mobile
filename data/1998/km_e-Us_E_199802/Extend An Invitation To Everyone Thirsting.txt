Extend An Invitation To Everyone Thirsting
1 As foretold by the prophet Amos, the human family today is suffering from “a thirst, not for water, but for hearing the words of Jehovah.” (Amos 8:11) To help people in this spiritually parched condition, we tell them about God’s provisions for recovering obedient humans from sin and death, which are depicted in the last chapter of Revelation as being “a river of water of life.” We have the privilege of extending to everyone thirsting for righteousness an invitation to “take life’s water free.” (Rev. 22:1, 17) How can we do this during February? By offering to those who are genuinely interested the book Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! You may want to try these presentations:
2 Since many people are concerned about health matters, you might find this approach effective:
▪ “Many are concerned about the rising cost of quality health care. Perhaps you have given this matter some thought. [Allow for response.] Is there a permanent solution to this problem? [Wait for a response.] Here is a wonderful prospect.” Read Revelation 22:1, 2. Then open the Revelation Climax book to the illustration on pages 308-9, and use paragraph 22 on page 311 to explain it. Conclude by saying: “This publication discusses every verse in Revelation.” If the householder shows genuine interest, offer the book, giving him an opportunity to make a donation to the worldwide work. Make arrangements to return.
3 When making the return visit, you could resume your discussion by saying:
▪ “The last time I was here, we talked about a permanent solution to health problems. Do you think the time will ever come when no one will be sick? [Allow for response.] Notice this striking statement.” Read Isaiah 33:24. Then open to lesson 5 in the Require brochure, and discuss paragraphs 5-6, asking the corresponding questions at the start of the lesson and looking up a few of the cited scriptures. Mention that the removal of sickness and death is part of the fulfillment of God’s original purpose for the earth. Arrange to return to discuss paragraphs 1-4 and 7 in the same lesson.
4 If a current news item involving an untimely death has been on people’s minds, you might try this approach:
▪ “You may have heard about [mention the news item]. When lives are tragically cut short, many wonder what comfort can be offered to the families of the victims. What do you think?” Allow for response. Then open to page 299 in the Revelation Climax book, and show the resurrection scene that is illustrated. Continue by saying: “Many are surprised to learn that both righteous and unrighteous people will be brought back to life in Paradise on earth. [Read Acts 24:15 as quoted in paragraph 9 on page 297, and then give the explanation found in paragraph 10.] This book discusses many other interesting details about God’s purpose for the future. If you would like to learn more about it, you may have this copy.” Make arrangements to return, taking note of the individual’s specific interests and concerns.
5 When you call again, tailor your presentation to the householder. Perhaps you could say:
▪ “The last time we spoke, I appreciated a comment you made about God’s purpose for the earth. [Repeat the comment.] I located some material I think you will find interesting.” Open the Require brochure to lesson 5. Read and discuss as many paragraphs in that lesson as seem to hold the householder’s attention. After setting a time to return to continue the lesson, give the householder a handbill outlining the meeting times of the congregation. Explain about the Public Meeting, and invite him to attend.
6 If you prefer a simplified presentation that features a tract, you could say this:
▪ “I would like you to have this tract entitled What Hope for Dead Loved Ones?” Hand it to the householder, and invite him to follow along as you read the first paragraph. Allow him to respond to the question raised in the last sentence. Read the second paragraph, and then open to the illustration on page 299 in the Revelation Climax book. Continue by saying: “This book gives more details about the resurrection and the rest of the Bible’s wonderful promises for the future. If you will read it, you may have this copy.” Give the householder the opportunity to make a donation to the worldwide work, and arrange for a return visit.
7 Our extending an appealing invitation to others may cause them to come to the waters of life, which Jehovah is now making available. Therefore, let us say to everyone thirsting, “Come!”​—Rev. 22:17.

A Russian Girl’s Hope
A 15-year-old girl in Ukhta, Russia, a city of over 100,000 population more than 800 miles [1,200 km] northeast of Moscow, expressed an earnest desire for better conditions on earth. She explained this in the following letter to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia:
“My friend told me that the book The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived describes the life of Jesus Christ. I am very interested in your books, magazines, and brochures. Let me explain how this interest developed. It came about at the telegraph office when I went to pay the radio and telephone bills. There I found a tract on the floor. I picked it up, shook off the dirt, and began to read the tract, which was entitled Why Is Life So Full of Problems?
“I read about the troubles and suffering that people have, and the cover of the tract illustrated the promise of a new life in Paradise. I hope that someday it will come. I really want to see all people happy, satisfied, and healthy and also to see dead relatives. . . . I would like to know what I should do in order to have the hope of living in the earthly Paradise. I beg you to send me some information or books. I would pay for them and the cost of mailing.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A 15-year-old girl in Ukhta, Russia, a city of over 100,000 population more than 800 miles <strong>[1,200 km] </strong>northeast of Moscow, expressed an earnest desire for better conditions on earth. She explained this in the following letter to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“My friend told me that the book <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived </em>describes the life of Jesus Christ. I am very interested in your books, magazines, and brochures. Let me explain how this interest developed. It came about at the telegraph office when I went to pay the radio and telephone bills. There I found a tract on the floor. I picked it up, shook off the dirt, and began to read the tract, which was entitled <em>Why Is Life So Full of Problems?</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I read about the troubles and suffering that people have, and the cover of the tract illustrated the promise of a new life in Paradise. I hope that someday it will come. I really want to see all people happy, satisfied, and healthy and also to see dead relatives. . . . I would like to know what I should do in order to have the hope of living in the earthly Paradise. I beg you to send me some information or books. I would pay for them and the cost of mailing.”</p>

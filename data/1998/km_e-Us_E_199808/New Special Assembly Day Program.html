<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The provision of special assembly days began in 1987. These one-day gatherings have proved to be upbuilding for Jehovah’s servants and for interested ones who attend. Beginning in September 1998, a new special assembly day program will be presented. You will find the nine talks and numerous interviews and experiences to be spiritually beneficial.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Show Appreciation for Jehovah’s Table” is the theme of the new program. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:14-23:65:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 65:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:21-46:10:21" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 10:21</a>) It will strengthen our resolve that our worship of Jehovah must take foremost place in our lives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:4-19:27:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 27:4</a>) The circuit overseer’s part will deal with “Examining the Inclinations of Our Hearts” toward meeting attendance. A guest speaker will show us how to “Maintain Spirituality by Feeding at Jehovah’s Table.” Practical encouragement will also be given to young people in Jehovah’s organization to maintain steadfastness in serving God. The visiting speaker’s main discourse, entitled “Spiritually Fortified to Give a Bold Witness,” will show how the provisions made through the congregation equip us to witness boldly about the Kingdom. Who would not want to benefit from this program?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Newly dedicated ones who wish to be baptized should inform the presiding overseer as soon as possible. We are confident that as we begin the 12th year of the special assembly day arrangement, everyone attending will be spiritually uplifted for the work ahead.</p>

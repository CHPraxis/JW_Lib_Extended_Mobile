<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Each congregation will receive three Literature Inventory forms (S(d)-18). The congregation secretary should meet with the literature servant early in August and set a date for taking inventory of the congregation’s stock of literature at the end of the month. An actual count must be made of all literature in stock, and the totals are to be entered on the Literature Inventory form. The total number of magazines on hand can be obtained from the magazine servant. <em>Please mail the original to the Society no later than September 6. </em>Keep a carbon copy for your files. The third copy may be used as a work sheet. The inventory should be supervised by the secretary, and the completed form should be checked by the presiding overseer. The secretary and the presiding overseer will sign the form.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ The Congregation Service Committee should give <em>prompt </em>attention to all applications for regular pioneer service. The service committee should not hold an application to see if the one applying is able to meet the hour requirement. The appointment date may be automatically changed on applications received after the requested date. Retroactive appointments are not made unless there are significant extenuating circumstances. If such circumstances exist, a letter should accompany the application.​—See the August 1986 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>insert, paragraphs 24-6.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">COYOTES are a major threat to the livelihood of sheep ranchers in the western United States. In 1996 alone, federal trappers killed more than 82,000 coyotes, and since 1990, more than 600,000 have been killed. But some sheep raisers have discovered another way of protecting their flocks. They have imported llamas from South America.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The llama is related to the camel. In fact, earlier this year a male camel was reportedly crossbred with a female llama, which gave birth to an animal that resembles its father. The llama may weigh about 250 pounds and averages four feet high <strong>[120 cm] </strong>at the shoulder. It has long hair that is usually white but can also be brown or black. But more important to sheep raisers, the llama takes an interest in sheep and runs off coyotes.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“He kicks at them and swings his head,” explains sheep raiser Becky Weed. “We haven’t lost a sheep to coyotes in four years.” But acknowledging that the llama is not the perfect solution, Weed noted: “We had a bear in our flock and lost four sheep.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A group of environmental-minded sheep raisers have formed the Growers’ Wool Cooperative. This is a consortium that sells what is promoted as “predator friendly” wool, that is, wool from sheep raisers who employ nonlethal means of predator control. Besides llamas, guard dogs and burros are also used to safeguard the sheep.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Growers’ Wool Cooperative has contracted with home-based knitters to manufacture wool apparel. A premium price is charged for this wool, and the sweaters, hats, blankets, and other items made from it also cost more. Will people pay the extra for these items? “People do when I tell them the kind of ranch it came from,” explained a Chatham, New York, store owner. “People like it because there’s a story behind the sweater.”</p>

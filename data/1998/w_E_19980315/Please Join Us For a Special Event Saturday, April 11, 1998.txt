Please Join Us For a Special Event Saturday, April 11, 1998
JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES warmly invite you to remember with them God’s gift of his Son, Jesus Christ. This gift opened up to mankind the prospect of enjoying everlasting life.—John 3:16.
This year the Memorial of Jesus’ death will be observed after sundown on Saturday, April 11. That date corresponds to Nisan 14 of the Bible’s lunar calendar. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for meeting place and exact time.
Do you know about these events that occurred during Jesus’ last days on earth?

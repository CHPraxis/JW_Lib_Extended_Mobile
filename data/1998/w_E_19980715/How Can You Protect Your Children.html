<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AFTER attending a neighborhood school for years, Werner<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> began advanced studies along with about 3,000 other youths in São Paulo, Brazil. For the first time, he observed fellow students selling and using drugs. Being of small stature, he soon became a victim of degrading and risky initiation rites by older students.</p>

Because of a decline in the quality of family life and an increase in poverty, in many lands the number of children who live on the streets is increasing. Child labor is a result of a failure to protect young ones from exploitation. Drug abuse also destroys many young ones. For example, when a certain Brazilian teenager became a drug addict, peace disappeared from his home. Besides the emotional strain experienced by his parents, there was the struggle to finance his recovery, and pitiless narcotics dealers came to their door demanding payment.</p>

This is a noble endeavor, but is it enough? What about protection from emotional and spiritual harm? Many realize that successful parenting includes the tackling of challenges that involve their children’s choice of friends and recreation. Yet, how can parents avoid being either overprotective or too permissive? You are invited to consider the answers found in the following article.</p>

An “Example of Union and Brotherhood”
That is how one woman described the actions of Jehovah’s Witnesses after she suffered the distressing loss of a family member. She explains:
“On behalf of my family and myself, I would like to thank the Witnesses of the Italian congregation in Freiburg, Germany. With the exception of my brother Antonio and his wife, Anna, my family are not Jehovah’s Witnesses. We have long criticized their religious choice, though we have always respected it.
“Now, however, we have to change our minds. In fact, we have experienced an example of brotherhood and love that we would never have expected.
“Sadly, Anna died prematurely in a road accident. Since we live in Italy, we were able to stay close to my brother Antonio and his children only up to a certain point. His Witness brothers have stepped in though. They have helped him with their presence, their words, their faith, their physical, moral, and economic support. Since I cannot thank the congregation personally, I would like to thank them through your magazine for their example of union and brotherhood that we will not forget.”
This woman’s kind remarks are appreciated. As she observed, Jehovah’s Witnesses are an international brotherhood. (1 Peter 2:17) They cultivate strong ties of affection among themselves, knowing that love “is a perfect bond of union.” (Colossians 3:14) Even in the most tragic of circumstances, which can befall all of us, Jehovah’s Witnesses stick close to God and his people.—Proverbs 18:24; Ecclesiastes 9:11; John 13:34, 35.

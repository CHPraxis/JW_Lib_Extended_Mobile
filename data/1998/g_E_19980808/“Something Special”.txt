“Something Special”
After reading the book The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, a book that attempts to present every event in Jesus’ earthly life that is set forth in the four Gospels, a 70-year-old woman in Moscow, Russia, exclaimed: “I have never read such literature. I want to know more about God and Jesus Christ and even to study the Bible.”
The branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia often receives such letters regarding Bible literature. A similar letter was sent by a woman in Chelyabinsk, a city of well over a million people about a thousand miles [1,500 km] southeast of Moscow.
She said of The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived: “The book is something special. It instills in people a hope for a happy future and helps them to know about ancient history. Before I came into contact with this book, I never thought about God and I was never interested in religion, but now I want to be baptized. I want to study your literature very much. I want to speak about the things I have read with my friends, acquaintances, relatives.”
You too can receive literature that can help you to learn more about Jesus and the Bible-based hope of life in a new world. If you would like to receive a copy of the book The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived or would like to have someone call at your home to conduct a free home Bible study with you, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address on page 5.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Polls show that many Americans believe that the first humans were directly created by God and not by a process of evolution from primitive life-forms. But why do so many science teachers in America promote mindless, chance evolution as fact? One reason is that “Darwinist fundamentalists . . . control the science departments in many universities,” says Phillip E. Johnson, law professor at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Johnson points out: “In some cases biology professors have been forbidden to tell students that there is any reason to doubt the claim that mindless material processes could and did create the wonders of biology.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Scientist and engineer Murphy O’Dean observes: “Rather than discard a theory that does not stand up to fact, the direction of ‘evolutionary science’ has become a statement of faith that ‘evolution must be true.’” Conflicting evidence and the lack of evidence are either ignored or explained away.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Why? Michael Behe, molecular biologist, says in <em>Darwin’s Black Box: </em>“Many people, including many important and well-respected scientists, just don’t <em>want </em>there to be anything beyond nature. They don’t want a supernatural being to affect nature.” But true science does not ignore contrary evidence in order to advance preferred ideas. Nor do all scientists believe evolution.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Brazilian magazine <em>Veja </em>asked Carlo Rubbia, winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics, “Do you believe in God?” While not acknowledging a personal God, he did admit: “The more you observe nature, the more you perceive that there is tremendous organization in all things. It is an intelligence so great that just by observing natural phenomena I come to the conclusion that a Creator exists.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">His observations remind us of the apostle Paul’s words regarding God: “His invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 1:20</a>.</p>

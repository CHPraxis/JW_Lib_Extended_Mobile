<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Young boys and girls, are you familiar with Jehovah’s command that you be included in the activities of the congregation? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:12-5:31:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 31:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:3-19:127:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps. 127:3</a>) It is a joy to have you beside us as we worship Jehovah together! You warm our hearts when you sit quietly at the meetings and listen closely. It makes us especially happy when you try to comment in your own words. The entire congregation is delighted when you present assigned parts on the Theocratic Ministry School, when you eagerly join us in the field service, and when we hear that you boldly witness to your schoolmates and teachers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:12-19:148:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 148:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>We want you to know that we take pride in you when we see your good manners, your neat appearance, your clean conduct, and your respect for adults. Our joy is especially great when you show that you are ‘remembering your Grand Creator’ by setting theocratic goals for yourselves.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:1-21:12:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ps. 110:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Tell Us Your Goals: </strong>One eight-year-old boy told a district overseer: ‘First I would like to be baptized, then I would like to help in the congregation by serving with the sound and handling microphones, being an attendant, helping with the literature, reading at book studies and <em>Watchtower </em>Studies. Then I would like to be a ministerial servant, then an elder. I would also like to be a pioneer and go to pioneer school. Then I would like to go to Bethel, be a circuit overseer or a district overseer.’ What fine appreciation he showed for the privilege of serving God!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>As you progress physically and spiritually, we rejoice to see you reach your goals. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:52-42:2:52" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 2:52</a>.) Each year, thousands of you become unbaptized publishers and then qualify for baptism as dedicated servants of Jehovah. Our joy grows when we next see you reach out to auxiliary pioneer and even enter the full-time service. Truly, children, you are our joy and a wonderful source of praise to our heavenly Father. May Jehovah richly bless you!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:24-20:23:25" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. 23:24, 25</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Though man has searched for ways to slow down the aging process and extend his life span, old age and death are still inevitable. How thankful we are that the Bible explains <em>why </em>humans grow old and die, as well as <em>how </em>the ravages of old age will be reversed and death will be eliminated. These truths are convincingly presented in the book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>The book clearly answers perplexing questions about life and death, directing the reader to the time when Paradise will be restored.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>In March we will offer the <em>Knowledge </em>book with the goal of starting home Bible studies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) Then we will make return visits on all those who manifest interest in the Kingdom message. In this way we may instill in others the hope of everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:2-56:1:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Titus 1:2</a>) To accomplish this, you may find the following suggestions helpful.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>When making the initial call, you might ask this question:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“Have you ever wondered why humans yearn for a longer life? [Allow for response.] Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Muslims, and others all have hope of a life after death.” Open the <a class="xt" data-xtid="26" href="jwpub://p/E:1101995017/"><em>Knowledge </em>book to chapter 6</a>, “Why Do We Grow Old and Die?,” and read paragraph 3. Reason on the cited scriptures. Referring to the two questions at the end of the paragraph, ask the householder if he would like to see the answers for himself. If he is desirous of that, continue discussing the next few paragraphs. A study is being started! Otherwise, leave the book for him to read, and make plans to return, preferably within a day or two, to discuss the answers.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>When following up a placement of the “Knowledge” book, you could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“I’ve returned to consider the two questions about death that we left unanswered.” Remind the householder of the questions. Then discuss the information in chapter 6 under the subheading “A Sinister Plot.” Depending on the circumstances, either continue the study or use the last question at the end of paragraph 7 to lay the groundwork for the next session. Make definite plans to return. Give the householder a handbill, and briefly describe how congregation meetings are held. Warmly invite him to attend.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>In either door-to-door work or informal witnessing, you might initiate a conversation by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“Have you ever wondered what the future holds for us and for the earth? [Allow for response.] The Bible sums up the future in one word​—Paradise! It explains that in the beginning, God made a portion of the earth into a beautiful paradise where he put the human couple whom he had created. They were to populate the whole earth, gradually transforming it into a paradise. Notice this description of what it must have been like.” Open the <a class="xt" data-xtid="27" href="jwpub://p/E:1101995012/13-13"><em>Knowledge </em>book to page 8, and read paragraph 9</a>, under the subheading “Life in Paradise.” Then discuss the points in paragraph 10, and read the cited scripture, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:10-23:55:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:10, 11</a>. Offer to continue the discussion of what life in the restored Paradise will be like and to cover paragraphs 11-16 together. Or encourage the person to read it on his own, and arrange to meet again and discuss it.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong><em>If a study was not established initially, you could try to do so on the return visit by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong>“As we discussed in our last conversation, it is God’s purpose that the entire earth be transformed into a paradise. That raises the question, What will Paradise be like?” Open the <a class="xt" data-xtid="28" href="jwpub://p/E:1101995012/"><em>Knowledge </em>book to chapter 1</a>, and study paragraphs 11-16, under the subheading “Life in the Restored Paradise.” Afterward show the illustration on pages 4-5, and ask the person if he would like to live in such beautiful surroundings. Then read the first sentence of paragraph 17 on page 10. Depending on the circumstances, either continue the study or say that on your next visit you will explain what is required in order for someone to live in the restored Paradise. Leave a handbill, explain the meeting schedule, and warmly invite the person to attend at the Kingdom Hall.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>The <em>Knowledge </em>book is an excellent tool to use in revealing to others “the everlasting life” promised by God. Your conducting home Bible studies with people can instill in them this grand hope that is inspired by the God “who cannot lie.”</p>

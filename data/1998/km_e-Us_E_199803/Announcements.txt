The names of all who are approved to auxiliary pioneer should be announced to the congregation.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on March 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make announcement to the congregation when this has been done.
▪ Those associated with a congregation should send all new and renewal subscriptions for The Watchtower and Awake!, including their personal subscriptions, through the congregation.
▪ The Society does not fill individual publishers’ requests for literature.

Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.

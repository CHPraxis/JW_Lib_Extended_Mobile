A Moscow Teacher Helped by Awake!
A teacher wrote the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia to say that she plans to use articles from Awake! in her school classes. She explained:
“I feel that Awake! helps me to find new power to live, restores my spirit, and frees me from depressing thoughts. I am thankful to you for the wonderful articles about man’s struggle with microbes [February 22, 1996, issue]. I am sure that your magazines bring goodness to every home that has them.” She added: “I would very much like to receive Awake! . . . Your magazine can without a doubt help me.”
A similar letter, received from Stavropol, a city of over a quarter of a million population, situated more than 700 miles southeast of Moscow, reads: “I would like to order the Awake! Not long ago I received two copies of this magazine. The articles showed an understanding of the problems people face. Some described facts that were new to me. This is the first time I have come across such a realistic description of things.”
If you would enjoy receiving another copy of Awake! or would like to have someone call at your home to discuss the Bible with you, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address on page 5.

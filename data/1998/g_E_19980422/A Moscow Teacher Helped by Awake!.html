<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A teacher wrote the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia to say that she plans to use articles from <em>Awake! </em>in her school classes. She explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I feel that <em>Awake! </em>helps me to find new power to live, restores my spirit, and frees me from depressing thoughts. I am thankful to you for the wonderful articles about man’s struggle with microbes [February 22, 1996, issue]. I am sure that your magazines bring goodness to every home that has them.” She added: “I would very much like to receive <em>Awake! </em>. . . Your magazine can without a doubt help me.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A similar letter, received from Stavropol, a city of over a quarter of a million population, situated more than 700 miles southeast of Moscow, reads: “I would like to order the <em>Awake! </em>Not long ago I received two copies of this magazine. The articles showed an understanding of the problems people face. Some described facts that were new to me. This is the first time I have come across such a realistic description of things.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If you would enjoy receiving another copy of <em>Awake! </em>or would like to have someone call at your home to discuss the Bible with you, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address on page 5.</p>

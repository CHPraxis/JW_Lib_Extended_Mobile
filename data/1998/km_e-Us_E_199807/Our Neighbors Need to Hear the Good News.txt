Our Neighbors Need to Hear the Good News
1 It is God’s will “that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) “All sorts of men” would include all our neighbors. Reaching them with the good news requires being versatile in our presentations and concerned about what may be of interest to each person we meet. (1 Cor. 9:19-23) Jehovah’s organization has provided tools that can help us to reach the hearts of those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.” (Acts 13:48) Let us see how we can use a variety of brochures during July and August to address the spiritual needs of our neighbors.
2 Featured Brochures: Listed below you will find suggestions that might be useful when presenting certain brochures. Each suggestion includes (1) a thought-provoking question for starting a conversation, (2) a reference where talking points can be found in the brochure, and (3) an appropriate scripture that could be read during the discussion. You can fill in the rest of the presentation in your own words, according to the person’s response. For most of the brochures, a previous issue of Our Kingdom Ministry is cited where you will find a more detailed presentation for the brochure.

3 Other Brochures: The February 1998 Our Kingdom Ministry insert lists other publications, including brochures, that are specially designed for use in witnessing to Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, and Muslims. Wherever appropriate, these brochures may be offered to the people we meet. You can review the suggestions on pages 4-6 of that insert along with pages 21-4 in the Reasoning book and develop brief presentations that may arouse the interest of these people.
4 Another brochure has been prepared to help people who may be well educated but know little about the Bible. It is designed to move them to want to look into God’s Word. Where appropriate, you may choose to offer the following:
A Book for All People.
Would you agree that acquiring a well-rounded education includes getting some knowledge of what the Bible contains?​—Page 3, paragraphs 1-3 and page 30, paragraph 2; Eccl. 12:9, 10.
5 Bible Study Brochure: Our objective in the ministry should always be to start a Bible study, either on the initial call or on a subsequent return visit. To that end, we have the following easy-to-use brochure for starting and conducting home Bible studies:
What Does God Require of Us?
Did you know that in 30 minutes or less each week for 16 weeks, you can acquire a basic understanding of the Bible?​—Lesson 2, paragraph 6; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; km 3/97 p. 4.
6 In the illustration of the neighborly Samaritan, Jesus made it obvious that a real neighbor is one who exercises love and kindness to help another in distress. (Luke 10:27-37) Our neighbors are in spiritual distress. They need to hear the good news. Let us shoulder the responsibility to share it with them, thus proving ourselves genuine disciples of Jesus Christ.​—Matt. 24:14; Gal. 5:14.

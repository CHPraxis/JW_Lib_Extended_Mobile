<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>It is God’s will “that all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:4-54:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:4</a>) “All sorts of men” would include all our neighbors. Reaching them with the good news requires being versatile in our presentations and concerned about what may be of interest to each person we meet. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:19-46:9:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 9:19-23</a>) Jehovah’s organization has provided tools that can help us to reach the hearts of those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 13:48</a>) Let us see how we can use a variety of brochures during July and August to address the spiritual needs of our neighbors.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Featured Brochures: </strong>Listed below you will find suggestions that might be useful when presenting certain brochures. Each suggestion includes (1) a thought-provoking <em>question </em>for starting a conversation, (2) a <em>reference </em>where talking points can be found in the brochure, and (3) an appropriate <em>scripture </em>that could be read during the discussion. You can fill in the rest of the presentation in your own words, according to the person’s response. For most of the brochures, a previous issue of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>is cited where you will find a more detailed presentation for the brochure.</p>

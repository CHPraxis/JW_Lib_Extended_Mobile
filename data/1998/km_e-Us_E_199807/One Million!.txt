One Million!
That is the number of publishers we would like to see reporting in the United States for August 1998. Do we have the potential to reach it? Yes, we do! Our current tally of congregations in the 48 contiguous states shows a total of 1,019,518 publishers. However, the all-time peak that reported in any one month was 975,829, in August 1996. How can we surpass that record number? It can be done if each publisher in the congregation makes definite arrangements to participate in the ministry during August and promptly reports that activity. Since the first two days of the month are a Saturday and a Sunday, why not make plans to share in the field service starting that weekend? If you will be attending a convention, you may be able to do some informal witnessing in the convention city and then share in field service with the congregation the following weekend. By getting an early start in the month, we will not fail to spend some time in the witness work during August. With united effort, we should see a new all-time peak of publishers that exceeds the 1,000,000 mark for the first time ever in the United States. What a shout of praise that will be to Jehovah!​—Ps. 47:1.

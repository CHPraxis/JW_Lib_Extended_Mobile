<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Keep God’s Commandments and Live” is the theme of the two-day circuit assembly program beginning in September. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:4-20:4:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 4:4</a>) It will emphasize <em>why </em>obeying God’s commands is not burdensome. Furthermore, it will show <em>how </em>the doing of God’s will brings refreshment and true happiness as well as hope for the future.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:28-40:11:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 11:28-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:17-43:13:17" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> John 13:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Those who in obedience to Christ’s command wish to be baptized at the assembly should speak with the presiding overseer, and he will make the necessary arrangements.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A symposium will explain practical ways that we can show love for God and for our brothers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:3</a>) Heart-stirring counsel from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:0-19:19:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalms 19 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:176" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 119</a> will be included in the program. Although the inspired admonition in these psalms was written thousands of years ago, we will see how it benefits us personally today.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The public talk to be given by the district overseer is entitled “Fear God and Keep His Commandments.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:13-21:12:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:13</a>) The circuit overseer’s final talk will show how youths can get the best out of life now and why they can have confidence in an everlasting future. The district overseer concludes the program by enumerating the many benefits that come from living by “the kingly law” of love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:8-59:2:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jas. 2:8</a>) Indeed, this is an assembly program that no one will want to miss!</p>

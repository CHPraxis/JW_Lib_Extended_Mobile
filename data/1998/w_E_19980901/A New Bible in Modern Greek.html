<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AUGUST 23, 1997, was a special day for those gathered at the “Faith in God’s Word” District Convention in Greece. At the close of the afternoon session, a new Bible was released—the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </em>in modern Greek. The surprised audience responded at once with tears of joy and a lengthy standing ovation!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Since 1905, Jehovah’s Witnesses had been using a 19th-century Bible translation that was produced by a Greek Orthodox clergyman. This Bible served them well for many years. For some time, though, Jehovah’s Witnesses felt the need for a Bible translation that was more accurate and easier to understand. In 1993, they were happy to receive a Greek version of the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures. </em>Now, however, they were overjoyed to have the entire Bible in modern Greek.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">One appreciative Witness called the <em>New World Translation </em>“a poem, a soft breeze carrying Jehovah’s voice, which for the first time, we can understand clearly in our own language.” Some began reading their new Bible as soon as they got home. One excited conventioner did not put down his Bible until one o’clock in the morning, when he had finished reading the entire book of Job!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures </em>in Greek is the result of some seven years of painstaking work. One letter that was received said: “You can rest assured that the <em>New World Translation </em>is going to assist us greatly in helping sincere people to learn about Jehovah.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">More and more people are overwhelmed by the problems and complex questions facing them today. How should we view lying? Is gambling proper? What about dabbling in spiritism? How should we view abortion? Is it wrong to get drunk or for unmarried people to have sex relations?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The questions go on and on. And they affect not only our life but the lives of our loved ones as well. People want answers that will benefit them. One such person, from Mississippi, in the United States, wrote to the Watch Tower Society:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“In the back of your book entitled <em>The Secret of Family Happiness, </em>I ran across a printed question asking if I would welcome more information or a free home Bible study. Indeed, I would!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Ever since the summer of 1995, I have been reading and studying my Bible. I try with my very best effort to take the Bible’s understanding to a level that I myself can use for my spiritual purposes and, better yet, for teaching others. If you are saying that you are sending free information, I’m all for it!”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">If you too would like to receive a copy of the 192-page book <em>The Secret of Family Happiness </em>or would like to have someone conduct a free home Bible study with you, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address on page 5.</p>

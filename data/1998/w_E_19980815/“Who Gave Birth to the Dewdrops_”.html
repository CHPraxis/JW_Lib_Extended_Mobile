<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A 19TH-CENTURY journalist described dewdrops as “earth’s liquid jewelry, wrought of the air.” Our Creator asked the ancient patriarch Job: “Who gave birth to the dewdrops?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:28-18:38:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:28</a>) God was reminding Job of the divine origin of the precious dew.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Apart from its glistening, jewellike beauty, dew is associated in the Bible with blessing, fertility, abundance, and the preservation of life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:27:28-1:27:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 27:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:13-5:33:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 33:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:28-5:33:28" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:8:12-38:8:12" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Zechariah 8:12</a>) During Israel’s hot, rainless season, “the dew of Hermon” preserved the land’s vegetation, and therefore its people. Mount Hermon’s forested and snowy heights still produce night vapors that condense to form abundant dew. The psalmist David compared the refreshment brought by this dew to the pleasant experience of dwelling in unity with fellow worshipers of Jehovah.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:133:3-19:133:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 133:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The prophet Moses’ instructions to Israel were gentle and refreshing, like dewdrops. He said: “My saying will trickle as the dew, as gentle rains upon grass and as copious showers upon vegetation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:2-5:32:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>) Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses are declaring the life-giving good news about God’s Kingdom to the ends of the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) God is extending the invitation: “‘Come!’ And let anyone thirsting come; let anyone that wishes take life’s water free.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 22:17</a>) Millions of people of all nations are accepting this offer of spiritual refreshment from God, which can sustain life eternally.</p>

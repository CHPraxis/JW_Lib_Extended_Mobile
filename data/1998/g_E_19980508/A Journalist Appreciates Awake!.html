<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The following recommendation appeared in the <em>High Country News </em>of October 13, 1997, published in Paonia, Colorado, U.S.A.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Greenpeace [an international environmental organization] may no longer be going door to door, but another group continues its long-time canvassing, often stressing environmental issues. It distributes millions [19 million of each issue] of copies of its material in about 60 [actually 81] languages, including Pidgin, Hiligaynon and Zulu. The July 8 [1997] issue asked on its cover: ‘Who Will Save Our Animals?,’ with a story inside that talked about the accelerated rate of extinction (three per hour), the ‘biological health of the planet,’ and ecological vandalism . . . The Aug. 22, 1997, issue discussed ‘The Water Crisis: A Global Problem,’ and the effects of population growth, pollution and international tension over use of rivers . . . While the information is science-based and wide ranging, the conclusion of many of these articles is anything but mainstream environmentalism. They say that if you want to share in the rehabilitation of the earth, ‘Then please learn what God requires of you by studying the Bible.’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“The group is the Jehovah’s Witnesses, and the publication is <em>Awake! </em>If they don’t come to your door, contact the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York Inc., 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We could hardly have said it better except to add, “or write to the nearest address listed on page 5 of <em>Awake!”</em></p>

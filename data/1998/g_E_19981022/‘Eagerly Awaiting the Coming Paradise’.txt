‘Eagerly Awaiting the Coming Paradise’
That is what a 14-year-old named Aleksandr said in a letter that he wrote to the Russia branch office of the Watch Tower Society. This Russian youth had been given copies of The Watchtower and some other literature published by Jehovah’s Witnesses. In his letter he explained:
“When my parents and I traveled to Khabarovsk on the train, Jehovah’s Witnesses approached us. They told us a lot about Bible prophecies, the last days, and eternal life on the earth.”
The youth concluded: “How pleasant it is to realize that soon wickedness will come to an end and that people will live forever on earth! I eagerly await the time when the earth will be turned into a beautiful paradise. I would be very grateful if you could write to me about how Bible studies are conducted.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a 14-year-old named Aleksandr said in a letter that he wrote to the Russia branch office of the Watch Tower Society. This Russian youth had been given copies of <em>The Watchtower </em>and some other literature published by Jehovah’s Witnesses. In his letter he explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“When my parents and I traveled to Khabarovsk on the train, Jehovah’s Witnesses approached us. They told us a lot about Bible prophecies, the last days, and eternal life on the earth.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The youth concluded: “How pleasant it is to realize that soon wickedness will come to an end and that people will live forever on earth! I eagerly await the time when the earth will be turned into a beautiful paradise. I would be very grateful if you could write to me about how Bible studies are conducted.”</p>

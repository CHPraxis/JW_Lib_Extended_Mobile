<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>September: </strong><em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em><strong>October: </strong>Individual copies of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. <strong>November: </strong><em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em><strong>December: </strong><em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life </em>with the <em>New World Translation.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on September 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make announcement to the congregation when this has been done.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office when reaching 18 years of age. All those required to do so should take care of the matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. Elders will want to have this in mind and give appropriate reminders to young brothers nearing the age of 18. Questions as to the young Christian’s responsibilities in this regard may be answered by the elders.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The elders are reminded to follow through on instructions given on <a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:1991286/5:213-22:257">pages 21-3 of the April 15, 1991, <em>Watchtower</em></a><em>, </em>regarding any disfellowshipped or disassociated ones who may be inclined toward becoming reinstated.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ Those associated with a congregation should send all new and renewal subscriptions for <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!, </em>including their personal subscriptions, through the congregation.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ The Society does not fill individual publisher’s requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made <em>each month </em>before the congregation monthly request for literature is sent to the Society so that all interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature. Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ The Society has a supply of ENGLISH bound volumes of <em>The Watchtower </em>for the years 1951 to 1959. Any publishers or new congregations that desire these publications may now request them through the congregation literature servant.

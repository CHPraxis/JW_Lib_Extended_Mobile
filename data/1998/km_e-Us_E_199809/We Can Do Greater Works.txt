We Can Do Greater Works
1 Outstanding works characterized the ministry of Jesus Christ. He miraculously fed thousands, cured many, and resurrected some from the dead. (Matt. 8:1-17; 14:14-21; John 11:38-44) His activity captured the attention of an entire nation. Yet, the last evening before his death, he told his faithful followers: “He that exercises faith in me, that one also will do the works that I do; and he will do works greater than these.” (John 14:12) How can we do “greater” works?
2 By Covering More Territory: Jesus’ sphere of activity was limited to Palestine, whereas his early disciples were told to witness “to the most distant part of the earth,” far beyond where Jesus himself preached. (Acts 1:8) The preaching work that he began is now global, covering 232 lands. (Matt. 24:14) Are you having a full share in working the territory assigned to your congregation?
3 By Reaching More People: Jesus left behind relatively few disciples to continue the preaching work. However, as a result of their zealous witnessing at Pentecost 33 C.E., those who embraced the truth and were baptized that day amounted to some three thousand souls. (Acts 2:1-11, 37-41) The ingathering of those “rightly disposed for everlasting life” has continued to our time, when we are baptizing an average of over 1,000 a day. (Acts 13:48) Are you doing all you can to reach honesthearted people wherever they may be found and to follow up on the interest as soon as possible?
4 By Preaching Far Longer: Jesus’ earthly ministry was limited to three and a half years. Most of us have been preaching longer than that. Regardless of how long we will be allowed to continue this work, we are grateful to help each new disciple get started on the road leading to life. (Matt. 7:14) Are you having plenty to do every month in the work of the Lord?​—1 Cor. 15:58.
5 We can remain confident that with Jesus backing us, we will do still greater works as his true disciples.​—Matt. 28:19, 20.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The service overseer is keenly interested in everything related to the progress of the evangelizing work in the congregation’s assigned territory. He thus plays a vital role in helping us fulfill our responsibility to preach the good news. As a zealous evangelizer, he takes the lead in organizing all service-related matters. As a capable teacher, he helps individual publishers improve their effectiveness in the ministry.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:11-49:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 4:11, 12</a>.</p>

He is responsible for making sure that an ample supply of literature, magazines, and service forms are available each month for our use. Once a year he reviews the territory file for all addresses of homes where we have been advised not to call, and he assigns qualified brothers to visit these homes.</p>

He is alert to organize practical arrangements to meet for service throughout the week, including holidays. He shows genuine interest in the Bible study activity. He seeks ways to give spiritual assistance to those who become irregular or inactive in the ministry. He is actively concerned about the work of the pioneers, and he oversees the Pioneers Assist Others program.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>As a member of the Congregation Service Committee, the service overseer proposes any needed adjustments in the Congregation Book Study groups. When he visits your group, be sure to be in attendance and to share with him in field service.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>All in the congregation should willingly cooperate with the direction given by the service overseer. This will help us increase our effectiveness in the disciple-making work and find greater joy in our ministry.</p>

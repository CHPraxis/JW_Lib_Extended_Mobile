A Suggestion
September marks the seventh time that the Knowledge book is the featured offer for the month. While we have good reason to focus attention on this effective Bible study aid, please keep in mind that other Society publications provide detailed information on many subjects only briefly discussed in the Knowledge book. You can enhance your ministry by becoming familiar with all the publications your congregation has on hand and being alert to recommend them to Bible students and others who show interest in a particular subject.

A free-lance writer from Nigeria, Africa, wrote: “I am a regular reader of Awake!, although I am not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Awake! is a first-rate magazine. It is a wellspring of creative ideas for me. Its covers are eye-catching and create in an unprejudiced reader a great urge to open its pages. Each issue evidences remarkable creativity; each page, journalistic excellence. With timely and finely crafted articles, each issue is a delicious serving of valuable and invaluable information.”

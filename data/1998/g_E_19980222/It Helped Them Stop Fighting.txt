It Helped Them Stop Fighting
An 11-year-old boy from California, U.S.A., wrote to Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York:
“I love your books, especially The Secret of Family Happiness. Before we got that book, my sister and I could never stop fighting. One day we decided to study that book, and we came to realize that we were not doing what God wanted us to do.
“This book helped us a great deal. I am grateful for it, and I encourage other families to read this book because it is great. It is also helping my family to find peace and happiness in our home.”
The Secret of Family Happiness is a 192-page book that features such helpful subjects as “Protect Your Family From Destructive Influences,” “Maintain Peace in Your Household,” and “You Can Overcome Problems That Damage a Family.”

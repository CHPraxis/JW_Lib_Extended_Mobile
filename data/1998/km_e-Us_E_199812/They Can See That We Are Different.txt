They Can See That We Are Different
1 Last year, over 300,000 new ones joined us by getting baptized. What have these people seen in Jehovah’s Witnesses that causes them to want to be part of God’s organization? Why do we stand out as different from all other religions? Here are some obvious answers:
​—We stick to the Bible rather than personal opinions: We worship Jehovah God “with spirit and truth,” just as Jesus Christ said to do. This has meant rejecting religious falsehoods and complying with God’s written Word.​—John 4:23, 24; 2 Tim. 3:15-17.
​—We go to people rather than wait for them to come to us: We have accepted Christ’s commission to preach and to teach, and we imitate his example of searching out honesthearted ones. We look for them at their homes, on the street, or wherever they may be found.​—Matt. 9:35; 10:11; 28:19, 20; Acts 10:42.
​—We provide Bible instruction for everyone without charge: We freely expend our resources and energy, devoting over a billion hours each year to God’s service. Impartially, we study the Bible with all kinds of people.​—Matt. 10:8; Acts 10:34, 35; Rev. 22:17.
​—We are well trained to help people spiritually: By means of our personal study of the Bible and the instruction provided at congregation meetings, assemblies, and conventions, we receive a priceless, ongoing theocratic education, which enables us to enlighten others spiritually.​—Isa. 54:13; 2 Tim. 2:15; 1 Pet. 3:15.
​—We take the truth seriously, applying it in our daily lives: Because of our love for God, we make changes, bringing our lives into harmony with his will. Our Christlike new personality attracts others to the truth.​—Col. 3:9, 10; Jas. 1:22, 25; 1 John 5:3.
​—We endeavor to live and work with others in peace: Cultivating godly qualities helps us to guard our actions and speech. We “seek peace and pursue it” with all persons.​—1 Pet. 3:10, 11; Eph. 4:1-3.
2 The examples of Christian living that people see in Jehovah’s organization motivate many to accept the truth. May our personal example have the same effect upon those who know and observe us.

Cardiac Surgeon Congratulates Awake!
Awake! of December 8, 1996, featured a series of articles entitled “Heart Attack—What Can Be Done?” Professor Thomas Stegmann, one of Germany’s leading heart-transplant surgeons and head of a thoracic and cardiovascular department, read the articles and wrote to the publishers as follows:
“I read with interest your report on the topic of heart disease and, in particular, heart attacks. As an expert in this field, I feel moved to tell you that your explanation of heart attacks and your information on the subject were very good—showing, on the one hand, much understanding for the individual patient with heart disease and, on the other hand, a correct account of the medical facts. The explanation provides a good overall view and sound information. Your attaching special importance to the early recognition of heart attack symptoms was also important.
“Despite the concerted efforts of medical science and society in general, arteriosclerosis—and especially the heart attack—is the most common cause of death in Western countries. As a cardiac surgeon who deals with serious changes in coronary arteriosclerosis (hardening, constriction, vascular occlusions) on a daily basis and who treats these diseases by means of various techniques of cardiac surgery, I know how important a well-founded and factual explanation is to the population—and also to the potential patient.
“Allow me to offer my warm congratulations on your portrayal of this subject—combined with the hope that your article will be made available to as many people as possible.”

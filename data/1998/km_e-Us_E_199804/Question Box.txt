â–ª What can we do to help improve the effectiveness of our meetings?
Some may be inclined to feel that the elders and ministerial servants are solely responsible for the success of congregation meetings because they conduct them and handle most of the parts. Really, all of us can contribute personally toward interesting and beneficial meetings. We can help make the meetings more effective in the following ten ways:
Prepare in advance. When we prepare well, the meetings capture our interest. When all of us do this, the meetings are livelier and more upbuilding. Attend regularly. A high attendance is more encouraging to everyone present, strengthening appreciation for the importance of attending. Arrive on time. If seated before the program starts, we can join in the opening song and prayer and thus receive full benefit from the meeting. Come well equipped. By bringing our Bible and the publication(s) used during the meeting, we can follow along and better grasp what is being discussed. Avoid distractions. We may listen better when we sit up front. Whispering and trips to the rest room can cause us and others to lose concentration. Be a participant. When more of us raise our hands and comment, more are encouraged and built up by the expressions of faith. Make brief comments. This gives as many as possible an opportunity to share. We should confine our brief comments to the material being studied. Fulfill assignments. As students in the Theocratic Ministry School or as participants in the Service Meeting, prepare well, rehearse in advance, and try not to cancel. Commend participants. Tell others how much their efforts are appreciated. This builds them up and motivates them to do even better in the future. Encourage one another. Kind greetings and upbuilding conversations before and after meetings add to the pleasure and benefits that we derive from attending the meetings.

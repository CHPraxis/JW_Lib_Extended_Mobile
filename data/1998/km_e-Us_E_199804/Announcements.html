<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ When working unassigned territory, publishers may offer the <em>Knowledge </em>book or the <em>Require </em>brochure. Any other publication may be offered if the householder already has these two publications. All should carry a variety of tracts for not-at-homes or individuals who do not accept literature. Any <em>Kingdom News </em>No. 35 that publishers or congregations still have on hand should be left with householders. Efforts should be made to follow up interest, especially where unassigned territories may be worked by special pioneers or are accessible to nearby congregations.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ With five full weekends, the month of May is a convenient time for many to auxiliary pioneer.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Beginning in April, convention badge cards for 1998 in Chinese, English, French, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese will automatically be included with literature shipments. It will not be necessary to request these. If additional badge cards are needed by the congregations, these should be requested on a Literature Request Form (S-14). It is necessary to request plastic badge card holders for any in the congregation who desire them.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ A 1997 edition of <em>Watchtower Library </em>on CD-ROM has been prepared in nine languages. For the first time, this valuable research tool will also be available in Danish, Dutch, French, Japanese (requires Japanese version of Windows), and Portuguese; these will contain publications released from 1980 to 1997. The starting date of publications is 1970 for editions in English (<em>Watchtower </em>from 1950), German, Italian, and Spanish. Congregations may begin submitting requests for <em>Watchtower Library​—1997 </em>in these languages. They are being manufactured in a number of lands, so requests for foreign-language editions will be filled as supplies become available. Please keep in mind that these are special-request items.</p>

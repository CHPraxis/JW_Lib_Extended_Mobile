<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AT SUBWAY stations, in public restrooms, or on bustling streets, mothers are abandoning their newborn babies. At times, garbage collectors have even found in trash cans tiny babies tired of crying for their mothers. According to <em>O Estado de S. Paulo, </em>“cases of babies abandoned on the streets are on the increase.” Of course, the young mother may regret her decision later. Yet she goes ahead, even though it may cost her child its life.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You may wonder, ‘How can a mother even think of abandoning her baby to an uncertain future?’ The Bible uses such a sad state of affairs as a metaphor to provide a strong contrast to our Creator’s feeling toward those of his own: “Can a wife forget her suckling so that she should not pity the son of her belly? Even these women can forget, yet I myself shall not forget you.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:49:15-23:49:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 49:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Really, more than any human mother, God has deep love for us and shows sensitivity to our needs. Whether you are a young person or an adult, whatever problem you may face, you are not alone. Your Creator wants to help you and is interested in your welfare. In the words of the psalmist, “in case my own father and my own mother did leave me, even Jehovah himself would take me up.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:10-19:27:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 27:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Worldwide, the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines are published to provide knowledge of “the only true God,” Jehovah, and his Son, Jesus Christ, which can mean everlasting life to those who appreciatively take it in.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p>

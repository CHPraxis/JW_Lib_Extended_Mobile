Announcements
▪ Literature offer for November: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. December: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life with the New World Translation. January: Any 192-page book published prior to 1985 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that do not have a supply of such books may offer True Peace and Security​—How Can You Find It? or You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. February: The Secret of Family Happiness.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting the 1999 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses with their November literature request. The Yearbook will be available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. Until the Yearbook is available and shipments are made, it will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Yearbooks are special-request items.
▪ Opportunities for travel abroad have become more readily available in recent years. As a result, many of our brothers have arranged to visit other countries. Frequently, they contact the Society’s branch offices requesting information. The branch offices are pleased to provide Kingdom Hall addresses and meeting times to assist in contacting local congregations. Also, they can give direction about visiting the branch office. Reports indicate, however, that many additional inquiries are made about travel arrangements, rooming accommodations, local attractions, and similar matters. Branch offices are not equipped, neither do they have the time, to supply information of this type. Visitors are encouraged to consult such sources as travel agents or tourist bureaus, which normally provide information for tourists.

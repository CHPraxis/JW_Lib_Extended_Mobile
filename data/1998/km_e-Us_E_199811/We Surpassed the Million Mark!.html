<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Service Year Ends With New Peak of 1,040,283 Publishers Reporting</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“One Million!” was the call in the July <em>Our Kingdom Ministry. </em>The 1,040,283 publishers reporting answered that call. This is an increase of 64,454, or 6.6 percent, over the previous peak in August 1996. We pray Jehovah’s continued blessing on our efforts to proclaim his Kingdom.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Elders, ministerial servants, and all publishers alike are urged to reflect on the efforts that were involved in reaching this goal. The million plus publishers are already with us in the congregations. And there are more to come each month as we continue to carry on an effective ministry. However, good organization for field service, coupled with kindly personal assistance where needed, is vital for further progress. We look to Jehovah for his all-important blessing so that growth will be maintained.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:7-46:3:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If the elders and ministerial servants​—especially those who are Congregation Book Study conductors—​along with other mature publishers and pioneers keep up the special effort they demonstrated during August, Jehovah’s rich blessing will surely be reflected in continued publisher increases. At times all that is needed is a kindly reminder to have a share in the preaching work and then perhaps another reminder to turn in the report. The suggestions outlined in the following insert article, “Be Effective in Your Ministry,” should help us improve in our activity and increase our joy as we experience fine results from our efforts.</p>

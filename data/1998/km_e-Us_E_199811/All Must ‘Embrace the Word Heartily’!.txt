All Must ‘Embrace the Word Heartily’!
1 Millions of people are studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. In order to qualify for life everlasting, they must ‘embrace the word heartily,’ as did the 3,000 who repented and were baptized on the day of Pentecost 33 C.E. (Acts 2:41) What responsibility does this place upon us today?
2 We need to help our Bible students develop devotion to Jehovah. (1 Tim. 4:7-10) To that end, the June 1996 Our Kingdom Ministry insert, paragraph 20, suggests: “Throughout the course of the study, look for opportunities to build appreciation for Jehovah’s qualities. Express your own deep feelings for God. Help the student think in terms of developing a warm, personal relationship with Jehovah.”
3 The Challenge We Face: Most people, influenced by false religion, are content with a form of worship that involves minimal time and effort, without requiring any real change in their way of life. (2 Tim. 3:5) The challenge facing us is to help our Bible students to see that true worship involves more than just being hearers of the word of God. They must apply in their lives what they learn. (Jas. 1:22-25) If something about their personal conduct is not acceptable to God, they need to recognize their obligation to “turn around” and do what is right to please him. (Acts 3:19) To gain eternal life, they must ‘exert themselves vigorously’ and take a firm stand for the truth.​—Luke 13:24, 25.
4 When discussing various aspects of morality, ask your Bible student how he really views these matters and what he should do if he sees a need to make changes in his life. Direct his attention to the organization through which he is learning the truth, and encourage him to attend congregation meetings regularly.​—Heb. 10:25.
5 Let us make it our aim to reach the student’s heart with our teaching. We will rejoice as we motivate new ones to embrace God’s word heartily and get baptized!​—1 Thess. 2:13.

Overseers Taking the Lead​—The Theocratic Ministry School Overseer
1 The Theocratic Ministry School overseer is a spiritually older man who works hard in speaking and teaching and who deserves our honor and cooperation. (1 Tim. 5:17) What are his responsibilities?
2 The Theocratic Ministry School library at the Kingdom Hall comes under his care. He is keenly interested in encouraging all who qualify to enroll in the school. He sees to it that an accurate record is kept so that assignments are made in an orderly fashion at least three weeks in advance of each school session. He needs to know the congregation well, having in mind each student and his capabilities. Although he may have another brother assist him in preparing the school schedule, assigning the parts properly takes the overseer’s personal supervision.
3 In order to teach the school effectively, the overseer must prepare diligently each week, making a thorough study of the assigned material. This enables him to keep the congregation enthused about the curriculum, to determine if the assigned material is covered accurately, and to highlight the important points that will be included on the written reviews.
4 Following each student talk, the overseer will commend the student and explain why a certain speech quality was good or why it needs improvement. When anyone needs additional tutoring to prepare his school assignments, the overseer or someone designated by him can render personal assistance.
5 In order to benefit fully from the hard work of the Theocratic Ministry School overseer and any additional counselors who serve under his direction, we should attend the school regularly. We should also fulfill all our assignments and apply the counsel that we receive as well as that given to other students. In this way, we will progressively improve in our ability to present the Kingdom message publicly and from house to house.​—Acts 20:20; 1 Tim. 4:13, 15.

The <em>Yearbook </em>will be available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. Until the <em>Yearbook </em>is available and shipments are made, it will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. <em>Yearbooks </em>are special-request items.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Opportunities for travel abroad have become more readily available in recent years. As a result, many of our brothers have arranged to visit other countries. Frequently, they contact the Society’s branch offices requesting information. The branch offices are pleased to provide Kingdom Hall addresses and meeting times to assist in contacting local congregations. Also, they can give direction about visiting the branch office. Reports indicate, however, that many additional inquiries are made about travel arrangements, rooming accommodations, local attractions, and similar matters. Branch offices are not equipped, neither do they have the time, to supply information of this type. Visitors are encouraged to consult such sources as travel agents or tourist bureaus, which normally provide information for tourists.</p>

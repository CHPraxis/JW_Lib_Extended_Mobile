“Will All People Ever Love One Another?”
During October and November of 1997, the four-page leaflet “Will All People Ever Love One Another?” received a worldwide distribution of over 300 million copies in more than 100 languages. Many favorable comments were made regarding it, including the following review in the Easton, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., Express-Times:
“It highlights examples of neighbors growing cold toward each other—even preying upon each other, as in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Rwanda, where longtime neighbors of different ethnic and religious groups killed each other.
“Closer to home, it addressed the elderly living alone where no one visits them, and one dynamic photo catches the face of a woman peering fearfully from the crack of a chained doorway.”
The branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Slovenia received the following request from The Philosophical Literature Club Impresie: “As regards the explanation of religious truth, the Roman Catholic Church has in Slovenia, sad to say, the monopoly. To understand these religious truths better, we most courteously request that you send us 50 copies of the tract entitled “Will All People Ever Love One Another?” It strikes us as something unique, as regards not only the content but also its visual impact.”

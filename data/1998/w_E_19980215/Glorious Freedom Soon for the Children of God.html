On the same day, he sacrificed a goat as a sin offering for all the other Israelites, even as Christ’s sacrifice will benefit mankind in general.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>What a marvelous hope is set before mankind! No wonder spirit-begotten Christians yet on earth are zealously taking the lead in telling others about it! As those who will become part of the “bride” of the glorified Lamb, Jesus Christ, the anointed remnant are involved in the fulfillment of these prophetic words: “The spirit and the bride keep on saying: ‘Come!’ And let anyone hearing say: ‘Come!’ And let anyone thirsting come; let anyone that wishes take life’s water free.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Revelation 21:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:9-66:21:9" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:1-66:22:2" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 22:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 17</a>) No, the benefits of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice are not limited to the 144,000 anointed ones.

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>Changes With the Passing of Time</strong></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6. How has God’s spirit operated on Jehovah’s servants during various time periods?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>God has a time to carry out his purposes, and this affects his dealings with humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:1" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:7-44:1:7" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Acts 1:7</a>) Though God’s spirit came upon his servants of pre-Christian times, they were not begotten as his spiritual sons. Beginning with Jesus, however, Jehovah’s time had come to use the holy spirit to beget dedicated men and women to a heavenly inheritance. And what about our day? The same spirit is operating on Jesus’ “other sheep,” but it is not arousing in them the hope and desire for heavenly life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="14-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) With eternal life on a paradise earth as their God-given hope, they joyfully support the anointed remnant in giving a witness during this period of transition from the old world to God’s righteous new world.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:5-61:3:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:5-13</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 7. What harvest work were the Bible Students concerned with, but what did they know about paradise?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>God began ‘to bring many sons to glory’ with the outpouring of holy spirit at Pentecost 33 C.E., and he apparently set a time for completing the spiritual “Israel of God” totaling 144,000. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:10-58:2:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Galatians 6:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:1-66:7:8" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> Revelation 7:1-8</a>) Beginning in 1879, a harvest work involving anointed Christians was often mentioned in this magazine. But the Bible Students (now called Jehovah’s Witnesses) also knew that the Scriptures hold out the hope of eternal life on a paradise earth. For example, the <em>Watch Tower </em>issue of July 1883 said: “When Jesus has established his kingdom, bound evil, etc., this earth will become a <em>paradise, </em>. . . and all that are in their graves shall come into it. And by becoming obedient to its laws they may live forever in it.” As time passed, the harvest of anointed ones diminished, and gradually individuals who did not have the heavenly hope were harvested into Jehovah’s organization. Meanwhile, God granted his anointed servants, born-again Christians, noteworthy insight.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:3-27:12:3" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Daniel 12:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:15-50:2:15" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Philippians 2:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:15-66:14:16" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> Revelation 14:15, 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 8. How did an understanding of the earthly hope develop in the early 1930’s?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span><sup>8 </sup>Particularly since 1931 have those with the earthly hope been associating with the Christian congregation. In that year, Jehovah enlightened the remnant of spirit-begotten Christians to see that <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:1-26:9:11" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ezekiel chapter 9</a> refers to this earthly class, who are being marked for survival into God’s new world. In 1932 it was concluded that such present-day sheeplike ones were prefigured by Jehu’s associate Jonadab (Jehonadab). (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:10:15-12:10:17" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Kings 10:15-17</a>) In 1934 it was made clear that “Jonadabs” should “consecrate,” or dedicate, themselves to God. In 1935 the “great multitude,” or “great crowd”—formerly thought to be a secondary spiritual class that would be “companions” of the bride of Christ in heaven—was identified as other sheep having an earthly hope. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:4-66:7:15" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Revelation 7:4-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:2-66:21:2" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 21:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:9-66:21:9" data-bid="20-3" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:45:14-19:45:15" data-bid="20-4" class="b"> Psalm 45:14, 15</a>) And especially since 1935 have anointed ones been spearheading a search for upright people yearning to live forever on a paradise earth.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 9. After 1935, why did some Christians cease to partake of the emblems at the Lord’s Evening Meal?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>After 1935 some Christians who had been partaking of the bread and wine at the Lord’s Evening Meal ceased to partake. Why? Because they realized that their hope was earthly, not heavenly. Said one woman who was baptized in 1930: “Though [partaking] was considered the right thing to do, especially for zealous full-time ministers, I never was convinced that I had a heavenly hope. Then, in 1935, it was made clear to us that there was being gathered a great crowd with the hope of living forever on earth. Many of us rejoiced to understand that we were part of that great crowd, and we ceased partaking of the emblems.” Even Christian publications changed in nature. While those of former years had been designed primarily for Jesus’ spirit-begotten followers, from 1935 onward <em>The Watchtower </em>and other literature of the ‘faithful slave’ provided spiritual food suited to the needs of both the anointed and their associates having the earthly hope.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45-47</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Wherever we serve Jehovah in faithfulness, he will satisfy our needs and upright desires.

He always does things that are in the best interests of those who love him. The disciple James said that “every good gift and every perfect present is from above, for it comes down from the Father of the celestial lights,” Jehovah God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="25-1" class="b">James 1:17</a>) Let us take note of a few of these gifts and blessings.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">12. Why can we say that Jehovah has given each of his faithful servants a wonderful hope?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup><em>Jehovah has given each of his faithful servants a wonderful hope. </em>He has called some to heavenly life. To his pre-Christian witnesses, Jehovah gave the splendid hope <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>of a resurrection to everlasting life on the earth. For instance, Abraham had faith in the resurrection and awaited “the city having real foundations”—the heavenly Kingdom under which he will be resurrected to earthly life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:10-58:11:10" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:17-58:11:19" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 17-19</a>) Once again, in this time of the end, God is granting millions the hope of everlasting life on a paradise earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Luke 23:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> John 17:3</a>) Surely, any to whom Jehovah has given such a grand hope should be deeply grateful for it.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">13. How has God’s holy spirit operated on his people?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup><em>Jehovah imparts his holy spirit as a gift to his people. </em>Christians given a heavenly hope are anointed with holy spirit.

Among these was Moses, who had Jehovah’s spirit, as did the 70 men appointed to assist him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:24-4:11:25" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Numbers 11:24, 25</a>) Under the influence of holy spirit, Bezalel served as an expert craftsman in connection with Israel’s tabernacle. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:31:1-2:31:11" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Exodus 31:1-11</a>) God’s spirit came upon Gideon, Jephthah, Samson, David, Elijah, Elisha, and others. Though these individuals of ancient times will never be brought to heavenly glory, they were guided and helped by holy spirit, as are Jesus’ other sheep today. So, then, possession of God’s spirit does not mean that we necessarily have the heavenly calling. Yet, Jehovah’s spirit provides guidance, helps us to preach and fulfill other God-given assignments, gives us power beyond what is normal, and produces in us its fruitage of love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, and self-control.

However, love for God’s Word and a good understanding of it do not constitute God’s way of indicating that we have been called to heavenly life. Men like Moses and Daniel even wrote portions of the Bible, but they will be resurrected to life on the earth. Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly, all of us receive spiritual food through Jehovah’s approved “faithful and discreet slave.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45-47</a>) How grateful all of us are for the knowledge thus acquired!</p>

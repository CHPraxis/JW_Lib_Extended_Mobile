<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">OUR Creator’s moral laws are eternal and unchangeable. For this reason the principle found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a> applies today: “Whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.” True, an individual may deny accountability to God, but the divine rule remains constant. Ultimately, no human is exempt from the consequences of his actions.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What of a person who lives a wayward life and then changes, becoming a servant of God? He may still have to live with the consequences of his previous life-style. This does not mean, however, that God has not forgiven him. King David’s adulterous relationship with Bath-sheba brought much calamity into his life. He could not escape this. But he did repent, and he did receive God’s forgiveness.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:12:13-10:12:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Samuel 12:13-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:13:1-10:13:31" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 13:1-31</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Have you ever felt disheartened when you suffer the consequences of mistakes you have made? If viewed in the right way, feeling regret can serve as a reminder to us to ‘be on our guard that we do not turn to what is hurtful.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:36:21-18:36:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 36:21</a>) Yes, feeling regret can help us to avoid repeating a wrong. Better yet, David used the experience gained from the sin he committed to benefit not only himself but others too. He said: “I will teach transgressors your ways, that sinners themselves may turn right back to you.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:13-19:51:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 51:13</a>.</p>

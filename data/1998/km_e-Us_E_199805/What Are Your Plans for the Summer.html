<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Is it not true that we are more likely to reach our worthwhile goals when we plan how best to use the time available to us? Summertime affords us a variety of opportunities to advance theocratic interests. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:5-20:21:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 21:5</a>) What are some of these?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The “God’s Way of Life” Convention is one event that all of us should include in our plans. Arrange time off from work or school so that you will be present for each day of the convention. Make reservations for your accommodations and arrangements for your travel well in advance.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Why not plan to increase your field service activity during the summertime? Longer daylight hours and warmer weather may allow you to spend more time in the preaching work. School vacation gives young people the opportunity to auxiliary pioneer during one or more summer months. Others too can plan ahead to auxiliary pioneer in August, when there will be five full weekends. This August, as we conclude the service year, a concerted effort will be made for everyone to share as fully as possible in the ministry.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Do you plan to assist a nearby congregation that needs help in covering its territory? The circuit overseer can inform the elders about the needs in your area. Or, if you qualify and would like to apply to the Society to cover seldom-worked or unassigned territory, obtain an application from your elders. If you will be vacationing away from home, plan to attend the meetings and share in the field service with the congregation in that locality. If you visit relatives who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses, prepare beforehand ways that you might share the truth with them.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>What are your plans for the summer? No doubt you want to refresh yourself physically. But do not overlook the more important opportunities that exist to energize yourself spiritually by continuing to put the Kingdom first in your life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:15-49:5:16" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Eph. 5:15, 16</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we have a tremendous work assignment. Jesus said: “In all the nations the good news has to be preached first.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 13:10</a>) Viewed from a human standpoint, this would seem impossible, but not so. We have the most powerful force in the universe backing us up​—God’s spirit.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:26-40:19:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 19:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>First-Century Evidence: </strong>Applying Isaiah’s prophecy to himself, Jesus said: “Jehovah’s spirit is upon me . . . to declare good news.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:17-42:4:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 4:17, 18</a>) Before ascending to heaven, he told his apostles that they likewise would be empowered by holy spirit to witness “to the most distant part of the earth.” Thereafter, Philip was directed by holy spirit to preach to an Ethiopian court official, the spirit sent Peter to a Roman centurion, and it dispatched Paul and Barnabas to preach to the Gentile nations. Who would have thought that people from such backgrounds would respond to the truth? But they did.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:29-44:8:38" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 8:29-38;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:19-44:10:20" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 10:19, 20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:44-44:10:48" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> 44-48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:2-44:13:4" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> 13:2-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:46-44:13:48" data-bid="4-6" class="b"> 46-48</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Modern-Day Evidence: </strong>The book of Revelation stresses the involvement of holy spirit in today’s preaching work by stating: “The spirit and the bride keep on saying: ‘Come!’ . . . Let anyone that wishes take life’s water free.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rev. 22:17</a>) The spirit has motivated Christ’s bride class and their “other sheep” companions to preach the good news to all peoples. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 10:16</a>) We should be bold in our preaching, never hesitant to approach people of all sorts, ever confident that God’s spirit will help us. The <em>1998 Yearbook </em>provides convincing proof that God’s spirit continues with his servants. Look at the response! During the past two service years, an average of over 1,000 were baptized each day.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Rest assured that God’s spirit will continue with us as we preach the Kingdom message to the extent that Jehovah wills. This knowledge should encourage and motivate us to keep exerting ourselves vigorously in the all-important Kingdom work.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:10-54:4:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:10</a>.</p>

They Silently Praise Their Creator
SUNSETS are spectacular by nature. But the sight of the sun descending behind this particular mountain in the Apuan Alps of Tuscany, Italy, is truly like no other.
Viewed from a distance, the sun appears to drop into the mountain rather than descend behind it. Why? Because the peak of the mountain has a natural arch that seems as if it were gouged out of the mountain. Indeed, this promontory has earned its name, Monte Forato—the Pierced Mountain. Because of the earth’s rotation around the sun, on only two occasions each year can those looking through the arch see the sun appear to drop into Monte Forato.
Like other features of creation, the inanimate heavens praise their Creator. How? In the same way that a beautiful painting may bring praise to the artist who produced it. In effect, the heavenly bodies speak of Jehovah’s power, wisdom, and majesty. As the psalmist put it, “the heavens are declaring the glory of God; and of the work of his hands the expanse is telling.” (Psalm 19:1; 69:34) Since the sun and other inanimate bodies praise their Creator, how much more should we!—Psalm 148:1, 3, 12, 13.

“A World Living in Peace and Harmony”
Do you believe this could ever come about? A woman from Florida, U.S.A., wrote: “Your tract Will All People Ever Love One Another? is one of the most powerful messages of hope I have ever read. I read it again and again. I exult each time I read it—at the loving thought of a world living in peace and harmony.”
If you too would like to receive evidence that a world of people can and will live in peace and harmony, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to an appropriate address listed on page 5. A copy of the 32-page brochure Does God Really Care About Us? will be sent to you. We believe that part 10, “The Marvelous New World of God’s Making,” will warm your heart.

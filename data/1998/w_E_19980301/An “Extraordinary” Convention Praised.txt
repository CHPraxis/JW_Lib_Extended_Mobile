An “Extraordinary” Convention Praised
A RADIO announcer in Lima, Peru, had serious reservations about Jehovah’s Witnesses. After attending one of their district conventions, however, his attitude changed dramatically. In fact, he was so impressed that he made some favorable comments to his radio audience. The following are excerpts from what he said:
“The convention was simply extraordinary. There was not a piece of paper on the floor nor a vendor around. There were no traffic jams. Five thousand two hundred people went to the stadium at their own expense, each armed with bucket, rag, duster, dustpan, broom, hand brush, gloves, and detergent to wash and scrub the place. Where paint was needed, they went ahead and painted. And who comes up with the money? They come up with it themselves! When they are informed about something that needs to be done, all of them immediately reach into their pockets to give. I tell you, the Catholic Church is falling asleep when it comes to such matters. I want to congratulate Jehovah’s Witnesses and the coordinators of this event. And I want to say to them from the bottom of my heart, May God help you and bless you.”
In the cities around the world this year, Jehovah’s Witnesses will enjoy the “God’s Way of Life” District Convention. Will you be present?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">EACH year Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world gather by the thousands at conventions. There, they enjoy fellowship and hear an excellent program of Bible instruction. Some make great efforts to attend these conventions. Last year, for example, in Malawi a couple in their mid-60’s, along with their son and his wife and baby, traveled 50 miles <strong>[80 km] </strong>by bicycle to attend a convention. They left their village at six in the morning and arrived at the convention grounds 15 hours later.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In Mozambique, a group traveled three days by bicycle to get to a convention. One night, as they camped in the open, they heard lions roaring close by. Although they threw firewood in the direction of the animals, the lions stayed around until daybreak. Another Witness traveling to the same convention came face-to-face with a lion on the road. He stood quietly without moving until the lion went away. At the convention these Witnesses cheerfully told how they had been “delivered from the lion’s mouth.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:17-55:4:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">As told by Sven Sievers</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">I HAVE stuttered ever since I was a child. Looking back, I appreciate my parents’ approach to the problem. When I stuttered, they always tried to concentrate on listening to what I wanted to say instead of correcting my way of speaking. According to speech therapists, parents who draw constant attention to their child’s stutter may aggravate the disorder.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">My mother became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses when I was three years old. In my teens I decided to follow her example and was helped to make a thorough study of the Bible. On July 24, 1982, I was baptized as a dedicated servant of God at a convention in Neumünster, Germany. Later, I moved to South Africa, where I continued to participate in the public preaching work, in which all true Christians are commanded to share. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>) How, you may wonder, do I manage as a stutterer?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Rewards for Being Positive</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">I must admit that sometimes it is hard for me to keep a positive attitude, but I have found that being positive really does make a big difference. The fact is that somehow I can always communicate. If not by speaking, I communicate by writing messages down or just by showing others Bible literature. A positive approach helps me overcome the difficulty of starting a conversation. I try to keep my introduction very simple. In the beginning of a conversation, I let the householder talk as much as possible. People like to talk, and this gives me the opportunity to get to know their way of thinking. Then, I continue the conversation with things that interest them, highlighting the Bible’s message. Concentrating on what they are saying helps me forget about my speech problem, and I stutter less.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A positive approach also helps me speak up at Christian meetings. I have found that the more I participate in Bible discussions, the more the audience and the conductor get used to me and listen to what I say instead of how I am saying it.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">To experience the joy of success, I have to keep on trying. This prevents me from succumbing to self-pity and becoming an introvert. Fighting self-pity is an ongoing battle. It has been said that if a person gets thrown from a horse, it is important for him to get back onto the horse so that he does not lose self-confidence. So if I have to stop speaking during a comment because I am completely <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>stuck, I try to get back onto the horse, as it were, by speaking up at the very next opportunity.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>How Others Can Help</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">When I have to make phone calls or ask strangers for information, I do appreciate tactful help. But some individuals go overboard in their desire to be helpful, and they treat me like a child who is incapable of making decisions.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">I also appreciate the help of my loving wife, Tracy. Before she acts as my “mouth,” we discuss the situation in detail and she knows what I would like accomplished. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:10-2:4:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 4:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:4:14-2:4:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14, 15</a>.) In that way, she shows me respect as her husband, and she leaves me feeling that I am still in control of my own life.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Another great help has been the Theocratic Ministry School. At this weekly meeting, students share in public Bible reading and in giving short talks on Bible topics. I was surprised to find that I can often read and speak quite well in front of an audience. If I had not enrolled in the school, I would probably never have become aware of this ability.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">When I have had assignments on the Theocratic Ministry School, it has been particularly encouraging when the instructor has concentrated on what I said and not on how I said it. I have greatly benefited from the <em>Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook,</em><span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> even though certain aspects of this book present a much bigger challenge to those who stutter than to those with normal speech. For example, at times, because of the amount of stuttering, I am not able to finish my talk in the allotted time. It is very encouraging to me, though, when the instructor highlights points that I am capable of working on.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>Greater Privileges of Service</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In the past, I had the privilege of doing public reading from a Christian publication that we study at our meetings. I also had the privilege of conducting the study when no other qualified minister was present, and today I do so on a regular basis. Although initially nervous, I have experienced God’s help in carrying out such assignments.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">For many years, however, opportunities for me to read or teach from the congregation platform were limited. This was understandable, since there were times when I took too long to make myself understood. So I used my energies to the full in handling other assignments. At first, I served as an assistant in caring for the congregation’s supply of <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Then, after being appointed a ministerial servant, I took care of the supplies of Bibles, books, and other literature. Later, I was assigned to check on the territory cards that are used in our public witnessing work. Concentrating on these assignments, trying to do good work, brought me much joy.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">For the past eight years, I have also served as a full-time evangelizer with Tracy. Jehovah has certainly blessed me in this aspect too. In fact, sometimes I wonder if Jehovah uses my weakness of stuttering. Of the five persons that I have had the privilege of helping to become dedicated Christians, two are stutterers.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>I still remember with joy the day I was appointed to serve as a congregation elder. Although my teaching ability from the platform is limited, I try to concentrate on helping others on a personal basis. Stuttering does not limit my ability to do Scriptural research to help members of the congregation who are facing serious problems.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Over the past five years, I have been invited to handle more and more speaking assignments. Besides giving talks on the Theocratic Ministry School, I have been able to handle brief announcements at other meetings. Slowly my fluency improved. But then I had a bad relapse. Anxiously, I thought, ‘I will not be given any more assignments,’ but to my surprise, my name was on the next schedule! The presiding overseer of our congregation said that if I get so stuck that I can’t continue, I can just look at him and he will come up to the platform and take over. I made use of this loving offer once or twice, but I have not had to do so in recent months. As my speech improved, I was assigned longer parts, including public talks. I only fully realized the progress I had made when recently I was asked to take part in two demonstrations at a circuit assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Frankly, I do not fully understand why my speech has improved. Also, it might deteriorate again tomorrow. In fact, while I seem to have made definite progress in speaking from the platform, I have had bad relapses when speaking to people on a personal basis. So this is not a success story in the sense that I have conquered stuttering. When I suffer a relapse, I try to remind myself that I need to accept my limitations and ‘be modest in walking with God.’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:6:8-33:6:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Micah 6:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Whatever the future might bring, I will keep on trying, knowing that in God’s approaching new world, stuttering will be completely overcome. “The tongue of stammerers,” the Bible says, “will be quick in speaking clear things.” I am confident that this will be true in a literal as well as a spiritual sense and that even “the speechless one will cry out in gladness.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:4-23:32:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:6-23:35:6" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 35:6</a>.</p>

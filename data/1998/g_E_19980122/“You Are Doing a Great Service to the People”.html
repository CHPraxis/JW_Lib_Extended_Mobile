<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A man from Goa, India, obtained two copies of <em>Awake! </em>from two of Jehovah’s Witnesses who called at his home. After reading them, he wrote the following letter to the publishers of the magazine:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I must thank the two ladies who called at my residence the other day and left copies of <em>Awake! </em>magazine. Thinking they were propaganda, I did not pay attention to them for some time. But one day I glanced at one of the magazines, on ‘The Amazon Rain Forest’ (March 22, 1997). I started to read it and could not put the magazine aside until I had read it completely and carefully.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I found the material in <em>Awake! </em>to be very interesting and informative. The variety of subjects also fascinated me. What I appreciated the most was the very rational and balanced approach of the various articles.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This first-time reader of <em>Awake! </em>added: “You are doing a great service to the people by bringing such valuable information to their doorstep.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">You too can benefit from reading <em>Awake! </em>If you would like to receive another copy or would like to have someone call at your home to discuss the Bible with you, write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

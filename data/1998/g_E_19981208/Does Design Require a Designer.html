<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is a question that many ponder today. What do you think? A man from Virginia, U.S.A., wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I just completed reading <em>Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>I thought that it was very thoroughly researched and thought-provoking. I received the book a number of years ago from one of your missionaries in Summerville, South Carolina, U.S.A.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I really appreciated the work and its scientific defense of creation. Because of your book, I no longer think that the theory of evolution is valid. Although I am a lifelong Roman Catholic, I have enjoyed this book and discussions with some of your Jehovah’s Witness missionaries.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If you too would like to receive reliable evidence that life did not come about by chance but was created, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to an appropriate address listed on page 5.

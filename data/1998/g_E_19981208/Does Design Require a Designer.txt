Does Design Require a Designer?
That is a question that many ponder today. What do you think? A man from Virginia, U.S.A., wrote:
“I just completed reading Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? I thought that it was very thoroughly researched and thought-provoking. I received the book a number of years ago from one of your missionaries in Summerville, South Carolina, U.S.A.
“I really appreciated the work and its scientific defense of creation. Because of your book, I no longer think that the theory of evolution is valid. Although I am a lifelong Roman Catholic, I have enjoyed this book and discussions with some of your Jehovah’s Witness missionaries.”
If you too would like to receive reliable evidence that life did not come about by chance but was created, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to an appropriate address listed on page 5. We would be pleased to send you the 32-page brochure What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It? Learn about the marvelous design in living things and why such design requires a Designer.

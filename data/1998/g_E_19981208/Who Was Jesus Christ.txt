Who Was Jesus Christ?
At this time of the year in many lands throughout the world, there are Christmas observances. Hundreds of millions of people believe that Jesus Christ was born on December 25 some 2,000 years ago. In paintings and sculptures, there are various portrayals of him as a baby in a manger. But, of course, he grew to manhood and lived on earth for 33 1/2 years.
HAVE you ever wondered about the physical appearance of Jesus when he was an adult? What kind of complexion did he have? Was he muscular and handsome, or was he frail and somewhat sickly looking, as he has been depicted by various artists down through the centuries? Was he clean shaven or bearded? Did he have long hair?
Also, did Jesus have an aura of holiness, such as a halolike light around his head as drawn by certain artists? Or was the reality different—that he had no such distinguishing features but could blend in with a crowd?
Conflicting thoughts have been put forth by secular historians and artists down through the ages regarding the appearance of Jesus. Additionally, reliable clues have been provided in eyewitness accounts of him that were written down by Bible writers who lived in the first century and who were in his company.
However, the following are far more important questions than what he looked like: Who really was Jesus Christ? What part does he play in God’s purpose? Has he fulfilled that part? What is he today, and where is he? Does he have a position so important that it will affect all humankind, even many who have died?
First, let us examine the evidence regarding the appearance of Jesus. What did he look like?

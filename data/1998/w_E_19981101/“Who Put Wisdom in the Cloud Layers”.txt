“Who Put Wisdom in the Cloud Layers”?
“WHEN you see a cloud rising in western parts, at once you say, ‘A storm is coming,’ and it turns out so. And when you see that a south wind is blowing, you say, ‘There will be a heat wave,’ and it occurs.” These words of Jesus, penned by the Gospel writer Luke, are examples of weather forecasts as they were made in ancient Palestine. (Luke 12:54, 55) In certain circumstances, the ancients could read the signs and make accurate short-term predictions.
Today, meteorologists use sophisticated instruments, such as earth-orbiting satellites, Doppler radar, and powerful computers, to gauge weather patterns over longer periods. But their predictions are often wrong. Why?
Many factors make accurate weather forecasting difficult. For example, unforeseen changes in temperature, humidity, air pressure, and wind-speed and direction can complicate matters. Added to these are the complex interactions of the sun, clouds, and oceans, which scientists do not yet fully understand. For that reason, weather forecasting remains an inexact science.
Man’s limited knowledge of weather reminds us of the questions asked of Job: “Who gave birth to the dewdrops? Out of whose belly does the ice actually come forth? . . . Can you raise your voice even to the cloud, so that a heaving mass of water itself may cover you? . . . Who put wisdom in the cloud layers, or who gave understanding to the sky phenomenon? Who can exactly number the clouds in wisdom, or the water jars of heaven—who can tip them over?”—Job 38:28-37.
The answer to all these questions is, Not man but Jehovah God. Yes, however wise humans may seem to be, the wisdom of our Creator is far, far superior. It is truly loving on his part that he has made his wisdom available to us in the pages of the Bible, so that we can make our way successful.—Proverbs 5:1, 2.

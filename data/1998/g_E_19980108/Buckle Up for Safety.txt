Buckle Up for Safety
▪ In the United States, motor-vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among youths from 5 to 24 years of age.
▪ In Japan, road accidents are responsible for more than twice as many deaths as breast cancer and kill four times as many people as prostate cancer.
▪ In Europe, car accidents account for four times as many deaths as homicides do.
THESE alarming statistics highlight one of the inherent dangers of traveling by automobile—speed can kill. And speed with alcohol murders. Thankfully, the risk of accident and injury can be reduced. How is that possible?
Cultivating safe driving habits is a good place to start. Some safety experts claim that 9 out of 10 accidents could be prevented or avoided. Exceeding the posted speed limit, weaving in and out of traffic, tailgating, driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and driving a poorly maintained car are just a few examples of unsafe driving habits. Respect for life and love for our fellowman should move us to adopt a cautious and responsible attitude toward operating a motor vehicle.—Matthew 7:12.
Seat belts are another simple, but often overlooked, safety measure. According to Tim Hurd, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation, “the safety belt is the most effective way to save your life in a crash. It doubles the likelihood of survival.” For the youngest passengers, the survival rate is nearly tripled if they use child safety seats.a
In spite of this, surveys indicate that nearly a third of the occupants of passenger vehicles in the United States do not use seat belts. As a parent, do you see to it that your children are safely strapped into their seats before venturing out? The time that it takes to buckle up is well worth it.
[Footnote]
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommends: “Children in rear-facing child seats should not be placed in the front seat of cars equipped with passenger-side air bags. The impact of a deploying air bag striking a rear-facing child seat could result in injury to the child.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“About 10:00 p.m. on November 11,” reported Arthur, in Suva, Fiji, “I started to feel chest pains, which I passed off as heartburn. My wife, Esther, was convinced that I was having a heart attack, since she said my symptoms were similar to those described in the December 8, 1996, <em>Awake!, </em>“Heart Attack—What Can Be Done?,” which she had just read.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I talked to my doctor on the telephone, and he advised me to take some heartburn medication, go to sleep, and see him in the morning. Yet, the pain persisted. I then asked Esther to bring the <em>Awake! </em>and read the section “Symptoms of a Heart Attack.” After she read it to me, I agreed to be taken to the hospital.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Tests showed that I was having a heart attack, and I was admitted to the hospital. For the next five days, I was kept heavily sedated and given complete rest. The heart specialist said that I was fortunate to have detected my heart attack.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“On January 9, 1997, I underwent four hours of open-heart surgery in Sydney, Australia. ‘The coronary artery disease was incredibly severe,’ the surgeon’s report stated. The condition of my coronary arteries showed that I was heading for a major heart attack that would have come within a few months had the attack on November 11 gone undetected.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“I can say without a doubt that the <em>Awake! </em>saved my life, since I would definitely have passed off my attack as severe heartburn.”</p>

“We Catholics Have Much to Learn From Them”
THIS observation about Jehovah’s Witnesses was made by a teacher in Bari, Italy, during her high-school class on the history of religion. The teacher had told the class that she would be using videocassettes as a teaching aid. Upon hearing this, one of the students, 18-year-old Roberto, suggested including his religion in the discussion. He offered her the video Jehovah’s Witnesses—The Organization Behind the Name. She accepted Roberto’s offer, and the entire class of about 30 students saw the video. “All were impressed by the unity, the organization, and the deep love that prevail among Jehovah’s Witnesses,” says Roberto. “They were even more amazed to learn that 40 million copies of The Watchtower and 36 million copies of Awake! are printed each month.”
“I did not think you were so organized,” commented several of Roberto’s classmates after seeing the video. Regarding Jehovah’s Witnesses, the teacher said to the class: “Observe how their faith moves them to be so united and organized. We Catholics have much to learn from them.” The video and the class discussion that followed did much to promote a better understanding of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

Why Didn’t She Believe in God?
OLESYA, a young woman in Rustavi, Georgia, a former republic of the Soviet Union, showed two visitors a picture of her parents and exclaimed: “If there were a God, he would not have permitted my parents to die when they were so young!” After Olesya’s husband, Tamazi, came home, the visitors left them the brochures Enjoy Life on Earth Forever! and “Look! I Am Making All Things New.”
When a return visit was made on the couple, Olesya had read the “Look!” brochure and wanted to study the Bible. She liked what she read. During the discussion that followed, she was quick to open the brochure and read the parts that she had marked. The sound arguments had impressed her.
For example, the brochure says: “The glorious wonders that surround us—the flowers, the birds, the animals, the marvelous creation called man, the miracles of life and of birth—these all testify to the invisible Master Intellect that produced them. (Romans 1:20) Where there is intellect, there is mind. Where there is mind, there is a person. The supreme intellect is that of the Supreme Person, the Creator of all things living, the very Fountain of life. (Psalm 36:9) The Creator is indeed worthy of all praise and adoration.—Psalm 104:24; Revelation 4:11.”
Olesya confided later that God’s promise to resurrect dead loved ones moved her to want to study the Bible. We believe that you too will benefit from the faith-strengthening information contained in these brochures. If you want a copy of Enjoy Life on Earth Forever! and “Look!

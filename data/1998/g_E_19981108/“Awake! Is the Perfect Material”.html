<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The above was the comment of a 16-year-old Muslim male from Benin City, in the African country of Nigeria. He explained in a letter to the Nigeria branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I came across <em>Awake! </em>in a friend’s house and borrowed nine issues. I read all of them from cover to cover in one day! I am writing to praise all the brains behind <em>Awake!—</em>including Jehovah—for a work well done! I am particularly impressed by the way you connect environmental matters with the Bible and God. As a member of the Nigerian Conservation Foundation, I have been looking for materials to build my own environmental/nature library. I now realize that <em>Awake! </em>is the perfect material. Please let me know how I can get the two editions of <em>Awake! </em>each month directly from you.”</p>

“Awake! Is the Perfect Material”
The above was the comment of a 16-year-old Muslim male from Benin City, in the African country of Nigeria. He explained in a letter to the Nigeria branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses:
“I came across Awake! in a friend’s house and borrowed nine issues. I read all of them from cover to cover in one day! I am writing to praise all the brains behind Awake!—including Jehovah—for a work well done! I am particularly impressed by the way you connect environmental matters with the Bible and God. As a member of the Nigerian Conservation Foundation, I have been looking for materials to build my own environmental/nature library. I now realize that Awake! is the perfect material. Please let me know how I can get the two editions of Awake! each month directly from you.”
Perhaps you had never read Awake! prior to seeing this one. If you would like to have another copy, please make such a request in a letter addressed to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address on page 5. We will be pleased to mail you another copy or, at your request, have someone call at your home to consider with you the significance of the times in which we live.
□ Send me a current copy of Awake!
□ Please contact me regarding a free home Bible study.

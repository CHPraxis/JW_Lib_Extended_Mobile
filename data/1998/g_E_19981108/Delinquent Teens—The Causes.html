<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">DO YOU hold to the conventional opinion that juvenile delinquents typically come from poor families and that children from “good” families rarely turn to crime? In Asia the facts seemed to some to support that view. “No longer,” reports <em>Asia Magazine. </em>“Police statistics and case stories around Asia show that more and more teenagers from respectable homes steal, vandalise, take drugs and turn to prostitution.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">For example, in Japan half of all teenagers charged with a felony come from a middle-class background. The situation in Bangkok is similar. “In the past,” says Adisai Ahapanun, chief of Muhita Training School, “teenage crime was mostly motivated by lack of money. Today, more than 50 per cent of the teenagers here are from middle-income homes with no financial difficulties.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some blame the situation on working mothers, rising divorce rates, and a materialistic outlook on life. Says Eddie Jacob, assistant director of a halfway house for teens in Singapore: “The bottom line is dysfunctional homes—where the parents may be divorced, or where you have single parents, or where both parents are working and the kids become neglected. Children pick up their values from home.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Bible foretold that our times would be marked by increasing rebellion among youth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1, 2</a>) Yet, that same book can give families the values that they need to stay close, regardless of their economic situation. The Bible is worth investigating, for “all Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>) Jehovah’s Witnesses in Asia—indeed, all over the world—are finding rewards in studying the Bible as families. They would be happy to help you do the same.</p>

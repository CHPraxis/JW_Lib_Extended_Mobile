Of the Hudson itself . </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopcedia Britannica</span><span class="font8"> tells us:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It is not a river in the truest sense of the word, but a river valley into which the ocean water has been admitted by subsidence of the land, transforming a large part of the valley into an inlet ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The width of the tidal river varies somewhat, being about 300 yards at Albany and thence to the Highlands varying from 300 yards to 900 yards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The river enters the northern portals of the Highlands between a series of hills whose frequently precipitous sides rise often abruptly from the water’s edge. For about sixteen miles the river is bordered by steeply rising hills, giving picturesque and striking views of great variety. . . . The views in this part of the river, often compared with those along the Rhine, are of a character in some respects unparalleled, and at several points they have an impressiveness and surprising grandeur rarely equaled. About ten miles after the Highlands are entered West Point is reached, a favorite landing-place of tourists and the seat of the United States Military Academy, from whose grounds flue views of the river may be had. This point is historically interesting as the seat of Fort Putnam, now in ruins, built during the American War of Independ-enee, at which time a chain was stretched across the river to prevent the passage of British ships. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Just below Peekskill the river broadens out to form Haverstraw Bay, at the extrem- ’ ity of which is the headland of Croton Point. Below this is the wider expanse of Tappan Bay, which has a length of twelve miles and a breadth of from four to five miles, while below this the river narrows to a breadth between one and two miles. ... At Piermont, . where the bay ends, the range named the Palisades rises picturesquely from the water’s edge to the height of between 300 and 500 feet, extending along the west bank for about twenty miles, the opposite shore being level . . . ” (See also cover design, and description, for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font8"> No. 487.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">[Judge Rutherford’s courageous speech delivered at Now York eity<sub>T</sub> Hu ad ay, October 2, 193S, ilticI broadcast i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over a transcontinental radio-chain]</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">B</span><span class="font8">EFORE all peoples there is today a great issue or question for final determination, rftated in brief, that issue is this: Shall the world be ruled in righteousness by Christ the enthroned King of Jehovah ? or shall it be ruled by selfish, arbitrary dictators? To be sure, men cannot settle that issue; but soon the Lord will set tle it, and every person must choose to take one side or the other and to receive the consequences. The issue involves life and death, and therefore the welfare of the people requires that they be told the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Today 1 speak to the American people, who for more than a century have taken the lead as defenders of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of worship of Almighty God. All of these rights of men are now in grave jeopardy. The people need to hear and to give ealm consideration to all the facts relating to the issue, and for that reason an assembly such as this is of great importance. Those who object to or oppose such assembly and a full discussion of the facts are the ones who advocate rule by cruel dictators, and their opposition is because of their desire to keep the people in ignorance until the people are deprived of all liberty and are under the complete control of dictators. The press and the radio are means of easy and quick communication of the facts to the people, but it is well known that, because of fear, many of these agencies are in the control of selfish interests and therefore refuse publication of the facts. This in itself increases the peril of the people. Certain radio stations, desiring to serve the public, are now broadcasting this speech, but before it ends there will be strenuous efforts to stop the broadcast and to deny the people the privilege of hearing, Such conduct is entirely un-American and very wrong. The American people are capable of hearing and considering the facts and are able to decide for themselves what thej<sup>T</sup> should do. 1 therefore earnestly urge upon the radio stations and all listeners to hear me through.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font7">Three weeks after delivery of the speech “Face the Facts’’ came its companion piece, “Fascism ok Freedom,” In response to many requests for a rebuke to the unholy Roman Catholic Hierarchy for their gangster methods and interference with peaceable assembly in the United States and Canada and committed in an effort to prevent the people from hearing his London broadcast “Face the Facts”, Judge Rutherford arranged to address the American continent from Mecca Temple, New York City, October </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">2,</span><span class="font7"> 1938, on the subject ■ “Fascism or Freedom”. A visible audience of 7,000 people filled aisles, seats, and standing room of the main and overflow auditoriums, with hundreds turned away; again relay auditoriums in the United States and Canada were connected by direct wire and 60 radio stations spread exposure and disgrace for the most criminal organization on earth. Thus while tlio enemy were busy repairing their shattered breastwork of lies another explosion threw them into turmoil, and, caught thus unprepared, they were not able to muster the least opposition. Another victory of Jehovah heard by millions!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">The totalitarian or dictatorial rule is fully supported by ambitious politicians, entrenched predatory wealth, and extremely selfish religious leaders. Totalitarian rule is the product of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God's kingdom is fully supported by all persons who love righteousness, and this is true without regard to race, color or previous faith. Jehovah’s witnesses, for whom I speak, are wholly devoted to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and therefore give their unqualified support to God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 2, 1938</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Newspapers of the religious element falsely charge that Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged in a campaign of hate, but that charge is entirely without foundation in truth. Jehovah’s witnesses are lovers of peace and righteousness. They do not hate men and are not fighting against men. As witnesses for the Lord their sole mission'is to inform the people and aid them to see what is for their best interest. They do hate wickedness and wicked schemes which bring upon the people oppression and - sorrow and which defame God’s name. In this they follow exactly in the steps of Christ Jesus, whom Jehovah has made the rightful ruler of the'whole world, and concerning whom it is written in God’s Word (Hebrews 1:8,9; Psalm 45: 7) : “A sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom; thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses‘are true Christians, that is, followers of Christ Jesus<sub>;</sub> and God’s command to all such true Christians is that they must tell the truth, that the people of good will may learn the way to righteousness and life. (John 18:37) No human agency can rightfully interfere therewith. Those who object to the full publication of truth of God’s Word and the facts in support thereof thereby declare themselves against Jehovah God and Christ Jesus His King. Honest men will lay aside all prejudice and calmly consider the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Totalitarian Rule Begins</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The issue now before the people is not new, but the time has come when that issue must be finally settled, and God has announced it shall be settled once and for all. Totalitarian rule raised its blighting head and began to exercise its destructive power five thousand <sup>1 </sup>years ago. Such rule originated with Satan the<sup>1</sup> Devil, the foe of God and of honest men. As Christians we must and do accept the Bible as God’s W<sup>T</sup>ord of truth given to man for his sure guide. (Psalm 119:105) Therein we find the truth recorded that the Devil used Nimrod as the first dictator. Nimrod set up religion contrary to God Is command; introduced traffic to control the products of men’s labor, and employed politics to rule the people arbitrarily. From that time till now every dictatorial government has employed religion, and combined religion with commercial traffic and politics to arbitrarily rule the people</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">4</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">and to turn them against Jehovah God and His kingdom, Jehovah God organized the people of Israel into a nation for himself .and gave to that people His covenant and His law for th&lt;pr guidance, that they might be a -model nation. To them God gave the express command that they must hold themselves entirely aloof from religion and that they must obey God’s law. (Exodus 20:1-5) In time selfish men, as leaders of the Israelites, adopted a form of religion and employed it, together with commerce and politics, to control the people and turn them away from God. The Pharisees and the doctors of the law became religious leaders, ruled the people arbitrarily, and persecuted every one of God’s true witnesses. (Matthew 23: 33-35; 21:43) Jesus denounced religion and religionists, declaring the same to be instruments of the Devil. (Matthew 15:1-9; John 8:42-44) Then the Jews fell under the arbitrary’ dictatorial rule of Rome, and the religious clergy took the side of the dictator of Rome as against Jesus, the Son of God. When those religious clergymen were demanding the lifeblood of Jesus the Roman governor said to them (John 19:.15) : “Shall I crucify your King?” Those religionists in answer cried out: “We have no king but Caesar”; thus rejecting Jesus, whom God had sent to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The people of. Israel were ruled by the iron hand of a Roman dictator, and Israel’s religious clergymen gave the allegiance to and supported the dictator, abandoned God and His Word, and took away the freedom of the people. In the presence and hearing of those clergymen Jesus said to the people (John 8:31,32,36): “If ye continue in my word, . . ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free,” and, ‘if I make you free, then you shall be free indeed.’ Thus it is set-tied that true freedom comes by full obedience to Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Exactly a similar condition obtains today. Christ Jesus, the world’s rightful Ruler, has come again, and Jehovah has enthroned Him. His rule has begun while the Devil still operates through his agencies on earth. (Psalm 110:2) In “Christendom” the leaders have turned from God and have become entirely religious and are against God and His kingdom. In every country where dictatorial rule obtains religious leaders support the dictator, and dictators declare their violent opposition to Jehovah God and His King, Christ Jesus. Now the Lord has sent forth His witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION </span><span class="font8">to tell the truth of and concerning His kingdom and of His purpose, to the end that the people may learn that their only means of freedom is by serving Christ the King of Jehovah. Therefore all dictators and their allies bitterly oppose those who serve God and who advertise His King and kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan the Devil caused the downfall of man and brought sickness and death upon the human race. That was the beginning of religion. Then God gave His word of promise that in due time He would redeem man and would set up a righteous government for the rule of the world and that all men who would choose to serve Him and His King should receive life everlasting and dwell for ever in peace. That government is a theocracy because everything thereof is done in harmony with the will of Jehovah. Psalm 19:7-9: ‘All of His laws and ways are righteous and true.<sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In opposition to Jehovah God and in direct contrast to His righteous kingdom, the Devil brings forth an arbitrary, a dictatorial, totalitarian rule of the people, which is unrighteous and desperately wicked and which denies the people the right of peaceable assembly, freedom of worship, and freedom of speech. The. Devil is the mimic god, and his dictatorial rule in the earth is a mockery of Jehovah God and a blasphemy of God’s holy name, and is set up for that purpose and to turn the people against God and His kingdom, and to plunge the whole race into everlasting destruction. All people that now willingly give their allegiance to the Devil’s totalitarian rule are certain to be destroyed at Armageddon, because God has so decreed. The only place of safety and freedom and of life for the people is by turning to and giving theiren-tire allegiance to the kingdom under Christ. Knowing this, the Devil desperately attempts' to keep the people in ignorance of these vital truths, because it is only by knowing the truth that the people may learn the way to freedom and to life. The issue, therefore, is of life and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Facts</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For the benefit of all persons who desire righteousness I now submit the indisputable facts. In doing so I am not moved by hatred of any man, but am moved by loving obedience to Almighty God and by an unselfish </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBEFT2, 1B38 </span><span class="font8">desire to do good unto all men. Therefore I ask the radio managers of stations broadcasting this speech to permit the entire speech to be heard without interruption, because your life is involved and the life and liberty of each listener is involved. If it appears that the facts, when spoken, may shock the susceptibilities of some religious leaders, ask yourselves this question: Which are more important, the feelings of a few selfish men or the liberties and lives of countless millions? The loss of liberty means ultimately the loss of everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Italy</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What already obtains in continental Europe is moving stealthily and with rapidity against America, and for this reason I cite as apt examples the European condition. Italy set up a Fascist government with Mussolini, an avowed atheist, as dictator, and he has excluded from that land every witness of Jehovah God and supporter of Christ’s kingdom. Shortly after .Mussolini became dictator he entered into an agreement with the pope, the leading religionist on earth, by which temporal power was granted to the Vatican, and Mussolini became a supporter of the Catholic organization and of Catholic Action; hence he is a religionist and against God and Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Italian dictator prosecuted a cruel war of conquest against and destroyed the helpless people of Abyssinia, and that unwarranted action of the dictator the pope fully supported. Now Mussolini persecutes the Jews, who have made their homes in Italy, and in that Wrongful act he is supported by the Hierarchy. For more than a year a bloody and unrighteous war has been prosecuted in Spain by rebels against the government, and that war of rebeilion, which has brought cruel death to many innocents, both Mussolini and the pope have fully supported. Japan is now carrying on a wicked war against China, and in that war Japan has the support of the pope and at his instance Japan has excluded or has denied Jehovah’s witnesses the privilege of bearing testimony to His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Fascism, Nazism, and Communism all mean the same thing, because all are for totalitarian rule and all are against God and Christ His King and all persecute the faithful followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. This evidence is cited to show the deadly conflict between Fascism and freedom.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Germany</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Germany the common people are peace-loving. The Devil has put his representative Hitler in control, a man who is of unsound mind, cruel, malicious and ruthless^ and who acts in utter disregard of the liberties of the people. Together with his backers, he rules with an iron hand. He cruelly persecutes the Jews because they were once Jehovah’s covenant people and bore the name of Jehovah, and because Christ Jesus was a Jew. Hitler has imprisoned thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses, the true followers of Christ Jesus, who have been guilty of nothing but advertising the kingdom of Christ. Many of those witnesses have been foully murdered while in Hitler prisons. In the persecution of Jews and of Christians, and in his arbitrary rule, Hitler has had the unqualified support of the Catholic Hierarchy. I here read into the record an article over the signature of a Catholic priest of Berlin, and which was published in the newspaper </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The German</span><span class="font8"> on May </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">29,</span><span class="font8">1938, which, amongst other things, says: ‘&quot;There is now one country on earth where the so-called . . . Bible Students [Jehovah’s witnesses] are forbidden. That is Germany! . . . The Catholic Church in Briining’s time urged to have [that sect suppressed]. ... When Adolph Hit</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ler </span><span class="font8">came to power, and the German Catholic Episcopate repeated their request, Hitler said; &quot;These so-called Earnest Bible Students [Jehovah’s witnesses] are troublemakers;. . . </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font8"> consider them quacks; I do not tolerate that the German Catholies shall be besmirched in such </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">manner by this American Judge Rutherford; I dissolve [Jehovah’s witnesses] in Ger-<sub>t </sub>many; their property I dedicate to the people’s welfare; I will have all their literature confiscated.’ [The priest adds,] Bravo! However, in the American Episcopate, even Cardinal Mundelein is not able to have Rutherford’s books . , . taken away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hitler and the pope entered into a contract </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font8">mutual operations and have worked together in Germany. When the Nazis marched into and seized Austria and destroyed the freedom of the people, there the Vatican betrayed the Austrians and fully supported Hitler in his ruthless act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Today Hitler and Mussolini, the arbitrary dictators, threaten the peace of the whole world, and they are fully supported in their destruction of freedom by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which fact is shown by the Catholic press today.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">The Communistic dictator arbitrarily rules Russia, and that country has put up a wall against all witnesses for the kingdom of God. The Catholic press of America tries to induce the people to believe that the Vatican is against Communism. But the f^cts show that the Hierarchy is willing to make an arrangement with any dictatorial or totalitarian power that will permit the Vatican to act as a kind of super-spiritual government and have the political element do its bidding. Note this, which appears in the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> July 26, 1938: ‘Mr. Forbes, executive secretary of the Communist party, proposed mutual co-operation between Communism and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy iff state affairs. In answer thereto the pope, acting through his cardinal and authoritative representative (Verdier) at Parks, made reply to the Communist party in these words: “If this gesture of the outstretched hand from your side expresses the wish to become better acquainted with your Catholic brothers in order to give better respect to the religion which inspires them to their convictions, their feelings, their works, then the church will not refuse to carry out this work of enlightenment and you will recognize that this can contribute greatly to the happiness of all.” To such generous offer from the pope the Communist party responded in these words: “The outstretched hand of the Communist party to the Catholic people remains outstretched.”’ This further was supported by Communistic leaflets distributed in New York yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These are not lying statements, as the Catholic press of America generally declares concerning all statements I make, but are plain truths which cannot he successfully contradicted. They are stated, not because of hate, but in order that the honest people, Catholics and non-Catholies, may see that the kingdom of.God under Christ is violently opposed by the greatest religious institution on earth, which falsely and blasphemously claims to represent .God and Christ, and which now ’ works desperately against the Kingdom of God and against the interest of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">America</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That it is the purpose of the religious organization named to destroy American freedom, I shall now prove, and in support thereof I quote from a letter of a Catholic priest, O’Brien, of Syracuse, New York, published in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">L’Aurora,</span><span class="font8"> as follows: “This land belongs consolation</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">of [his] strategy in guiding American Catholics [in Catholic Action] ... he has taught them to enlarge and remodel the Catholic press. . . . Catholic Action partakes of politics, and is a political penetration, an infiltration into the political world of a new force and agency. . . . Cardinal Pacelli, on behalf of His Holiness, . . . urged on the Knights [of Columbus] to . . , rally . . . Catholic manhood as necessary for the ‘practical solution of those problems of social and civil life ... ’ ” In 1930 Alfred E. Smith announced his belief “in the American doctrine of the absolute separation of Church and State”. “Pius XI • . . definitely repudiated the ‘absolute separation’ heresy of . . . Smith and enlarged upon the desirability of ‘union and association’ between Church and State.” The pope said: “Governments can assist the church greatly in the execution of its important office if in Laying down their ordinances they take account of what is prescribed by divine and ecclesiastical law, and if penalties are fixed for offenders....</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“A phase of present-day Catholic Action is the urging of Catholics to throw themselves into politics. . . . Catholic leaders ... do not advocate ... a separate Catholic party. . . . The church prefers to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">control legislators</span><span class="font8"> rather . than parties, and to avoid the odium and expense of running a distinct organization. But the church wants </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">plenty of high offices</span><span class="font8"> for her children. . . . The most sensational use of political power to force a Church issue was that of Archbishop Curley when he threatened the present administration, and President Roosevelt in particular. . . . When he took it upon himself to tell the President what he should do, and to threaten him with political extinction if he did otherwise, then Archbishop Curley was acting not merely as an ordinary politician but as a political dictator. ... It seems to be the policy of the church here to maintain intimate relations with politicians, and with State employees. As regards the latter, the police are first in favor with the Church . . . and that having them in their thousands in her tow she can all the more easily command politicians. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Who can place a limit to the Catholic objective in this country? Re-open diplomatic relations with Rome? Though gratified by such a .concession, why should Catholics be content with that? Accord to them the right of exclusive censorship over books, jdays, amusements and the Press. The church would accept such office without giving thanks for</span></p>

Now we demand what is reatly ours and we are going to have it; . . . peacefully, honestly, if we may; if necessary we are ready to fight and die for it. . . . We want as cabinet members children of the holy mother church holding important positions in the entire structure of our government. . . . From now on the Protestant heresies will receive the treatment ascribed to the Protestant heretics ... by our Canon laws. . . . We are ready prepared for 1940. . . . All . . . institutions . . . must be wiped out or placed under the protection of our Hierarchy ...” “All loyal children of the [Catholic] church [are] to assist our worthy President with all [our] strength to see that the individuals comprising the United States Supreme Court shall obey the Presi- . dent’s injunctions and if necessary we will change, amend or blot out the present Constitution so that the president may enforce . . . our humanitarian program on all phases of human rights as laid dowm by our saintly popes and the holy mother the church.” That traitorous statement has never been repudiated by the Hierarchy, and therefore has the Hierarchy’s approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conquest of America</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No one has ever tried to interfere with Catholics’ practicing their religion. The official Hierarchy has taken advantage of the liberty granted by the Constitution of the United States to use their religious organization as a political machine to gain control of the nation and to destroy the liberties of the people. Many honest and enlightened Catholics, seeing that the Vatican is bent on political conquest of America, have forsaken that religious organization and have taken their stand on the side of the Lord and righteousness. An ex-Jesuit priest of New York, Doctor E. Boyd Barrett, recently published his book entitled “Rome Stoops to Conquer”, and from that book I quote the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Pope Pius XI'. . . has given the best of his singular ability to the supervision and direction of the Catholic campaign in America. . . . [War is being waged in] the greatest struggle of the Church’s history. The conquest of America is the supreme objective at which he aims. . . . Pius is well aware that the Catholic church can never hope again to dominate the civilized world until America kneels, beaten and penitent, at her feet. . . . Characteristic </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 2, 1S3E</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">it, for she would regard it as her exclusive right to enjoy it. Amend the Constitution so as to allow State' Legislatures to apportion public moneys to the support of Catholic schools and institutions. The Church would grudgingly admit that a long-delayed obligation was being met by the country. Go further, and amend the Constitutipn so as to recognize the jurisdiction of her Ecclesiastical Courts and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">establish</span><span class="font8"> the Catholic Church as the official Church of America, At this point the Church would begin to relax and smile with content. But still she would demand more and more of us. . . . She would not ask for any measures to be taken against Protestant denominations as </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">long as they did not criticize her</span><span class="font8"> or cross her path or encourage Freemasonry . . . Protestant sects would be tolerated and treated in a kindly way </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">subject to what she would consider necessary and reasonable restrictions. . . </span><span class="font8">. Never was the Catholic Church </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">in any country</span><span class="font8"> in the world since Christendom began so rich, so highly organized, so influential, so loyally soldiered by her subjects as she is today in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That is plain language and strong proof that the Hierarchy in America is working hand in glove with the Fascists to grab control of the nation and to take away all the liberties of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Further Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I now submit the proof showing the Hierarchy putting into practice what Doctor Barrett says they intend to do. On September 11 last I delivered an address at London, which was broadcast to many countries. More than 100 radio stations in America broadcast that speech “Face the Facts”. To prevent the people from hearing the facts Catholic Action flooded many radio stations with threatening letters, and some stations, because of fear, yielded to their demands. In many places in the United States, Christians rented public halls, installed wireless equipment, and there peaceably assembled to hear the speech and to worship God in spirit and in truth. Catholic Action tried to -prevent such assemblies, and succeeded in a few instances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Chicago, where most of the public officials are Catholic and dominated by a cardinal, the Navy Pier auditorium was leased&quot; for the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses, and everything was in readiness, when Cardinal Mundelein's<sup>1</sup> representative demanded the cancellation of the lease and the prevention of this Christian assembly. Public officials yielded to that demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Rochester, New York, Commissioner McFarlin rented to Jehovah’s witnesses the city hall for their convention. Two days before the convention opened the Catholic priest, John Randall, acting under command of the bishop, demanded that the city cancel the lease, shut out Jehovah’s witnesses, and prevent their peaceable assembly, and the cancellation was made, and for one day this hall was closed against that Christian body. Then on application Justice Voorhis issued an Order of Court requiring the hall to be opened, and it was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Ottawa, Canada, the Coliseum was engaged for this convention of Christians. Ten days later notice was served on Jehovah’s wit-. . nesses by the Board of Control that the use of the Coliseum “is granted subject to there being no utterances made . . . against any church or religious denomination or those connected with churches or religious denominations”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Little Rock, Arkansas, the city council, at the instance of the Catholic bishop Morris and his organization of Knights of Columbus, prevented the peaceable assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in the public park for worship and to listen to the London lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Colorado Springs the Catholic clergy and other politicians signed a petition, falsely charging “that Rutherford is against Christianity and all it stands for, and the American flag, and the ideals it stands for”, and thereby induced the radio station to cancel its broadcast contract and the press to publish the libelous statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many other radio stations in the chain were bullied and threatened. As to the effect thereof I quote a letter of a radio manager, which is a sample of many others, addressed to the Watch Tower agency:. “We regret to advise that due to the prevalence of Catholicism in this territory we must refrain from taking the broadcast.” Many radio stations were threatened by Catholic priests if they broadcast the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New Orleans</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At New Orleans the Coliseum arena was leased for the assembly in convention of these Christian people to worship God and to hear the London speech. At the instance of the Catholic Hierarchy the doors of the Arena were locked and the literature of Jehovah’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION </span><span class="font8">witnesses withheld from them and they were prevented from assembling. Another hall was then engaged, and Catholic Action succeeded in having that hall closed to Jehovah’s witnesses. A third hall was taken, and while a local speaker was delivering a Bible lecture the audience was intimidated by a squad of police under the command of one McNamara. The fourth hall was rented, and a Catholic police squad stopped the installation of telephone wires in that building, and thus prevented the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses there to receive the London speech. Then the Jockey Club, outside the city limits, was leased for the peaceable assembly and worship by these Christians. Under pressure from the Catholic Hierarchy the parish sheriff prevented the installation of the telephone wires and the use of that place of assembly. Then, as a last resort, a private open-air lot was taken, and there on Sunday, September the 11th, a body of Christian people assembled peaceably and to worship God and to hear the London address. Electrical equipment bad been installed. A squad of police, under command of McNamara was on the ground before the audience arrived. McNamara, under the direction of the Catholic Hierarchy, stepped forward and excitedly ericd out to the audience assembled: “Stand back”; and then, turning to his police squad, he gave this command: “Men, when the lecture starts stop it, even if you have to break the electrical equipment; and the first man who interferes, shoot to kill.” When the lecture began at London, McNamara himself cut the telephone wires, disabled the electrical equipment, and, while he was doing so, the police squad stood with their hands on their guns, and thus the people again were forcibly prevented to peaceably assemble, freely worship and exercise freedom of speech. Immediately following this highhanded and unlawful action the Catholic newspaper known as </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Action of the South,</span><span class="font8"> edited by the “Right Reverend” Wynhoven, published the following: “It is indeed a source of deep gratification that notwithstanding the persistent efforts of the witnesses of Jehovah, their three-day convention in New Orleans was frustrated. .. . Practically every large hall in the city was denied them. . . . The chief of police’s office and the sheriff of Jefferson Parish unhesitatingly stepped in to stop 'effectively this insult to New Orleans.” The Federal Court is preventing a repetition today of such unlawful acts, but Wynhoven won’t publish that</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER!, 1938 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The proof is therefore conclusive that the Catholic Hierarchy was back of the unlawful action in breaking up a peaceable assembly of Christians gathered together for worship of Almighty God. This is further and conclusive proof that the Hierarchy is against God and against His kingdom under Christ and is working in league with Fascism to destroy the liberties of the people. The Hierarchy has bullied and bluffed and threatened and put fear into the public press and the owners of many radio stations, to prevent the people from hearing the truth. Honest, sincere Catholics do not endorse such highhanded and unlawful action, and they, seeing that the Hierarchy has turned the organization into a political machine and is robbing the people and using the money to destroy their liberties, these honest Catholics are forsaking the Hierarchy and turning themselves to God and to His kingdom. This action of honest Catholics greatly angers the Hierarchy. And their priests and press howl. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Advance in America</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Calmly now consider the length to which Fascist-Hierarchy rule has advanced in America: Catholic priests boldly declare that the government of the United States shall be seized in 1940; threaten to compel the United States Supreme Court to obey the demands of the Hierarchy; threaten to amend or destroy the Constitution as best suits the convenience of the Hierarchy; threaten Protestants with violence who dare oppbse the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Hierarchy, as stated by Doctor Barrett, has been turned into a political machine which prefers to control legislators rather than have a separate party, and to have many important offices in the government; a Catholic bishop arrogantly threatens the president of the United States unless he conforms to the will of the Hierarchy. The public press and many radio stations are browbeaten into silence as against the Hierarchy’s crooked work; Protestant clergy have been induced to remain silent; the Jews are frightened into submission and silence; and now the only class of men on earth who have faith and courage to tell the truth are persecuted, imprisoned, threatened, their peaceable assemblies broken up, and their freedom of worship and freedom of speech denied! Does it not appear that liberties of the American people are about all gone? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">9</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the people are told the facts about a crowd that is operating under a religious cloak to steal their rights, the Hierarchy howls and says: “Lies! Put a gag in the mouths of those and do not permit them to speak.” Honest Catholics and honest men of all faiths are against such highhanded action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Is it wrong to publish the truth concerning a bunch of hijackers that are robbing the people? No! Then is it wrong to publish the truth concerning a religious organization, operating hypocritically and doing the same thing? Americans have heretofore been at liberty to express' themselves freely on public matters. No sane man in America would desire to do the president any personal harm, but many sincere and honest Americans properly criticize the policy of the president, and the newspapers and the radio stations are not forbidden to publish’ such criticism. Is the Hierarchy so sacred that it has greater privileges than the president of the United States? What right has Rome to tell the Americans that they cannot publish the truth about the despoilers of the people? Shall honest men be gagged and compelled to remain silent while this bunch of hijackers destroy the liberties of the people? Above all, shall the people be denied their God-given privileges of peaceable assembly and freedom of worship of Almighty God, and freedom of speech concerning His kingdom and those who oppose it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Are Jehovah’s witnesses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are not a sect and are not religionists. They are Christians. They are made up of those who have come from Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and those outside of all religious organizations. They are men and women who Jove righteousness and truth and hate wickedness. They are not politicians. They are not kingdom builders, because God builds His kingdom. As John the Baptist was, so are Jehovah’s witnesses, “a voice in the wilderness crying out” to the people and warning them that their only means of escape, safety and salvation is by placing themselves under Jehovah’s King, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is written in the Word of God: “The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso put-tetb his trust in the Lord shall be safe.” (Proverbs 29:25) Protestants, Jews, many radio station owners and others, by reason of fear of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, have been led into the snare of Satan, gagged, and are</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">10</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">bound hand and foot. Jehovah’s witnesses, and' all others who love righteousness and who love God, now serve notice on the FascistHierarchy combine that they will not, because of fear, yield to that totalitarian rule and will not remain silent and refrain from testifying to God’s kingdom. They believe and trust wholly in the Lord God, and Him they will obey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since the appearing of that hideous monstrosity, the totalitarian rule, the liberties of the people have rapidly vanished, and everincreasing woes have come upon the nations. Among such woes and crimes are these, to wit: The rape of Abyssinia; the wanton slaughter of innocents in Spain; the cruel persecution of Jews and Christians in Germany and Italy; and now the unwarranted assault upon Czechoslovakia; and the malicious attempt to destroy the liberties of the people of Britain and America. When the storm of insanity and tribulation has passed, the true history of the world will be written under sane conditions. It will then fully appear that the men more reprehensible and therefore chiefly responsible for such crimes and woes are the men who compose the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, headed by the present pope, who inaugurated “Catholic Action”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The head of the Hierarchy appears to be an adept in getting in line with his political allies. Within an hour after the fate of Czechoslovakia had been fixed with the consent of the pope’s allies, and in order to magnify the importance of the religious element of*the alliance, the pope calls upon the faithful Catholics to pray for peace. It did not seem to him advisable to pray for peace when Italy was murdering the Abyssinians, when the rebel Franco and other Fascists were slaying and continuing to slay thousands of innocents in Spain, nor when his friend Hitler grabbed Austria and drove out defenseless Jews and Christians. Now he prays that Hitler may not be disturbed while stealing Czechoslovakia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For centuries it has been the desire of the head of the Catholic Hierarchy to rule the world as a spiritual overlord. That unsatisfied ambition has led the Vatican to stoop to the worst kind of politics to accomplish their wrongful and blasphemous purpose. When such conscienceless men, while carrying on their nefarious work, hypocritically claim to be the representatives of Jehovah God and Christ, they are guilty of the greatest blas</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSOLATION </span><span class="font8">phemy against God’s name that has ever been uttered under the sun. Honest Catholics will now give heed to God’s warning, flee from that religious makeshift, and find rest, liberty and life under Christ the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Last Days</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christians fully realize that these are the last days and hence the time of great peril. In the Scriptures it is written (2 Timothy 3:1-5): ‘‘This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, . . . traitors, . . . having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof; from such turn away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These words exactly describe the Hierarchy combine. If the men of the Hierarchy really loved God and His kingdom, they would not try to control the polities of the world and to destroy the liberties of the people. By trying to rule the world the Hierarchy denies the power of God to set up His kingdom as He has promised. The fact that they do practice a form of religion, claiming to serve God and at the same time opposing His kingdom and joining with others to arbitrarily rule mankind, is proof conclusive that they are the enemies of man and of God; and the Lord admonishes the people to turn away from such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fact that the Fascist Hierarchy claims the right to rule the world in the place of God’s King, Christ Jesus, is also proof that such com bination constitutes the “abomination of desolation”, which God by His prophet named and foretold would arise in these days. (Daniel 11:31; 12:11) To the honest people the Lord sdys: “When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, ... then let them that be in Judrna flee to the mountains [that is, to the kingdom of God under Christ].” “For, then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the w<sup>f</sup>orld to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” —Mark 13:14; Matthew 24:15-21. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Seeing, then, that the liberties of the people are being taken away by that religiousFascist combine, which stands where it ought not to stand, claiming the right to rule the nations of the world, then all who would live must take heed to this admonition of the Lord and flee to God’s: kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Men cannot stop the onward march of the Hierarchy-Fascists now. It has gone too far! The Lord is permitting it to come to a climax</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 2, 193B </span><span class="font8">to serve His own purposes. Now the only possible place of safety is under the protection of Christ’s kingdom, because God has declared His purpose to soon act and to completely destroy everything that opposes His kingdom. The Fascist Hierarchy presume that they shall now gain and for ever control the world; and when they think that they have silenced completely the people that are for God’s kingdom, then, as it is written in the Scriptures, they will felicitate each other and say : “We .are at peace and in safety.” Note, then, what the Lord’s Word says about this, at 1 Thessalonians 5:3: “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction eometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.” Such disaster will befall them at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Write Radio Stations</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In view of these facts and for the encouragement of the radio stations that do broadcast this speech in the public interest, I earnestly urge upon all listeners, Jehovah’s witnesses and all others who love liberty and righteousness, to immediately send letters to the radio station to which you are listening, expressing your hearty approval of their broadcasting this speech. Let the radio stations know that there are yet many Americans who love the principles of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom of worship, which are guaranteed by the American Constitution and commanded by the Most High God. Furthermore, 1 invite the radio stations that stand for American principles, and who are against Fascism, to advise me by wire or letter that they are willing to again broadcast the truth for the benefit of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let the Fascist-Catholic Hierarchy know that this is the land of America, and not Rome; that they may freely practice their religion here amongst those who like it; </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font8">that they cannot use their religious institution as a political machine to turn over to the fanatical dictators the American government and take away all the liberties of the people. The Catholic press persist in lying about me and saying that I am engaged in a campaign of hate. But, together with others of Jehovah’s witnesses, we are fighting for the principles of righteousness which are loved by all honest people regardless of previous faith. What Jehovah God has commanded us to do, that we will do regardless of opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">11</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We are certain that the will of God is that a hypocritical, religious organization shall not destroy freedom of worship and freedom of speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Foreknowing this day of great crisis, when dictators would destroy peoples’ rights, Jesus addressed himself to cruel religious leaders of all time. His words, thereby announcing with the greatest force fixed principles of Jehovah, now apply to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and to all others who use religion to further their selfish interests. He says to those religious leaders who are against God’s., kingdom under Christ; ‘Woe unto you, Catholic clergy, hypocrites<sub>;</sub> for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for ye enter not in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. . . . Fill up ye then the ' measure of your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell? . . . Upon you shall come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth.’— Matthew 23: 13-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Fanatical Fascists and Nazi dictators, with the aid and co-operation of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy at Vatican City, are now wrecking continental Europe. They may for a brief period of- time gain control of the British Empire and of America, and then, God declares, He will act and through Christ Jesus, His great Executive Officer and Executioner, will completely destroy all such organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then the people who obey God and Christ shall survive and live for-ever in peace and happiness and will fill the earth with a righteous people, all to the praise of Jehovah. Choose ye, therefore, whom ye will serve! Shall we have Fascistic Catholicism, slavery and death? </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Oli</span><span class="font8"> shall we embrace Christ and His kingdom and receive true freedom and everlasting life? It is not within your power to stop the onward march of the wicked, but it is your privilege to flee to God and to His kingdom under Christ and thus find security, refuge and salvation; and let this warning be sounded now again in the language of God’s prophet Jeremiah (21:8,9; 38:2), that all who do not flee to and obey His King, Christ Jesus, shall suffer destruction at the battle of Armageddon, which is near at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Consider now briefly what God’s kingdom means for the people. When Satan defied God to put men on earth who would remain faithful and true, Jehovah said to the&quot; Devil.- ‘Instead of destroying you now, I will permit you to remain for a time, that I may have my name declared amongst all the nations, and then I will show you my power.’ (Exodus 9:16) God then declared His purpose that in His due time He would redeem man and send Christ Jesus to set up His kingdom. . God’s purpose cannot fail 1 He has said: “I have purposed it, I will also do it,” (Isaiah .46:11) Jehovah proceeds according to His own sovereign will. He sent Jesus to earth, who gave His life as a redemptive price for those human creatures who do prove their</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&lt; integrity toward Jehovah. Jesus instructed His followers that in God’s due time He would return and set up His kingdom of righteousness. Knowing that the kingdom is God’s means for the blessing of the people, Jesus taught His followers to pray to Jehovah this prayer: ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven.’ That means that God’s will shall be done on earth in His due time, and His will is always righteous. Christians and religionists still utter this prayer, but only true Christians sincerely desire the fulfillment of the prayer. They rely solely upon God and His King and kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was in 1914 that Jehovah enthroned Christ as the invisible Ruler of the world. (Psalm 110:2) Before destroying Satan, Jehovah, according to His Word, eaitses His name to be proclaimed throughout the earth in order that all persons of good will toward Him may hear and learn the truth and flee from religious organizations and find refuge and safety under the Lord’s kingdom. That testimony Is now being given. Only the Devil could so violently oppose that testimony, and hence he uses his religious representatives to oppose it and t« persecute God’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You people of good will have had all the sorrow you want .to have. You desire to see righteousness rule in the earth, that you may dwell in peace with your children and your neighbors. You hate strife, war, and oppression. The Lord’s kingdom will bring to pass the desire of all honest hearts for peace and prosperity. You believe that the Bible is God’s Word. Then hear what He says to you about His kingdom and His King. “Unto [youj a son [King] is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder ;■ and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace; of the increase of his government arid peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">there shall be no end.” (Isa. 9:6,7) “And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghouks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” (Isaiah 2: 4) “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.”—Isaiah 32:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy have kept you in ignorance of these precious promises recorded in the Bible, because they want to rule and to exploit you. When one calls attention to God’s warning against hypocrisy, deceit and oppression practiced in the religious systems and to God’s good promises to the obedient ones of mankind, then the Hierarchy, having no reasonable or Scriptural answer thereto, howl these words: ‘Those things are all lies. The people should not read the Bible, but hear only what Hhe. Catholic priests say.’ These religious leaders rob you of your money, your freedom of thought, and freedom of action, and greatly oppress you, and Christ alone can and will relieve you, as it is written : “He shall judge the poor of the people, . , , and shall break in pieces the oppressor.” (Fsalm 72:4) Furthermore God says to the obedient ones: “Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him ; that glory may dwell in our land. Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. Truth shall spring out of the earth and righteous-mess shall look down from heaven. Yea, the Lord-shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her in crease.’’-Psalm 85: 9-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Which, then, will you choose, the Devil’s rule of Fascist Hierarchy OR freedom under the righteous reign of Christ? Let those who want to see righteousness in the earth make this their Declaration:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Declaration</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We give thanks to Almighty God that He has brought to our attention His Word of truth. We love righteousness and choose to serve Jehovah God and His King, Christ Jesus. In obedience to His commandment we do now forsake hypocritical, religious institutions, turn to God and Christ His King, and henceforth we will seek righteousness and meekness as God has commanded, that we may receive protection, peace and life everlasting, and that we may share in the vindication of God’s name. We recognize that God’s kingdom is a theocracy, which is holy, righteous and true, and we delight to put ourselves under the Lord and gladly obey His righteous rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your letter of the 3rdf addressed to Judge Rutherford has been received in this office. You say, “I stu tabled onto station WFAS which was broadcasting your rotten tirade of lies and hatred”. That is a sample of how you reach almost everything: as it appears from your letter, you just stumble on to them, but it seems that you never fall near the truth. You accuse Judge Rutherford of broadcasting asinine, ridiculous, childish and malicious lies and yet you do not cite a single, statement that he made that is untrue. Manifestly you are a very ignorant man and your own letter will show on careful examination that you never reach a conclusion after mature deliberation, as you will see further on as shown up in this letter. Referring to Judge Rutherford’s speech Sunday, he cited the Concordat entered into between the Pope and Mussolini, also the Concordat entered into between the Pope and Hitler, also the agreement of Hitler arid the Pope about Hitler entering and grabbing Austria, all of which are historic facts well known to every man who is informed about what is printed. He cited the endorsement of the Pope that was given, to Mussolini in destroying Abyssinia; he cited the Pope’s approval of the war of rebellion by Franco ip Spain and of the Pope’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">approval of the war being carried on by Japan against China. These are also historic facts well known by every man of any common, sense who is informed on current history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Rutherford stated further facts from Dr. E. Boyd Barrett's book, who for many years has been a Catholic and knows the inside of that organization, and he quoted from the book literally. Evidently Dr. Boyd knows more about the Hierarchy than you do. He quoted “The German” newspaper which published a Catholic priest’s letter in which Hitler says, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font8"> will not tolerate the German Catholics' being besmirched in this country by Jehovah’s witnesses.” He quoted a letter from the Catholic priest O’Brien of Syracuse published in *1.7Aurora”; he also quoted “The New York Times” of July 26, 1938, which published the statement of Mr. Forbes, Executive Secretary of the Communist Party, and the response thereto by the Pope’s Cardinal Verdier. These surely cannot all be lies and rot or else all these newspapers and cardinals and priests and writers of books are liars. He then submitted evidence showing that officials of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in Chicago, Rochester, New York, Ottawa, Canada, Little Rock, Arkansas, Colorado Springs, New Orleans, attempted to break up the peaceable assembly of Christian people on the 11th day of September last. He cited the Court Injunction issued by Judge Van Voorhis of Rochester which compelled the opposition to release the hall which they had taken away from Jehovah’s witnesses there. He quoted the order of the United States Court at New Orleans which compelled the Catholic Hierarchy officials there to cease their opposition to holding a meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses. These are matters of public record and not merely opinion, and when you call a man like Judge Rutherford a liar you ought to be well fortified because he doesn’t tell lies and doesn’t have to tell them but relies wholly on the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You conclude your letter with a postscript saying, “What is your answer to the letter in the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8">referring to the clipping which you enclosed. This same clipping I am returning to you and this proves conclusively that you “stumble” on to things and stumble over them and don’t look at the real facts. The letter you refer to is one written by the bishops, taking issue with the German god and setting forth the Catholic view of religion; but note again that that letter was issued and published on the 19th day of August, 1933, that it was sent out and published by the National Catholic Welfare Conference News’ Bureau and printed in The Catholic News. Now, doesn’t it seem rather peculiar to a reasonable man that this would</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A star in the parochial school</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">appear in “The New York Times” first on Monday, October the 3rd? “The New York Times” reporters had heard Judge Rutherford’s speech and a Catholic reporter was there. There is no possible answer to the truth of Judge Rutherford’s speech; so as an attempt to offset it and befuddle such ignoramuses as yourself that appeared in “The New York Times”, and you read the headlines and jumped at a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If you have looked at “The New York</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Times” of Sunday, October the 2nd, 1938, in the second part of section one, on page 33, beginning with column 3 and ending with column 6, you might have been enlightened a little further concerning the harmonious action of the Hierarchy with Hitler. There you will see that Hitler entered Berlin in great triumph and that there were also present to welcome him Fascists garbed in Italian uniforms and with a Fascist band. Among those who sent congratulatory telegrams to Hitler on the occasion was the rebel Francisco Franco and last but not the least noteworthy are the congratulations sent to Hitler on that occasion by the German Catholic Hierarchy, and, as the paper states, “It was signed by all the German Cardinals”, and that letter amongst other things congratulates Hitler “in the name of the diocesans of all the dioceses in Germany, congratulations and thanks and to order the festive pealing of bells Sunday”. That letter must have been prepared in advance in anticipation of Hitler’s triumphal entry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now', don’t you see that you have made a blind ass of yourself? You have kicked and brayed without knowing the reason why, only because you heard a man telling the truth about an un-American institution, namely, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, that has forsaken its one-time devotion to its church and is now given over wholly to polities to grab the American government. You ought to be so shamefaced that you would go out and wash your face and sit down and meditate as to how you can square yourself with the Lord. I am taking occasion to gall your attention to these things that you may have an opportunity to repent of your unwarranted, slanderous, libelous, vicious and indecent language used against a man who is doing more good for American principles and righteousness than any other one man in America. This is an answer concerning “The New York Times”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am certain that it is wholly immaterial to Judge Rutherford whether you believe a thing he says or not. He states the truth. He is not trying to get anybody to join him, but he is calling to the attention of the people in America, Catholics or non-Catholics, that they are being grossly deceived and maligned by the worst bunch of enemies America has ever had, namely, the crowd of Italian politicians operating out of Vatican City. Take this or leave it, just as you choose. You will have to </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBERS, 1938 </span><span class="font8">bear the responsibility of whatever course you take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Respectfully, (Signed) Ed Keller</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Assistant Sec'y</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">P. </span><span class="font8">S. Now, honestly, did you hear any part of that speech, or did some Catholic priest to whom you bow and pay tribute ask you to write this scurrilous letter? If you are really honest and sincere you will give careful consideration to what is here said and then you might wake up and save yourself instead of being blindly led by a bunch of men who are your real enemies. Judge Rutherford is not interested in getting anybody to join him. It </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font8">nothing to him. He does not carry on any hate. He is stating the facts for the benefit of the.people who want to be honest and who want to do the right thing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Premier Hodza, of Czechoslovakia, had the people with him, and called in good shape the bluff of the late “Reverend Father” Hlinka. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font8">invited the men in Hitler’s pay to come up on the platform and discuss with him publicly the question of which'is better, the democracy which the whole country then enjoyed or the autonomy demanded by Hlinka, which is really nothing more nor less than a dictatorship. The farmers laughed at their Hitler-subsidized leaders and cheered Hodza to the echo. In due course of time, as soon as space permits, there will appear in these columns the evidence that the betrayal of Czechoslovakia was caused by the Roman Hierarchy, working through its tool, Henlein—Hitler’s stooge. Henlein talked too much on one occasion and gave the whole thing away.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Publisher Aboard Ship (II) </span><span class="font8">The Dutch are very humble and sincere, and, generally speaking, have a deep reverence for Jehovah God and His message. Many are very much disturbed as they look around them from their little country and see the ravages of religion gone mad and the orgy of murder that it incites. Most of those on the great liners of the Hol land-American line have a healthy hatred of the Hierarchy and eagerly turn towards the Kingdom when they see the difference between religion and Christianity. In recent months their five big ships have been visited several times, and, by the Lord’s grace,, there are now 85 books and 321 booklets in the Holland!sh tongue on board, while some Hollandish records have given them a further appreciation of the work. Many of the booklets are </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cure,</span><span class="font8"> and they like it real well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One afternoon I took the phonograph down to the stewards’ messroom in the Veendam. This is situated far beneath the water line, and, the day being a hot one, the temperature was almost unbearable down there, being well over 100 degrees. But the men didn’t mind, and, stripped to the waist, eagerly listened to the lecture ‘‘Truth” in Dutch. I would wait until about 20 men had filled the messroom and were taking their tea, and would then start, up the record. At once there was respectful silence, the few who still persisted in talking being quickly silenced by the rest, who wanted to hear. The books and booklets were arranged on one of the tables near the machine, and at the end many came up and took literature. When that gang was through and the next lot came in the procedure was repeated, and 46 heard the record there that afternoon. Several came up and expressed their thanks for the information they had heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At a later visit on this same ship with </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cure </span><span class="font8">there seemed to be little interest until the attention of the men was drawn to the heading, in Dutch, that shows religion to be a racket, and also that it was the intention of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">16 </span><span class="font8">the Roman Hierarchy to grab control of the whole earth. Immediately there was a change, and the ones that had previously turned down the booklet now came up for it and promised to study it very carefully. There were three cooks listlessly leaning over a rail and looking the picture of gloom. Their attention was called to the same passages in the booklet, and immediately they brightened up. One turned to me then with a bright smile and said, “This fine!” It made one feel real glad to have a small part in this work as all around men could be seen deeply immersed in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is intense interest on the beautiful new flagship the Nieuw Amsterdam, which was visited on its first two trips and which also has its share of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font8"> and bound books, and where a phonograph meeting on the sec-ond'trip was much appreciated. The boys in that cabin made me solemnly promise before I left that they should get </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font8"> just as soon as it was ready for them in Dutch. They got it, and there was much rejoicing. There also reposes gracefully in the first-class library a full set of the volumes, in English, left by another witness. Their gay, attractive colors stand out in bold relief and command the attention of the casual observer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This ship is the last word in comfort in the modern manner. The crews’ quarters are so fine that one would think he was in the passenger accommodation but for the signs above each cabin, or “hut”, as they are called there. Each messrooin has a loudspeaker that is connected to one central radio set so that the men can have entertainment without cost. There are actually escalators running from the galley to the dining saloon, to make for more efficient service. The large galley itself reminds one of a department store, with its many counters and a sign over each, such as -Meat,' b'ish, Vegetables, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On these Holland-American liners, each captain now has the books. The captain of the Rotterdam got his under rather peculiar conditions. Some of the stewards aboard had told me that if I went up to the skipper he would be the last person I would see on the ship, meaning that he didn’t like the work and would throw me off. I went up notwithstanding this friendly advice, and a steward took in the testimony card for the captain to read. After a muttered conversation out came the steward and said the captain would like to see my pass, please. Somewhat apprehensively consolation I sent it in, and soon the steward reappeared with the ear'd, the pass and fifty cents, and said that the captain would like another book like that one. So it doesn’t always do to believe what one hears!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The other two big vessels of that line are the Volendam, where the men are very friendly and meek, and the Statendam, which was the flagship of the line before the advent of the Nieuw Amsterdam, and where the interest is on the upgrade, there being much literature scattered all over the ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just one more incident concerning the Nieuw Amsterdam, in passing. While seated in a messroom there and trying, in a mixture of broken English and French, to explain something further concerning the organization to a couple of interested stewards I felt something sail past my ear, and looked down to see a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font8"> booklet lying there. On making an effort to find out who had treated the message with such contempt the way was opened to place three more bound books to bystanders who had seen this.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The Belgian line has both French and I )utch in the crews of its ships, in about equal proportions. It is quite a common thing to play a French record for the French-speaking half of a group and then follow it with the same subject in the Hollandish tongue for their comrades. Sometimes the only way to explain the contents of a Dutch book to a Belgian is to do so in French. On this line there is a vast difference in each ship: on some the crews are really glad to hear and receive the truth, while on others they are strongly Catholic and manifest their venom in a series of spiteful actions and sneers.—Erie W.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom Privileges tn Near East (III) </span><span class="font8">♦ In the month of January we decided on an expedition to northern Syria with four witnesses. We started out of Tripoli and when we were halfway across we discovered that because of the heavy rains the main bridge was washed away and we had to drive back ninety miles and go by the island of Rwaad near Laedocia, Tartoos. On our way to this country we drove through a city of 7,000 population called Burjj Saffita. Just as we were ready to leave town we put on two records. The people were excited and started to leave their homes. The animals in the field, even, were frightened, including the one that wore the dog collar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After passing this town we were told that another bridge was washed out but we could ford the river, which was about seventy feet wide. A witness who was with us was familiar with that country, and so we attempted to cross the river. We got within ten feet of the other side when the water almost carried us away. The engine stopped dead and one witness managed to get out of the car and go to the next town to sound the alarm. About twenty people came to our rescue and we paid them the sum of $1.40 to pull us out of the river. They thought that was the best pay they had ever had. We gave them a witness and went on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We had to pass through many crocks</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">and small rivers, as many of the bridges had been washed out, due to the incessant rains whichhad swept the country and which had done a great amount of damage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When we reached the town called Aamar Elhuson Akar, we were met by several witnesses, who carried the sound equipment to one of their homes, but we were forced to leave the automobile parked between two Catholic churches. We went to the home of a Jouadab worker, and practically the entire town came to this house and we gave a splendid witness with the phonograph and talked until eleven o’clock answering questions after playing the phonograph for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The following morning, when we endeavored to start the automobile some trouble was encountered, due to the fact that someone had disconnected some wires. Then the priest sent out the report that it was the Lady of our Lord who had paralyzed the automobile so that, it would not start. We tried to push it, but all in vain. However, after some search, I finally located the trouble and we started</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">the automobile. The priest, turned his head in shame and walked away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The next day the town invited us to put on the sound equipment, which we did. We started with “Exposed”, and when we had played four records the Catholic priest enticed some hoodlums to pull the cord from the sound equipment and tried to stir up trouble. The priest came with a big stick in his hand ready to strike me, but I talked gently and kindly to him and called his attention to the fact that he was not showing the spirit of the Lord and that the Bible admonishes to love our enemies and do good unto them that hate you. The calmer and kinder I was to him, the more angry he became.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I finally asked him to state his objection, and he said we were attacking the Roman Catholic Church. I asked him if he believed his own doctrines, and he stated that he did; and I asked him if he would like to hear some of his own doctrines discussed. He said, “Certainly,” So we told him to listen to the next part of the program. Then we proceeded to read out of the booklet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered,</span><span class="font8"> quoting from </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font8"> [Roman] </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font8"> in fact, reading word for word, and particularly calling his attention to quotations regarding “purgatory”, etc., emphasizing the question as to whether he really believed that. He answered in the affirmative. I got him to agree that we were not really attacking the Roman Catholic Church, but were presenting the facts regarding Bible truths and then letting the people decide for themselves. Finally, the peo-pie who were listening became so incensed against the priest that they ordered him to leave or they would kill him. When he would not leave they attempted to throw him over the cliff, and then asked us to continue with the program. When we finished the “Exposed” lectures, they asked for “Religion and Christianity”. As a result we were able to place many pieces of literature with them and the people invited us to call at their homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I spent two days in the town endeavoring to establish a study, as we had several witnesses living there who were not organized for service. By the Lord’s grace we gathered fourteen witnesses together and organized them into a company, and they now meet together to study. They are really charged with the zeal of Jehovah that is peculiar to the house of, the Lord. Since then there have been added to their number twelve more who have taken their stand on the side of the King of Eter-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">nity. Also, I was able to leave one phonograph and eighteen records with a Jonadab, who has put them to good use. When we were ready to leave this town the people asked us to put on some more records, and they prepared a farewell party for- us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We proceeded on, and everywhere we tvent the people welcomed the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The witnesses are now better organized than ever before in this part of the world, and are determined to serve the King of Eternity to the best of their ability, regardless of opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy really controls the governments both of Syria and of Lebanon and are doing their utmost to stop the message, but, as the prophet of the Most High God said, “no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against -thee in judgment thou .shalt condemn.”—Joseph E. Rahal, Ohio.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Jesus said; ‘Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd.’ The fulfillment of this scripture today brings much joy to the Lord’s people as they engage in the work of witnessing to persons of good will concerning Jehovah’s kingdom; For some time the Lord has seen fit to use the radio as one of the means of getting the Kingdom message to the people, particularly the Watchtower station WBBR, which is in fact the Lord’s station, because it is devoted entirely to publicizing Cod’s kingdom. So when letters such as the following are received they touch with appreciation the hearts of those who have a part in this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gentlemen:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Listening to your radio program every time it is on the air. I would like to obtain Judge Rutherford’s books and all about the Kingdom under our Lord. Could you also supply me with a good Bible? I will be very much pleased if you can give me full particulars; and, please, where can I get in touch with Jehovah’s witnesses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sincerely yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">[Signed] ■—-------</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So radio enters countless homes unknown to us, carrying Jehovah’s message of comfort to the Lord’s “othep sheep”. Just how many have been interested in God’s kingdom by radio, we shall probably never know.</span></p>

Another way to increase the passenger-carrying capacity of the cars would be to strap each passenger’s arms around his waist and strap his legs together and pile the commuters up like cord wood. If this last idea is adopted, care should be taken that the feet are all at one end. After a while the expert trainmen will get to know the size of shoes of each passenger and the riders can be thrown off at their proper stations with very little delay. The straps around their arms will prevent them from kicking, biting, scratching and pulling hair. A further improvement would be to have a separate rack for piling the passengers for each station.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">To be Nationalist in Quebec is al-PBLRT’ most synonymous with being a eor-poratist. The Catholic Church and MKfl its various control organizations— Catholic syndicates, the A. D. J. C. (Federation of Catholic Youth Organizations), </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">L'Ecole Socials Populaire,</span><span class="font8"> an institution for education and propaganda sponsored by the Jesuits, the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Parti National</span><span class="font8"> and the various newspapers controlled by these organizations or supporting them, are ail definitely for the corporate state. Duplessis and Gouin, too, have at various times paid tribute to the idea. The scope of the corporatist movement, combined with the undemocratic character of recent Legislation, has convinced certain observers that Quebec is rapidly being transformed into a Fascist state. While there is. need for apprehension, in the opinion of the author this view is exaggerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The corporatist movement in Quebec bdses itself upon the labor program of the Catholic Church as enunciated by Pope Pius XI in his encyclical, Quadragesimo Anno, In 1934, at the behest of the Church and the Catholic syndicates, the Taschereau government enacted the Arcand Law. This law provided for the extension of labor contracts to cover the entire industry concerned, upon the application to the government of one of the parties to the contract; and provided further for the establishment of joint committees of employees and employers to supervise the extension of the contract to each industry. The Church viewed the measure as an important step towards the corporate state, in which labor and capital will be compelled to settle their differences wfithin the framework of joint committees, or the corporations, rather than through the class struggle. The further development . of their program called for the expansion of the powers of the committees established in virtue of the law and, in addition, for their gradual subordination to government control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But while the setup under the Arcand Law bore some resemblance to Fascist corporatism, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">20</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">there existed the fundamental distinction that the unions still retained their independence and still retained their right to strike. And while the Nationalist movement in Quebec may have many points in common with Fascist movements elsewhere—its extreme nationalism, its anti-trust demagogy, its virulent anti - Communist and even anti-democratic stand, its primitive anti-Semitism, its corporatism, its open sympathy for European Fascism—nevertheless, it is still necessary to characterize it as an incipient rather than as a definitely Fascist movement.-Cwrent </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">History.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ I enclose two photographs of Canadian chaplains. One of these religious bastards has eight medals on his breast; the other has three. During the World War I was in the front-line drenches thirty-eight months and never saw a priest or parson during that time; the decorations shown are for gorging themselves with food intended for the real soldiers 100 miles in front. Take a peep at the following, from the London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald: •</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On October 28, 1935, the Milan cathedral was crowded with Mussolini’s troops, who were about to leave for Ethiopia. Cardinal Schuster talked to the men, and his words express plainly the Church’s satisfaction with Fascism’s war of aggression in .Eastern Africa. His words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Let us co-operate with God in this moment in which the standard of Italy carries on to the battlefields of Abyssinia the eross of Christ, severs the chains of the slaves, and smooths the roads for the missionaries of the Gospel. Let us cultivate in us and others this good faith, and God will give us the reward: peace. . . . Peace and protection to the valorous army, that in obedience to the command of the country opens the doors of Ethiopia to the Catholic faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the cardinal finished his address he presented to each soldier an “oriflamrne” (which he , had blessed) carrying the slogan “Noi tireromo di-ritto”, meaning “We shall shoot straight”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That’s a fine demonstration of warlessness, and Mr. Ratti (the pope) approves of the slaughter of Spanish Roman Catholics by Franco’s Mohammedan bandits, and of Japan’s brigandage in China, and urged Dollfuss to massacre the Catholic workers of Vienna. This is the old bandit that tries to make honest people believe that he is God’s professional manager on earth, I believe that Mussolini and Hitler are paragons of virtue compared to the big chiefs at the Vatican.—Patrick Sullivan, Canada.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ A friend in Canada writes in enclosing a copy of the Toronto </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star,</span><span class="font8"> May 3, 1938, bearing the following headlines:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Takes too long in paying masses for relatives. Mr. Justice .Chevrier gives Leonidas Lefebre 4 months to pay $142.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The learned judge in the case ruled as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">True, there is nothing in the agreement that says within what period such masses are to be said, but by virtue of their very purpose and nature it is obvious that they should be paid for and celebrated with the least possible delay after the decease of the one for whose benefit they were ordered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That is all plain enough. The priest in the case wanted to use the money, and the judge wanted him to have it, but now see 'what the correspondent of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font8"> has to say. He should shame himself to make such reflections on the clergy and the judiciary, and especially on the unholy combination of bribery and brimstone known ' as “Purgatory”, but what he said was:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">What will those poor souls think when they find they have been hijacked?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is bad enough to be jacked into “Purgatory”, when there is no such place. It is still worse to feel the terrible heat in such a place, when there is no place to contain the heat and .no heat to contain. It is a further insult to know, when one is in such a place that doesn’t exist, and in such a fire that also doesn’t exist, that the money that was to be paid to turn down the heat, and give the priest something wherewith to-back up his hand in his next poker game, was not paid on time, and no time was specified, and finally that a judge had to be rung in and get the whole swindle in the newspapers and make everybody laugh to see such sport.

<p><span class="font8">♦ The rush of the Roman Hierarchy to grab control of the whole world right now, and not at some far-off future time, is well planned. It was no mere accident that the latest Eu-eharistie Congress of Idolatry was held in ■Budapest. The immediate result was the resignation of the Hungarian premier and the appointment of a new<sup>r</sup> one, Dr. Imrcdy, who, it is announced, “will follow the lines laid down by the Rome-Berlin axis.” In other words, Hungary is now Fascist: Catholic Action has gained its end.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ In grateful recognition of the pope’s stand for Fascist Japan as against the Chinese Republic, the puppet state of Man-ch ukuo conferred the highest Manchu decorations upon Cardinal Pacelli, Papal secretary of state, Cardinal Fumasoni-Biondi of the Propaganda department, the bishop of Manehukuo, and other prelates.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>The Lawless Policeman of Jersey City</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Jersey City is today the worst-governed city in the United States, all due to Frank Hague. Its elections are a disgrace. Its people are ashamed and afraid to talk for fear of reprisals. Hague is, of course, a Roman Catholic, and therefore uses methods any other type of man would be ashamed to use. He stands well with his church and with that church’s constant friend and admirer, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When pressed by overwhelming evidence of election frauds in Jersey City Hague put on a Fascist exhibition of what he calls “Ameri-</span></p>

His friend and associate, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Bar</span><span class="font8">ney Me Feeley, mayor of Hoboken, had the city employees out, and the WPA workers too. All men between 35 and 55 who could pass as veterans had to be in line in the parade or lose their jobs. Troops of the New Jersey National Guard were in the procession. President Roosevelt is their commander-in-chief; so, in a way, he was one of the boosters of this renegade ballot-box staffer. Gen. Wm. A. Higgins was grand marshal. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The newspapers of Berlin were delighted. Why would they not be ? Here is a fellow-Nazi, fully trained, using the Nazi cry of “Communism” —“Communism” as a shield for all manner of deviltry perpetrated in the name of good government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not content with establishing Fascism all along the Jersey City-Hoboken water front, the battle was carried to Newark, where Norman Thomas, three times candidate for the office Franklin Roosevelt holds, was rotten-egged for exercising his rights of free speech, guaranteed by the Constitution Mr. Roosevelt swore to uphold. Also, he was drowned out, while 400 Newark cops stood idly by, by a band led by Joseph Basile. Basile admits that he was paid $175 for the job, one $100 bill, one $50 bill, and five </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">$5 </span><span class="font8">bills. Ho does not know who gave’him the money (?).</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Fascism in its rankest form is being established in New Jersey by Frank Hague, viee-chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, commander-in-chief &lt;of the army and navy of the United States, as the figureheads at the front of the procession. It won’t be long now. All you have to do is to wait. Mr. Hague wants all that do not approve his methods to be shipped abroad, if they are of foreign birth or extraction (he himself is Irish), or to Alaska (American substitute for Siberia) if it so happens that they were born in “the land of the free”, .</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>“Hiding the Truth: Why?”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Three years ago the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society published a booklet entitled “Government”, containing the address on that subject delivered by Judge Rutherford at Washington, D. C., in June, 1935, broadcast over more than 100 radio stations in the United States, and to the British Isles, Scandina-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">vian countries, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Africa, Australia and other lands. In the same booklet was also published another address entitled “Hiding the Truth: Why ?” The second address, given at a later date, explained the power of the Roman Hierarchy in political and publicity matters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The booklet as a whole was banned at Lusaka, Northern Rhodesia, in May, 1938. The news dispatches sent out from Lusaka gave the title of the banned booklet as “The Government Hiding the Truth. Why?” as if the two lectures and the two topics were all one. This was done, of course, to please somebody. Can you guess who it was? If not, maybe the following paragraphs from a letter, from the Watch Tower office at Cape Town, South Africa, will make it all clear:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Readers of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> will want to know why the booklet has been banned at this stage? Recently a translation was made in Chiwemba. Chiwemha is the language of the Awemba tribe. The Awemba live in the northeastern part of Northern Rhodesia and their spiritual needs are catered for almost entirely by the Roman Catholic missions in that part of the country. Readers of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font7">will recall that it was members of the Roman Catholic Awemba who instigated and took a lead in the Copperbelt rioting in May 1935. The lecture “Hiding the Truth; </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Why</span><span class="font7"> f” exposes the dirty work of the Hierarchy in America, and it is not difficult to understand why the agents of the old “whore” in Northern Rhodesia wish to suppress the truth in that connection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Readers of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> will also appreciate the fact that although the matter has been misrepresented in the press, by yielding to the sinister influence of religionists and banning some of the Society’s publications the government of Northern Rhodesia has part in the conspiracy aitd is at least responsible for hiding some of the truth from the people of that land! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Communion Breakfast Diet</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ “Reverend Father” Carroll, Roman Catholic bishop of Lismore, Australia, at a “Communion Breakfast” held in his city, said, according to the Sydney </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font8"> of April 4,1938:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I should like to see some of the members of the Hibernian'Society become members of a rifle club, and get to know something about a rifle. It would be a great shame if our Catholic men were below the average in their knowledge of every method of defence. The day may come in Australia, as it did in Spain, from within. It may come from without. As the danger threatens Australia there should be preparedness. I think it is good training for any man to be familiar with the mechanism of a gun.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“I hear that dog again,” whispered Bunny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Let us play a game,” said Jane. “Let us pretend that we are Indians, and must walk very quietly, without making a sound,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;All right,” agreed Buddy, eagerly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Good!” cried Bunny, clapping her hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Soon four pairs of feet were going as softly as possible down the unpaved road. Now and then someone stepped on dry leaves and made a crackling sound, but no one sjxske.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All at once the sharp bark and the long howl were heard again. &quot;It sounds as if that dog were just around the bend,” whispered Buddy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As they rounded the bend, Bunny called out, &quot;Oh, there’s the dog, and it’s a big one!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Buddy’s mouth dropped open and he looked very puzzled. “That looks more like a police dog than a hound.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Surely enough, there it stood just at the side of the road, partly in the tall dried grass. It was a yellowish-gray color, with long ears and a long, pointed nose. Its shoulders seemed hunched up, while its head was lowered. Its eyes were such strange eyes—wild and sly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">As Buddy stepped toward it to get a better look at the long, bushy tail, the animal pulled its lip back' and showed its teeth. They all no-tieed then that between its front. paws was lying a large bone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 2, 193B</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sally shivered a little. “That is the strangest dog I’ve ever seen,” she said. “Its eyes give me a queer feeling.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Now listen, and don’t be afraid,” said Jane. “That isn’t a dog. It’s a coyote, which is really a kind of wolf.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;A coyote!” cried Sally in a frightened voice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Don’t be afraid,” reminded Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;But it might run at us and bite us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“No, Sally. It is much more afraid of us than we are of it. That is why I wanted you to slip up so quietly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It couldn’t be more afraid of me than I am of it,” answered Sally. “If it were, it would have run away long ago.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Oh!” said Jane, softly, for the coyote had suddenly disappeared into the tall grass, without a sound. One minute it was standing there, staring at them; the next minute it was gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The dog went away,” Bunny murmured. “Wouldn’t it hurt us?” asked Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“No. The coyote is quite cunning and uses his wits to get him out of tight places.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Where did he get the bone?” asked Bunny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“That was part of a little animal he had found dead. Probably it was a rabbit. He ' didn’t kill it himself, but that doesn’t mean that he wouldn’t. Sheep and chickens taste good to him and he steals them from the farmers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“But how did a coyote get here?” Sally asked. &quot;I thought they lived but west.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;That’s right, they do. But there are quite a few of them around here now. When people who are traveling in the west happen to find one of the little coyote puppies, they think ‘What a nice pet the little fellow would make!’ They bring the puppy home and raise it. But coyotes arc not easy to tame. When the 'little coyote grows up it wants to run wild; so it slips away. Soon it is trying to find an easy living by robbing the farmers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Just the same, I don’t like to meet coyotes on country roads,” said Sally.—Contributed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ These leftover skits regarding the Seattle convention will be appreciated by many. They show', in themselves, the entire innocence of-Judge Rutherford and all Jehovah’s witnesses of the horrid lits published in all the Catholic press of what took place there.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>Proving the Devil a Liar</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ One of the Seattle officers lunching with a group of Jehovah’s people was asked, “Have you noticed anything about this group of people in contrast to other like gatherings?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Response: “Yes, one thing in particular, and that is this: you people conduct yourselves just like ordinary folks. Most of the people who hold conventions here expect the city to be turned over to them, heart and soul, whereas you people are exceptionally willing to help and co-operate. In other words, you’re just ordinary working folks, like us coppers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Further inquiry: “Is there anything else that appears outstanding in your mind regarding these people?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ A passer-by confronted a small girl near the Seattle auditorium and, noticing a large banner advertising the lecture “Violence”, inquired of the tot what it was all about.

<h6><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>Tearing Down Signs</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Jehovah’s witnesses were discommoded somewhat in one section of Seattle when their signs advertising the convention were repeatedly torn down. A close watch was kept, and after a day or two the transgressor vras “caught in the act”. The culprit proved to be a police officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ The J.w. who posted the sign immediately arose to the occasion with a “Hey! What’s the idea of your tearing down those signs?” Police officer: “Well, it’s against the law to post up signs of any' nature.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J. w., noticing political signs plastered all around: “Why don’t you tear those signs down, too, then? You know our message deals with the establishment of God’s kingdom here on earth and the vindication of Jehovah’s name. What’s more important than that?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Officer: “Well, I guess you are right. I’ll -tell you what I’ll do. I’ll leave that sign up if you will promise to take it down after the convention.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J. w.: “I’ll make that a promise. By the way, have you read Judge Rutherford’s latest book, entitled </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies?</span><span class="font8"> You should have one by all means.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Officer obtains book. “I’ll be seeing you later.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>What Is the Matter?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Just a week before Judge Rutherford’s lecture in Seattle a lady appeared at the Civic Auditorium, grasped‘the door to enter, and, to her surprise, found it locked. Chancing to see a delegate, she asked, “What is the matter, that I cannot get in here? I thought admission was free.” He said, “Admission to what? There is a ball game going on here now and we are not supposed to grant admittance to anybody,” “Ball game, nothing,” she said; “I am not interested in that. I w’ant to hear Judge Rutherford’s lecture 'Violence’, and was told it is free and to be at 3:00 o’clock.” “Well,” said the delegate, “come next week at this hour and you will be made ■welcome ; that address is not until next Sunday.” “Oh,” said she, “then I have to wait a w'hole week to hear that lecture.” '</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Can you believe it that the Protestants, Catholies and Jews have had a tolerance meeting in Hoboken? the city where a magistrate sends men and women up for thirty days for preaching the gospel and even for sitting in an automobile, and where the “judge” on the bench has to turn to some political boss to find out how much of a sentence to impose. Well, they did, and the “Reverend” Mr, Pedersen, Baptist wind - jammer, made it all clear that “the American way is that of tolerance and brotherhood”. That was so nice of Pedersen.

<p><span class="font8">♦ New<sup>r</sup> Jersey specializes in wooden men. When a group of liberty-lovers sent a representative to Washington to demand a Congressional investigation of the reign of Hague the First in Jersey City he came back reporting that among all the New Jersey congressmen he was unable to find any that had either the small or the large intestines usually concomitants of manhood. It looks as if slabs of wood would do more good at Washington ; there would be no salaries for the people to pay, and the results would be the same as now.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ All Americans who love their blood-bought liberties must lea$n to face squarely the menace of Fascism in the United States, and, what’s more, they must, while they still enjoy their precious freedom, help, to the limit of their powers, to build up an anti-Fascist press, the first line of defense in the war to protect Democracy. Without a free and outspoken anti-Fascist press we Americans face a hopeless future, in which gangsters of the Hitler type ■will take over the country and run it as a part of the Nazi ideology of dictatorship, suppression, persecution, discrim-, ination, censorship, rampant nationalism, ruthless militarism, collective robbery, and all the other horrors of Hitlerism.-—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">American Freeman.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Whereas, The United States Supreme Court in the case of an obscure citizen has again invalidated a law seeking to restrict the distribution of printed matter: therefore be it Resolved, That the American Newspaper Publishers Association renew- its pledge to come to the defense of any one in this country whose rights to a free press have been infringed, with full confidence that in the Supreme Court of. the United States these rights will be sus-■ tained against unconstitutional laws and arbitrary and illegal acts of government when properly presented.—New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span></p>

The American Newspaper Annual shows a shrinkage of daily newspapers in one year from ‘2.107 to 2,084; a decrease of weekly papers from 10,80S to 10,629; and a decrease in semiweekly papers from 377 to 359.

<p><span class="font8">♦ Chevalier Jaekson, bronchoscopist, developed the science connected with his name. His greatest achievement was the extraction of four open safety pins from the chest of a six-month-old infant. The tube was passed down the child’s throat; the little electric light showed the objects sought; carefully designed instruments closed the pins one after another, and other instruments brought all four of them. out at one time, along with the woolen string to which they were fastened, and the child lived. Dr. Jackson is now 73. In his odd profession he has removed pins, hairpins, crucifixes, jacks, buttons, staples, stones and false teeth, and on one occasion an unfired cartridge. A child came from Australia to have a nail removed from his lung, and went back with it in his hand. Formerly all such cases dipd.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ In Maida Vale, W. London, England, Rabbi Ezekiel Bornstein, with a tumor on his brain, lost all knowledge of English. Surgeons removed the tumor (which must have been press</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font8">on Broca’s convolution in the left forehead, where knowledge of languages is, carried) and he completely recovered his lost art of speaking English. It should be added that injuries to Broca’s convolution, and their subsequent correction, have fully demonstrated that certain cells of the brain are developed for certain languages, which may be wholly lost, as this instance, or all verbs may be lost, or all adverbs. Or injuries may occur which will destroy all power to read or to comprehend letters at all.</span></p>

Anesthetics were applied. An artilleryman was called in and removed the explosive cap, so that the shell could be taken out without blowing the patient and the surgeon into smithereens.

<p><span class="font8">• With the rising of Parliament for its holiday season the political air was that of “anticyclone”. The members wefe taking their necessary change. Those who are responsible for the government of the country may not drop their responsibility, but they are relieved from the need to answer questions and of making speeches in Parliament; those whose chief task is listening to speeches are, no doubt, very pleased to get quiet. Listening to wearying talks and walking in and out of the lobby when a division is called must on occasion be very fatiguing. &quot;The “headline press” continues to find material for its need. An unusual amount of thunderstorm and of very heavy rain, sometimes almost, like a cloudburst, has helped the newspapers day by day.

</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">• Reuter, in a dispatch from Rome, reports that a group of 60 members of the House of Commons sent II Duce a message of good will, handed to him by a British resident in Rome. In the communique the group style themselves “The Anglo-Italian Parliamentary Group”, They desire, they say, to see the Anglo-Italian agreement ratified as soon as possible, believing that its ratification would constitute one of the most important factors of lasting peace in Europe. The message concluded by recognizing at its just value the way in which Italy replied as might be expected, saying that he agreed with them, arid hoped the agreement of April 10, “an agreement which liquidates the past,” will shortly be rendered effective. Probably some of these members of the British Parliament were of the number who had much to do with starting the rebellion in Spain, and which Mussolini helped as much as lay in his power. One might be tempted to think that both he and the 60 members of Parliament had their ‘tongue in the cheek’ when they went through this performance. Names are not given, but it may be assumed that the active Catholic Action has a share in this. These friends of Italy, or rather of Mussolini, are surely no friends of the British people: they are of the same class that desired to see the people of Abyssinia subdued to Mussolini’s rule, and the people of Spain brought under the dominion of the dictators. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald,</span><span class="font8"> commenting on this, says,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">It is a pity the sixty M.P.’s cannot spare a few minutes to read the agreement. In it they would see that the delaying factor is Spain. Mussolini promises to renounce all territorial, political and economic aims in Spain and to withdraw Italian troops. When this is done, the agreement comes into force. It is plain to anyone that the agreement has been delayed by factors over which Mussolini has complete control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Unemployment</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">• The numbers of the unemployed remain high. In July there were 1,773,116 reported as unemployed. The figure is better than for the previous month, but is 448,000 higher than a year ago.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Building Societies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">• The Building Societies’ year book, 1938, has just been published. The assets of the many building societies in Britain are reported at the huge- figure of £710,000,000, last year’s increase being nearly £54,000,000. Shareholders, depositors and borrowers number more than 4,268,300. The amount advanced on mortgage during the past ten years is £1,030,375,- ■ 713, an average of more than £100,000,000 per year. The report says, “The safety of this vast edifice of thrift is soundly based on more than 1,000,000 English homes, is backed by over £38,000,000 of reserve funds, and a record for prompt discharge of their obligations on the part of borrowing members which has become one of the most striking phenomena of the age.” That is one side of tfie picture, but there would tell of the struggle very many of the possessors of those homes have in order to meet the obligations owing to the building societies. There has been a ramp in this building business, and many have grown rich at the expense of the tenants of the houses. Poor foundations for the houses, poor workmanship in their erection and fittings, small rooms and cramped passages are almost as common as the houses themselves. The occupier is soon at the expense of repairs, often from overlooking</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">the lack in his purchasing contract, or because lie is compelled to accept what is offered. The hujlder has finished with him, and frequently it happens that the building societies’ mortgage is closed, and the householder has lost out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The British Broadcasting Corporation</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">• The new chief of the British Broadcasting Corporation, F. W. Ogilvie, who takes the position of director-general following Sir John Reith, is also “a son of the manse”, a Scots term for saying his father -was a clergyman, and his early life that of a clergyman’s home. He has evidently been chosen Jor his general ability and eonsidend fitness for the important position as chief director of this huge organization. Sir John’s deputy was one of the men from whose number the selection was made, and as he is a Roman Catholic many feared that the organization might get still further under the prejudice towards the Roman Hierarchy which some have noted: The Protestant Reform Society in its annual report mentions the appointment of Roman Catholics to. high positions in the British Broadcasting Corporation. It says, “‘Increasing inter-penetration* by Roman Catholic influences is stated to be ‘viewed with increasing alarm’ by Protestants.” In the same matter it is worth noting that the Southern Baptist Association recorded apprehension lest there should be a strengthening of Roman Catholic influence at the British Broadcasting Corporation. A speaker declared that Roman Catholic propaganda in wireless programs had increased of late, and he feared further domination. He added, “There is not a Roman Catholic in the world who does not do his hardest on behalf of his church.” No doubt the speaker realized the purposefulness of the average adherent of the Roman Catholic church when compared with that of his own community and of Protestants generally. The one is a propagandist ; the other is not, but is merely a religionist. Jehovah’s witnesses know that numbers of Roman Catholies are getting their eyes opened, and not only are leaving that “church” but are turned to witness against it, having learned that it is the Devil’s main instrument in the religious phase of his war against Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<h6><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>“Protestants”</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">• Comment has been made here on the fact that the religious sects in their yearly general meetings talked about almost any subject except what the Scriptures reveal of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 2, 1938 </span><span class="font8">purpose of Jehovah in these last days. A contributor to one of the religious journals has taken note of the resolutions which these assemblies have put on record, and he asks the question, “Are we too protestant?” He writes, “I have found there were over seventy resolutions on every conceivable subject from gambling to gaming and from housing to furniture. Six out of every seven were protesting against such and such a practice, habit, Bill, Law, or procedure, and call upon one or more ■ authorities to amend, repeal, qualify, cancel or abolish such,” The writer of the article has little to suggest to get these “protestants” out of the rut they arc in; but he thinks that if all the religious folk got together and made claims on the daily newspapers for notice they could get at least a page a day given to the interests of religion. Not likely; but this is mentioned here because it proves that which Judge Rutherford has said about Protestantism, and that is, that as a section of religion Protestantism is dead, Rome saw it rise ; it has watched it die. The dogmas and creeds of Papacy are no longer a matter for protest; to the contrary, there is a fundamental agreement with it in doctrine, and a leaning toward it as being the chief bulwark of the religious business in the earth. The “Protestant” sections of religion look al the solidarity of the Roman Catholic church with a measure of envy. One of their foremost representatives has told his fellow preachers, “You can talk about the Roman Church—but it is the only church today that is not being decimated by loss of its people.” The “Protestants” in religion are as blind as Rome as to the message of the Scriptures which Jehovah is now causing to be given, as a warning to all men of the swift approach of Armageddon, and the word of safety to all of good will toward Him. The Roman Hierarchy is sedulously busy in Britain purposing to gain supremacy, and is as active against the Protestant institutions as it is professedly active against Communism, and there arc evidences of its bitterness towards Jehovah’s witnesses, who are letting light from TIis Word shine in the dark places of religion. .</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Decreased Sunday-School Attendance</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ In the year 1937 in Britain the Church of England lost. 82,000 from its Sunday-school attendance ; Methodist church, 66,000 ; Congregational church, 23,000; and Baptist church, 16.000. At this rate, in 25 years there would</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">not be a Sunday school left, and the experiment begun in Gloucester, England, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">150 </span><span class="font8">years ago by Robert Raikes would be at an end. The Scriptures do not recognize Sunday schools, but place the responsibility for instruction of the child upon its parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Turning to the Dead for Advice</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">• A number of men and women who style themselves. “The World Service Group” expect to be able to help the country out of its difficulties. Seeing no leader of men amongst present politicians, and having fallen into the trap of spiritism, they are turning to the dead for help, and counsel. They have, they say, already got into communication with some of the giant politicians and leaders of the past, mentioning the late Earl Haig as one of them. They expect to get into communication with such as Gladstone or Pitt, who led the people in past days, giants in the political world. As the group name themselves The .World Service Group, their service is not to be confined to Britain, unless they expect that if Britain gets put in order the other peoples will follow the lead. They claim that there are eminent members of Society in the group. This is another turn of the Devil. Hitherto spiritism has acted as a religion, and it is to be numbered amongst the religionists, though the main section, the Roman Catholics, hate it like poison—“purgatory” and spiritism do not mix. Now it seems that the Devil is turning this mischievous professed talking with the dead to politics, and spiritism is to enter that very confused arena. Is it expected that Gladstone still retains his views, and that Pitt is of the same mind as when he was prime minister of Britain? There are those who would violently disagree with any advice said to come from Gladstone, and there are very many who believe that Earl Haig was not competent for the huge task to which he was set, and was the means of hurling hundreds of thousands into needless slaughter. The group depends upon mediums, always suspect, and upon seances, which are liable to be made the sport of the demons. Men become foolish when they refuse the Word of God, the Scriptures. Attempted or professed communication with the dead was expressly forbidden by Jehovah, under penalty of death. In Isaiah’s days there were those in Israel who did what this group seek to do, and speaking the word of Jehovah he said, “When they say unto you, Seek ye unto the necromancers . . . should not a people seek unto its God ? In behalf of the living should it seek unto the dead?”—Isaiah 8:19, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Poltergeist in Blackpool</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">• These knock-about demons have given Blackpool a visit while the holiday crowds are there. In a quiet avenue not far from the pleasure beach, in a house occupied by a man, his wife and two little girls things have been jumping about the rooms in a disconcerting fashion. The man who is employed at the pleasure beach says that when sitting at his midnight supper a hair brush started from a receptacle and hit him on the back of the head, the barbmeter fell from the wall, and a clock dropped from the kitchen dresser. He telephoned the police, perhaps expecting a constable to help with this unruly business. The officer laughed at the story, but while they were talking a clothes brush jumped off the table, and a brass ornament in the fireplace turned upside down. There was no one to arrest, and the policeman left, and so did the folk in the house. There was more of the same kind, of liveliness two days later, after the family had ventured borne. These knock-about demons give a show now and again; they are of the irresponsibles of the Satanic hosts. One does not hear of the spiritists’ being very ready to add them to' their 'proofs’ of a spirit world, nor of the religionists’ doing so. Naturally so, for the spiritists do not want to have their religion (-onsid-ered as being associated with dfcmonism, and the ordinary religionist has almost given up the idea of there being a Devil with hosts of evil spirits in association. These are mostly like the Sadducees of Jesus' day, who did not believe in angels nor in spirits, as Paul stated. See Acts 23: 8. The object of the Devil through his spiritist section is to “prove” that the dead are not dead, and thus continue the lie with which he began, and continue to try to make out that God is the liar; for God said that death should follow the transgression of His command.—Genesis 3:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Cabinet Spiritists</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">• The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Pictorial</span><span class="font8"> says, “Three members of the Cabinet are active spiritualists. They attend private seances, talk to statesmen of the past, now advising them from the ‘other side’. These members of the cabinet do not come out in the open and declare their beliefs, because they do not want to invite criticism and ridicule.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Proposed Super-Highways</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The proposed new super-highways are nine in number, three from east to west and six from north to south. One of the east to west lines would be from Boston, via Albany, Cleveland, Chicago, Council Bluffs and Yellowstone Park, to Salem, Oregon; another would be from Baltimore, via Wheeling, Columbus, Indianapolis, Springfield, Denver and Yosemite National Park, to San Francisco; the third would be from St. Petersburg, Fla., via Pensacola, Baton Rouge, San Antonio and El Paso, to Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of the north to south routes would be from Augusta, Maine, via Concord, Hartford, New York, Baltimore, Washington, Richmond, Raleigh and Columbia, to St. Petersburg; another, from Buffalo, via Pittsburgh, Charleston, W. Va., and Atlanta, to Pensacola; another, from Chicago, via Memphis and Jackson, to Baton Rouge; the fourth, from Bismarck, N. Dak., via Pierre, S. Dak., Broken Bow, Nebr., Ness City, Kans., and Hobart, Okla., to San Antonio; the fifth, from Philipsburg, Mont., via Salt Lake City, to El Paso; and the last, from Seattle, via Klamath Falls, Oreg., Sacramento and Los Angeles, to San Diego.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The proposition is that on these great boulevards, with their many lanes for various kinds of traffic, there would be no grade crossings of railways or highways anywhere, and troops and munitions could be moved over them with greatest possible speed and safety.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>Key West Overseas Highway</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The Overseas Highway, built on the piers of Henry M. Flagler's abandoned Overseas Railway to Key West, has been completed. Key West is now again connected with Miami, 170 miles away, without any intervening ferry trip. This PWA project, costing $3,600,000, will be a good thing for Florida, but a hurricane is liable to come along at any time and carry it into the Gulf Stream.</span></p>

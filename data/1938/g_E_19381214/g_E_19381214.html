<p><span class="font12">Jesuitized Germany </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(in two Parts—Part</span><span class="font8"> 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">^Hitler and the German cardinal, Faulhaber, are in constant consultation with each other at Munich.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE continual threat of war (to other nations) demands that there shall be plenty </span><span class="font5">of </span><span class="font6">cannon fodder. Hence boys and girls in Germany who desire to marry are loaned 1,000 marks without interest, payable in household goods, linen, furniture and the like. The prospective wife must give up her job, however. Marriages thus subsidized have resulted in 600,000 births in three years. A good crop of the afore-mentioned fodder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Conspiracy Against Czechoslovakia</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is of particular interest here that in the conspiracy against Czechoslovakia undertaken by Henlein under direct instructions from Hitler, all the Catholic theological students of Prague University joined the Henleinist movement </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">en masse.</span><span class="font6"> Does anyone heed to ask, Why? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In an address, October, 1932, three months before Hitler came into power, Konrad Henlein said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The welfare of the Sudetens is indissolubly bound up with the welfare of the Czechoslovak Republic. We stand, in principle, and unanimously, for loyalty to this state. For more than a thousand years Germans and Czechs have lived together in these lands, and always their fate has been common, in times of distress and in times of prosperity. We feel too vividly the power of historical tradition seriously to consider any kind of territorial revision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But that was then. It seems not to have been hard for Henlein to change his mind and his loyalty, if any. In one of his manifestoes, addressing the Sudeten Germans he disclosed the Roman Hierarchy’s backing of his plan for the dismemberment of his country when he said to them, “You still have to bear a reign of terror of Hussite-Bolshevik criminals in Prague.” Ah I That’s it! That discloses the whole scheme and its source. Czechoslovakia must be subjected to Hierarchy control. It was a remnant of Protestantism. Huss was burned at the stake because he loved God and truth, and hated the Hierarchy. Czechoslovakia was to be sacrificed for the good of the latter. The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> carefully concealing the Hierarchy, makes the following hedging comment:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is pretty generally acknowledged that John Huss’s ideas were largely borrowed from the English reformer Wycliffe. Hostile proclamations spoke of the former’s followers as WycliSites or Hussites. It is not, however, a point to be pressed. By now it is commonplace that the most explicit treaty obligations and the strongest moral commitments fade with time, and John Wycliffe has been dead more than five hundred and fifty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Priests Would Destroy Czechoslovakia</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the threat of war with Germany in the very air Czechoslovakia called 500,000 men to the colors and France announced that if the frontier were crossed she would live up </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to her </span><span class="font6">treaty to the letter, which meant another world war. Britain also notified Berlin that she could not and would not stay out. As a result Hitler made no move., But somebody else did. The “Reverend Father” Andrej Hlinka, leader of Czechoslovakia’s 2,300,000 Slovaks, announced that the province of Slovakia would break away and become a part of Germany or Poland unless the rights of self-government granted to the Sudeten Germans were also granted to the Catholic Slovaks. The move was entirely a Catholic move, and the speakers were entirely Catholic priests, showing intimate, close working relations between Hitler and the Hierarchy, in their </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">mu</span><span class="font6">tual efforts to destroy all republics and place., the control in the hands of cruel dictators.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19381214_files/g_E_19381214-2.png" alt="" style="width:42pt;height:42pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">In the forty days between May 21 and July 1, the Central German Broadcasting Station made 922 attacks on the Czechoslovak Republic, criticised its president 194 times, made .attacks on its officials and law courts</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">172 times, and insulted its army 106 times. Further, on 31 occasions it stated falsely that the country is ruled by Communists. Nice neighbors, eh ? What ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The effect of mischievous polities, was seen in the sudden decision of two Jewish-owned industries to leave the Sudeten German section of Czechoslovakia and reopen their factories in Prague, where they figured they were much more likely to get a square deal. But the result was that 400 Sudeten Bermans and 109 Czechoslovakians lost their jobs.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19381214_files/g_E_19381214-3.png" alt="" style="width:42pt;height:42pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">Nazi regard for the rights of others was illustrated by the Nazi or Henlein party in Czechoslovakia when inconceivable pressure was applied to the German population to make them decorate their homes with Henlein portraits and placards, as is the custom ■ in the realm of Frank Hague. Those who refused to fall in line were the targets for organized threats and intimidations. Employees were sent for by their employers and . threatened with dismissal; those out of work were warned that they would never be given employment by any factory owner or builder of their district. In effect this was equivalent to a threat to murder the man’s whole family, and actually caused some to suicide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Czechoslovakians in Germany</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are 400,000 Czechoslovakians in Germany ; they have no rights, and if they have grievances they do not dare mention them. This is by way of comment on the supposed right to make all the trouble possible for Czechoslovakia which was claimed by the Sudeten minority in that land. Moreover, there are Germans in the Italian Tyrol that are </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">really</span><span class="font6"> oppressed. Hence Henlein, the troublemaker, is without excuse, and so is the murderer. Hitler, for whom he works. , 1,200,000 Poles in Germany complain that they are insulted, assaulted and maltreated, that they are unable to secure police protection, that their businesses are boycotted, and that Germans who have anything to do with them ure denounced as traitors. Yet Hitler wants to run the whole world, and treat all but Aryan Germans as he treats the Poles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In its opening phases in Czechoslovakia the Nazi civilization showed all the familiar features that have made it so hated by all decent men. In perfect order the Henleinists smashed the windows of Jew and Czech stores and looted them of their contents. Behind the smashers and the looters came the smear brigades, equipped with tar and paint for making all Czech signs unintelligible. Mere boys warned newspapermen not to take pictures. Hitler has trained them well in all the accursed philosphy of Jesuitic bedevilment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Because you are human you will be pained to learn that as late as October 19, 1938, there were hundreds of your fellow creatures (penniless Jews) expelled from their homes in the Sudeten areas of Czechoslovakia taken over by Hitler’s coup, and that these unfortunates were not allowed to enter Czechoslovakia proper, and hence were existing, in the rain, sleeping in the ditches between the German and Czechoslovak lines. Among these was an expectant mother. She wrote a letter to a friend that she was lying ■underneath a hedge, with no money and only the clothing she had when expelled. Nice civilization, eh? ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the German-speaking sections of Czechoslovakia women were clubbed by young Nazi bullies in broad daylight because they undertook to trade in co-operative stores of societies to which they actually belonged. Henlein, speaking for the Nazis, says that every cooperative store in Czechoslovakia, and every co-operative society (of which there are 700), must be closed because Hitler says so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the taking over of the Sudeten area of* Czechoslovakia, embracing some 3,585,000 persons, the total population of Germany is now 78,700,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While Chamberlain was trying to figure out a way of giving Hitler what he had been promised, he thought it would be nice if the pope would speak a little piece over the radio, just to make everybody feel better; which the pope was very willing to do, of course. So he broadcast to the world, taking advantage of the opportunity to make them feel hopeful, though it is not quite clear what the world is to .hope for, what with Mussolini and Hitler running around loose, not to mention Chamberlain and the pope himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hitler’s Personal Fury</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19381214_files/g_E_19381214-4.png" alt="" style="width:43pt;height:43pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">Of course, Hitler is only a gangster, and a madman at that, but even a gangster and a madman, one would think, would almost halt at the language he used in speakbig of President Benes of Czechoslovakia, one of the most cultured, intelligent, capable statesmen of modem times. His mention of Btenes over the radio as a liar, while Benes was still president, was most unusual. Now it comes out that there was personal reason for his hatred. Czechoslovakia, when it was still a republie, was a refuge for the oppressed, and among others whom it sheltered were men who escaped from Germany and who hated Hitler and all for w.hich lie stands, and who broadcast truths about him, in German, which he did not wish German people to hear. It is certain that many and horrible deaths will follow the madman's control of the little republic that was civilization’s outpost in Middle Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rape of Czechoslovakia was accomplished in four hours by four men who did not allow<sup>7</sup> the injured country to be heard or to present a brief. Russia also, very much a party to the problem, was excluded from the group. Mussolini was the only one able to speak in all the languages there used-Italian, French, German and English.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19381214_files/g_E_19381214-5.png" alt="" style="width:196pt;height:241pt;">
<p><span class="font4">Music hath channa—or hathu/t it?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">The joke is on Mussolini. The Italians do not like his German imported goose step, and Pegler thinks ' that, because they did not want to, they could not even learn it. Mussolini is now an “also ran”, and unless he can teach his warriors to cat sauerkraut and frankfurters and like Wagnerian music, all is lost. The accompanying cartoon tells the story well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To save something from the wreck, the Czechoslovak government was compelled to appoint Dr. Joseph Tiso, a Roman Catholic priest, as prime minister of Slovakia and to grant the Slovaks full autonomy. Tiso selected all his associate ministers, and thus Slovakia is governed directly from Vatican City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wolves are not famous for eonsi de ration when engaged in the mangling of the meat thrown to them, but the Nazi wolves are entitled to the blue ribbon in the way they divided the city of Policka between themselves and Czechoslovakia, The town has a population of 5,891, of whom only 149 were Germans at the last census, but, when the town was divided, 100 homes, a cemetery and a cinema went to Czechoslovakia and the Nazis took the rest for the new Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As is always the case when democratic institutions go down and totalitarian influences arc in the ascendant, all Freemason lodges in Czechoslovakia have had to decide on self-dissolution. The Inquisition will start at once all over Czechoslovakia; indeed, it has already started, as this plainly shows. Censorship of news, compulsory labor camps, shifting of diplomats, and suppression of newspapers, show that all the curses of totalitarian government are under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No one with an animus against the innocent can conceal it. It was the slimy hand of Vatican diplomacy that betrayed Czechoslovakia, Rejoicing in the downfall of the man who tried to prevent the destruction of the little mid-European republic, the &quot;&nbsp;Reverend Father” Coughlin’s paper entitled “Social Justice” had a headline reading, “Czech people freed of Benes.” Dr. Benes, the ousted president of the country, will become a professor in the University of Chicago, where he will give a series of lectures on democratic institutions, for all of ivhich institutions the Vatican has only the bitterest hatred, despite soft words and lying statements to the contrary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An honest man, who did not know that the Vatican outfit was behind the destruction of Czechoslovakia, would be led to wonder just </span><span class="font5">how’ </span><span class="font6">it happened that when the German and Polish troops seized the portions of the country which the four wolves of Munich had allotted to them, it was the Roman Catholic young ladies in the Sudeten and Teschen areas who bombarded the German and Polish invaders with roses. The only possible explanation of this bombardment is that these young women were under the direct influence of the Roman Hierarchy, which sold out the Protestant democracy of Czechoslovakia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Reverend Father” Coughlin, also under complete Vatican domination and influence, describes the sell-out at Munich as “a victory not for Hitler and aggression, but for peace, truth and justice”. Lovers of real truth will be interested to learn that the founder of the Czechoslovak republic was a lover of the Bible, and that is why bis memory is so hated by the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mourning the British loan of £10,000,000 to Czechoslovakia before Germany gobbled it up, the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle</span><span class="font6"> invites the mourners to also mourn for £10,000,000 loaned to Austrian Socialists to build model tenements and another £10,000,000 loaned to the Austrian Nationalists to buy shot and shell to knock the tenements down, and still another £10,000,000 to correct the damages sustained before the house-painter of'Berchtesgaden came dowm and seized the whole country, tenements and all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kennedy Shares the Glory</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was singularly appropriate that when the time came to betray Czechoslovakia America had a Roman Catholic as its representative at the court of St. James’s, and report has it that he was at Chamberlain’s right hand constantly throughout the Nazi-Czech crisis. The same story that gives this information also quotes Chamberlain as saying, “Don’t you see? Franco is fighting for our class. If he loses, we shall have labor governments everywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The Munich agreement has for the moment averted war in Europe but it has not secured peace,” states the American League for Peace and Democracy. Continuing:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We now' face the results of a proceedings unprecedented in history. When, even 'after defeat in war, was a nation ever deprived of its territory and resources without being present at the Council table </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font6"> Instead of the democratic procedure suggested by our president as the approach to peace, namely, a conference of all interested nations upon neutral territory, we have seen four powers disposing of the vital resources of a small-nation without its presence or consent and without consultation with other nations directly interested. We have now a settlement dictated by the threat of force. Peace can no more rest on such a basis than it could upon the Versailles Treaty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The Munich agreement is no settlement of the minorities problem. How could that problem be settled by terms, dictated by a man whose treatment of minorities in his own land has shocked mankind? This agreement, dictated by force, has created new minorities to plague the conscience of mankind and disturb the peace of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The problem of peace today is the problem of the aggressor. The Munich agreement has increased, not diminished, the prestige and the power of the Fascist aggressors. It has accomplished the economic dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. It has opened the way for further and more effective aggression. It has successfully enthroned force above reason, right, and justice. It has paid as the price of peace the destruction of the basis of peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“What has been yielded in this settlement is not merely territory, economic resources, prestige and power; it is the democratic process itself which has been abandoned in this acceptance and imposition of terms dictated by force.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Danzig Next on List</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Indications are that Danzig is text on the list. The same meth-ids are being pursued as werc-fol-lowed in Austria and Czechoslovakia. Enough munitions have been brought into the city to arm 25,000 men, and the young Nazis are training for the zero hour. Their insolence is so great that recently they threw a Polish official off a railway train, severing both hands and one foot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the free city of Danzig, with a total population of 589,000, the Nazi senate, since it came into control, sent 8,449 people to concentration eamps in Germany, and 3,246 more Danzig citizens to German jails as political prisoners, and 2,327 others vanished without a trace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hitler gave his word that when he got what he wanted of Czechoslovakia he wouldn’t ask for any more of Europe, but maps of Germany, confiscated in Poland, show two provinces of that country as provinces of greater Germany. The maps were printed in Germany. Other maps, published in Marshal Goering’s paper and in use among teachers, show the whole of Switzerland as included in what is called ‘‘Greater Germany”. Four days after this news was published in Switzerland came the public announcement that Switzerland will spend $100,000,000 in defense, showing that she does not intend to lose her liberties without a fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Half a million men are working night and day to give Germany a triple line of machinegun turrets along its western border, from Switzerland to the North Sea. Another large German force is making a similar line between France and Spain. These may come in handy sometime, especially in friendly overtures to France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only has Hitler ambitions to dominate Europe; his minions are also active in America. In Brazil President Vargas, dictator, foun^, that the Fascist party there was receiving funds from Germany. He suppressed the whole outfit before they knew what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No matter where they live, all Germans must “Heil Hitler”. If carried out, in the sense in which the Nazis demand, it would mean that even jn the United States the German-speaking people must break away from their allegiance to the American government and demand physical union with Germany. If that principle is right, the Italians should do the same, the Irish the same, the Hungarians the same, etc., etc., </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ad infinitum, </span><span class="font6">and the United States would be broken up into as many snarling, fighting, warring factions as there are languages in Europe. The existence of the United States government is the greatest reproach to the Nazi theory that could possibly exist. It stands for liberty of all, and not liberty of any to oppress or injure others, no matter what their tongue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Says Sigmund Livingston in “Facts About Fictions”: “On March 26 of this year [1938], eighteen American youths, all under the age of 18, all of German parentage, were sent from America to Germany to be trained in the German Fueh rersChulen. They will be taught the art of dictatorship, of terror, of hate, of falsehood. When they have finished their training, they will be returned to this land as qualified fuehrers to lead in the warfare against freedom, liberty and democracy.” This procedure manifests the gratitude of vipers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The German spy ring, of whom some eighteen were indicted in the United States Federal courts, showed an amazing stupidity, despite the fact that some of them got away, due to parallel stupidity in the United States. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEMBER 14, 1938 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the spies was caught with a violin case loaded with the plans of an American bomber, and another was so foolish as to pose as an American under-secretary of state and to try on that basis to get fifty blank passports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other Germans, however, who have had a taste of German culture and “civilization”, have no desire to spread it to other lands. Doubtless there are many such, and they should make their stand clearly known.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Newspapers which are completely silent about the altogether diabolical persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses give considerable space to the sufferings of the Jews. Some of these dispatches and reports are astounding. Discrimination against the Jew is reminiscent previous persecution of this rave when the Hierarchy had the measure of power which it is now seeking to regain. The pope’s feeble expression of disapproval with respect to racial prejudices comes with bad grace, when the record of the Hierarchy of which he is a part includes so long a list of atrocities perpetrated upon the Jewish people in the heyday of Hierarchy power.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Robbing the Jews</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">V Germany is financing itself by the ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;robbery of the Jews, not only those</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">at home, but those abroad. Every ■iJew, regardless■ of where he lives, -^Bif he is a citizen of Germany, has had to set forth in a statement the whole of his property, including bank balances, jewels and personal possessions of all sorts. This is then pre-empted by the state. If a Jew gets permission to leave his homeland he may take with him only sixteen shillings, or ^bout $4.00. In some sections of Germany, and perhaps all over the country, the persecutions have</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">become so petty that a Jew may no longer use the elevators of a public building, but must climb the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">German efficiency has made the robbery of Jews a fine art. By one act after another hot only have the Jews been compelled to sell their businesses at the cost price of the goods in stock, or less than that cost, but even then a Jew could leave Germany with only about 8 percent of the value of his property. Since June 4, 1938, even this has been stopped, and now he may leave the country only with the 10 marks (16 shillings) which every traveler leaving Germany temporarily' may take with him. He may not even take personal belongings such as furniture or medical instruments. It seems incredible that any people could have fallen to such levels of inhuman beastliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The German government has now ruled that any tenant of a building may break his lease if the landlord fails to remove a Jewish tenant on his demand, and that when a landlord intends to sign a new'lease with a Jew he must inform every Aryan tenant of his decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Buchenwald concentration camp, near Weimar, 65 miles from Leipzig, Germany, 80 Jews died in a single month. They were compelled to work at quarrying and stone-breaking from 4 ajn. to 8 p.m. When they fainted beneath the hot summer sun the only treatment received was to have a bucket of cold water thrown over them and to be left where they fell. Breach of discipline was followed by flogging, 50 strokes, during which the victim usually dies.

<p><span class="font6">A reporter for the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express </span><span class="font6">interviewed the 56 outcast Austrian Jews, robbed of all their property and ordered out of the country into the No Man’s Land between Austria and Yugoslavia. One of these, an elderly, well-dressed man, mentioned that his family had lived in Austria for five centuries, during all of which time they had been law-abiding people, and had accumulated a fortune of £16,000 in mills. Now, he said sobbing, he had not even the means to commit suicide. The Nazi gangsters had seized everything he owned.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">In New York city Miss Liesel Wolf, 37, a Jewish refugee, facing the prospect of having to return to Germany, leaped from a window, committing suicide. It shows what Germany is to the Jews. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">More than 1,700 Jews suicided during the first three weeks of the Nazi occupation of z» Austria.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">An Appeal for Mercy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Jews of Germany, like Dives in the parable of Dives and Lazarus, made a pitiful appeal for mercy from gentiles not under control of Hitler. A portion of the appeal follows;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our means become daily smaller. Exclusion from trade and industry forces the greater part of German Jews into unemployment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our strength' threatens to fail. We do not forget that a world so anxious for peace and security cannot devote its whole attention to us. We do not forget that other people have heavy eare and needs, but we dare to hope, at least, that the frontiers may be opened for our people for organized emigration and a plan made for temporary settlement for those capable of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We yearn for a life of self-sacrifice in the free air of the world. We wish to associate in the work of peaceful construction. May these words of the late hour be heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Following Hitler’s lead, Mussolini caused the dismissal of all Jewish officers from the Italian army, nineteen functionaries of the Ministry of the Interior and fourteen Jewish professors of the University of Pisa. From the latter city 265 foreign Jewish university students, mostly Polish, fled. All Jews who found refuge under the Italian flag since January, 1919, must leave the country. They wjll be permitted to settle on the lands stolen from Ethiopia. See the cartoon on page 5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">One can readily imagine the strug</span><span class="font5">gle </span><span class="font6">of conscience endured by the clergy of Bade who received orders to take </span><span class="font5">the oath </span><span class="font6">of fidelity to the Fuehrer. The bishopric of Fribourg was unable to obtain the least amendment to the formula of the oath, so that the priests continue to promise obedience to a dictator who calumniates them, laughs at tbeir faith, wishes to suppress them, and dreams of the annihilation of their religion. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The National Journal</span><span class="font6"> of Basle (Switzerland) calls the course of these priests “extraordinary spiritual heroism”! What is there heroic </span><span class="font5">in </span><span class="font6">this ignominious capitulation before their so-called “enemy” and the entire absence of devotion to principle? There is not the slightest degree of martyrdom in evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Contrast therewith now the sufferings of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The utter inhumanity of the fiends ruling Germany is discernible in the fact that the relatives of Jehovah’s people in that accursed land do not know and have not known for years where their joved ones are, and their only solace is in the hope that the imprisoned ones are dead as a result of their mistreatment and have thus escaped from the hands of their tormentors; so says </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Trost,</span><span class="font6"> the German edition of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Bibelforscher are deprived of ent al rights by law! The mothers among them are martyrs to their convictions in the most gruesome meaning of the term. They are invariably good mothers, and have brought their children up religiously, and the thought that they are being corrupted has made many a mother ill. There are many young women prisoners whose fiances are in penal institutions for men, both serving long sentences. Outwardly they are very composed. How many human lives have been blighted through such conflicts it is impossible to say. But there can scarcely bo a single family in whose wider circle there is not at least one case of political disaster. Very often there are several cases in one family. Not so much is known about them, because people keep silent about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then there is the matter of sterilization. This is frequently resorted to, among women as well as men. One can, if one wants to, readily enough declare a human being who re fust's to change his “wrong” opinion to be morbidly feeble-minded---the most frequent ground for sterilization. This is especially often resorted to in the case of the Bib elf or seher. A sterilized person may marry only another sterilized person.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">faithfulness of these witnesses in the Buchenwald concentration camp as “stubborn religious fanaticism” as it quotes the following from the Manchester </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some have undergone a so-called ‘German baptism’. They were placed in a barrel of sewage and asked if they still believed in Jehovah. The Bible students have shown a dour fervor in ah camps and prisons, and at Buchenwald they refused to answer the question. They were then completely submerged in the sewage again and again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Made to rise at 4:00 a.m. the prisoners at Buchenwald are compelled to do the heaviest work in quarries and on roads, and on food not fit for a dog. When, through weakness, they cannot keep the pace they are flogged 25 strokes. When two prisoners escaped, all the rest of the men in camp had to stand at attention 17 consecutive hours, all through the night. Those&quot; who collapsed under the strain were allowed no food for three days. Of the escaped prisoners one was recaptured and beheaded. In this one camp in one year-145 prisoners were murdered or committed suicide.

<p><span class="font6">Prague), reports that in the camp in Dachau (Bavaria) the prisoners are marked by different broad stripes around the .trousers, sleeves and upon the back, thus designating the reason for their internment and the grade of cruel treatment they should receive. Those stripes mark the following “companies”: returned Aryan emigrants, homosexuals, habitual criminals, returned Jewish emigrants, political prisoners, second political prisoners (second offenders), political Jews (liberals), Jews who “defiled the Aryah race”, and last, Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Punishments consist of punitive exercises (to the point of exhaustion and unconsciousness), flogging, together with solitary confinement (before and after the flogging, chained in a dark, very small cell without window). Normal punishment consists of 25 strokes with the whip and 8 days solitary. Second grade consists of 50 strokes and 14 days solitary. That goes up to 100 strokes and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">4 weeks </span><span class="font6">solitary. When one is kept for eight days in that hole he gets something to eat only every second day, and in many eases only every third day. . . . Punishments that exceed 50 strokes are, out of “humane consideration”, paid out “in installments”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning the witnesses of Jehovah the report contains the following remarkable testimony :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They endure all punishments with stoic eompos-tire, and even continue successfully to work amongst their fellow-sufferers for their cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Regarding the concentration camp in Sachsenburg (near Berlin), where most sadistic fiends are their tormentors, one report similarly testifies: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">,Astonishing is the conduct of the Bible students. These, often' young people, evidence unshakable courage. They demonstrate the loyalty of martyrs and are unyielding as no other group in the camp. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEMBERS, 19S8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The political prisoners are determined from tli-c beginning to obey all orders, well knowing that otherwise the SS-men would make short work of them and only wait for an opportunity to do so; whereas nothing can induce the Bible students to render the Hitler salute. Their faith in Jehovah forbids them to do it. -To be sure, amongst them occur as a result the most suicides and suicide attempts [read homicide and homicide attempts]!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A further proof of the secret union between , the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the Hitler government is the conspicuously partial treatment that the few priests (mostly sex perverts) receive in this camp, which is situated, not in the Catholic, but in the Protestant part of the country:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Protestant pastors arc not treated differently from the other prisoners in the camp. They also must do hard labor, and their hair too has been cropped. But when two Catholic clergymen were brought in [as prisoners] the commanding officers </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the camp were quite embarrassed. They did not dare to crop the consecrated and anointed heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Sachsenburg they enjoy making sport with the newly arrived prisoners in the following heartless manner: In the middle of the night loud commands are given to the SS-guards, which can be heard far and wide, “Firing squad, fall in line!” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font6">prisoners hear the command. They [the new arrivals in their special barrack] stand trembling at their plank-beds. Until morning one after the other is being inarched off and questioned. In the morning the command is given, “Execution postponed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In regard, to the concentration camp for women in Mohringen one report tells,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The old Bible student women give the matrons much trouble: they neither render the Hitler salute nor can they be deterred from attending their devotions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The martyrdom of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany [not self-made] is easily the most outstanding as well as the most startling fact in current history. Following the path which their Master trod, they are treated like Him; taken from prison and from judgment and subjected to every illegal and violent abuse that their depraved captors can devise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fact that the press has nothing or next to nothing to say about these outrages helps one to understand how it happened that the death of Christ Jesus upon the tree is almost totally ignored in profarfe history.

<p><span class="font6">'.j/ The Fascists and Nazis, acting in conjunction with the Catholic Hier-■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;archy, have kept their shipping</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">pretty well shielded against the truth, even as they do the people in their respective countries. Hence it has been impossible to do anything up to now on the ships of the Italian line and the larger German lines. The Polish Gdynia-America line also refused a pass, stating that “the crews of their ships are all of the Catholic faith and they have resident chaplains on board to attend to their spiritual needs”, which was just a polite intimation to keep off their private preserves. One can imagine, in the light of Spain, Italy and Germany, just how these “spiritual needs” will be attended to. The French line, also, refused through its secretary to renew its pass, although the door is not definitely closed by such refusal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are, however, several German ships of the all-tourist class where it is still possible to work without much interference. These were onee under the control of the unfortunate Jewish shipping magnate Arnold Bernstein, who is now in a Nazi prison and has, in addition, forfeited his ships to the government of Nazi Germany. Though these ships fly the swastika and are run by Nazi crews, there are many persons aboard who are not in harmony with Nasi ideas and haven’t much use for the usual Nazi high-pressure regimentation of the thoughts and actions of honest men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a peculiar experience to work on these vessels, and one not easily forgotten. At once there is manifest a feeling of distrust and fear, and a tight-lipped silence that speaks volumes. The very air is electric. Throughout the ships are pictures of Hitler, usually flanked on each side by a large swastika, and the customary exhortation to render obeisance to the Nazi chief is not wanting. In the messroom of one of these ships I had the certain satisfaction of leaving a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> book in (german with a couple of honest men there, while all the time</span></p>

Another captain, of entirely different disposition, gladly took </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> as a steward stood by, ..Incidentally, it was rather amusing to see the expression on the face of the steward, as only a short time before he had said that he didn’t think any would take the books on that ship. Still another captain showed me an old and worn copy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font6"> that he kept hidden in a brown paper bag. of opening up the books at various &quot;hot’* passages and directing the attention of the men thereto. The phonograph was tried, but the already jittery seamen were seared to death by so much publicity and would depart, leaving me running a German record to myself; so this was discarded here as being unpruc</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">in Rio de Janeiro &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">tical. It was another</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">problem to get directions as to how to get to a certain part of the ship. After the average sailor had at length grasped what was required of him he generally rattled off directions in a stream of fluent German that wasn’t much help. All I could do was murmur “Danke schon!” (“Thank you!”) and wander off as wise as before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On one of these ships the chief purser said that he, too, was of the' opinion that religion was a racket of the worst kind, but he classed the Bible in with religion and had no use for that either. That is the usual opinion there. Nazism has about destroyed any faith the Germans once had in Jehovah God and His Word, which they now hate because of its Jewish connections. On this same ship there was a pleasing contrast in the galley, where three cook hoys were talking. One of these by signs and broken English said that he had “seven books in house” in Germany, and was overjoyed to get a damaged </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font6"> at a cheaper rate. The others accepted booklets and warmly shook hands in gratitude therefor. Truly these lads were not Nazis in spirit.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">As in other places where Fascists, Nazis or the Roman Hierarchy have control, there were the usual cries of “Communist!”, etc., and harsh words. There were also those there that resented anything being said about the doings of the Hierarchy, showing that Catholics and Nazis have very much in common. Incidentally, when working aboard Japanese ships, the selfsame yell of “Communist 1” has gone up, proving, as set out in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cure,</span><span class="font6"> that the Hierarchy has made an alliance with Japan in its effort to grab China and that the tactics of the Devil’s totalitarian giant are still the same, no matter where it rears its ugly head in the earth. Soon, by the Lord’s grace, that giant will be destroyed and then the way will be plain and easy for all right-minded persons to get peace and joy in security and vibrant health. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The foregoing experiences will tend to show thrft there are very many really fine and honest men amongst the sailors who sail the seas: men who want to see righteousness established and who love the truth and want to do what is right. They have been pumped full of religion for years, until, as one put it, the very sight of a clergyman makes .them feel physically sick. They see all around them wars and revolutions and the horrible massacre of millions of innocent persons, and, not being quite blind, they see the 'filthy finger of religion smeared over the whole thing. So it is a joy to be able to tell them from the Bible itself that their feelings are right and proper and that soon the entire nasty, slimy mess is going to be cleared from the earth in the “strange act” of Jehovah God himself. Of course, there are always plenty of the other kind, who laugh and jeer at the truth and try to pour ridicule on it from every angle, and these include the religious ones and also the atheists. The Lord must laugh at their feeble efforts to bold back the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a strange and wonderful thing, how the Lord removes the obstacles so that the tes-timonj^may be given. Many times officers on ships have expressed their amazement’to have someone visit them with the truth. They have themselves been unable to obtain permission for even their closest friends and families to visit them, and can’t make out how an outsider could get aboard. What they leave out of. consideration is the fact that, while the witness is of himself completely unimportant, the message he bears is a sacred commission from the Most High, and the Lord has promised that His hand will be over His people to the very end.-Eric W. Symondson, New York.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Q</span><span class="font6">UESTION : Why do not &quot;‘tongues” form a part of Jehovah’s witnesses’ equipment now as in apostolic times?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">A.nswer: Today certain religionists insist on miraculously given “tongues” as proof of true Christianity, more than nineteen hundred years after Pentecost of A.D. 33. Manifestly, if Jehovah God wanted His faithful servants to now' exercise powers of tongues, He would impart such to .them for their use. The fact that He does not now do so shows that He has other means and ways for accomplishing His purpose that “this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations” before the final end of Satan’s world comes, soon. (Matthew 24; 14) Today the’literature which is distributed by millions of copies each year by Jehovah’s witnesses is published in more than 75 “tongues”, the principal languages of the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In lands or in foreign colonies ■where Jehovah’s witnesses do not know' the language they use a printed “testimony card” or “testimony booklet” to introduce the literature in the tongue which the people there speak, as, for instance, here in New York city, where, as in Jerusalem at Pentecost time, are found practically all the main languages of the earth. Also, the Kingdom message has been recorded on phonograph dises in many languages, and Jehovah’s witnesses carry with them a small phonograph with records in the particular language or languages needed and let the phonograph reproduce the speech in the hearer’s native tongue. Sound cars and sound boats equipped with loudspeakers are also used to reproduce such recorded speeches, that thousands may hear at one time. By this means, since 1922 particularly, Jehovah’s witnesses have preached the Kingdom gospel io literally hundreds of millions, in many tongues, in all quartet's of earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who today insist on the “gift of tongues”, how much preaching of the Kingdom gospel do they do in “tongues” outside of their meeting places? None. Their “gift</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEMBER 14, 1938 </span><span class="font6">of tongues”, w'hieh they think is from God, they possess only temporarily, when seized by some strange power at the meeting place, and then no one present, not even the one whose tongue makes the strange sounds, understands what the foreign babble means. Which ones, then, are fulfilling God’s commandments and carrying out the commission He lays upon true and anointed Christians, to wit, “^he spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound ; ... to comfort all that mourn”? (Isaiah 61:1,2) Which ones show that the holy power of God is resting upon them and working His will through them, Jehovah’s witnesses or religionists wuth imagined “gift of tongues”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Christ Jesus w<sup>r</sup>as present in the flesh on earth, He preached the Kingdom gospel in only one language, His parents’ tongue. Did this lack of tongues prove He was not the Christ ? At Pentecost “tonglies” were given for a sign to the unbelievers (1 Corinthians 14: 22), arid all the foreigners listening heard every one the message in his own torigue and understood what was said, without even an interpreter. (Acts 2:1-11) Even in his day the apostle Paul said: “Do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?” (1 Corinthians 12:10,30) And then in the next chapter (13:1,8) he shows that to “speak with the tongues of men and of angels” is not the real test of a Christian, but love, or unqualified devotion, to Jehovah God as expressed by obedience and faithfulness to Him, and, furthermore, that in course of time the gift of tongues to Christians would stop: “whether there be tongues, they shall cease.” They did cease, at the death of the apostles through whom the gift of tongues was given to others (Aets 19:1-6; 8: 14-20), and at the death of those to whom the gift of tongues was imparted through the apostles, Today there are no apostles of Christ Jesus on earth in the flesh through whom Jehovah God chooses to ..communicate the gift of tongues. Nor is the “sign” of “tongues” any longer necessary' to accomplish God’s work as commanded, as witness the works of Jehovah’s witnesses among every nation, kindred and people and tongue oh earth at present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Religionists today who claim to possess at </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">17 </span><span class="font6">times the miraculous “gift of tongues” are at such times possessed of the demons and by them made to babble, and thus are the dupes of the Devil, who always counterfeits God’s methods. Being deceived, such 'gifted’ ones are filled with 'pride and self-righteousness, and are blinded to and turned aside from doing the real works of the service of Jehovah God. They bring reproach upon His name in that they misrepresent Him aqd His organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In now looking for such an out-of-date “sign” rather than obeying God’s clear commission to His witnesses, let religionists take heed to Jesus’ warning that “an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign” and that the sign such a generation demands will not be given to it, because contrary to God’s will. And immediately after those words Jesus warned against becoming possessed by demons or “unclean spirits”.—Matthew 12; 38-45.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Mothers who wish to kill their babies may take any one of several popular headache cures. This will poison their milk, and the milk will poison the babies. If the mothers will smoke cigarettes, now widely advertised everywhere, and smoked everywhere regardless of the rights of non-smokers, the murderess will accomplish her ends even more certainly. It is impossible for a smoking mother to have a healthy child. The heads of the tobacco trust deserve the death sentence for what they have done and are doing to humanity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ In London a 14-year-old lad was completely cured of color blindness by so-called “manipulation of the top vertebrae of the neck”, which those who have had osteopathic or chiropractic treatments will understand perfectly. The nerves leading to the eyes were strengthened until they became normal, and the boy was able to pass the navy’s rigid color test and was accepted as a recruit after having been previously rejected.</span></p>

It is just possible that the scratching was not accidental: the cat may have seen a cataract film and intuitively removed it. Anyway, it is a hard eat story.</span></p>

In 1917 the per capita public debt was $28.57, but the country was only just making a feeble beginning at throwing its money away. The subsequent results were all that the house of Morgan could desire. The average per capita debt since that time, down to 1932 inclusive, was $174.50. The average per capita debt for the last four years was $224.66; and on February 12, 1937, it touched the $34,500,000,000 mark, with a per capita debt of about $266.91.

We have 11,090,000 or 12,000,000 unemployed, and I say that four or five million of them won’t work, refuse to work. And that is happening because we put relief into their laps whether they deserve it or not, and whether they want it or not. We’re perpetrating the worst laziness and buncombe the country has ever seen. There are eases of people so lazy they won’t even get out of bed to get their relief checks.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Chamberlain’s Sympathies .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A United Press dispatch carried by the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font6"> of September 28 contains an account of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain’s appeal to Pope Pius XI in the recent Czechoslovakian crisis, on the eve of the Munich Four-Power Conference. Undoubtedly this was done by Chamberlain in recognition of the Papal alliance with Hitler. Chamberlain’s later agreement to parcel up the country of the Czechs was repudiated by many Englishmen, including representatives of the House of Commons. Phyllis Bottome, describing this conduct as traitorous, states, as reported by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The American Guardian</span><span class="font6"> of October 14: “Therefore, by permitting Germany to become much more powerful, so that Hitler is able to fight as well as bluff, Chamberlain deliberately helped the cause of Fascism and hurt democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But these few protests seem more like cries in the wilderness with most of Britain still asleep. Consequently, in order to remove all the languor from the eyes of the thoughtful, the end of the present trend of England in bowing to the pope is foretold in a review of the history of Mary I of England, -who sacrificed to the Roman shrine in the sixteenth century,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">20</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hitler's Model</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mary Tudor, first queen regnant of England arid Ireland, was the child of Henry VIII by Katharine of ikragon, herself a Spanish. Catholic and familiar with the practices of the fiendish Inquisitioner, Tbrquemada. She was reared in the Catholic faith and is said to be “an historical example of the noxious effect” that such education has on the mind of a child. At the death of her brother, Edward, who is said to have requested Cranmer, later a victim of the scourge of burnings, “not to yield His Church of England to the Papal wolf,” Mary came to the throne,'in 1553,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the same year she “had a private interview with Commendone, the pope’s envoy..., Mary assured him of her inviolable attachment to the religion in which she had been educated, and of her desire to restore the pope’s supremacy in her kingdom. . . . She gave him a letter to Pope Julius III, declaring her wish that her kingdom might be reconciled to Rome . . . </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">’’—Lives of the Queens of England,</span><span class="font6"> by Agnes Strickland, Vol.</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">'2, </span><span class="font6">page 573.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order to perform this reconciliation with the head of the Roman Catholic Church she was equipped with a privy council which the above historian describes as an “inquisitorial tribunal”. Before she began the real effort to exterminate “heretics” she was confronted with a rebellion led by such unfortunates as Wyatt, and her manner of dealing with these offenders was but a foretaste of the fury she was later to.exercise upon the Reformists and other Papal enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Recounting these early days of the reign, says the same chronicler: “Many were hung at their own doors, and left there; so that according to an Italian eye-witness, ‘the queen could not go to the city without beholding the ugly sight of dangling corpses at every turn of the street.’ ” But let one imagine, if he can, “the agony of the harmless families within those houses—children, wife, mother, or sisters, who saiv a dear, perhaps an only protector, thus hanging before his own doorway.” — Same volume, page 603.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mary actually held the then despotic authority of supreme head of the church. One of her bloodiest acts was the execution of the Protestants Guilford Dudley and his wife Lady Jane Grey. “The executions of this lovely and innocent girl and her young husband must ever be considered frightful stains on the reign of a female sovereign.”—P. 603.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">consolation</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">But </span><span class="font6">at this point “Bloody Queen Mary” was really just getting into the swing of the Inquisitioner. Some of these deeds were political crimes. It remained for religious fervor to inspire some of the most iniquitous murders of all time. In 1555 “commenced that horrible persecution of the Protestants which lias stained her name to all futurity” and which “curdles the blood with horror at this distant time”. Gardiner and Bonner, bishop of London, Mary's chief Inquisitioners, burnt with deeply religious fervor “the opposers of papal supremacy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The martyrs “of the Protestant church of England were men of blameless lives and consistent conduct. In 1555 were burnt Rogers, Saunders, Dr. Rowland Taylor, and Bishop Hooper. ... At the least computation, above two hundred human creatures perished before the persecution and Mary’s reign ceased altogether.”—Same, pages 638-641.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prime Minister Uninformed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While examining the course of Mary I in prostrating England to the pope is it not reasonable to suppose that Mr. Chamberlain knows well this bloody chapter in his country’s history ? Can he fail to know that Hitler is merely the modern tool of intimidation and terror of the Hierarchy! an ally who is congratulated by the Catholic bishops of Germany for his theft of Czechoslovakia, who imprisoned the anti-Catholic rioters in Austria^ who has imprisoned thousands of true Christians who exposed the infamous Papacy! The London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font6"> of September 23, 1938, states: “Mr. Neville Chamberlain is warmly commended by the Count Della Torre, editor of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Osservatore Romano,</span><span class="font6"> semi-official organ of the Vatican, for his ‘supreme step’ of visiting Herr Hitler personally.” If Mr. Chamberlain is not a Fascist himself let him recall Mary’s “conciliation with Rome”, with which we continue, and remember before going farther through this portal that it is for Englishmen to “abandon all hope, ye who enter here”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Martyn for Principle</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The last words and acts of some of those courageous men *who. stood up at the cost of their lives against the religious tyranny of Mary are worthy of note as expressive of true Christian sentiments. Bishop Hooper stated to his executioners when he refused clemency at their hands at the price of renunciating his faith; “ ‘I am not come hither as one en</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEMBER 14*1938 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/ </span><span class="font6">forced or compelled to dieI might have had my life, as is well known, with worldly gain, if I would have accounted my doctrine falsehood, and heresy.’ ... It was not until after about three quarters of an hour of torment [in the fire] that he at last expired.”-Froude’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reign of Mary Tudor,</span><span class="font6"> page 194.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The real controversy that Mary had against these upright men was that they refused to acknowledge supremacy of the pope. The historian Froude above quoted continues, on page 196: “The enemies of the church were to submit or die.” The manner in which these liberty-lovers offended is well expressed by Hooper in a letter to friends a week before his sentence. His words which are so remindful of all struggles for freedom are reproduced : “I did write you of late, and told you of what extremity Parliament had concluded concerning religion; suppressing the truth, and setting forth the untruth; intending to cause all men, by extremity to forswear themselves : and to take again for the head of the church a very enemy, as the Word of God and all ancient writers do record. And for lack of law and authority they will use force and extremity, which have been the arguments to defend the pope and popery since their authority first began in the world.”—Same, page 195.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Modern Leopard Spots</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Would not Hooper’s words spoken just before he was burned at the stake, in Gloucester, nearly 400 years ago, apply today? Gilbert 0. Nations, Ph.D., writing in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Monitor</span><span class="font6"> of February 12, 1938, describes the Vatican and Hierarchical system as “The Arch Malefactor”, and asks, “What malignant power has suddenly frozen the spirit of liberty and humanity m every continent? What evil force can reach and mobilize arbitrary dictators in every land? What world-wide authority has all the secrets of every government, every nation and every individual! What wo rid-encircling gov<sup>1 </sup>ernment ia totally autocratic and excludes from its organization every liberal tendency?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“What autocrat rules under claim of sole agency of Almighty God on this earth? What throne has condemned the sovereignty of the people in many high official utterances?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Continuing this description of the pope, Mr. Nations affirms: “He now has treaties of virtual alliance with Hitler and Mussolini and the other Fascist tyrants. He lias ambassadors called nuncios stationed at forty of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">21</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the world’s capitals.....Nearly a million</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">priests in the deep seer&amp;y of the confessional gather every secret of every heart. . . . In- ' comparable propaganda constantly sweeps the earth. ... Its censorship and propaganda are fatal in their destructive force. But they are as nothing compared with the secret avenues and processes by which liberty, justice and democracy are being steadily undermined . . . under the sway and destructive plots of the autocrat of the seven hills.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Chamberlain is undoubtedly in possession of these facts. If he is not he is scarcely competent to guide the course, in the present turmoil, of the greatest nation on the earth. But the prime minister is just beginning the road to Rome. Let us return to the days when the act was performed in a thorough-going fashion, when through “Bloody Queen Mary” the unlimited viciousness of the hearts of the Hierarchy was entirely unrestrained. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Murder of Innocents</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Smithfield the dismal “pageant of Whitehall” took the staunch Rogers for its victim. He was led along before his wife with his nine children, and their infant babe on her breast, to see him burned to death for his opposition to popery. “The fire was lighted. The suffering seemed to be nothing. He bathed his hands in the flame as 'if it were cold water’, raised his hands to heaven, and died.” —Froude’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reign of Mary Tudor,</span><span class="font6"> page 192.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After a lapse of a few months the purging out of “heretics” took another spurt. This “inquisition established by the legate was not to commence till Easter. Outside of the four leaders of the Reformation the Catholic bishops were for the most part prudent in their selection of victims, and chose them chiefly from the poor and unfriended”. Lawrence was burned at Colchester. Hi$ legs “had been crushed in one of Bonner’s prisons; he was unable to stand and was placed at the stake •in a chair. ... At his burning young children came about and cried, as well as young children could speak, 'Lord, strengthen thy sen.’ant’ ”.—Same, page 201. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">William Hunter, a Reformist, was “ordered to attend mass by a priest”, which he refused to do. Later a “Catholic magistrate in the neighborhood required his father to produce him ...” He was condemned to die at the stake, and as he was burning a priest shrieked, “Look, how thou burnest here; so shalt thou burn in hell.”—Same, pages 202-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About now in her reign Mary must have been giving the pope’s heart real joy; but he was not quite satisfied. He no doubt using the papal legate Reginald Pole to work upon her religious susceptibilities, she was induced to believe that her failure to have a child was due to the sin of sparing the “heretics”. She was told that she had committed the misdeed of Saul in sparing the Agagites. Thus spurred to action “she wrote a circular to quicken the languid zeal of the bishops. . . . Under the fresh impulse of this letter, fifty persons were put to death at the stake in the three ensuing months”.—Same, pages 211-2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“All evidence concurs to show that after Philip’s (Spanish heir to the throne and Mary’s husband) departure Cardinal Pole was the single advisor on whom Mary relied. . .. From the (papal) legate came the first episcopal inquisition;—the most frightful scenes in the entire frightful period were witnessed under the shadow of his metropolitan cathedral.” (Canterbury) (Same, page 223) “Pole believed that in the catalogue of human iniquities there was none greater than the denial of the Roman Catholic faith, or the rejection of the Roman bishop’s supremacy.” This was Mary’s guide who was to assist in the perpetration of further horrors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Perhaps of all the victims of this murderous scourging out of “heretics” Cranmer was the most interesting. He was a Catholic bishop high in authority who objected to the excesses of Mary and “maintained that no English subject could swear allegiance to a foreign power without being involved in perjury”. Ordered to answer charges to the bishop of Gloucester, “representing his holiness the pope,” he stated: “The pope is contrary to the crown. I cannot obey both.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While a Catholic he had a wife secretly and gave this reason; 'it was better for him to have his own wife, than to do like other priests, having the wives of others.’ (Same, pages 227-8) These facts were duly presented to Pope Paul IV. Cranmer was tried in Rome and notified of his conviction. At the last moment he recanted; and instead of permitting him to live out his days in the ignominy of a broken heart, the papacy overstepped itself. When he was led to the stake and the fires kindled he held his right hand in the flame until burnt to a crisp in repudiation of his recantation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bonner, who performed many of these sacrifices to appease the papal Moloch at Rome,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">•CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">was called ‘common cut-throat and general slaughter-slave to all the bishops in England<sup>5</sup>1 The writer continued to say that 20,000 Catholics had been turned to the Protestant cause by the atrocious cruelty, and that he would never obtain his “popish purpose in suppressing the truth” in this manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">More Blood, More Money for Rome</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But, once an Inquisitioner always an Inqui-sitioner. The work went ahead: “But martyrdom was often but a relief from more barbarous atrocities. In the sad winter months which were approaching the poor men and women, who, untried and uncondemned, were crowded into the bishop’s prisons, experienced such miseries as the very dogs could scarcely suffer and survive. They were beaten, they were starved, they were flung into dark fetid dens, where rotting straw was their bed, their feet were fettered in the stocks—while the wretches who died were flung out into the fields where none might bury them,” (Same, page 234) Thus the English Inquisition had reached the ultimate of religious madness. Meanwhile the pope prospered in several w'ays: many were induced into making bribes to priests to insure their safety; the queen commanded that “his holiness” receive one-tenth of all ecclesiastical benefices; of all the property confiscated from those slain he received his share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hitler Praised by Hierarchy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the account of the prison methods one is reminded of the concentration camps of Adolph Hitler; herein are foully incarcerated hundreds of thousands of liberty-lovers, among which are at least 5,000 of Jehovah’s witnesses. The cruelty in these camps is of the kind practiced in Mary’s reign, but the Hitler Inquisition has added some modern refinements in torture. If any doubt that Hitler is merely the twentieth-century model of the ancient malevolents, let all doubt be removed by the words of a Catholic priest published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The German</span><span class="font6"> of May 29, 1938; “When Adolph Hitler came to power and the German episcopate repeated their request, Hitler said: ‘These so-called “Jehovah’s witnesses” are troublemakers;—I do not tolerate that the German Catholics be besmirched in such a manner by this American “Judge Rutherford”;—their property I dedicate to the people’s welfare; I will have all their literature confiscated.’ ” Hitler went further; he persecuted, tortured and killed for the cause of the pope. Is it possible</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEMBER U, 1938 </span><span class="font6">thdt he is not a comrade-in-murder of the present pope? or th^t the Hierarchy with its infinite espionage system does not know its friends? Will not some voice which the English trust cry out against this monstrosity which the prime minister seeks to marry to the British Commonwealth of Nations? Surely many in Britain know whither the road to Rome leads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Inquisitioner Is Dead;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'Long Live the Inquisitioner<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To the last Mary was a subject of the pope. “On the morning of November 17, 1558, after receiving extreme unction—she—expired.”— Strickland’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lives</span><span class="font6"> of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the Queens of England.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">EVery encyclopedia shows that centuries before the birth of Christ many were worshiping the rebirth of Sol, the sun, commemorating it with evergreen, holly, mistletoe and the Yule log, as now with the “Christmas tree”. The evergreen tree, to represent that the sim did not really die at the winter solstice, was used in’ the days of Semiramis, mother and wife of Nimrod, to proclaim the Devil’s lie that Nimrod did not really die, but had an immortal soul, kept on living, and at his apparent death became king of all the gods. This was and is a reproach to the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ever since then the third day after the winter solstice (December 25) was used to illustrate this, the 'Devil’s lie, first told in Eden. That lie, “Ye shall not surely die,” is the central theme of all religion. Thus, Christmas celebrations are, in faet, celebrations in honor of the Devil himself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The wish is father to the racket</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">Take a look at the facts. The Devil for centuries has been called “'Old Nick”, transformed by easy stages into “Saint Nicholas”, and thence to “Santa Claus”. The feast in his honor is one of overeating, overdrinking, lying to children, and operating a racket that shoves off on the poor people huge quantities of worthless junk for which they have no use, at unusually high prices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The evidence is that Jesus was born about October 1; so it is argued He was conceived December 25. But neither He nor His Father ever commanded anybody to celebrate either of these dates. The whole celebration is based on false statements; and when the children learn that their parents have lied to them, they are hurt. A New Orleans lad </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font6">heard to say, “Now I have learned that Santa Claus is the Devil, and I expect next thing to learn who Jesus is.” Just think of the harm </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;What about the “three wise men”? Answer: They were religionists [magicians, (Greek)], lured on by an eerie light, miscalled a “star”, which light was supplied </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font6">the Devil, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">was intended to result in the destruction of the Savior at the hands of Herod.

<p><span class="font19">H</span><span class="font6"> Uncle Charley took Jane’s arm and helped her over the partly-frozen stream. Then he lifted Buddy and Bunny across. Is was fun, walking through the snow-covered fields and the deep, silent woods with Uncle Charley. It was much more fun when there was a surprise in store.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Is it very far?” Bunny asked, for the sixth time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“No,” replied Uncle Charley. “Are you getting tired, Bunny?’*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Oh, no,” answered the little girl. And to prove that she wasn’t, Bunny ran up the little hill ahead. But suddenly she slipped and came tumbling and sliding back down to the bottom. For just a moment she looked surprised, then laughed, “That was fun 1”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At last Uncle Charley said, “Just down this little path, now, and we shall be there.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Such beauty!” Jane cried, as she gazed down into the hollow' which long ago had been cut by a small river. Mines and dams and dredging of the larger river for shipping had all helped to make of this little river a small stream. It trickled along now, under its thin layer of ice, winding about among rocks and trees and steep banks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And here is my surprise,” said Uncle Charley. Reaching forward he pulled aside a mass of tangled, snow-laden branches. Coming closer and looking under the branches, the children saw a wall of great rocks with a large hole in the midst of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Go on in,” invited Uncle Charley, holding up the flashlight he had .brought along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Oh, a cave!” cried Buddy, with sparkling, eyes. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just the sort of thing any boy would love, Jane thought, as she followed him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Inside the cave was a group of the most wonderful stones, cut into beautiful shapes^</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“How did they get that way?” Buddy asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“They, are part of Nature’s handiwork,” Uncle Charley explained. “Nature is the greatest of al] artists. The things she builds take hundreds of years to make and last still more hundreds of years once they are made. They may take any shape or form ; for God’s great artist builds slowly and eternally. We humans know only what we have learned from Nature —from mighty rocks and from tiny snowflakes ; from the arch of a man’s foot and from the colors of a butterfly’s wing. We know only the things which Jehovah in His divine wisdom and love allowed us to learn.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bunny looked a little puzzled. “That’s too long a speech for you, isn’t it?” Uncle Charley said. “Then let us say it this way. Long ago a river ran through here, and as it flowed along it washed over the rocks and against the rocks. For many, many years it did this. Little by little the rocks began to wear away, rapidly in some places, more slovvly in others. At last a eave was formed and in that cave were many rocks carved into pretty shapes by the water. The river grew smaller and left the eave just as it was.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Are there any caves bigger than this?” Buddy asked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Many of them. Some of them are so large it would take days to walk through them. Some of them have such beautiful and strange things inside that we do not have words enough to tell about them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“How foolish man should feel,” Jane said, “to talk of his greatness and his wisdom when he compares his little efforts with such vast things!” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Everyone would do well to realize that,” Uncle Charley answered. “Caves, like this, great walls, great valleys, great bridges, great mountains—all built and carved in stone without the help of man; and overhead glowing sunrises and flaming sunsets and strange lightnings; man has little excuse for boasting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I’d like to come here often,” Buddy remarked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I have one more surprise for you,” said Uncle Charley. Taking them a little farther back into the eave, he pointed to a small, rather hidden hollow. There, curled up and very soundly asleep, lay a beautiful large skunk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“What’s he doing ?” asked Bunny. ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“He’s sleeping until early spring. Last fall he ate enough to last him all winter. Then he crawled in here to wait for warm weather.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bunny giggled. “This is a nice surprise.” Just then Sally joined them unexpectedly,. which was the nicest surprise of all.—Contributed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p><img src="g_E_19381214_files/g_E_19381214-24.png" alt="" style="width:198pt;height:44pt;"><img src="g_E_19381214_files/g_E_19381214-25.png" alt="" style="width:63pt;height:73pt;">

<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>The Political Situation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">• All the world kqows the history of the events which happened in Europe during the political crisis in central Europe, In itself the dispute between Hitler and his backers and the government of Czechoslovakia might have had as little world repercussion as Hitler’s rape of Austria, But the situation was different: the Czechs were comparatively strong and could meet force by force, however small a chance they had of finally resisting their attackers, Also, they buttressed themselves in determined opposition against Germany’s aggression because of the pact they had with France, who had promised to gid them if attacked by an enemy force, and because of the agreement there was that Britain would go to the aid of France if in such war France should be in danger from enemy forces. In pursuance of his set purpose to dominate central Europe and to bring all German nationals under his control—and always with the wider purpose of dominating the political situation in Europe, Hitler, under guise of usual .autumn maneuvers, mobilized the greater part of his army, (He speaks of the German people as “my people”.) When his time had come he made demands on Czechoslovakia for certain portions of its territory, and said plainly that if this was not agreed to he would take what he wanted by force. It seems impossible to think that he was unaware of the effect this demand would have on France and Britain. He probably thought that his recent ‘^bloodless conquest” of Austria, accepted by the governments in Europe and by Britain, could be repeated, except for a short fighting opposition. History often gives an account of things hidden at the time of action, but probably the world will never know the hidden things of Hitler’s mind, nor the things kept secret by those immediately involved; for. the time cannot be far off when all these things will be blotted out by the destruction of Armageddon. The records of the kingdom of heaven will not be sullied by those of evil minds, nor give any account of the schemes of the poli-</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">tieians, financiers and religionists involved in them. There are many who believe that even to the end Hitler’s activities were a great bluff, and that at the pinch he would have cried off. Perhaps it is more reasonable to think that he expected both France and Britain to decide that the costs of war to themselves were more than they would undertake. As the crisis developed there came great uneasiness in Britain. The politicians got busy: a great cry was raised for the salvation of democracy; for the Czechs were its only representatives left in central Europe, and its loss there Would mean the strengthening of the -dictator powers. Until this time the people of Britain had been little disturbed by the dispute between Hitler and the Czechs; but suddenly the affair loomed large and threatening: the theories of forms of government were cast aside; for a European conflagration was imminent. When Hitler showed his persistency and revealed his set purpose a war scare broke on the people, and the government’s action in hurrying their air raid precautions helped the scare. Men began to count upon' being called up, and the women to prepare themselves for their men’s going away. Millions of gas masks were fitted in quick time; trenches were dug in the parks and in innumerable gardens. The radio kept the people partly informed, and the newspapers had their greatest time. There was questioning of the prime minister’s action when he first went to see Hitler, but when ah last he came back announcing an agreement which deferred the war, there was universal thankfulness for the relief. In the House of Commons there was almost hysterical demonstration. “Peace in our time,” and “No more war with Germany”, were the first declarations the premier made after the Munich conference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But after the relief from the dread and fear of what a war would surely bring, and the realization that, after all, Hitler had gained his ends, there was almost a revulsion of feeling, not about being thrown into war, but as to the result of the agreement in the consequences sure to follow. It was a strange business to have the heads of four nations discussing the partial dismemberment and the crippling of another and the victim not Consulted. The four were seeking the interests of their own countries while consulting how much of the body of the victim could be left to function. However, a world war was stopped for the time, and so there was benefit to all. When the premier announced his intention</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">to go and see Hitler the people thought he; had gone “to beard the lion in his den”; but they found that, after all, he had got only a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">few </span><span class="font6">hairs of the beast; for Hitler had </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">gained </span><span class="font6">his </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">end, </span><span class="font6">the annexation of Sudeten Czecho</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">slovakia. </span><span class="font6">The acid test of the claim ‘No more </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">war .in our </span><span class="font6">time' was supplied by the premier </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">himself </span><span class="font6">when he said that Britain’s war prep-</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">- stations </span><span class="font6">must continue, and that rearmament</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">must go on at an accelerated rate. The two totalitarian governors, Hitler and Mussolini, are not trusted: they break their word readily. Neither uses the language of diplomacy: they understand plain facts, the fact of force against force; and no doubt the mobilization of the British fleet was the easiest thing for Hitler to understand. Hence, while they are in power their possible enemies must act as they do. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">volume of opinion critical of the affair is being expressed. There is a realization that . Hitler’s position in Europe has been greatly strengthened, and with that a corresponding weakness of Britain’s democratic influence in the world. There is a rising fear that the people in this land who favor totalitarian meth</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ods </span><span class="font6">in government have received a stimulus —and there are many in the high and dry places of political influence who would regularize the people and their affairs according to the Fascist idea. It appears that there are several saviors of the peace of Europe and of the world. Hitler, the world’s greatest disturber, claims to have given Europe peace; his friend, his “dear friend”, Mussolini, claimed it when he got to Rome; the British people accorded the honor to Mr. Chamberlain, and the religionists reckon that their prayers saved . Europe from war. There is another, a “rever</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">end” </span><span class="font6">who has managed to get reported in a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">South* </span><span class="font6">Wales paper, claiming a special bit of attention, He has a scheme in process of establishment which to be successful—and he says </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that. </span><span class="font6">God started him on his work—needed peace in the land. “No man in Wales,” he </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">said, </span><span class="font6">“had so much to lose as he,” and that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">material matters and in faith. So he prayed tp God to prevent war. One thing is certain; that is, that the men involved in the talks and discussion in Munich, the four big chiefs, didn’t think of God. It may well be said of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">- . then*, ‘God is not </span><span class="font6">in all their thoughts.’ (See</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Psalm 10:4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Results</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• AU </span><span class="font6">this is going to make a great difference to the lives of the people in Britain. There </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEMBER </span><span class="font6">14, 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font6">those who want forthwith a conscripted army. Mr. Chamberlain said of this, “There will be no conscription by this government.” But as the present Parliament must be dissolved before long, his assurance does not carry very far, and it is possible that if another election resulted in a similar substantial majority for his party a form of conscription would be quickly put into operation. There is certain to be a registration of all persons available for service to the state. Then will come the cry of the state as having first call upon all citizens. The political situation is now such as will compel Britain to face the fact that life cannot be as hitherto, but that the face of the world is changed. With the possibility of broken pacts and ruthleSs aggression under false pretenses the feeling of security is gone. Perhaps withholding conscription except in a time of emergency, it will be made to appear a very reasonable thing that each person should show something to prove his loyalty to his country. Undoubtedly the religious organizations will both be expected and will be ready acceptors of any such schemes as shall appear to preserve Britain from being placed under a foreign power. It will be no matter for surprise if the wearing of symbol of loyalty is introduced, nor if school children arc expected to salute the national flag—and this has already<sup>1</sup> been suggested as a fine means of instilling patriotism in the young minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not always realized that the Church of England can be made to be of service to the State. It is, of course, part of the State. Its archbishops and bishops are appointed by the king, through his ministers in practice. The king, as the State, has chief power in all matters civil and ecclesiastical. The 37th of the articles by which the Church of England is regulated, after declaring that the king (the State) has this power, says it is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the magistrate, to wear weapons and to serve in war. Every priest at his ordination has to promise to obey his superior, and the bishops appointed by the State must take an oath to obey the archbishop, and the archbishop does the same to his head, the king. If then the king (the State) should order that certain State arrangement be made known by the priests —the vicars, rectors, incumbents — in the churches; if an appeal for certain help is ordered to be made, none may refuse. The authorities in the Church of England have not been ready.to use their authority over recal-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">citrant parsons; but once this matter comes up, it is certain slackness will not be allowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whatever view may be taken of the policy of the- British government followed for some years, and latterly shown leanings toward the governments of the totalitarian states, there is no questioning the fact that those states are now the chief factors in European politics, and that they have gained greatly in status from the Munich conferences. It is also true that the totalitarian idea has gained some ground in Britain, and its adherents are strengthened. All this is' strong confirmation ■ of the speech by Judge Rutherford in the Royal Albert Hail in London, and at the time when the crisis was arising. He bade the people take warning a'nd face the facts of totalitarian aggression, not merely in respect to the aggression of Hitler, but of that monster represented by the determination to put the state in the place of God, whether represented by the Papal Hierarchy or by any other power which seeks to control the peoples. The religious systems, often spoken of as “organized religion”, are now threatened with two destructive forces. One they have already begun to experience: the peoples are turning from them in apathy and disbelief in their claims and sincerity, and often in disgust; for the light of truth has fallen on them and their false claims. On the other hand, the totalitarian system of government as represented by Nazism and Fascism, while acknowledging religion, makes it subservient to the state and puts its dictator and the state in the place of God. The Roman Hierarchy is being competed With in its own game; for in its set purpose as a political power -it has made a religion to suit its purpose. The pope has already expressed the need of seeking some means of co-operation with the Nazi power in this new development; with the other he has it already. Russian Socialism, which is Communism, would destroy Christianity, false or real; but Nazi and Fascist totalitarianism will accept religion, but only as a means to the ends in view. Certainly the events of the past days have given much point to the warning by Judge Rutherford when he showed that the Scriptures show that the Hierarchy in combination with these world forces make the monster represented by Goliath. The end of it is destruction in Armageddon as Jehovah proceeds to finish the work of the vindication of His name, and which is the root cause of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">30</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the world trouble, even as the prophecies foretold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">fcifidel Parsons</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• Religionists use the words “infidel” and “anti-God” of those who call themselves “Freethinkers”, Rightly, of course: he who does not believe the Word of God is an infidel and is against God. Many Freethinkers are theists: they do not deny the fact of a Creator, but deny any revelation. But the terms are not to be limited to declared skeptics and refusers of that which by religionists is claimed to be Christianity, but which in fact is religion posing as Christianity. There are religious leaders who are jnfidels, and who have done much more- injury<sup>7</sup> to the people than the self-declared infidel. Posing as teachers they have led multitudes into unbelief of the Scriptures ■ as the Word of God. They have denied the faith, and stand in the same place as the Pharisees, who made the word of God of none effect by their traditions, and, as the Sadducees, who were flat unbelievers of much that God had revealed and spoken. A book of “explanations”, published as a “Companion to a short Bible”, written by a canon of Liverpool cathedral, says, “The Bible story of creation was based upon a similar story derived from Babylonia”; of the record in connection with the Flood, “It repented the Lord”; “God is thought of in very human terms as regretting his work, the results of which he does not seem to have foreseen.” Of the language confusion at Babel, “the same motive, jealousy, caused this, as when he is said to have banished Adam and Eve from Eden and sentenced them and the serpent.” These men ought to take their place with those openly known as infidels. They will surely soon be placed there; for they and their systems are being brought into the judgments of God. They are anti-God in opposing His Word and in their unbelief, and / they are of antichrist, having the spirit of antichrist.—1 John 2:18,19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark111"></a>Twenty Years After 1918</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Twenty years after the Great Foolishness the “bodies” of 768 British soldiers were found on the battlefields of France, and though, as usual, most of the bpdies had been blown to smithereens, enough service badges were found to “identify” 189 of the poor boys that gave their all to make the world what it is now.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>Natural Bridge — Cover Design for This Number</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6"> NATURAL bridge or natural arches one of the interesting things in this interesting world that lead the mind to contemplation of the fact that there is a great designer hack of the beauties and wonders of nature, animate and inanimate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A natural arch or bridge is one that is fonnqd without the aid of man, by the forces of nature, out of virgin rock or stone, spanning a stream or valley or gorge, or standing out from the side of a mountain or cliff. The well-known Pont d’Arc, of France, it is believed, was formed by a river’s cutting through the rock, perhaps by first finding a crevice or break, and gradually enlarging it, until there was a wide opening beneath the overhanging rock. There are many similar natural bridges in southern Utah. One of these, the Rainbow Arch, has a height of 309 feet, and spans an opening of over 278 feet. The arch itself is 40 feet thick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is also a remarkable natural bridge in Virginia, noted for its grandeur. This bridge has a height of 236 feet, a span of 50 feet, and a thickness of 40 feet. It stands out prominently from the surrounding landscape beneath and has a roadway loading over it. From this roadway nothing remarkable is to be seen. One must descend to the lower ground to appreciate the majestic view presented by this remarkable natural phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But just at this point there is a slight obstacle, in the form of a sort of tollgate, through which it is necessary to pass in order to get a satisfactory and satisfying view of the handiwork of God at this particular point. It is necessary to pay a price, in other words, for &quot;earth hath its price for what earth gives us”, and frequently men set a price upon that which should be as free as the mountain air. So it is here. The spot has been preserved in all its rustic beauty, but to add, if possible, to the awesome spectacle an organ has been installed in a suitable spot, and as one approaches the majestic arch the sounds of the organ are heard, at first faintly, then swelling louder and louder as the view of the natural wonder becomes more and more impressive.</span></p>

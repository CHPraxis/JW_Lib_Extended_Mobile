<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH'S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth ean come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall live on earth forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Be not afraid</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH GOD made the prophetic picture with Jehoshaphat, the other Judeans, and their enemies, exactly portraying what is now taking place in the earth when the anointed servants of God are going out to face the treacherous enemy that seeks their destruction. From that picture information is now to be gained which is of inestimable value to all </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">consecrated. In the prophetic picture the covenant people of God, the Judeans, in military order, marched out of the gates of Jerusalem and began their trek to face the enemy and to behold their salvation at the hand of the Almighty. In the van marched the musicians, singing the praises of Jehovah; back of these was the mixed army or company of men, which probably was insignificant in compari</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">son </span><span class="font3">with the strength of the enemy. That multitude of Judeans was made up of a mixed company of men, women and children, and with them strangers who were non-Judeans. The wisdom and power that was guiding that mean-looking little army was invisible to human eyes, but Jehoshaphat and the people with him had full faith and confidence in that supreme power and joyfully followed along as directed. On another occasion Jehovah had given Elisha and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font3">servant a vision of the mighty host of heaven that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font3">protecting them. Now in the closing days of the Elisha work on earth Jehovah is giving his anointed remnant and their companions a mental vision of the heavenly host that is shielding and protecting them and that will gain the victory to the glory of Jehovah God. As in ancient times, so now Jehovah God, representatively in Christ Jesus and his host of holy angels, rides above the earthly company, directing every step of those who love and obey the Lord.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> The trained singers who were in the lead and knowing that victory was assured, at a given signal would break forth in song to the praise of the Most High, and undoubtedly, their songs were with fervency and of genuine praise to Jehovah: “And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set am-bushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.” (2 Chron. 20:22) The setting of the ambushment by the Lord God against the enemy is thrilling, and it is with profit that we consider the surrounding circumstances and the manner in which this ambushment was set and what resulted. It was early in the morning, and in that rare atmosphere of the Judean hills the songs of the singers must have floated out far ahead of them, reaching the ears of the enemy before the opposing forces came into view of each other. To those military strategists directing the combined enemy the procedure on the part of the Judeans of coming to meet them with song must have been a very strange thing, and so the enemy would regard the Judeans and their companions as fanatics. The enemy would chuckle on the easy job they would have to clean them out when they approached. Well do the facts of the present day fulfill that prophetic picture. God’s people under the command and leadership of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is supported by his host of militant angels, march out to face the enemy. The threats of the enemy, and the display of their power, their boasting and strutting about, do not at all deter the faithful from going forward. These faithful servants trust Jehovah and his great military Leader, and they know that victory is certain because the battle is God’s, and therefore they cannot keep back the song, because they have been commanded to be witnesses to the name of Jehovah. This antitypical company of Judeans, Jehovah’s faithful witnesses and their companions, break forth in song, telling of Jehovah’s “beauty of holiness”, of his glorious King, and of his kingdom, and of all the blessings that shall flow out to the obedient ones of mankind. Agreeable to his commandment, they tell of Jehovah’s vengeance against the religionists and the Devil religion and of the true worship of Almighty God, which is exactly opposite to religion. The combined enemy, the modern-day Ammonites, Moabites, and mount-Seir-ites, hear the songs of God’s devoted people, and they sneer and snicker and say amongst themselves: “What a bunch of fanatical fools, to think they can come out against us.” To all the world of unbelievers the action and the message and the songs of Jehovah’s witnesses, the modern-day Judeans, seem</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">to be very strange. The carrying of that message from door to door and telling the people and singing the praises of Jehovah, to all except the faithful ones appears to be a very strange work. It is Jehovah’s work, and it is indeed a “strange work”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">* The Judeans, led by the singers, praised, and the modern-day Judeans now praise, Jehovah, who has ‘put his words in their mouth, and covered them with his mighty hand’, and their songs proclaim the honor of Jehovah’s name, the victory for his forces, and the complete vindication of the name of the Most High. The typical people of the ancient time marched, and now the antitypical people march, to the battlefield, and Jehovah times every step of his servants, that each and every thing shall come to pass according to his will. He is maneuvering both sides. Hearing the songs of the approaching Judeans, the Ammonites and allies think it well to prepare to receive them and take them by surprise, and therefore to prepare an ambushment; but the fact is, the Lord Jehovah did the preparing. God, directing their movements, set the ambushment against the enemy and the forces supporting them. The record reads: “Jehovah had set liers-in-wait.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font3"> The combined forces of the enemy thought that they would prepare to take the Judeans wholly unawares and destroy them before they could realize their situation. They did not figure the matter just right. The liers-in-wait must have been chiefly the Moabites and Ammonites, and they would take the honor of slaying the Judeans and their companions; and this purpose on their part is made certain by the words that follow in the twenty-third verse of the prophetic picture. As then, so it is today: the great General of the earthly hosts was directing everything to the advantage of his own people. The prophet describes the action of the enemy in these words: “For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, 0 Lord. They run and prepare themselves without my fault [without my being at fault]: awake to help me, and behold. Thou, therefore, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen [Moabites and their allies]: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah. They [the enemy] return at evening [when darkness falls; which antitypically came in 1919 and behind which the enemy expected to hide] : they make a noise like a dog [snarling, growling and howling; the howling such as the old ‘whore’ is now doing], and go round about the city. . . . Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.” —Ps. 59:3-6,15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">* As it was then, so now Satan’s representatives are the ones who, filled with malicious hatred, lie in wait to take undue advantage of the righteous ones. Satan has put that murderous spirit in the heart of the modern-day Ammonites, Moabites, and others to take Jehovah’s witnesses by surprise and crush them. The psalmist describes it in these words: “He lieth in wait secretly, as a lion in his den; he lieth in wait to catch the poor; he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.” (Ps. 10:9) The enemy expects to draw Jehovah’s witnesses into a trap, and they are setting such traps, as is illustrated by compulsory flag-saluting and other like things. If they had studied God’s Word, they would know what God has to say to them by such lying in wait. With the religionists, especially the leaders, there is no excuse for failure to know, because they have had possession of the Bible. Concerning such the Lord says: “Lay not wait, 0 wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place; for a just man falleth seven times [under oppression by his enemies, as in 1918], and riseth up again [even as now, when the Nazi-misguided Germans are persecuting the righteous] : but the wicked shall fall into mischief [that is, into their own trap, resulting in their destruction].” —Prov. 24:15,16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> It was the purpose of the Moabites and allies to crush the Judeans. It is the purpose now of the same combined enemy of modern times to crush Jehovah’s witnesses. Back in those ancient days it was Jehovah who maneuvered the enemy and set the ambushment and caused the enemy to take that position, which would result in their own downfall. The enemy make the pit for God’s people, but they fall into it themselves: “He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.” (Ps. 7:15) “The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made; in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. The Lord is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands... .* The wicked shall be turned into hell [instead of steering the faithful servants of God into hell], and all the nations that forget God [religious ‘Christendom’ has forgotten God by plotting against his faithful servants].” (Ps. 9:15-17) All these prophecies are written for the benefit of God’s people, and they describe the situation as it will be at Armageddon: “So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves; all that see them shall flee away. And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God: for they shall wisely consider of his doing.”—Ps. 64: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> This further shows that God maneuvers the enemy to bring about his purpose, and this shall result in causing all who behold to know that the great Jehovah God is taking over the fight in behalf of his people. God puts into the mouth of his people the prayer, which now they pray: “Grant not, 0 Lord, the desires of the wicked; further not his wicked device, lest they exalt themselves. As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. Let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again. Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth; evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him, I know that the Lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor. Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name; the upright shall dwell in thy presence.” (Ps. 140:8-13) The fact that God has put this prayer into the mouth of his people shows that he will grant the petition and visit the enemy with destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’ The, Ammonites and Moabites hid themselves, of course, with the knowledge and consent of those of Mount Seir. Now it appears that the modern-day Ammonites and Moabites, fanatical politicians and financiers, at the instance of the religionists, prepare to bring about the destruction of God’s people. On marched the singing Judeans, never faltering in their step, and then suddenly the fight began, and the Lord sums it up in the brief words concerning the result of the fight against the enemy: &quot;And they [the enemy] were smitten.” The Judeans did not even engage in the fight. The fight had come to pass as God had told them, that “the battle is not yours, but God’s”. Seemingly a bungle had been made; but not so. The result was the direct “act of God”, foretelling God’s “strange act” that he will cause to come upon the enemy at the battle of Armageddon. The modern-day combined enemy against Jehovah’s witnesses consult together and conclude that the wiping out of Jehovah’s witnesses must take place, but that they will do it in such an easy, quiet and apparently legal manner that others will approve their action. Their counsel shall fail: “The Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen [anti-God and anti-kingdom crowd] to nought; he maketh the devices of the people [who are against God] of none effect.” (Ps. 33:10) Today the “great whore” is riding on the back of “the beast” and she is fatally bent on destroying God’s faithful remnant, and she expects to have this destruction brought about at the hands of the commercial and political crowd; but Jehovah informs his people that, “strange” as it may seem to the religionists, the “ten horns” and “the beast” will hate the old wench or whore, who now rides, and will snap back at her, tear her, and burn her with fire. (Rev. 17:16,17) This God pictured at the battle that took place and resulted in the destruction of the enemies that marched against the people of Judah under Jehoshaphat.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">• the battle took place in broad daylight, when the visibility was good, and the fact that the Judeans weye singing loudly shows that they appeared openly and aboveboard. The purpose in the outset on the part of the enemy was that the Judeans should be slain. But mark what really took place: “For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them; and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.”—2 Chron. 20:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">* Keep in mind that Jehovah there made a prophetic picture for the specific instruction and learning of his people now on earth, informing them of what shall come to pass at the beginning of the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Did Ammon and Moab make a mistake, resulting in the destruction of the people of Mount Seir? Whether they did or not, the picture definitely discloses the present-day conditions, and shows that there is no mistake. God maneuvered the forces then, and he will do it at Armageddon.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Today the commercial elements constitute the antitype of Moab, which commercial elements include the military crowd, bent on shedding blood; while Ammon pictured the present-day political crowd that do the bidding of the commercial and religious element. Having in mind now the political element, and particularly the younger sons who are deliberately reckless and wanton and who have gotten out of control of the older ones, who have heretofore dealt with the religious crowd, particularly the Roman Catholic element, “with kid gloves,” we see a change rapidly taking place toward the religionists. The younger, reckless element amongst the political crowd, which are now in the saddle, particularly in Nazi Germany, have no regard for anything that pertains to God. They know that the religionists, and particularly the Roman Catholic crowd, are racketeers carrying on a most devastating racket. The “strange work” of the Lord, in which Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged, has probably had something to do with bringing this information to the minds of others, making known the fact that the religionists are useless barnacles riding on the back of the political and commercial elements. They are losing respect for the religionists, and it is to be expected that this will increase in the near future. The people generally, and particularly the Communists and Fascists, have no regard for religionists or anything that names the name of God. The Communists are now against the Hierarchy, and they are also just as much against Jehovah’s witnesses, or even more so, because Jehovah’s witnesses truly serve Jehovah God. The Scriptures indicate that the commercial and political elements, including the Communists, will soon learn that their investments in religion are very unprofitable to them. Those elements, pictured by the ones who really hid themselves to slay the Judeans, but who suddenly stood up and slew the inhabitants of Mount Seir, in antitype now prepare to slay the antitypical Judeans, or Jehovah’s witnesses, but by reason of the Lord’s maneuvering them that political, commercial and Communistic mob will ‘stand up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir [that is to say, the religionists] and smite them’. In the type the miscarriage of the plan to slay the Judeans was plainly due to the direct “act of God”. Likewise now Jehovah’s “strange work” is going on and is opening the eyes of the many people to the crookedness of the religionists, and in his due time God’s “strange act” will bring about the destruction of the religious element by those of the political, commercial and Communistic elements. This conclusion is supported by the prophecy of Obadiah six and seven: “How are the things of Esau [Esau, who is Edom; that is, the Religious element] searched out! how are his hidden things sought up! All the men of thy confederacy [commercial, political, Communistic] have brought thee even to the border; the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee; there is none understanding in him. Shall I not in that day, saith the Lord, even destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau? And thy mighty men, 0 Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter. For thy violence against thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.”—Obad. 6-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Even now the religionists are forsaking God and his Word altogether and placing the state or political power above the things pertaining to their so-called “worship”. Now, when religionists desire the political and commercial element to take adverse action against Jehovah’s witnesses, they, led by the clergy, say: “We have no king but Casar [the state].” (John 19:15) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font3">their further attempt to ensnare Jehovah’s witnesses the religionists advocate the tricky flag-saluting show and like shows that have always been foreign to liberty-loving people, and this they do that Jehovah’s witnesses may be compelled to ‘render unto Casar [that is, to the state]’ everything that the state presumptuously demands. The religionists, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, assume to be the advisors of the other elements, and therefore they put the state above God and urge those directly representing the state to compel everyone to recognize the state above Jehovah. As the allied crowd in the days of the captivity of the Israelites in Babylon set a trap for the faithful Hebrews (Daniel third chapter), even so now the religionists set a trap and dig a pit for those who faithfully serve Jehovah God, and, as the Scriptures show, those conspirators shall fall into their own pit. They will learn that they have carried the matter too far and that they have put “Csesar”, that is, the state, far above God and they have permitted themselves to become subject to the radical, political element, and now they must take the consequences. Bent on having everything their own way, the radical Nazi-Fascist element rule the country and the people with a cruel and oppressive hand and will go to the full extreme; and this is clearly foreshadowed in the prophetic picture here considered. Ammon and Moab completely destroyed their one-time ally, those of Mount Seir; they left not any of them. The prophetic picture, therefore, shows that the radical element of politics and commerce, at the present moment allied with the religionists and religious racketeers, will turn upon the religious allies and put an end </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to them. In </span><span class="font3">support of this statement and prophecy above mentioned, note further the prophecy, to wit, Ezekiel 23:11-30, discussed in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> Book One, page 309; and also Ezekiel 16:28-41, considered in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> Book One, page 192.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> With the beginning of Armageddon Satan’s organization is therefore certain to be divided against itself. (Matt. 12:25) At that time there may be another attempt of the pope to escape in disguise similar to or like what was done in 1848, when the pope made his escape from Rome and fled to Gaeta. The disguise worked all right then, but it will not work when the Lord is directing the matter at the final fight. The vindication of Jehovah’s name is at stake, and the Lord Jesus, his Chief Marshal, will not be deceived by any manner of disguise the religionists may wear; not even their overalls, with rough hands, will serve as a disguise. In the present, as in the past, the Lord has maneuvered the forces of the enemy into a position where they shall meet with destruction, and this is made clearly to appear in the prophetic picture here under consideration, and particularly the words: “And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir [religionists], every one helped to destroy another.” It will be like a dog fight, dog eating dog. In the type they went mad, and, blinded by their madness, the men of Ammon and Moab slew one another. That part of the picture foretells what shall take place at Armageddon, and the Devil will be unable to prevent it, even if he tries. Religionists, to which the others have held, being then destroyed, the political and commercial elements, blind and crazy mad, will use their deadly weapons upon each other. This is fully corroborated by other prophecies of Jehovah. The Devil’s spirit will control all of his organization, and when the Devil sees that there is no more show for him to rule, destruction of men is the only thing left for him to bring about; and therefore it may be concluded that he will welcome the destruction of millions of human creatures. The money-changers will turn against those running the governments and will take away all their financial support, while the politicians will attempt to destroy the money of the financiers. Malice and hatred will control both, and they will proceed to destroy each other. This will prove that the Devil can no longer hold his crowd together, no matter how much effort he makes. The Lord will see to it that the Devil’s followers will destroy one another. Says the Lord God Jehovah: “And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen [all who are anti-God and therefore against God’s kingdom] : and I will overthrow the chariots [organizations, political and commercial, labor unions and Communists], and those that ride in them [those who are directing the organization] ; and the horses [equipment for war and other means of cruel ruling] and their riders [those who command] shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.” (Hag. 2:22)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">A like picture concerning the rout of the enemy is recorded at Judges 7: 22.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> All these things Jehovah caused to be recorded in the past, and now he makes known to his covenant people the meaning thereof and why he recorded them, and this he does that the hope of his faithful people may be made strong in this day of great peril. The prophetic picture made with Jehoshaphat and others, here considered, is fully supported by many of the Scriptures written aforetime for our learning, and which show that, while engaged in the “strange work”, which Jehovah is carrying' forward with his people, the anointed and their companions must and will suffer many hardships and persecutions; that while they are undergoing such trying conditions, they must feed their minds upon the record of God’s Word, which he has made for their strength and comfort. That is the reason that the Lord permits the publication of these truths now. No one of the temple anointed company can now stand alone and in his own strength. All of the temple company must stand together in the Lord Jesus Christ, fully supnorting one another. Not even the anointed can understand these things, which are written for their comfort, unless they ‘study to show themselves approved unto God’, that is to say, study his Word and the revelation thereof, which he is now bringing to pass to enlighten and strengthen those that love and serve him. The prophetic picture here recorded concerning the battle, which is God’s, should be of greatest comfort and strength and hope to the people of God in this day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Jehovah answered the prayer of Jehoshaphat as he had spoken to the people through his servant Jaha-ziel, telling them to ‘stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you’. Jehovah fully and completely fulfilled his promise to them. There they stood and saw the enemy slaughtering one another. This part of the prophetic picture tells the anointed people of God, who are now confronted with the combined enemy, that they are not ‘to be afraid, nor dismayed by reason of the multitudinous enemy’ which is filled with the spirit of the Devil and which is pressing in Upon them from every side. Let every one of God’s people keep in mind that the approaching “battle is not yours, but God’s; ye shall not need to fight in [that] battle; set yourselves, . . . and see the salvation of the Lord with you”. These words of Jehovah give full assurance, confidence and courage to everyone of the temple company today and to their companions who remain true and steadfast within the bounds of God’s organization. Shall not all such loudly sing the praises of Jehovah in advance of the victory?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> The battle had ceased, and the Judeans proceeded to ascertain the result, and therefore they marched toward the watch tower in the wilderness, where they could have a better view: “And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none eseaped.”-2 Chron. 20: 24.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Here is further assurance to the anointed that some of them shall be carried through and remain alive on the earth after Armageddon. When that great battle begins, resulting in the slaughtir of the religionists, it will proceed to the complete annihilation of all the Devil’s organization. The Judeans went toward the “watch tower”, doubtless the tower in the wilderness of Jeruel, and there viewed the result of the fight, that is, the result of the “strange act” which Jehovah had brought about for their protection and deliverance and for the vindication of his own great name. Reference to the “watch tower” does not call attention to the Watch Tower Society or to the magazine by that name, but does emphasize the fact that at Armageddon the faithful remaining and their other companions who survive will view the great and marvelous act of Jehovah God performed through Christ Jesus, and that then they shall behold the enemies destroying one another, and being in “the watch tower”, that is to say, in an exalted position in God’s favor and secure from harm, they will observe the Lord’s complete victory to the vindication of his name. It is even true now, however, that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">and kindred publications of the Society, by faith, give Jehovah’s people a view of the oncoming battle and what is certain to be the result thereof.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">” The Judeans had been on the march, singing as. they went, but now they had reached the scene of slaughter, and they remained quiet and beheld the salvation or deliverance God had brought about for them. The fight was over and the destructive work completed. The sound of battle no doubt they had heard, but now it had ceased because the slaughter was complete. It is to be presumed that Jehoshaphat had posted advance watchmen to mark the movement of the enemy, which watchmen would behold the progress of the fight and report the details thereof to their commander, Jehoshaphat. Jehovah had done the fighting or caused it to be done, for the battle is God’s; and in the language of his prophet he invites his people to view the havoc wrought. Mark these prophetic words that apply at Armageddon: “Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and eutteth the spear [of Moab, Ammon and mount Seir] in sunder; he burneth the chariot [the entire organization of Satan, that is, the entire organization condemned by judgments previously written] in the fire.” Therefore Jehovah says to all creation: “Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.” And God’s people respond: “The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.” (Ps. 46:8-11) Thus Jehovah foretells what will be seen by his faithful ones at Armageddon when it is done: “He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.” (Ps. 110:6) Surely then “thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness”. The faithful, viewing the result of this great battle, will with joy shout the praise of Jehovah God and his King. As Jehovah brought about the destruction of that combined enemy host that went against Judah, so he will cause the destruction of Satan’s cohorts at Armageddon, and concerning which he says: “And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.”—Jer. 25: 33.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Speaking through his servant Jahaziel, God had told his covenant people to stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, and now there they stood still at the watch tower and viewing the carnage wrought by the Lord, and which resulted in the deliverance of his people. Jehovah had fought for them, and they were saved. Likewise Jehovah will fight for his people at the battle of Armageddon, and they will be delivered and be entirely safe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The prophecy foregoing is a picture of what shall take place at the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and what a terrific sight that will be to the eyes of the survivors whom God will bring through the terrible conflict, that is, the remnant and the great multitude, among whom will doubtless be some of the faithful prophets who recorded these things. For the enemy there will be no way of escape, even as there was no escape for Moab and Ammon; even as it is written: “There was not an escaping.” (2 Chron. 20:24, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font3"> Corresponding with that prophetic picture, the result at Armageddon is described in these words: “And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock [now composed of yes-men, politicians, and commercial giants, and suchlike] to escape.”—Jer. 25:35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>80</sup> Further describing the progress of the battle of the great day of God Almighty, the Lord says: “And the beast [riderless now because the old whore, the religious crowd, has been dumped off] was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which lie deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the remnant [of men, including Nazis, Fascists, Communists, and other like ones] were slain with the sword of him [Jehovah’s Executor and Vindicator, Christ Jesus] that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth; and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.” (Rev. 19:20,21) Then follows the complete fall of the Devil himself, his organization having perished there, and &quot;fire from the midst of thee”, which &quot;shall devour” the entire organization.—Ezek. 28:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>81</sup> The enemies of Judah were spoilers and had in</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">vaded </span><span class="font3">the promised land to spoil Jehovah’s people, but Jehovah turned the tables on them and took their spoils: “And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance, both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.”—2 Chron. 20:25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> Now Satan and his henchmen are fatally bent on the destruction of the people of Jehovah, but the result will be the destruction of the enemy, and of this let God’s people be now fully assured. This prophetic picture is proof of that. Jehovah further assures and encourages his people by the words of his prophet foretelling what shall befall Satan’s crowd: “Thus saith the Lord God, It shall also come to pass, that at the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think an evil thought; and thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages [not walled cities; Jehovah’s people entirely without human protection, not surrounded by walls] ; I will go to them that are at rest [by reason of their complete faith in God], that dwell safely [in the Lord], all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates [no strong-arm squad or other like protection], to take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the [once] desolate places that are now inhabited [by Jehovah’s people], and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods [kingdom interests], that dwell in the midst of the land. Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil? Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord God, In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth safely, shalt thou not know it? And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army. And it shall come to pass at the same time, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord God, that my fury shall come up in my face.” — Ezek. 38:10-15,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> The Judeans found amongst the dead enemies an “abundance” of “riches”; which foretells how the forces of Satan now on the earth heap up great riches for the last days (Jas. 5:1-3) by robbing the poor and defenseless people in the name of God, carrying on their racket under the name of Christ. This certainly describes the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which possesses great material riches. The Devil’s visible forces become a spoil to Jehovah’s people; that is, what the religionists forfeit God’s people, by being faithful, gain: “The wicked shall be a ransom [price] for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.” (Prov. 21:18) In other words, the wicked religionists, by reason of their wickedness, lose all, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">this results beneficially to the righteous, because, the righteous gain everything at Jehovah’s hands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> Jehovah God, through Christ Jesus, will spoil the visible forces of Satan: “Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey. The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep; and none of the men of might have found their hands. At thy rebuke, 0 God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.”—Ps. 76:4-6; Zech. 2: 8-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> The spoil taken from the enemy by the Judeans greatly enriched them. This does not mean that the faithful remnant and the great multitude will take material wealth that is left behind by Satan’s crowd; but the picture foretells that the triumph of Jehovah God over the enemy and the privilege given to the faithful people of God to see and be identified as having a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and be preserved by his power for his further service to the glory of his name, will be lasting, durable riches to them, that is to say, treasures in heaven that shall never perish. These faithful ones shall have firsthand knowledge that the Almighty is God, whose name alone is Jehbvah, and that constitutes a great spoil, and with which spoil taken from the dead cannot be compared. The spoil taken by the Judeans was “so much” that three days were required to gather it up. All that spoil was left to the people of God, who fought for them and gained the victory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>26</sup> Now Jehovah through Christ Jesus is doing his “strange work” by having the truth told concerning the religionists, who have defamed God’s name and in his name have carried on their rackets. By making known the supremacy of Jehovah God and his work and the olessings of his kingdom, long ago promised, the faithful are laying up treasure for themselves. The great privilege of God’s people now on earth is to have a part in this strange work. (Ps. 68:11,12) It is Jehovah God that has provided, and that gives, the message of truth, and it is not the message of man or any company of men. It is therefore Jehovah God who rises up and does his “strange work”. Jehovah is now at the temple by his representative, Christ Jesus, and now he causes his words of truth, like dew from heaven, to drop down upon his people who are led by Christ Jesus. Therefore says the prophet of God: “The Lord gave the word; great was the company of those that published it. Kings of armies did flee apace; and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.”— Ps. 68:11,12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot; It </span><span class="font3">is a “great” company, a company greatly favored, that is, privileged to publish the message of truth, which God gives, and such have a part in his “strange work”. That work is now in progress, and it frightens the enemy, and the enemies flee and hasten to gather themselves together and prepare for a final assault upon the publishers of God’s message. It is a time of war, and God has commanded all of his faithful ones to rise up against her, the old wench, in war (Obad. 1). They are in the antitypical Jerusalem, on Mount Zion, and beginning to march out against the enemy. The war will reach a climax at the battle of the great day of God Almighty. In that final battle God’s remnant will have no part, and therefore no use for carnal weapons.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> All that have a part in the vindication of his name will share in the spoils. The spoiling of the enemy, and the disgrace to which all such shall be reduced at Armageddon, are pictured by the birds and beasts gorging themselves on the bodies of the slain. (Ezek. 39:17-21; Rev. 19:17-21) Today the wicked representatives of Satan on the earth have seized the entire earth, together with all its riches; and when the enemy is entirely deprived of all such, then the blessings of the earth will be ministered unto those who serve God. Then the “other sheep”, or great multitude, will respond to the invitation of the Lord: “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom [earthly blessings] prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” —Matt. 25: 34.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> That the destruction of Satan’s entire organization will result in great blessings is further pictured in 2 Chronicles 20: 26. After the spoils had been taken by them, the Judeans assembled in the valley of Bera-chah, which means “blessings”, that result in “prosperity”. Doubtless this was the valley or ravine up which the combined enemy were marching to the assault and there God met them. It was, therefore, first the “valley of Jehoshaphat”, meaning “Jehovah-judged”, for there Jehovah adversely judged the enemy; and foreshadowed that immediately preceding the Armageddon battle Jehovah adversely judges the nations composing Satan’s visible organization, and this he does in vindication of himself. Then it is also the “valley of decision” (meaning “concision” or “thrashing”), for there Jehovah, by Christ Jesus, his great militant General, cuts to pieces the enemy forces; and afterwards it becomes the “valley of blessings”. Satan’s visible organization is filled with murderous intent, and now Jehovah is maneuvering their movements as they march against his people and as the nations come into the antitypical “valley of Jehoshaphat”, where he judges them and thrashes them completely. Another description of this is given by the prophet, to wit: “Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather yourselves together round about; thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font3">Lord. Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the heathei. round about. Put ye in the sickle; for the harvest is ripe; come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great. Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision; for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.”—Joel 3:11-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">•° The climax is reached in the great battle of Jehovah : “The Lord also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake; but the Lord will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of Israel.” (Joel 3:16) And then shall follow blessings; which will be the valley of blessings: “So shall ye know that I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain; then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more. And it shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth [out] of the house of the Lord, and shall water the valley of Shittim.”—Joel 3:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> The Judeans assembled in the valley of Berachah; “for there they blessed the Lord,” continuing to give praise to his name. Unquestionably there will be much service of blessing Jehovah’s name after Armageddon is fought, and all the surviving ones, both of the remnant and the faithful men of old, the prophets, and the great multitude, will join therein together. It was so when God had delivered his covenant people at the Red Sea, when they broke out in songs of praise, foretelling again what will come to pass following the deliverance of his people at the battle of the great day of God Almighty. (Ex. 15:1-21) That will be such a marvelous time of blessing and joy that human tongues cannot find or utter words sufficiently to praise Jehovah’s name. They will adore him and his great Vindicator, Christ Jesus. It is then that the will of God will begin to be done on the earth as in heaven. It is reasonable to expect that Jehoshaphat, the one-time king of Judea, will have been awakened out of death by that time and will join the others on that grand occasion of praising Jehovah. Concerning that occasion it is written: “Rejoice over her [the organization of Satan, then completely destroyed; which is pictured by Babylon], thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.”—Rev. 18:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>M</sup>The book of 2 Chronicles is listed as the last of the Hebrew Bible, and the contents indicate that it was written sometime after the Babylonish captivity of the Jews. The words, “unto this day” (verse 26), would mean unto the time of the restored remnant, and hence particularly apply to God’s people now on the earth. Following the battle of the great day of God Almighty the earth will ever thereafter be the antitypical “valley of blessings”, because it is the battlefield where Jehovah vindicates his name upon all his enemies, and those who thereafter and for ever live upon the earth will forever bless the name of the Most High.—Ps. 150:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">*• The Judeans and their companions then left the scene of battle and all returned to Jerusalem. “Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the Lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies.” (2 Chron. 20: 27) Likewise following the battle of Armageddon the survivors will turn from proclaiming the day of the vengeance of our God and will vigorously engage in the constructive service of the Lord. The great King, Christ Jesus, will rule, and he, upon whose shoulder the government rests, is indeed the Prince of Peace, and the time of his peace and prosperity will never end. The faithful remnant, entering fully into the glory of the King, will participate with him in the numberless blessings that will be ministered to others, to the glory of Jehovah God. The Judeans, returning to Jerusalem with joy, were filled with gladness because Jehovah had vindicated his word and his name. It will even be so following Armageddon, when these who survive will return and praise Jehovah, having seen the result at Armageddon: “Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies; and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.” —Ps. 92:11.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>34</sup> The Judeans had marched out to meet the enemy, and they went back singing the praises of Jehovah, and even louder than ever before; and this is indicated by the psalmist (68:25,26). Thus is foretold that the survivors of Armageddon will go unto the temple organization of Jehovah and forever praise his name. “And the Lord shall be king over all the earth; in that day shall there be one Lord, and his name one.”—Zech. 14: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>35</sup> It is the day or time of vindication, and the name of Jehovah shall be for ever exalted and. praised. Then war having ended, strife done, no more shall the name of Jehovah be reproached: “And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation [vindication], and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God; for true and righteous are his judgments; for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.” (Rev. 19:1,2) Manifestly it is at this point that the thousand-year reign of Christ, the Prince of Peace, begins.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>36</sup> The prophetic picture then tells of the course of real wisdom that shall be taken by all who live: “And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets, unto the house of the Lord. And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of Israel.”—2 Chron. 20: 28, 29.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">” For centuries the Devil and his representatives have controlled the earth. After Armageddon they will rule no more, but all the earth will be presided over by Christ Jesus, the Prince of Peace, and his visible rulers will be the faithful men who in centuries past have proved their faith to Jehovah and who shall be resurrected and made princes in all the earth. (Ps. 45:16; Isa. 32:1) Those faithful men feared Jehovah, and thus they were men of wisdom, and they continued to follow that wise course as long as they lived; and all the people of earth who live must likewise fear God and take a similar course. In the prophetic picture here considered the Jonadabs or people of good will have been shown only indirectly or by inference, but at this point they are represented by “all the kingdoms of those countries”, which fear God both before and continuously after Armageddon. The people of good will, or Jonadabs, are shown as coming from all countries. (Rev. 7:9) Only those who fear God and his King, Christ Jesus, will live forever. King David pursued the Philistines and fought them ‘from Gibeon to Gazer’, and it was written of David, who there pictured Christ Jesus the King: “The fame of David went out into all lands; and the Lord brought the fear of him upon all nations.” (1 Chron. 14:16,17) The fear of the Lord Jesus Christ, the King of kings, will come upon all peoples and nations who live, and such then will be taking the course of wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>88</sup> The prophetic picture concludes with these words of beauty and peace: “So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet; for his God gave him rest round about.” (2 Chron. 20:30) The realm of Christ Jesus, the Greater-than-Jehoshaphat, reigning thereafter as the representative and vindicator of Jehovah, will be peace, quietness and joy. Upon the shoulder of the great Prince of Peace will forever rest the government of peace and righteousness, and there shall be no end. Christ Jesus will share his glory and riches with the 144,000 members of his body; concerning which it is written: “Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.” —Rev. 20: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BE VERY COURAGEOUS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>88</sup> The unfolding of the foregoing prophetic picture to the people of God at this time of threatening danger and great peril means much to them. The remnant and their companions should consider it with prayer and joyful thoughtfulness to God and to Christ Jesus. For some time God’s people have been subject to all manner of cruel persecution by the religionists and allies. In more recent months the political and commercial elements have openly joined forces with the clergy in a combined effort to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses and their work. In Germany the persecution of the witnesses of the Lord has been terrible and cruel beyond description, and continues to be so. In the realm of the nations known as the British Commonwealth of Nations, and particularly the outlying provinces thereof, Jehovah’s witnesses are being persecuted and hindered in their opportunities of service, and this is done openly by the political and financial elements. In America the political elements, aided and abetted by the commercial interests, and backed up by the clergy, and further supported by the Communists and all radical elements, join in the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, and these facts cannot be disputed. Why should God permit such assaults upon his people? The prophetic picture here examined gives answer to that question and discloses what will be the final result. Therefore these pictures that are now so forcibly called to the attention of the faithful must be considered in the light of other prophecies, and these should give great courage and hope to those who have covenanted to do the will of Jehovah. Let each and every one bear in mind at all times that all of these prophetic pictures are set forth in the Bible and were written aforetime for the benefit of those now on earth who stand firmly for God and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>40</sup> At the present hour Jehovah’s witnesses visualize the political, commercial, religious, and other radical elements, which compose all of the Devil’s visible organization, actively engaged in carrying out their conspiracy to destroy the servants of Jehovah and their work. We know that both the conspiracy and the overt acts in furtherance thereof are prompted by the Devil himself. The men of politics and of commerce have no grievance against Jehovah’s witnesses, because Jehovah’s witnesses have done them no harm and are not in competition with them; but those elements of Satan’s organization have joined forces with the clergy, because the Devil has put his spirit in their minds to do so. The combined forces of the enemy therefore move upon Jehovah’s witnesses, and Satan has instilled in their minds hatred, ill will and malice, and induced all parts of his organization to believe it to be their duty to destroy anything and everything that supports the kingdom of Almighty God. Because the remnant and their companions are on the side of Jehovah and his King, the enemy marches out to destroy them. Jehovah is looking well to his own and is maneuvering the enemy forces into a position where they may know that it is the power of Jehovah God that brings about their destruction, and at which time he will furnish complete protection for his own people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DEVIL WORSHIP</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>41</sup> In recent months high public officials in the political part of the enemy organization have announced that the people must have more religion in order to bring about a condition desired by them. Commercial men are acquiescing in such declarations, and the clergy with pious face and cruel hearts hold up their filthy hands and sanctimoniously say: “Behold, we are about to bring about a better world.” Now the clergy get behind their allies in politics and appeal to their patriotic sentiments to further religion by carrying out Devil-worship schemes, amongst which are such as saluting flags and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">heilmg</span><span class="font3"> men and giving honor and praise to them. In furtherance of such satanie worship, compulsory flag-saluting is enforced in the public schools and at other places. For more than a century and a half in America the people have sincerely and with true patriotism supported the nation without being compelled to indulge in any particular ceremonies. A sudden change has come about, and those who study God’s Word know that this change is due to the Devil’s seeking the destruction of all who are not on his side. Compulsory flag-saluting will never make better citizens, but will ultimately make them worse and increase their hatred for everything that names the name of God and Christ. At the beginning of the year 1938, in the Congress of the United States, which should be looking after the peace and welfare of the people, there is introduced a bill entitled: “To regulate and codify rules for saluting the flag.” Such bill provides a detailed religious ceremony as to the manner of using, carrying and saluting the flag, and provides that anyone who shall willfully disrespect the flag shall be punished by fine or imprisonment, the amount of the fine and the duration of the imprisonment being left exclusively to the discretion of the judge under whose jurisdiction the case falls. The bill further provides that “during the ceremony of hoisting the flag, or when the flag is passing in a parade, or in review, all persons shall face the flag and stand at attention and salute”. Any failure or refusal to do so would certainly be construed as “a disrespect to the flag” and result in the punishment of one who refuses to salute, which punishment would be according to the whim and amount of prejudice of the judge before whom the offender is brought. Would anyone twenty years ago have believed that such a thing would ever be possible in America?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">° Let every person who believes that the Bible is God’s Word of truth now here carefully read the third chapter of Daniel’s prophecy and compare it with the foregoing flag-saluting ceremony provided in the bill now pending in Congress. Have in mind that in the account given in Daniel’s prophecy every person was required to indulge in certain motions or ceremonies at the sounding of musical instruments and should thus worship an image erected. Three taithful Israelites, who had full faith and confidence in Almighty God, were determined to obey his commandments, as </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">set </span><span class="font3">forth in Exodus 20:1-5. Realizing that the ceremony was a devil-worshiping scheme, they refused to salute and were punished at the whim of the judge before whom they were brought, and their punishment consisted of being bound and forcibly cast into </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">red-hot furnace. Jehovah God brought them out unscathed and unhurt, because of their faith and devotion to him. That record God caused to be made specifically for the benefit and guidance of those who today love and obey him, and for their encouragement in this hour of fanatical flag-saluting and Devil worship God assures his faithful ones that he will </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">give </span><span class="font3">them protection if they remain true to him. AIL true followers of Christ Jesus will obey God, and not man or laws made by fanatical men and which laws reproach the name of Almighty God. The determination of the true followers of Christ Jesus to obey Jehovah will hasten the combined conspirators in committing their further overt acts against Jehovah’s witnesses. Look for and expect a concerted movement on the part of the commercial, political, religious, and other radical elements of the Devil’s organization to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions. When that danger becomes imminent, let all the faithful keep in mind the words spoken from Jehovah: “The battle is not yours, but God’s.” Remember that he preserved his faithful people in times of old who stood for his name and his cause. Be assured that the strength of Almighty God will be manifested in behalf of those who obey him, as it is written: “For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.” (2 Chron. 16:9) All protection and salvation and deliverance of God’s people must come through him, and to his people he says: “The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms; and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.”—Deut. 33: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>43</sup> The revealing of the various prophetic pictures in God’s Word, including those contained in the 20th chapter of 2 Chronicles, is proof that the day of deliverance is near. The combined forces of Satan are launched to the final assault upon the people of God assembled with the Lord Jesus Christ; and the Almighty God, having his people and their salvation fully in mind, says to the faithful ones: “Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.” Jehovah God is backing up his people. Therefore be very courageous and stand firm, and we shall see the salvation and deliverance of the faithful at the hand of the Most High.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">It is desired to keep our records as clear and up to date as possible, but we often encounter several difficulties. Parties living at different places have similar names. One may move to another place and not advise us of the change, and we do not know whether he is one whom we already have on our record or is someone else. Thus we may have John Smiths in various places, whereas several of them may be the same person. To assist in this matter we have arr-nged Question 2, on reverse side of this sheet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some sisters contributed under their maiden name, and after marriage have sometimes used their own given name, as Mrs. Mary Smith, and sometimes given their husband’s name or initials, as Mrs. John Smith. Thus we have learned of some cases where we had the same party under three names. Please see Questions 3,4 and 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One more difficulty: Some of the friends have been the only ones in their families who were interested. If they pass away, their relatives do not always notify us; and the names are retained on the active list for want of definite information. We shall appreciate your assistance in helping us clear these difficulties. See Question C.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark7"></a>LETTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REQUEST FOR ADVICE: AND REPLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am a boy of 18 writing to you for much-needed advice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am the boy that wrote to the Australian branch to see when and where I could join the ship Lightbearer. I was told I could; and it isn’t the fact that I should have to travel half round the world to get there that bothers me: I could manage that; but it’s the fact that I feel obligated to my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">They read your books, have attended a few meetings, but aren’t over active. We all look forward to each issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font2"> My dad is 40 years of age; he was shell-shocked in that cursed war. My mother has leakage of the heart. I have two young brothers: one 13, other 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With the above facts in mind I want you to read my problem. We have just purchased a small farm on the easy payment plan (?). Everything is in a rough state. My dad is approaching the lay-off age. I could help a lot if I stayed home and worked. And if I go to service—? that’s the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now is when I am most needed by them, who have sweated out the best years of their life for me. On the other hand, God is the Giver of life. How can I serve both? If I stay and serve God, which I should do, I should surely cause blame to fall upon them. If I go where I am not known (I can speak my mind better to strangers, anyway), then my folks suffer. For myself it doesn’t matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Please answer as you think best. I seem to know your answer already: “No obligation is stronger than God’s.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am not asking you for a way by which I may worm my way from responsibility, but merely for advice. After I have the advice the rest is up to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">My folks taught me about God in your method; your books were my teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A brother,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Robert Whitney.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">REPLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Answering yours of the first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A covenant to do God’s will takes precedence over all prior agreements, contracts, or obligations. That is to say, the agreement to do God’s will must be performed, and nothing should be permitted to interfere, hinder, or prevent one from fulfilling his covenant to serve Jehovah. This applies to all persons, without regard to sex or family relationship. If, therefore, you have made a covenant to do God’s will and he.opens the way and opportunity for you to serve him, then the performance of any agreement or covenant with or obligation to any creature that interferes with your rendering full service to Jehovah must be ignored. God must be first and without compromise. Jesus laid down the rule explicitly, and the word “hate” used in the following texts means to love less, and concerning this he said: ‘ ‘ If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters [all family relationship, either by affinity or by consanguinity], yea, and*his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.” —Luke 14: 26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The text at Revelation 22: 17 includes both the anointed and the Jonadabs, who have covenanted to do God’s will. Jesus’ commandment is that the anointed must say to those who will hear, “Come”; and to the Jonadabs he says, “Let him that heareth say, Come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The commandments to God’s people in particular are found in Isaiah 51: 16; 43: 10-12; Matthew 24: 14. The responsibility for failure to obey these commandments is stated in Acts 3: 23. One cannot excuse himself from rendering full service to the Lord on the ground that he is obligated to take care of some human creature. We must now be not partially for the kingdom, but wholly for the kingdom. Every conseciated person owes his all to Jehovah and Christ Jesus. His future existence depends on faithful performance of his covenant. To make known the kingdom to others is the direct commandment of the Lord, which obligation he lays upon every one of tho consecrated. The pioneer field is open to you to perforin as commanded. After considering these scriptures you will decide the questions propounded as to you appears to be right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With much love and best wishes, I remain</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">We, the company of God’s people taken out for his n&amp;me, and now located in. the city of Greater London, recognize that God’s government is a pure theocracy and that Christ Jesus is at the temple and in full charge and control of the visible organization of Jehovah, as well as the invisible, and that “The Society” is the visible representative of the Lord on earth, and we therefore request “The Society” to organize this company for service and to appoint the various servants thereof, so that all of us may work together in peace, righteousness, harmony and complete unity. A copy of this resolution is being sent to the Branch office in London together with a lilt of names of persons in this company that to us appear more fully mature and who therefore appear to be best suited to fill the respective positions designated for service.</span></p>

I have often desired to write you concerning the children and their part in the kingdom work, but knowing you are so very busy with the more important things concerning the kingdom I have deferred the same until now. Since the April 15 and May 1 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Towers</span><span class="font2"> came along, showing the parents’ duty toward their children, and that the children too can have a part in the kingdom service, I cannot wait any longer in writing to you expressing my thankfulness to the great Jehovah for this wonderful provision for the children at this time, and to you whom he has chosen to bring these things to our attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Being one who has children and is directly concerned in this matter I have often been considering it in my mind for some time past. The Sunday school part has never worried me, as here in Ireland We have had no such thing for a long time now, so the parents had to teach the children themselves; but I often wondered whether it was all right to take them along in the field service, as we have all been doing that for the past two years; and now it has been revealed to us that we are following the right course. The company here in Belfast have done everything possible in assisting the children to get'into the service and have a part in spreading the good news; but elsewhere there may be critics who think that children are not efficient and do not know enough to carry the message from door to door. So it has pleased our heavenly Father to reveal this information to us at this time, which dispels all doubt and greatly encourages all who have a desire to honor Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As proof that the Sunday school has not had the Lord’s blessing, only a few had any part in the service, out of the many that were instructed in the truth, when the Sunday school was carried on here, the rest having forsaken the Lord and gone out into the world. Trying to ape the Devil’s arrangement gets one nowhere, but rather lands one in the ditch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So let all who have children and desire to see them grow up in the knowledge of Jehovah and his glorious kingdom continue to teach them themselves, and cast away everything that savors of the Devil or his organization, which stinks and is more than putrid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In closing I might say I have had a very enjoyable week-end with the assembly at Belfast arranged for all the brethren and people of good will in Northern Ireland, and served by Brother Schroeder. I have never enjoyed one better, as the bossy spirit seems to have gone completely and the idea is to help one another so that there may be greater activity in the kingdom service. With such a kind, earnest, and zealous branch servant as we have, no doubt the service work in the British field will prosper as never before, because such has been the Lord’s directing in making the change, which is clear to all that can see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren here in Ireland, this priest- and clergy-ridden land, are with you to a man “in fleecing the old whore”, and continue to lift high the banner of Jehovah that those people of good will may see the way to Zion and safety at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May the great Jehovah, our heavenly Father, continue to bless you and use you mightily in the days that are ahead, as in the past, in comforting and encouraging his people and declaring his name in all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours in Jehovah’s service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">R. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dempster, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE LORD IS TEACHING AND LEADING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The May report of the [London] Bethel family study is submitted herewith. There has been an attendance at these meetings of 21, 21, 21, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is a pleasure to report that our studies in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font2">have been followed with the closest attention and, judging by the interest shown, there is no question that the time thus spent together is of the greatest benefit to us all. We have completed our study on the article “Children”, and it has given us a real sense of joy and satisfaction, to see the difficulties and problems, which have previously arisen on this subject, at last cleared up. We say again, as we have said so many times before, that the Lord is giving us continual and abundant evidence that he is teaching, and leading his people, to the ever-increasing praise and honor of Jehovah’s holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours in kingdom joy and service,</span></p>

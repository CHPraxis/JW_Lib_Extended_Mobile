<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 1S37</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH’S WITNESSES are the most favored people that have lived on the earth since the days of the apostles of Christ Jesus. This annual report is submitted that they and their companions, the Jonadabs, may have a vision of the progress of Jehovah’s kingdom in the earth and that, having that vision, the joy of the Lord may give them greater strength in this time of stress. Understanding, within the Scriptural meaning of that word, is, at the present time, of vital importance to them, and for that reason the Lord God says to them now: “With all thy getting get understanding.” Information and knowledge are prerequisites to understanding. It is hoped that the information contained in this report will aid both the anointed remnant and their companions, the Jonadabs, to get a better understanding, which means their increased appreciation of their own proper relationship to the Creator and to Christ Jesus their Redeemer, Lord and King. That understanding dispels selfishness and causes the understanding one to think soberly and not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think. In order that one may think properly he must know that all he is and all that he ever hopes to be is given to him as a gracious gift and provision made for him by the Lord. With such definite conclusion in mind, then, he can worship God in spirit and in</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">truth. It is such earnest and sincere ones that Jehovah seeks and with whom he is well pleased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To God’s people now on earth this is the worst of times and the best of times: worst, because now darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the people, and all the forces of darkness are arrayed in a bitter conflict with light and righteousness. The gross ignorance of the masses of humankind concerning the Word of God is appalling. Only a comparatively few persons have a desire to know the truth and do therefore seek the truth. This condition Jehovah foretold through his prophet Isaiah and at the same time commanded his own people: “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee ” (Isa. 60:1,2) It is the best of times because the children of light are permitted to see and to understand that Jehovah is now revealing to them his purpose to within a short time destroy wickedness and put in fuller operation his kingdom under Christ, which will dispel all darkness and cause the healing beams of light to shine upon all who devote themselves to the Mos't High. The faithful witnesses of Jehovah are therefore children of the light and the children of the day, and are not of the night, nor of darkness. (1 Thess. 5:5) God has therefore put his faithful people in a class alone, separate and distinct from all other creation. He affords these the opportunity to have a part in the vindication of his name, and guarantees to all faithful, obedient ones that they shall have life everlasting and for ever enjoy his blessings. He discloses to them that his time is at hand when Jehovah will cause his name to have the proper place in the mind of every creature that lives. God’s people are now permitted to announce to the world these great truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">John the Baptist was the announcer of Jesus, who came in his Father’s name to do the work assigned to him. John the Baptist foreshadowed Jehovah’s witnesses who are now permitted to announce to the world that the King of glory, Christ the Lord, and mighty Governor, has come and that he will vindicate Jehovah’s name and bring to the people who obey him boundless blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The faithful witnesses of Jehovah are the children of Zion, and of them it is now truly said: “Happy Zion! What a favored lot is thine!” The anointed remnant are the children of Jehovah and his holy organization. All of them are taught by the Lord, and great is their peace and joy. (Isa. 54:13) Jehovah caused his prophet long ago to foretell this day and to put into the mouth of his faithful witnesses these words: “The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.” All who are truly devoted to the Lord today continually give utterance to those words of thankfulness and praise to the Most High. At the same time, because of the cruel persecution heaped upon God’s faithful people by the religious agents of the Devil, many tears of bitterness have been shed and are now shed by the faithful followers of Christ Jesus, while at the same time they greatly rejoice that they are privileged to fill up some of the sufferings of Christ left behind for their benefit. (Col. 1:24) The day of “ingathering” is now here, and the faithful anointed remnant joyfully bear the message of good news to those people on earth who are of good will toward God that those of good will may learn of God’s gracious provision and flee to the place of safety and join in the witness work. Addressing his “faithful servant” class, by and through his prophet the Lord says: “They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.” (Psalm 126:5) All of these faithful ones know that the joy of the Lord is their strength, and in the strength of the Lord they go forward in their work. The faithful children of God now on earth know that the day of the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and the time of their own deliverance, is at hand, and for that reason their </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">joy is</span><span class="font7"> very great. They love to take a retrospective view of the progressive steps leading to the consummation of their hopes.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark2"></a>THE KINGDOM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Only a few persons now on the earth appreciate the importance of the present-day events that are coming to pass, because only they have a vision of the greatest thing that has ever come or ever will come to the earth. The kingdom of Jehovah God, with Christ Jesus as the Head and Chief thereof, is that which is of all importance and the greatest of all things that has come to earth, because it is by and through that kingdom that the name of Jehovah will be fully vindicated, and by and through Christ the King God will administer life everlasting to all who render themselves in full obedience to the law of the Kingdom. The more fully we can now appreciate the Kingdom, the greater will be our zeal for the Lord and the more certain will be our eternal blessings. A consideration of some of the progressive steps toward the development and setting up of the Kingdom will be helpful just now to those who are striving to maintain their integrity toward God. All religionists, and many of those who think of themselves as walking in the narrow way and who are selfish, have considered and do now regard their own individual salvation as the most important thing. Salvation of men is only of secondary consideration. It is the vindication of Jehovah’s name by and through his kingdom that is of paramount importance. Therefore the Kingdom, that is, God’s government of righteousness, is of the greatest importance, and it is only those who see and appreciate this fact that now enjoy peace of mind and joy of heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shortly following the expulsion from Eden there was born to Adam and his wife their son Abel. His occupation was and is a criterion by which the faithful children of God may be identified. Abel was a shepherd boy, attending to and feeding the sheep. Those who are fed and who in turn minister unto others are designated by the Lord under the symbol of sheep. Throughout the Scriptures the obedient ones are called sheep. It is the sheep flock of the, Lord that are taken into the Kingdom and receive the blessings thereof. Out under the stars, guarding the flocks while they rested, the mind and heart of that shepherd boy Abel was turned to the Almighty God. He had faith in God. Steadfastly resisting the assaults of the Devil, Abel remained true and faithful and worshiped the Almighty God in spirit and in truth. That shepherd boy was the first one of a small company of faithful witnesses of Jehovah, who centered their hopes in God’s kingdom, and, resisting the enemy and remaining true to Jehovah, those faithful men sealed their testimony with their own blood. Abel was the first -martyr to the cause of righteousness. Since the time of Abel to now every one who has faithfully obeyed Jehovah has been the object of the wicked assault by Satan the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Applying his deceptive and wicked methods in his effort to make good his challenge, the Devil has turned away from God the great majority of humankind; but from Abel unto this very day there have been, and are, a small minority of human creatures that have remained true and steadfast to the Most High, having their heart set upon and their hopes centered in the kingdom of God. Let the Kingdom now be magnified in the heart of every one who loves righteousness. Referring again to that little company of faithful men from Abel to John the announcer of Jesus: God revealed to them his purpose to set up a government that would rule all the world in righteousness and minister boundless blessings to all men who put themselves under and who continue obedient to the laws of that government. By faith those men of old visualized the Kingdom, and with great yearning they desired it. Separating themselves entirely from those men who yielded to Satan’s blandishments, that little company of faithful men were blind to everything save the righteous government of the Most High. Their faith and devotion to God is set before all who follow after as a true and correct example. Concerning those faithful servants of the Most High, God caused to be written in his Word the following: “These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned: but now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.”—Heb. 11:13-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those faithful men left “the world”, or Devil’s organization, and, says the Scripture, had they desired they could have returned; but their real desire was a better government, a government controlled from heaven by Christ Jesus under Jehovah God, and because of their unswerving devotion to God and his kingdom Jehovah God is not ashamed to be called their God, and they were Jehovah’s witnesses. He has prepared a place for them in that righteous government, and by his grace they shall soon receive it and occupy that condition of blessedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every one of the faithful men there named, the Devil sought to destroy. Such cruel assaults, however, did not shake their faith in God or deter them from performing their duty. The cruel trials to which they were subjected, and the great persecution heaped upon them, and their faithful devotion to Jehovah under such adverse conditions, serve to comfort and encourage the witnesses of Jehovah who today are striving to maintain their integrity toward the Most High. Those faithful men of old had opportunity to accept temporary deliverance by becoming unfaithful to God, but such deliverance they refused. They chose to suffer affliction for righteousness rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. They were determined that nothing should separate them from the love of God and their hope and prospects of the glorious government that should some day rule the world. Therefore of them it is written: “And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment: they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.” — Heb. 11:36-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The faithful remnant on the earth today, because of their faithfulness in giving the testimony of Jesus Christ concerning God and his kingdom, are likewise ill-treated and abused, persecuted and imprisoned, and, while undergoing such cruelty, they rejoice to call to </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font7">d the experiences of the faithful men of old, and thus they are encouraged to press on with their work, singing the praises of the Most High as they go. God has provided for the faithful remnant better things than will be enjoyed by Abel and his companions mentioned in the Scriptures, and that “better thing” includes the great privilege of being now on the earth at the coming of the Lord Jesus, the King, and of being his servants and announcing the King and his kingdom, and the prospect of being a part of the royal house. Faithfully performing their present-day duties, the remnant will participate in the first resurrection, to be for ever associated with the King. Seeing the glorious prospects set before them, the present-day witnesses of Jehovah give heed to this admonition: “Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us. ’ ’—Heb. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Having full faith in God and in his kingdom and appreciating their privilege of serving the King, the vision of the remnant enlarges and they cast away every weight that retards their service to the King, refusing to permit any earthly thing or relationship to hinder them in their onward march to the Kingdom. The Lord has invited them to enter into his joy of vindicating his Father’s name, and the faithful ones put themselves wholly on the side of the King and are blind to everything else. Only the Kingdom is worth while, and only Jehovah and his King will they serve. They lay aside every weight, and they spurn religion, which has been the besetting sin of all who have started to follow Christ Jesus. These witnesses of Jehovah are truly Christians, because they are walking in the way that the Lord God has marked out for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the faithful prophets of old endured all manner of opposition and persecution and still continued joyfully and steadfastly to maintain their integrity toward God, with stronger reasoning should the remnant now endure all manner of persecution and in spite thereof remain true and steadfast to the King and his kingdom. To them more has been committed than was committed to the prophets, and of them the Lord now demands much more. Their enlarged vision increases their responsibility. God’s provision for the remnant is better than that for the prophets, but each one has his own part to perform, and each one who remains faithful to the end shall in due time fill his place to perfection and to the glory of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For 4,000 years following the rebellion in Eden the Devil pursued his wicked course of turning men and angels away from God and heaping great hardship upon every man who served God. Then came to the earth Jehovah’s beloved Son, the Savior of men, and the Vindicator of God’s name. Recognizing Jesus as the heir-apparent to the throne of Jehovah’s righteous government, Satan employed every possible means to bring about the destruction of Jesus. The great temptation placed before Jesus in the mountain had ended with victory for him, because he had successfully rejected every attempt of Satan to turn him away from the path of righteousness. Then Jesus immediately began his earthly ministry: “From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say: Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (Matt. 4:17) Thus it is seen that he placed the kingdom of Jehovah above everything else. He drew to himself plain and honest men who also had a desire for that better government. Recognizing Jesus as the one sent of God to rule, those faithful disciples thereafter joined Jesus in proclaiming to the people the truth of and concerning God’s government. During the entire three and one-half years of his earthly ministry Jesus stressed the paramount importance of the Kingdom. Because he did so, Jesus drew upon himself the hatred and the murderous assaults made by religionists, the agents of Satan. That persecution against Jesus was carried on constantly, because Satan well knew (and yet knows) that the kingdom of God under Christ will completely vindicate Jehovah’s name and prove Satan a liar and will open for men the way to life. There is nothing that can be compared with the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His earthly ministry was drawing to a close, and Jesus gathered his disciples about him and instructed them and told them that he must go away to receive the kingdom and that in due time he would return and set up that righteous government. When Jesus was arrested and brought before the Roman ruler for sentence, the one thing that he emphasized was the kingdom of God. Responding to the question put to him by Pilate, Jesus replied: “I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.” (John 18:37) These words plainly show that every person who really loves and serves the truth will follow the lead of Jesus by putting the Kingdom forward as of the greatest value and importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God permitted Satan and his religious agents to put Jesus to death in the most ignominious manner, and then Jehovah showed his supreme power by raising Jesus out of death, exalting him to the highest place in his great organization, and bestowing upon him a “name which is above every name”, and commanded that every living creature shall confess that Jesus is the Christ and King to the glory and vindication of Jehovah’s name. Directing the attention of the people to his beloved Son, Christ Jesus the King, Jehovah says: ‘He shall show to the nations righteousness, and in his name shall the nations hope.’ Thus Jehovah makes known that the government under Christ is the one and only hope of the peoples of earth. Everyone today who worships God in spirit and in truth now recognizes that the kingdom of God under Christ cannot be compared with anything else, but that it stands at the head of all things of importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Following the resurrection of Jesus, and during the entire period of their faithful journey in the earth, with great emphasis the apostles held before the people the overshadowing importance of the Kingdom, which Christ Jesus will establish at his second coming. They were fully aware of the prophecy regarding that kingdom, which prophecy says: ‘Upon the shoulder of Christ Jesus shall rest that righteous government, which will bring the desire of every honest creature, and which will completely vindicate Jehovah’s name.’ Those faithful apostles never at any time attempted to draw attention to themselves or to seek the praise of men, but, putting self entirely in the rear, they were blind to everything save the kingdom of God under Christ. They urged the followers of Christ Jesus to keep in mind his second coming and his kingdom and frequently reminded them that all faithful ones would suffer persecution at the hands of religionists, the agents of the Devil; and they admonished such followers to endure persecution and affliction and to remain true and steadfast to the King and Kingdom to the very end. Those faithful apostles refused to compromise with and bow down to the elements of creation that dishonored God’s name and ruled the earth as the representatives of Satan. Like the faithful prophets who had preceded them, the apostles of Jesus set their affections and their hopes wholly on the government of Christ Jesus and devoted their lives exclusively to making known the name of the King and the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Within a brief space of time the apostles died, and then the Devil saw that it was his opportunity to seduce and to debauch the professed followers of Christ Jesus, and, to accomplish his wicked purpose, Satan influenced selfish men to organize religion and, for the purpose of deceiving the people, caused that organized thing to be designated as &quot;the Christian religion”. From that time forward the religious leaders taught and constantly held before men the false doctrines that the chief purpose of God and of Christ is to save men from &quot;purgatory” and &quot;hell” and to get the saved ones into heaven. By reason thereof the people have been turned to selfishness and have been kept in complete ignorance of the kingdom of God under Christ. Religion and religious leaders, therefore, are the things on earth most responsible for the gross darkness that now covers the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That religious organization misnamed &quot;the Christian religion” in time evolved the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization or system, which is a devilish, political organization using the name of Christ as a blind behind which that wicked organization, entrenched in a mass of lies, has hidden itself. They continue to practice fraud, and carry on a racket by which the people have been, and are deceived and robbed and the name of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus grossly reproached. Honest men, seeing the wickedness of the Roman Catholic organization, in time organized what is called &quot;Protestantism” and called it the &quot;Protestant Christian religion”, and those men made some attempt to teach the Scriptures; but their doctrines have always stressed individual salvation of men from &quot;hell”, and they entirely ignored and obscured from the view of the people Jehovah’s great government under Christ Jesus, which is the only hope of mankind. Religion was thereafter the means by which the people were and have been led into and held in gross ignorance. Religion has been a great curse upon mankind and is the -close-besetting sin of those who have attempted to follow Christ Jesus and of which the apostle gives warning. After years the net result is that all religion, so-called &quot;Catholic”, &quot;Protestant,” and all others, are at unity in the work in behalf of the Devil and against God and his kingdom under Christ. Darkness, therefore, has settled down upon the world, and gross darkness enshrouds the people, blinding them to the only government that can ever bring relief and blessings to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">About the year 1875 a few sincere men who served God began to gain some knowledge of the second coming of Christ and his kingdom, and those men began to preach the truth as they learned it. They were in the midst of religionists, however, and they held on to many things pertaining to religion, and hence they came out of Babylon wearing ‘soiled garments’. Many of them continued faithful unto the coming of the Lord. It was in the year 1914 that Jehovah set his beloved Son, his King, upon the throne and directed him to begin his reign and the exercise of his power. It was three and one-half years thereafter, to wit, 1918, that Christ Jesus appeared at the temple of Jehovah and assembled before him for judgment all those who then were in a covenant to do the will of God. Jehovah, by his prophet, had foretold the coming of his Servant, the King, in these words: “Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts.” (Mal. 3:1) Thus Jehovah fixed the time with certainty as to the coining of his Servant, Judge and King. First he declared that his Messenger, Christ Jesus, would do a preparatory work, and, that finished, he would then straightway come to his temple, which temple is made up of those persons wholly devoted to Jehovah. (1 Cor. 3:16; 2 Cor. 6:16) The purpose of the coming of Christ Jesus, the Messenger and Servant of Jehovah, to the temple is first to apply the test and to render judgment concerning those who had professed or made a covenant to do the will of God; and this is made certain by the words of Jehovah, to wit: “But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap; and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.” (Mal. 3: 2, 3) The approved ones now offer unto the Lord an acceptable offering, and that offering is full and complete devotion and service unto God by performing their duties in obedience to his commandments, acting as witnesses for Jehovah.-Heb. 13:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was in 1918 that the Lord Jesus came to the temple of God and there began his judgment. All the physical facts agree with the Scriptures fixing that time. There the judgment of the Lord made manifest those who were and are unreservedly devoted to Jehovah God and his kingdom. That test being applied, many were unable to withstand the test, and they fell away and went back to the world over which Satan is the god and invisible ruler, while the faithful stood firm and true to Jehovah. Those who were then faithful and continued to be entirely devoted to Jehovah God received the approval of Christ, the great Judge, and thereafter they offered unto Jehovah a pleasing and acceptable sacrifice: “Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years. ” (Mal. 3:4) “Judah,” as used in this text, means those who are devoted to the praise and service of Jehovah God, and “Jerusalem” symbolically stands for or represents God’s organization or temple company.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>“HIS GOODS”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Christ Jesus having received full power and authority particularly with reference to the Kingdom and the things of interest concerning the same, he designates all such interests of the Kingdom as “his goods” or “possessions”. Those persons who at the temple judgment received the approval of the Lord became the bondservants of the Lord and are entirely committed to the doing of his will. Such persons collectively constitute that body whom the Lord designates as his “faithful and wise servant”. These are called “faithful” because of their devotion to the Lord and being dependable; “wise” because they are diligent to obey the will of the Lord, always following his instructions. At the temple judgment the Lord commits to his “faithful and wise servant” all his “goods”, that is to say, all his earthly Kingdom interests, which interests they must carefully safeguard, look after, protect and serve. Concerning these things Jesus says: “Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when he eometh, shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods. ’ ’—Matt. 24:45-47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That company of persons is joined by others who from and after 1918 consecrated themselves and are fully devoted to doing the will of God and who prove their loyalty and faithfulness and whom he begets and makes a part of the temple company. This latter company also becomes a part of the “faithful servant”. The temple company or servant class is commissioned to serve Jehovah and his King, and the duty and obligation of such is to show forth the praises of the Most High. “In his temple doth every one speak of his glory.” (Ps. 29:9) Such are a chosen race of people, that is, a people for God’s purpose. (1 Pet. 2:9,10) All the Lord’s earthly Kingdom interests being committed to their keeping, they must fully and completely perform their assigned duties and obligations, as Jesus has said: ‘Of him to whom much is committed, much more is demanded. ’—Luke 12:48, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>HIS NAME</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The challenge flung into the face of Jehovah by Satan involves the great and holy name of the Most High. Instead of destroying Satan at the time the challenge was made, God said to Satan: “But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” (Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser) </span><span class="font7">It is therefore plainly stated that Jehovah God will have his name declared in all the earth immediately preceding the exhibition of his supreme power in the destruction of Satan. The “faithful and wise servant” constitutes a people for the name of Jehovah; as it is written: &quot;God . . . did visit the [nations], to take out of them a people for his name.” (Acts 15:14) Such are the ones whom the Lord has commissioned to represent him and to bear witness of his name and his kingdom, and which witness must be given immediately preceding the battle of the great day of God Almighty, in which Satan shall be completely shorn of all his power. This &quot;faithful and wise servant” is made up of a class of men and women who are therefore entirely separate from the world or governments amongst men, and whose time, energy, money, everything, must be and are wholly devoted to God and his kingdom under Christ. They have absolutely nothing to do with and no interest in the political affairs of this world. They are for the righteous government of Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was after 1918 that the Lord revealed to his people an understanding of his Word concerning them and their duty and obligation to him and to his King. To that class of faithful persons Jehovah says: &quot;Thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall name.” (Isa. 62:2, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font7"> The Lord makes known to them that they must bear the new name which he gives them, and which new name is &quot;Jehovah’s witnesses”; as it is written: “Ye are my witnesses, saith [Jehovah], and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he; before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am the Lokd, and beside me there is no saviour. I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there was no strange god among you; therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.” —Isa. 43:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the approved temple company of the Lord that constitutes his witnesses selected and sent forth for a specific purpose. Such are anointed or commissioned to do a specific work, and their commission is stated in these words: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn. ’ ’—Isa. 61:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such commission lays upon them an obligation that they are compelled to faithfully perform. Christ Jesus is the Head and Chief One of the temple and is “the faithful and true Witness” of Jehovah, and every one who is of the temple must be a witness to the name of Jehovah. (John 18:37) Every one of the temple company, therefore, is properly designated “Jehovah’s witness”, because they are wholly for Jehovah and his government of righteousness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>HIGHER POWERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The faithful servant must likewise be obedient to his Master, and he is the servant of him whom he does obey. (Rom. 6:16) Peoples of the earth are organized into nations, and the visible rulers of such nations are a few men who occupy and fill public offices and who together with their associates control the people of the nations. The invisible ruler or god of such nations is Satan the Devil. (2 Cor. 4: 4; John 12:31; 14:30) Under the wily and seductive influence of tie Devil religious and political rulers of the world have seized upon a scripture concerning “the higher powers” and wrongfully applied it, and have assumed and have taught the people that these earthly politicians who fill the offices constitute the “higher powers”. This is not only wholly false, but a defamation of God’s name. Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are “the higher powers”, particularly to those who have covenanted to do God’s will. (Rom. 13:1) AR such covenant people must obey God rather than man. (Aets 5: 29) It follows, therefore, that Jehovah’s witnesses must be obedient to the Lord and his commandments and that no man or earthly government can rightfully grant a permit to preach or can properly interfere with Jehovah’s witnesses in giving testimony and doing what the Almighty God has commanded that they shall do. When governments of earth attempt to override God’s commandments, they are presumptuous and grossly wicked. Those who have made a covenant to do the will of God are under the immediate command of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is Jehovah’s great Prophet, Priest and King; and concerning them it is written: “And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people. ’ ’—Acts 3: 23.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>THE MOST HIGH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The full and complete allegiance of Jehovah’s witnesses and all his people is to the Almighty God, the Most High. His witnesses must do right toward all persons, but they must always obey God’s law; and when the law of some earthly government is contrary to the law of God, the consecrated children of God have no choice or alternative. They must obey the commandments of the Lord God and his King. A failure or refusal to do so means their destruction. Every proper law of earthly governments that is in harmony with God’s law true Christians will obey and gladly obey, but any law of any earthly government that contravenes or is directly opposed to God’s law is wrong, and God’s children will obey His law, and not that of man. An example of this: Jehovah God commands that all creation shall obey and worship him and shall not bow down to or attribute salvation to any creature or thing, because Jehovah God is the source of life and protection and blessings for all creatures. It is the Devil that induces men to violate God’s commandment, and he does so to sustain his wicked challenge and to thereby bring about the destruction of men. For the protection and salvation of obedient men God commands: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.” (Ex. 20: 3-5) Contrary to this unchangeable command of God, worldly governments enact laws compelling men to salute flags and to pay homage to men, thereby attributing protection and salvation to earthly things. It is the privilege of every person who desires to do so to conform himself to such unrighteous laws, but one who is in a covenant with God to do his will must obey God’s law; and to salute any flag or to hail any man or any creature and thereby attribute to such protection and salvation is to compromise with the Devil contrary to God’s law, to reproach the name of the Most High, and thereby to bring upon such person complete destruction. For this reason all true and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are designated in the Scriptures as strangers and pilgrims in the earth, looking for and awaiting the complete establishment of God’s righteous government that shall rule the world in perfection. There could be but one purpose in attempting to compel Christians to salute flags, and hail and bow down to men, and that one purpose of Satan is to cause such Christians to violate God’s commandment and bring upon them destruction; and this would be carrying out his side of the controversy and therefore would be a further reproach of God’s name. This matter is here stressed in order that it may be seen that true Christians cannot and will not obey any law of any men that openly repudiates and violates the law of the Most High, Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Furthermore, all persons who worship God in spirit and in truth delight to do his will; they love God and his law, and therefore delight to conform themselves to his law. The Christian does not seek the approval of men, but desires the approval of God. Knowing that every good thing proceeds from Jehovah God, the child of the Lord has no desire to act contrary to God’s law, but always to be obedient thereto. In so doing he can never go wrong; and hence to refuse to salute flags or bow down to images or men could never work injury to anyone. For more than 150 years the American government has recognized the inalienable right of men to worship God as their own conscience directs; but now, in these latter days, when the Devil knows his time is short, he induces the religionists, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, to attempt to compel the doing of deeds or things that will result in the destruction of true and faithful followers of Christ Jesus. The saluting of flags and bowing down to men never made any person honest, law-abiding, ■ faithful and righteous. For any Christian to indulge in such practice, because contrary to God’s Word, renders him wholly unrighteous. Therefore Jehovah’s witnesses say to the nations of the earth and to its rulers: “Take whatever course men desire; we will serve God, and to him only will we bow down and worship.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For more than six thousand years men who believed, obeyed and served God have with eagerness hoped for, looked for, and prayed for the coming of God’s government of righteousness. The prayer which Jesus taught his followers to pray is this: ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.’ In this present time that prophetic prayer is being answered, because Christ Jesus has come, God has enthroned him as King, and his reign has begun. The true child of God therefore recognizes the kingdom of God under Christ as the greatest thing that has ever come to pass or ever will come to pass, and for that reason he is determined to give his entire devotion to God and his righteous government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses forming a part of the temple are instructed by the Lord and are sent forth to do his service. To them Jesus Christ commits his testimony, and they must obey his commandments. Jesus does not command them to go about and make an effort to convert the world, as religionists claim that they are doing. Their work is to </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">ann</span><span class="font7">ounce the kingdom of God. Now the Lord has brought about the physical facts in fulfillment of his prophecy, showing that the King and Kingdom are here and all persons who would live must give heed to the King and obey his laws. It is that kingdom that brings about peace, prosperity, life and happiness to obedient men, and it will solve all the problems that perplex men, and, above all, the Kingdom will vindicate the name of Jehovah God. These great truths constitute good news to honest and God-fearing men. “Good news’’ means the gospel of the Kingdom. Because of the paramount importance of the Kingdom, Jesus gives positive commandment to all Christians, which commandment they must now obey, and which commandment is in these words: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.’’ (Matt. 24:14) That message of good news must be declared to the people by God’s witnesses and must be done and completed immediately preceding the destruction of Satan’s rule and power; and when the work of giving testimony is done, then will immediately follow the battle of the great day of God Almighty, which is Armageddon, and which will completely wreck every part of Satan’s organization. Again the Kingdom of the Lord God under Christ Jesus is emphasized as that which is of greatest importance to all creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be sure, Satan is violently opposed to the kingdom of God because the full operation of that kingdom means the finish of Satan and his power. Satan therefore assaults Jehovah’s witnesses and attempts to destroy them. In every part of the earth the events that are daily coming to pass show that Satan is doing his very best to destroy those who announce the Kingdom. In this wicked assault made by Satan he uses religion and religious organizations, led by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and that explains why the Catholic Hierarchy in every part of the earth violently and wickedly oppose the proclamation of Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ. Looking to thi$ very time, the Lord Jesus speaks of the Devil, that old Dragon, and his instruments operating against Jehovah’s witnesses, in these words: “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.”—Rev. 12:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Everyone therefore who is true and loyal to Jehovah God and his kingdom, and who faithfully obeys the commandments of the Lord, is the object of Satan’s assault. Jesus informed the apostle of what would come to pass in these latter days, and therefore Paul, under inspiration, wrote: ‘Through much tribulation shall ye enter the kingdom.’ Jehovah’s witnesses know that they must expect persecution from religionists, because religionists are Satan’s tools or agents. Tribulation or persecution, therefore, does not at all deter them from doing their work, but, as the apostle declares, they rejoice in tribulation, such being evidence that they have God’s favor and his approval.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>CONTROVERSIAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Satan attempts to lull to complete silence everything that would expose him and his wicked operations. For that reason the religionists, Catholics, Protestants, Jews and others, all agree to say nothing that might provoke a controversy. They have induced the public press and the radio to refuse the publication of any truth concerning God’s kingdom, on the ground that it is controversial. They invoke every unrighteous rule against Jehovah’s witnesses in their desperate attempt to keep the people in ignorance of everything pertaining to the kingdom of God, and this they do for the reason that they know the truth when told exposes the duplicity and crookedness of Satan and his religious agents. Upon the false pretext of having peace those religionists insist that Jehovah’s witnesses shall not be permitted to inform the people of God’s kingdom, declaring that the Kingdom message is subversive and seditious; the very thing that religionists charged against Jesus when he was on the earth. The earthly ruling powers make laws which declare that the testimony given by Jehovah’s witnesses concerning God and his kingdom is seditious and liable to cause a breach of the peace and therefore should be suppressed. All these things constitute corroborative evidence that the kingdom of the Lord is here and that the great issue is about to be finally and completely settled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">False doctrines are likewise in direct opposition to God’s truth. Therefore the proclamation of the truth is always controversial, for the reason that it exposes the lies of Satan’s agents. By reason of the great number of lies religionists tell the people, the masses are kept blind to the truth. Now the Lord sends forth his witnesses to declare the truth, and that truth when declared provokes a great storm of protest by the religionists for the very purpose of beclouding the issue. It is the kingdom of God and the proclamation of his truth in conflict with Satan’s wicked organization that provokes controversy. The proclamation of his truth must continue, however, and will continue until God’s due time to destroy Satan’s organization. Those who appreciate the great importance of God’s kingdom under Christ, and those only, will engage in making proclamation of the Kingdom message. Everyone who is informed of and concerning the Kingdom and who then fails or refuses to have a part in delivering the testimony of the Kingdom as commanded, thereby shows himself to be against God’s kingdom, because Jesus says: “He that is not with me is against me.” Only those who take a positive stand on the side of God and his kingdom from this day forth will ever have a part in the blessings which God bestows upon his creatures. How many persons really appreciate what the Kingdom means? Apparently not many; but those who do appreciate the meaning thereof are fully determined to serve the King and his kingdom by joyfully obeying his commandment, and are also fully determined that they will permit nothing whatsoever to interrupt their faithful service to the </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font7">g,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>WITNESS WORK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The foregoing are some of the reasons why Jehovah’s witnesses joyfully engage in the Kingdom service, and that amidst the most cruel and brutal opposition that has ever been practiced against true Christians. If the Kingdom was important in the day of Abel and the prophets that followed, all of whom looked forward with great anxiety and joy to its coming, now, when the King has come and has begun his reign, that kingdom is of far greater importance to those who have made a covenant to do the will of God. Jehovah’s witnesses in these days see the fulfillment of the prophecies, and they know that the day of deliverance is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The most important work of Christians is to announce the King and his kingdom, which righteous government rests upon the shoulder of Christ Jesus, because that government will vindicate Jehovah’s name. The secondary purpose of declaring the message is that all classes of persons may be warned of the impending disaster about to fall upon the world that is ruled by Satan, and that the only possible way of escape from such disaster is to flee to God’s kingdom and there find refuge and safety. By this means the Lord informs the people of good will toward him as to the means of protection and safety. Such persons of good will he declares are his “other sheep”, which “other sheep” he now gathers unto himself and who shall in due time become a part of God’s fold. Those people of good will are otherwise designated in the Scriptures as ‘ Jonadabs’, or those who will form the “great multitude”. (Rev. 7:9) The hope of such is not heavenly, but their hope is in the heavenly kingdom, that kingdom being ruled by the heavenly One, Christ Jesus. That kingdom through Christ will administer to the great multitude life everlasting on the earth. Such persons are now hearing the Kingdom message, and hearing it they joyfully &quot;flee to the mountains ’, that is to say, to God and to Christ. They take their stand firmly and openly on the side of God and his King, put themselves under God’s organization, and joyfully participate in delivering the Kingdom message. Therefore the Jonadabs have a part in the witness work, and with great zeal do they participate in that work, and so full is their devotion that the Scriptures describe them in these words, to wit: “After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; and he, that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.”—Rev. 7: 9,10,15-17.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>COMPANIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord in his Word designates the anointed remnant and the great multitude as “companions”, because both companies are devoted to Jehovah and his King and therefore are entirely separate and distinct from the world ruled by Satan. The citizenship of the remnant is in heaven, while the everlasting abiding place of the great multitude will be on the earth. Both companies are and will be for ever wholly for the Lord. They praise Jehovah and worship him in spirit and in truth. The anointed remnant is charged with the responsibility of carrying the message of the Kingdom to the people, and the great multitude or Jona-dabs are their helpers and join with the remnant in advertising the King and the Kingdom. Both companies must at all times prove faithful to Jehovah and his kingdom if they would receive God’s ultimate approval. The Devil and his representatives, both invisible and visible, are bitter enemies of all who are on the side of God and his kingdom. Such is the reason for the persecution that is constantly heaped upon God’s people now on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the proper understanding God’s people have during the fiscal year of 1937 put forth their efforts in obedience to God’s commandment to advertise his kingdom. To them Jehovah has given this commandment: “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.”—Isa. 62:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In obedience to that commandment their faces are turned toward the Kingdom, and their efforts are employed to make known the King and the Kingdom. It is now God’s time for the witness work to be done, and his people delight to have a part in such work. Looking to this very day, Jehovah caused his prophet to write: “Behold, the Lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him. And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the Lord; and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.”—Isa. 62:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The word “city”, used in this text, is God’s temple organization, of which Christ Jesus is the Head, and which is not an organization forsaken, but which is held as dear to God as the apple of his eye. The faithful delight to serve him, and for that reason they have been doing it during the fiscal year just closed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>CORPORATIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Scriptures abundantly support the conclusion that Jehovah God has an organization and that he does everything orderly. His work on the earth is carried on in an orderly manner, and the earthly part of his organization represents his interests and that of his kingdom and is made up of all persons who are at full unity in Christ Jesus and who are for his kingdom. That organization on earth is designated under the term “the Society”, meaning the society or people engaged in his service. To comply with the proper laws of the land “the Society” formed corporations, which corporate bodies hold title to property and legally carry forward the work and affairs of the Society. The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is the parent corporation of said Society and is organized under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania. The Peoples Pulpit Association is an associated corporation of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and is organized under the membership corporation law of the State of New York. The International Bible Students Association is also an associated corporation of the first one named and is organized under the laws of Great Britain and also of Canada. Such corporations hold title to the property of and carry forward the work of the Lord’s people otherwise designated “the Society”. Such corporations are not religious, or religious organizations, but are Christian organizations, and are charitable and benevolent corporations. Because men have not recognized the clear distinction between religion and Christianity, the lawmakers of the land put religious, Christian, charitable and benevolent organizations all in the same class. From the legal viewpoint, therefore, they are the same and entitled to the same privileges. Organized under the laws of the land the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, the Peoples Pulpit Association, and the International Bible Students Association are entitled to all the privileges granted by the laws under which they are organized. The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and its kindred corporations above named are charitable and benevolent corporations. They are charitable organizations because such organizations are properly defined as “exhibiting Christian love”, that is to say, the love of Christ, which love is entirely for God and his kingdom and for humankind. A benevolent corporation is properly defined as one “having the disposition to do good; possessing and manifesting love for mankind and a desire to promote men’s prosperity and happiness”. The aforementioned corporations, to wit, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Peoples Pulpit Association, and International Bible Students Association, come clearly within the proper meaning and purview of the law and are therefore fully entitled to the benefits of the law which provides that all such corporations are exempt from taxation. Such corporations are not employed or used for the selfish interest or benefit of any individual, but are wholly devoted to the work of doing good to men in general by informing them and teaching them of God’s gracious provision to give life, prosperity and complete happiness to the human race. All the money, property and assets had and held by such corporations above named are devoted exclusively to the work of the Lord in doing good to men. Those corporations are instruments of God’s people, used exclusively and unselfishly for the benefit of mankind and to the glory of God. They are not used for pecuniary profit. Small contributions are received for some portions of the literature printed and distributed by the Society or'corporations above named, while a great amount of such literature and books is given freely to the poor. Employment, food and raiment are freely furnished to many persons, and therefore the corporations named are strictly and wholly within the purview of the law regarding charitable and benevolent societies. Such corporations are therefore entitled to tax exemption upon property held for corporate purposes, although the opponents of the Lord’s work have attempted, and still attempt, to treat such corporations as organizations for pecuniary profit. The correct theory and purpose of the law of the land is that such corporations should not be taxed on their property used for the work, such as is carried on by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, the Peoples Pulpit Association, and the International Bible Students Association. For that reason these corporations make application to have the benefit of such tax exemption laws. The facts are that the foregoing corporations are probably the only ones doing a work in the name of God and Christ Jesus that devote all of their assets and contributions to a charitable and benevolent work. The Society by its corporations has extended its charitable and benevolent work to all parts of the earth, and the people have freely contributed their money to carry on such work and continue to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Opponents of God’s kingdom wrongfully attempt to show that the aforementioned corporations and the Society are devoted to work against earthly governments. This claim is entirely wrong. The Society and the afore-mentioned corporations are devoted wholly to God’s kingdom under Christ, which is the only hope for the people and which holds out unlimited benefits for humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few persons on the earth are the devoted followers of Christ Jesus the King and are therefore Christians. They have their eyes fixed upon the Kingdom, and all their hopes and joys are centered there. Like Abel and the other faithful servants of Jehovah who followed after him to the coming of Jesus, all Christians ‘desire a heavenly government’, that is, a government ruled by the King of righteousness, Christ Jesus. (Heb. 11:16) All persons of good will likewise desire that government of righteousness and are lending their entire support to that kingdom. All such persons are fully determined that by God’s grace no amount of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">persecution shall deter them in their unstinted devotion and service to the Kingdom. Their eternal existence is centered in the Kingdom, and they are servants and supporters of that government of righteousness, and their eyes are blind to everything else. Let Satan and all his earthly agents, particularly the religionists, take notice now that their wicked opposition to the kingdom of Christ and to his faithful publishers and supporters on the earth'will avail them nothing. These Christians rely upon Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, and therefore they will go on in their work of publishing the Kingdom message. This explains why during the past year the publishing work of Jehovah’s witnesses and the Jonadabs has gone forward amidst the most wicked persecution ever launched against any company of sincere persons. They see Jesus, the Faithful and True Witness of Jehovah God, who bore the taunts, jeers and wicked persecution of the religious agents of the Devil, and did so joyfully that he might be Jehovah’s Vindicator; they have marked his victory over death and his great exaltation because of his faithfulness. They now hear and obey the clarion voice of the faithful apostle of Jesus Christ who, by divine authority and under inspiration of the holy spirit, addresses his fellow Christians in these words: “Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach. For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come. By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.” —Heb. 13:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While suffering indignities and bodily pain inflicted upon them by religionists these faithful Christians rejoice to be faithful publishers of the Kingdom, and thus they go among the people bearing the testimony of good news, and as they go they are singing the new song, which only those who are devoted to God and his kingdom can know or sing: “And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints. Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.” (Rev. 15: 3, 4) Christ Jesus is leading them, and they are absolutely certain to participate in his complete victory. They are therefore the only joyful people now on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From here follows a brief resume of the activities of the Kingdom publishers as their work has been carried on in different sections of the earth during the fiscal year closing September 1937.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>AMERICA (UNITED STATES OF)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Society carries on its work by the use of the aforementioned corporations, of which the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is the principal corporation. The executive offices are located at 124 Columbia Heights, and the general operating office is at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, New York, U. S. A. Among the means employed to preach the gospel of the Kingdom are the following, to wit: the printing and manufacturing of books, magazines and other papers; the manufacturing and use of sound equipment, and the use of electrical recordings for the reproduction of the human speech; and by calling upon the people at their homes and offices and exhibiting to them the message of the Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Adams Street factory being inadequate to accommodate the production work, an addition thereto was built during the year at a cost of $48,000. Also additional equipment was necessary to be used in the factory, and this was purchased during the year. The number of persons engaged in the work in the Adams Street factory and office during the year averaged 141. They worked a total of 274 days at the factory, and the other days during the year they were in the field preaching “this gospel of the kingdom”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In order to produce the above books and booklets it required the use of 1,883 tons of paper, 71 tons of chip board, and more than 109,000 yards of cloth. Additionally there were required tremendous quantities of gold leaf, paste, thread and other material. The factory, in its own ink department, manufactured 24,624 pounds of ink, 475 gallons of paint, 200 pounds of putty, and 7,674 pounds of glue.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>NEW MACHINERY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">A number of new machines were required during the year, and these were purchased and installed and include the following: Dust arrester in carpenter shop; vacuum cleaner for the air; a new stitcher for booklets; new casting-plate equipment, and other machines. During the year the Society imported from Germany a printing press, which is one of the most modern and up-to-date in use in any country. On this press can be printed magazines, books, papers or booklets. The machinery installed at the factory and in use is capa-, ble of producing daily a total of 40,000 bound books of 384 pages each, or 250,000 books of 64 pages each. This factory is a marvel in the eyes of worldly people because they cannot understand how men will so thoroughly devote themselves to the work in producing literature, and never complain about the time, and whose allowance, for instance, is only a nominal thing. Only the spirit of the Lord would prompt men to perform the work that is done in this factory. They delight to do it, and the Lord blesses their efforts.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>SHIPMENTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The shipment of bound books during the year exceeded that of production, but the production of booklets was about 1,300,000 more than the shipments during the past twelve months. A total of 1,521,516 bound books were shipped out from 117 Adams Street and its depots in the United States, as well as 22,850,966 booklets. Bibles were shipped to the number of 27,402, bringing the grand total of books and booklets shipped out to 24,399,884. This literature containing the Kingdom message was sent to all parts of the world, in 50 different languages. The shipment of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font7"> exceeded by far that of all other bound books, reaching a grand total of 826,108. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font7"> is already published and in stock in 27 languages. In the shipments of booklets, the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font7"> went over the 5,600,000 mark. Of the total amount of Literature shipped out, 2,644,806 books and booklets were in foreign languages, the balance in the English language. To dispatch the books, booklets and magazines it cost the Society $102,989.77.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>SHIPMENTS OF SOUND EQUIPMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During the past year 44 transcription machines were completed and shipped out, and 71 sound cars No. 3. At the Columbus convention two of the new Model No. 4, with a ten-watt output, were placed. This new model, which has just been developed by the Society, has a dual-speed turntable. The speaker can be mounted on the top of the car with vacuum cups. This equipment will give the finest reproduction of voice and music. If desired, it can be removed from the car and set up in a hall. It is operated from a six-volt battery. The entire equipment is very compact. A contribution of $140 covers the cost of its manufacture and shipping.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>RECORDINGS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Society has equipped publishers with electrical transcription discs on which is recorded the human voice proclaiming “this gospel of the kingdom”. The president of the Society prepares the manuscript and records these speeches. Some of them are fifteen minutes in length, and these are used for the sound cars. Up to the present time there have been produced and used 185 of such transcription records. The speeches are recorded also on discs of four and one-half minutes in duration of time, and these are used on phonographs. During the fiscal year 42 new recordings were made and have been in use, and in addition thereto 22 recordings were made in September of the fiscal year, and these are now ready for shipment and use. This brings the total number of phonograph recordings up to 124. Many of these recorded speeches have been translated and recorded in other languages, to wit: Afrikaans, Arabic, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. During the year there has been a tremendous increase in the use of the phonograph records. In 1936 there were only 52,752 discs in use; whereas in 1937 there were four times that number that have been manufactured, bringing the total up to 214,877 dises. Each disc contains two lectures. Therefore these phonograph recordings of four and one-half minutes total 429,754 recorded lectures or speeches. This, however, does not include the 22 recordings above mentioned, more than 65,000 of which recordings have already been ordered and will be shipped out immediately. Assuming that the 214,877 records were used 20 times each during the year, that would amount to 4,297,540 lectures or speeches proclaiming the message of God’s kingdom. The recent recordings of the 22 above mentioned include the public address on “Safety”, delivered at the Columbus convention; the public address on “Worshiping God”, broadcast on September 26; and one recording describing the new book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies..</span><span class="font7"> The demand for phonographs and records is rapidly increasing, and at the end of this fiscal year the Society was unable to fill all the orders.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>PUBLICATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Each person who is devoted to Jehovah God and his kingdom is a publisher of the Kingdom message, and as opportunity is afforded these persons engage in the distribution of the literature and employ other means of publication hereinbefore mentioned. In addition to all the states in the United States of America where publishers are at work, there are 22 other territories where publishers are at work who report regularly to the Brooklyn office. Those countries are, to wit:</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font7">In the United States alone there were engaged 21,451 pioneers and other publishers during the year. The hours in which they were engaged in the publishing work totaled 5,036,255. The literature placed by these amongst the people, including bound books and selfcovered booklets, totaled 12,466,043.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The tabulated report shows a decrease when compared with that for the previous year, as far as figures are concerned, but the magnitude of the work accomplished has been felt by the religionists more than in any previous year. It is not the purpose here to make excuses for totals of placements, hours and sound attendance not being equal to or more than last year’s, but it is good to consider why there is a decrease in hours, which naturally affects placements of literature and sound attendance. In the United States there were two conventions, one in October, which began the fiscal year, the other at Columbus, which ended the year. The time spent by the brethren in preparation for these conventions and in going to and from them is taken out of the field service hours. Also during the past twelve months the rearranging of the millions of petition names for proper back call required considerable time in hours not reported. Then the “Exposed” meetings consumed considerable time. These were not reported in the hours, yet they constituted an effective witness throughout the country. In the territory selected for these special “Exposed” meetings intensive witnessing was done, and many interested persons have now become good publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wherever there is disturbance amongst the company publishers this reduces the amount of distribution, and many of the brethren have been much disturbed and interfered with during the year. This disturbance has been due in some instances to the “elective elder” spirit being manifested by some who think themselves in the truth but who have retarded the progress of the work. The Lord has cleared out some of these, and it may be expected that he will soon clear them all out. Furthermore, the arrest and persecution of many of the publishers has reduced their hours in the field. Taking the matter as a whole, the real good accomplished and number of persons who have become interested in the Kingdom message during the year are gratifying, and the net result is an increase over the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Adding to the total distribution of books and booklets in the United States the distribution in the associated countries that report to the Brooklyn office, the total distribution during the year is, to wit, 12,744,629. The newly interested who obtained literature from these publishers during the year total 6,819,744. Persons who attended and gave attention to the sound lectures reproduced by electrical transcription and the phonograph during the year total 10,506,848.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year the Adams Street office received letters totaling 287,592. Many of these, having heard the message by radio or sound equipment, ordered literature, to the total number of 137,574 books and booklets. The letters dispatched from the office during the year totaled 283,478. From the report filed by the Adams Street office servant with the president the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">AH the new features that were brought forth throughout the year were taken hold of enthusiastically by the brethren. One of these new featuies was the calling on petition signers, which unquestionably had the effect of intensifying the witness throughout the area covered. This petition back-call work was followed by the “Exposed” campaign. This brought much fire from the Hierarchy and religionists. The sound cars co-operated by introducing the witnesses in regular field work and making announcements of these “Exposed” meetings. Some of them were mobbed. These “Exposed” meetings were very well attended. As time went on, it was found that the personal visit to the home does the most good. Your letter of June 23 sets out the importance of the personal back call, which is now being stressed through the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font6"> and has proved very effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now that many thousands of phonographs are in the field, a systematic coverage of the territory with records has really begun, using particularly the “Exposed” series and “Religion and Christianity ’ ’. The publishers have taken hold of this phonograph work with enthusiasm, and the reports are splendid. This has proved more effective than hiring halls and trying to get people to come. Even though often fifteen or twenty minutes are spent by a publisher at one place in running phonograph records, it means in many instances a larger combination of books or booklets is placed, but not as many calls are made. Many of those using the phonograph have reported that they are now able to put m more time in the field without getting so tired, because the phonograph gets the brethren into the homes and they can sit down and rest while you do the talking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is interesting at this point to consider the amount of sound equipment in the field. Thus far the Society has manufactured 13,571 portable phonogiaphs. Of this number, approximately 3,000 have been shipped to branches, leaving over 10,000 phonographs of the Society’s models in use in the United States. Many of the publishers have obtained phonographs locally, of which we have no report. Additionally, portable transcription machines and sound-car equipments have been manufactured by the Society and put in use throughout the country to the following extent:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark39"><span class="font6">Portable transcription machines, all electric</span></a></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>BETHEL HOME</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Situate at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, is the Bethel home. The name means “house of Jehovah God”, and in that house are domiciled nearly 200 persons, who are wholly devoted to Jehovah God and his kingdom. They come from many parts of the country, and regardless of official position or other place occupied by them when in the world, they are now all on a common level, engaged in the common cause of the kingdom under Christ. Every one in the home is devoted to the work of preaching this gospel of the kingdom of God. No person is taken into the home save those who are fully consecrated to do the will of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the Bethel home are located the executive offices from which the executive work of the Society is directed. This includes the office of the president, the secretary and treasurer, and the Bethel home servant, who looks after the home and other associated works of the Society. At the office of the president is prepared the manuscript for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> much of the manuscript for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age (Consolation),</span><span class="font7"> also the manuscript of the books and booklets and other publications. The correspondence relating to the general management of the Society is conducted from this place. At the treasurer’s office are kept the books of account showing all donations and contributions-received by the Society and all bills paid by the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to the foregoing the home houses those persons who work at the home and at the radio station studios, and also those who are engaged in the work at the Adams Street office and factory. One general dining room is employed, where food is served to all. The home maintains a laundry, shoe-mending shop, pressing shop, all of which are operated solely for the use of the members of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The preaching of this gospel of the Kingdom means the publication of the Kingdom good news. Every person at the Bethel home is a preacher of the gospel, and is ordained and commissioned by Jehovah God to preach this gospel of the Kingdom. (Isa. 61:1, 2) Each and every one who occupies the Bethel home has a clear vision of the righteous government of Jehovah God, which He is now bringing in, and is delighted to serve that kingdom. All members of the family are served meals in one main dining room, and during each meal Bible questions pertaining to the Kingdom are discussed and considered. At stated hours in the evening Bible classes are conducted in the main assembly room of the home, which class studies are attended by those who occupy rooms at the home. Each study is led by some competent person, and all take a part in the study for the purpose of equipping them to preach this gospel of the Kingdom to the people. Each and every bedroom or living room in the house is devoted to Bible study. Generally, two persons occupy each bedroom, and together or singly they study the Scriptures and prepare themselves and their work for preaching or publishing the gospel or Kingdom message. Having prepared himself, each one goes from house to house and preaches the gospel by the means provided by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All menial work of the home is done and performed by those consecrated men and women who occupy the premises. A part of the time during each week is devoted to the work of publishing the Kingdom message by the members of the family going from house to house and calling upon the people and witnessing to them, after the manner adopted and followed by the early disciples of Jesus Christ. They publish the Kingdom message to all persons who have an ear to hear. During the fiscal year just closed the members of the Bethel family employed a total of 23,697 hours in going from house to house or door to door, bringing to the people and witnessing to them “this gospel of the kingdom”. In addition thereto the family served every day during the Newark and Columbus conventions, which service required many hours and much strenuous work to the end that others might go into the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The members of the Bethel family, during the fiscal year, employed and used more than 125 phonographs and sound machines reproducing and preaching the Kingdom message. In doing this work they visited many persons in the Greater New York area and gave testimony to thousands of persons, proclaiming to them the Kingdom message. Their efforts are summed up as follows: Hours engaged in this service, 23,697; persons attending and hearing the message by sound equipment, 44,405; persons obtaining literature, 44,629; total number of books and booklets placed with such persons, 97,593. The number of persons of the Bethel family engaged in the publishing of the message averaged 157 persons per jveek. Thus it is seen that the members of the Bethel family, in addition to their other duties performed at the Bethel home, preached the Kingdom gospel to many persons and brought comfort and consolation to many who were seeking after righteousness and truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The studios of radio station WBBR are situate at the Bethel home, and every program broadcast from these studios includes the Kingdom message proclaimed either by persons who speak or by transcription or phonograph records that are reproduced and broadcast by radio. This radio station is devoted wholly to the publishing of the Lord’s kingdom message and, to other things of public interest, convenience and&quot;' necessity. No pecuniary profit whatsoever is derived from such broadcasting, no revenue is received, and all the expense of maintaining and operating such radio studios is met by voluntary contributions. The Bethel home, therefore, is entirely devoted to the proclamation of this gospel of the Kingdom as commanded by the Lord, and thus the entire work at said home is benevolent and charitable. Each and every member of the Bethel home renders service freely, and the only compensation therefor is housing and meals furnished by the Society, and laundry provided, as well as repairing, and a small allowance of $10 per month to each person, which money is used for incidental expenses, such as clothing and the like. No person of the Bethel family has or receives any pecuniary profit from the operation of the home, factory or office.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>WATCHTOWER (STATEN ISLAND)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Society owns certain real estate situate on Staten Island, Greater New York, and for convenience this place is called Watchtower. At that point is situated the transmitter of radio station WBBIt, which radio station is devoted exclusively to broadcasting that which is of the greatest public interest, convenience and necessity, and all programs are broadcast freely and without any compensation received from any person whatsoever. No program for hire is ever broadcast, and all the expense of maintaining and operating such radio station is borne by the afore-mentioned corporations, and the money received for that purpose is derived from voluntary contributions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to the radio station, a portion of the land at Watehtower is used for gardens, whereon are produced vegetables used to provide food for the family at Watehtower and at the Bethel home, Brooklyn. There are 17 persons employed or engaged at Watchtower, Staten Island, in the work of operating the radio station, cultivating the gardens and attending the poultry, the proceeds of which are used entirely for those who are engaged in the Lord’s service. This is carried on for the purpose of enabling the Bethel family to be maintained at the least possible cost or expense. Those laboring at the Staten Island home receive no profit whatsoever, and their allowance for incidental expense is the same as to the members of the Bethel home, and, in fact, all are of one family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to the foregoing the Society maintains at Watchtower buildings in which are housed aged and indigent persons who are unable to care for themselves, but which persons have spent much time and effort in the publication of the Kingdom message. These persons receive their food, raiment and shelter free of charge, and which is furnished at the expense of the Peoples Pulpit Association. Each and every member of the family at Watehtower, Staten Island, is devoted to the Lord, consecrated to do his will, and commissioned to preach this gospel of the Kingdom. The rooms of the buildings at Watchtower are used for the housing of persons engaged in preaching the gospel, and at stated times Bible studies are held therein. Each and every person at the Watchtower home at Staten Island at stated intervals engages in the work of going from house to house to preach this gospel of the Kingdom by word of mouth and by use of the phonograph and transcription records. The property at Staten Island is devoted entirely to the Society’s work of proclaiming the Kingdom message or advertising God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>RADIO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During the past year the radio has been employed to advertise the King and the Kingdom, and many radio stations have participated in that work. For these programs the commercial rate has been paid, and the money used to pay for same has been contributed by the men and women throughout the land who love God and his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The programs broadcast have been both by electrical transcription and by speakers personally using the radio to address audiences. Programs by electrical transcription in the English language to the number of 18,213 were broadcast during the year. Radio Station WBBR, owned and maintained by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and the Peoples Pulpit Association, broadcast all programs without any remuneration from anyone. This radio station never at any time has received one penny for broadcasting programs. All expense of maintaining that station is paid by the Society. In addition to this, time for broadcasting has been purchased from other stations in the United States and other countries, and below we give a list of radio stations employed and used during the year 1937, the total number being 339, as follows, to wit:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">During the year the president of the Society addressed the country a number of times by a network of radio stations. Some of these programs were transmitted practically all over the earth. Saturday, September 18, 1937, the president’s address before the Columbus (Ohio) convention, to an audience of 25,000 people, was broadcast throughout the United States, practically all of North America, England, Continental Europe, and Australia Sunday, September 19, 1937, 135 radio stations in the United States broadcast an address delivered by the president of the Society on the subject &quot;Safety”. Sunday, September 26, 1937, the president broadcast a lecture, &quot;Worshiping God, ’ ’ over a nation-wide network of 125 radio stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the conclusion of the last above-described network of radio stations broadcasting the program it was announced by the president of the Society that on the 31st of October, 1937, all contracts for the broadcasting of programs of the Society for hire would be canceled and that thereafter only such radio stations as would broadcast the Kingdom message without charge would be used. In his address on &quot;Worshiping God” the president set forth the reasons why this action was being taken. Amongst other things were these: That during the past ten years radio stations throughout the land had broadcast the Watch Tower programs proclaiming the kingdom of God under Christ, and it had spent upward of two million dollars in payment for such programs, all of which money had been contributed by those who love God and his kingdom; that during all that time the religionists put forth their most vigorous and vicious endeavors to prevent radio stations from broadcasting such programs; that threats and coercive methods and boycott were used, particularly by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other religionists, to induce radio stations to cancel such programs; that because of such wrongful methods used petitions were filed by millions of American citizens with Congress and with the Federal Radio Commission, demanding that action be taken to prohibit interference with Watch Tower programs; that nothing whatsoever had been done to cause such persecution and interference to stop, but, on the contrary, the public officials of the United States government, owners of radio stations, and others had conspired and acted together to hinder and prevent the broadcasting of the Kingdom message; that for this reason the radio has up to this time served as a test to owners and operators and to the officials of the government of the United States, and particularly to the clergy, all of whom have shown their opposition to God’s kingdom under Christ; that by this test all of those opponents have identified themselves as the enemies of God and his kingdom, and therefore the radio appears to have fully served God’s purpose in giving warning to the peoples of the nation and in serving to divide the people and force the opponents to declare themselves against God’s kingdom and thus identify themselves as members of the Devil’s organization, even as the religionists did in the time of Jehu. (2 Ki. 10:18-28) The Lord Jesus declared that at the time of his appearing at the temple he would have all the nations before him, and he would separate them as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats; and the radio has furnished much evidence of the fulfillment of this prophecy and has shown clearly that those who have opposed the broadcasting of the Kingdom message are in the “goat” class as opponents of the Lord God and his King. (Matt. 25: 31-46) The radio having served God’s purpose, there seems to be no further reason why consecrated money should be used to pay radio stations to make known the Kingdom. Although the law of the land requires that radio stations broadcast that which is of public interest, convenience and necessity, almost all the programs put over the air are commercial, having to do with an effort to sell to the people goods, wares and merchandise, much of which is of no value; that the religious programs broadcast are purely commercial, because the purpose is to induce the people to stand by the churches as against God’s kingdom, and to support the churches by their money. The programs generally broadcast today do not comply with the law, for the reason that they are not of public interest, they are not of public necessity, and they are not of public convenience, because they have no tendency to inform the people of the things that they really need or to build them up and give them strength, moral courage and faith in God. For this reason the poor get no benefit from commercial radio stations. A better method of carrying on the witness work than by hired radio stations will henceforth be used.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>PERSONAL VISITS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus and his apostles went from house to house, there meeting the people personally, and preached to them the gospel of the kingdom of God; and thus the precedent was established and has the approval of Jehovah God and shows that such a manner is more pleasing to the Lord in proclaiming the gospel to the people. It is the delivering of the testimony to the people that is important, and this can be done better by personal visits than otherwise. Everyone who will be of the kingdom of God now has an opportunity of having a part in bringing the testimony personally before the people, and the Jonadabs or '‘great multitude” likewise have an opportunity to participate in this work and will do so. The ruling element of the nation having been warned, particularly by means of the radio programs broadcast concerning the Kingdom, and the poor people having few faeili-ties for hearing radio programs, and the poor being the ones that are most likely to hear the Kingdom message, a concerted and organized effort will now be put forth to carry the Kingdom gospel to all such as have a hearing ear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As an aid to such personal witness work the Lord has brought into action thousands of sound machines with the necessary equipment, which machines are known as transcription machines, sound cars and phonographs. Speech relating to the Kingdom message is made and recorded by means of electricity and other necessary equipment, and such speech is reproduced on discs or records for the benefit of those who desire to hear. These sound machines are produced and made available for Jehovah’s witnesses and the Jonadabs, all of whom are now privileged to use them and by this means have a part in preaching this gospel of the Kingdom. During the fiscal year approximately 15,000 sound machines have been employed in this part of the witness work, and more machines and records are being produced as rapidly as the Society’s factories can turn them out. The field workers are providing themselves with phonographs and the necessary records, and they go from house to house and introduce the Kingdom message in this manner. Up to the present time the transcription and phonograph records have been made and the speech translated and recorded in the English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Ukrainian, and Arabic, and other languages. These sound machines are manufactured and placed in the hands of the field workers at a financial loss to the Society, the deficit being made up by voluntary contributions.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>USE OF RECORDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Recordings are made for the transcription machines on discs that require fifteen minutes to reproduce the speech, and on the phonograph four and one-half minutes to five minutes to reproduce the speech. The pioneers and company workers and others use this sound equipment and the discs in their daily witness work in the field. All the workers are realizing the great aid of such equipment in preaching the gospel, and the company workers and others throughout the earth are increasing their equipment as rapidly as possible to do this work. By this means they are enabled to personally meet the people in their homes, particularly those who are too poor to have radio receiving sets, and to interest such hearers by giving them an opportunity to hear of some of the provisions that God has made for those that love and serve him.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>SPECIAL PIONEERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">At the conclusion of the fiscal year the Society organized a company of “special pioneers’’, equipping these for field service and sending them forth to do special work. Each one of such pioneers is equipped with a phonograph and records, which will be daily used in the witness work. These special pioneers will receive necessary aid from the Society and will devote their entire time to calling on the people and personally presenting to them the Kingdom message, both by phonograph and through the printed publications. It confidently appears that this method of preaching the gospel will be more effective than the broadcasting by radio stations, and money that would otherwise have been used to pay commercial rates for programs on the radio will now be employed to increase the means of giving testimony by phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who have made a covenant to do the will of God will find now no excuse for their failure or refusal to have a part in the witness work. This gospel of the Kingdom must be preached in obedience to the Lord’s commandment, and the Lord is providing the necessary means to do the work. For this reason the use of sound machines and phonographs and the personal visits to the homes of the people will put a test upon the' witnesses of the Lord. This test will afford each one the opportunity to show whether he will maintain his integrity toward God or not. All who have a proper understanding of the paramount importance of the Kingdom will meet this test and stand it successfully and go joyfully on to victory. They will realize and appreciate that this is a great campaign in the interest of the Righteous Government. They will not be so much impressed with their own salvation as with the privilege and responsibility of proving their unbreakable love for God and his kingdom. They will see and appreciate not only that the Kingdom is a means of salvation of honest and obedient persons, but, above all, that through it Jehovah God’s name will be fully vindicated. So seeing that before them is set the greatest privilege ever given to creatures, the faithful will permit nothing to stand in their way or interfere with their full devotion to the Lord in performing this part of the service to his honor and praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The special pioneers will furnish a very effective way of reaching the people, and as the Lord provides the financial means the number of these special ones will be increased. Both the remnant and the Jonadabs are'learning that it is their great privilege to use whatsoever money they can in furthering the Kingdom interests and by this means to prove their love and devotion to God and his kingdom. It is therefore confidently expected that the Lord will put it in the minds of such persons of good will to come forward with all the money that is necessary to carry on his work according to his will. Those who are fully devoted to God’s kingdom now appreciate the fact that money is of no value whatsoever unless it can be used to further the Kingdom interests, and the Kingdom interests can be furthered by advertising to the people that God’s kingdom is the only means of relief and salvation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>BOOKS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Society maintains at Brooklyn a printing and bookbinding establishment, as well as in other places of the earth equipment for manufacturing the books. All these books contain the message concerning the Kingdom. They are not manufactured for pecuniary gain, of course, because no profit is made. At the end of the year we find, each time, that the small contributions that have been received for the books do not meet the expenditures for the manufacture and publication of the same. The deficit must be made up and is made up by money voluntarily contributed out of the meager means of those who are interested in God’s kingdom. One means of advertising the Kingdom, and which means has been greatly blessed by the Lord, is that of exhibiting to the people the books containing the Kingdom message. The phonograph furnishes an introduction which claims the attention of those who are seeking truth and righteousness, and the books that are placed in the hands of the people enable them to take their Bible and carefully examine the books; by which, together with the explanation contained in the books, they are able to ascertain God’s purpose toward the human race. It is true that the Society receives contributions for the books from all who will, but these contributions are often less than the books cost to manufacture and publish. In addition thereto a great number are given away freely to people who have no money. Jehovah’s witnesses realize that their mission is to preach the Kingdom, that God has laid that responsibility upon them, and they cannot shirk this responsibility; and if they find persons who desire to know about the Kingdom, and who have no money to contribute toward the publication of books, such books are freely given to them. Persons who hunger and thirst for righteousness seek the way of finding the same, and thus their attention is drawn to the Lord’s provision for such. The publications of the Society explain the Bible and enable a person to find in the Bible exactly the things that bear upon the present-day events and make clear the reason for the destruction now on the earth and the only hope that is set before mankind. Jehovah God has pointed the people to his beloved Son, the King, and his kingdom as their only hope, but in order for the people to learn this great truth it must be called to their attention. For this reason the message of and concerning the kingdom of God under Christ is of greatest public need, convenience and interest. Only those who love Jehovah and who are therefore Jehovah’s servants are bearing this message of truth to the people, and, true to his course of wickedness, the Devil and all his agents oppose such message. Jehovah’s witnesses, therefore, know that they must carry on the witness work against great opposition, and they are not at all deterred in their work by opposition. Religious leaders call upon their parishioners to gather together these books and bum them, for no other reason than the fact that they contain the truth exposing wickedness and showing God’s only remedy for the human race; and those who do burn them have and manifest the spirit of God’s great enemy, Satan the Devil. By means of comparing the Scriptures with religion the people now can readily see that religion is of the Devil and has been an instrument of the Devil used for centuries to blind the people, whereas Christianity, that is, full obedience to God’s Word, leads people into the way of safety and everlasting blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year the Lord has caused to be brought forth the booklets </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon, Protection, Uncovered, </span><span class="font7">and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Safety,</span><span class="font7"> and a booklet entitled </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study;</span><span class="font7"> also a bound book of 384 pages, entitled </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font7"> These books make the clear distinction between religion and Christianity and enable the people to see who constitute their real enemies and who are their real friends. The proclamation of this kingdom message carried on by this and other means of publication provokes a controversy on behalf of the enemy, and thus there is a constant warfare between those who are for God and his kingdom and those who are opposed. This is the time that this warfare must be carried on, and therefore, in harmony with the text for the year, this warfare is being carried on. Therefore to his people Jehovah says: “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.” Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions throughout the earth have been diligent during the year in carrying on the battle as commanded. Their part in such warfare is not performed by carnal weapons, but by the use of God’s Word and its explanation. Their part is to sound the warning and to deliver the message of comfort, and thus they are magnifying the name of the Lord and the importance of his kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>CONVENTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During the fiscal year a number of local conventions were held in the area of the United States. The two outstanding important conventions were the ones held at Newark, New Jersey, October 16-18, 1936, and at Columbus, Ohio, September 15-20, 1937. At the Newark convention 4,247 publishers were at the battle front; and amidst a drenching rain and great opposition from the clergy and the police, and other opponents, those faithful persons witnessed for Jehovah’s kingdom, and placed in the hands of the people in and about Newark 96,386 books and booklets. The numerous sound cars present and that operated in different parts of the vicinity within that period of time had a total of 137,301 listeners. On the third day of that convention the president addressed an audience in the Armory, with a seating capacity of 12,000. Every seat was occupied, and all available standing space, and hundreds on the outside heard by means of voice amplifiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was at the Newark convention that the Lord disclosed to his people in general assembly for the first time his provision as foreshadowed by the drama recorded in Genesis known as “Joseph and his brethren”. That convention was a great uplift to Jehovah’s witnesses and a splendid witness to the people of New Jersey, where there had been so much wicked persecution carried on against the Lord’s people because of their faithfulness to his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The religionists showed their enmity against God and his kingdom during the Newark convention by causing the arrest of a great number of men and women, who were thrown into prison, not for committing some crime, but because they were going from door to door bearing testimony to the people. Many of these cases were tried in the courts; and the courts, yielding to the influence of the commercial religionists, imposed fines and jail sentences upon Jehovah’s witnesses. These faithful publishers suffered such indignities joyfully, because they knew that the Lord had permitted such as a means of causing the wicked ones to identify themselves as against God’s kingdom and a means for the witnesses of the Lord to prove their integrity under adverse conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">September 15-20, 1937, the Columbus, Ohio, convention was held. More than 20,000 of God’s people assembled there daily to hear instructions to better equip themselves for the field battle. On Sunday, at the time of the delivery of the public address, 30,000 or more persons were on the ground, all of whom were enabled to hear clearly every word spoken by means of a splendid public-address system. This public-address system was installed by one of Jehovah’s witnesses connected with the Lord’s organization and upon whom the Lord put his spirit and blessing in making such arrangement. Officers of the Fair Grounds freely stated that they had never known the Fair Grounds and the auditorium to be so well equipped with a publicaddress system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That convention was, without doubt, the greatest assembly of God’s people held on earth, the greatest in number, and its enthusiasm, no doubt, the greatest. Of course, it does not compare with the meetings that the Lord Jesus held, but since the days of the apostles there has been nothing like it. It was clearly manifested that those who attended that convention were fully devoted to the Lord and his kingdom, and nothing was heard from anyone except that which would advance the Kingdom interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Up to this time a number of companies in different parts of the land had been afflicted by the manifestation of the “elective elder” spirit, and hence there were contentions within the company. At the Columbus convention all got a better view of the Kingdom and its importance and of the necessity of unity in action, and at the conclusion thereof the entire number attending the convention signified, by standing, their determination to go back home, lay aside all personalities and contentions and all selfishness, and each and every one bend his efforts fully to the advertising of the King and the Kingdom. It clearly appeared that this convention had served to unify God’s people as never before and to show them the necessity of presenting a solid front against the enemy in the warfare. Not only the visible audience heard the addresses and participated in the enthusiasm of the convention, but a much larger invisible audience heard. Assemblies were had throughout the United States and Great Britain, Continental Europe and Australia, and these assemblies, being connected by wire and wireless equipment, were enabled to hear the most important address delivered to the convention. They all participated in the spirit of enthusiasm and loving devotion that moved those at the Ohio convention to proclaim the name of Jehovah and his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the Columbus convention the territory for the workers was limited, of course, and not sufficient to give each and every one an opportunity to devote much time to field service. There was an average daily of approximately 8,000 persons in the field service. These publishers placed in the hands of the people during the convention the aggregate number of 117,468 books and booklets. The persons receiving such literature numbered 80,934. Those attending the sound car and phonograph meetings were approximately 140,000 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From every part of the country came those who are devoted to God and his kingdom. They came by every means of transportation. The pioneers journeyed in their trailers, and some of them on foot. There on the Fair Grounds they pitched their tents and built their own city. Nearly one-fourth of the Fair Grounds space was used for this purpose. They laid out their city in an orderly manner, erecting their tents and parking their house-ears along the streets provided by them for that purpose. On these house-cars, trailers and tents were posted the names and addresses of those who were domiciled there, that they might be readily found. Approximately 2,000 lived in this quickly constructed city. To show the facility with which these faithful witnesses act, their equipment was brought in and their city built quickly, and within twenty-four hours after the convention ended everything was removed and this little division of the army was again marching to their territory to further engage in battle. The Lord surely loves these pioneers very dearly because of their zeal for him and his kingdom. They endure really the brunt of the battle, and they rejoice in undergoing hardships and suffering reproach for the name of Jehovah and his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The feeding of that great multitude in Columbus was an important item, and the Society set about to provide the food at the least possible cost. A cafeteria was constructed and operated chiefly by members of the Bethel family and other brethren who assisted. Ten thousand persons were fed per hour during the rush periods, and practically all those attending the convention obtained their three meals a day at this cafeteria. To give some idea of the magnitude of the preparations necessary a statement is here made of the food consumed, as follows: Milk, 52,730 quarts; 8,000 gallons of fruit juices; 12,434 pounds of bread; 2,079 pounds of butter; 14,000 pounds of meat and fish; two tons of cheese; many tons of vegetables; 70,000 pies; 57,000 portions of ice eream, and much other food. The cafeteria and kitchens were equipped with voice amplifiers so that those who did the work could, while working, listen to the programs and other proceedings of the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every member of the Bethel family was assigned to a post of duty, and each and every one performed his or her duty faithfully. The convention was without doubt the most orderly and well conducted that the present generation has known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Other provisions of the convention included this: A gas station was installed for the purpose of furnishing gasoline and oil to the cars of those attending the convention, and the Society furnished the necessary gas and oil at actual cost, thus saving those attending considerable money. The Society furnished its own traffic officers and police to police the Fair Grounds. The Society made arrangements with the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio State Journal,</span><span class="font7"> that daily issued more than 30,000 extra copies of its paper carrying a full-page report of the convention. There are many details that might be recorded here, but it seems not best to use this space to further elaborate on this convention. More complete details thereof have been published in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio State Journal</span><span class="font7"> and the magazine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the beginning of each year a schedule is made up for the campaign work in the field during the year. It is not always possible to follow out this campaign closely and accurately, because of other things that arise which must be done. There is but one purpose, and that is to give the most effective witness possible in behalf of the Kingdom, and the Society bends its efforts to that end. As to this further means of advertising the Kingdom, and the efforts put forth, the following is quoted from the report of the Society’s servant at 117 Adams Street, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There were two campaigns scheduled for the year. On account of the convention, only one was held, May 29, 30. The brethren are always ready for action when called upon; but a more effective means of meeting opposition has been found, which is, covering the troubled area with just a phonograph and making arrangements for back calls, at which subsequent calls literature is introduced for the first time. This has proved very effective, and the enemy has not been able to successfully oppose it. It has proved an excellent means of meeting emergencies that have arisen, and a divisional campaign has not been necessary. All the details of the division arrangement are still held intact for any action necessary. Report for the one divisional campaign of the year is as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGNS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was a total of 41,126 different publishers in the field during these two international periods. It is a remarkable thing, when one stops to consider it, that 2,500,987 pieces of literature are placed in the hands of the people m only 18 days’ timet If the brethren could average as much time throughout the year as they average during these testimony periods, more than 50 million pieces of literature would be placed in 12 months; so it goes to show that these international campaigns are a real blessing and that the brethren do put forth an extraordinary effort. A report for the two periods follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">As was announced in the beginning of the year, bix special periods were set aside for special witness. The names of these periods denote the fight and have been stimulating to the brethren to put forth extraordinary effort in the field. In the United States these six periods brought forth good results. Nearly three million pieces of literature were placed, and over two million persons enjoyed the lectures brought to them through the sound equipment. The total work accomplished in these six periods, to compare with the six periods of 1936, is set out herewith:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">During the past year 318 companies were served by members of the Bethel family. The work they did was the same as that carried on by the regional servants. Their territory is held within. 200 miles of New York city. The brethren within this distance of the Brooklyn office are better organized than at any time heretofore. The expense of this service, in addition to 42 funerals served, amounts to $1,539.89.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society from its Brooklyn headquarters sends out certain numbers of men who regularly represent the Kingdom interest by serving companies at various places. All of these are ordained ministers of the gospel. Their ordination consists first of that conferred upon them by the Lord, as set forth in Isaiah 61:1, 2, and the further authority granted to them by appointment from the Society. Below we give a list of those who are ordained ministers and the representatives of the Society from the Brooklyn office, to wit:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Attention is here called to some of the evidence of the opposition manifested by religionists against God’s kingdom under Christ. True to what the Lord foretold, those religionists, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, put forth every possible endeavor to hinder the progressive march of the Kingdom message, and this they do by causing the arrest and persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses and the enactment and enforcement wrongfully of laws to further retard the witness work. It has become necessary for the Society to maintain a legal department, employing one gen-</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Comparisons</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This report shows a decrease of over fifty percent, compared with the previous year’s arrests totaling 1,149. There has been a steady decline in number of arrests since the first of the year. Here is the tally by quarters:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">First quarter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;363 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third quarter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Second quarter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;104 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth quarter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the first quarter we had the Newark-convention total of 114, and a haul of the same number at Peoria, Illinois. The average number of arrests per month for the year is 47. Taking out the first month, with its unusual conditions, the average is reduced to 30 per month. For the past six months the average is 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are several reasons for this improved condition of affairs. One is that the publishers are using more wisdom and discretion in their work. They avoid arrest instead of walking right into it. They evade officers instead of challenging them to arrest them. Another reason is the wider use of the phono-giaph. In a number of the tough areas phonographs only are used, with good effect. A third reason is that some of the municipalities got tired of the battle and quit their opposition. They groan occasionally, but most of the time look the other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New Jersey</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The witness work is progressing steadily and with very few arrests. A large number of municipalities “improved” their ordinances during the past year. The newspapers announced prominently at the time that they were being improved to get Jehovah’s witnesses They made their ordinances so tight, however, that businessmen and labor unions and newspapers have strenuously objected. One of them, at Edgewater, was challenged by a labor organization, and in a test ease the New Jersey Supreme Court handed down a decision that a municipality could not prohibit the handing out of a document of public interest on the streets It still appears to be considered an invasion of the personal rights of people to hand such document to a householder at his home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It appears as though we might see the labor organizations fighting the same battle we have fought, and the Edgewater ease, at least, is beneficial to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pennsylvania</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The mining areas around Pittsburgh have subsided in their opposition greatly. Tlus is largely due to the determined resistance put up and the winning of a number of cases in the Common Pleas courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Georgia</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It looks as though the area around Atlanta is going to be the principal battle ground for a while. The municipalities have put rigid ordinances on their books. We have been defeated in the Georgia Supreme Court, and the opposition has therefore been much encouraged. The publishers are meeting the issue with increased use of the phonographs, and, in Atlanta, with the use of “no fixed contribution” testimony cards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New York</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The central part of Long Island, and North Pelham, in Westchester county, offer some resistance. We secured reversals of three convictions from North Pelham, which will have a salutary effect on that burg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Flag Salute</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">New Jersey, Georgia and Massachusetts upper courts have upheld the compulsory flag-salute regulations The New Jersey and Georgia cases are being appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The papers are being caiefully prepared, and we should have a decision on the merits before the year is over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Legislative</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lawmaking bodies do not readily pass bills presented by us, but it is apparent that our presentations have had a good effect in preventing oppressive legislation from being passed. In Pennsylvania several gag laws were introduced. We presented counter measures and asked for an investigation. Our bills were defeated, and also the gag laws failed of passage. &quot;We presented a protest to the New York Legislature against the Nazi gag law. It failed of passage. Same result in Connecticut. In Illinois a flag-salute law was introduced. We protested, and that failed of passage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom Schools</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are two in Massachusetts, three in Pennsylvania, one in New Jersey, and one in Maryland. A large number of qualified teachei s have registered their names for service when needed in such schools. An additional school is being established in Atlanta, Geoigia.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>COST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The enemy always concerns itself about the money used to carry on the work for the Lord’s kingdom. They constantly put forth an effort to show that the work of the Society is a commercial enterprise. This shows their complete ignorance of what God’s kingdom and its work means. All the money and all the wealth in the earth belong to Jehovah, and he could have it all for his own purpose, if that should be his will. God furnishes his people the opportunity to show their love and devotion to him and his kingdom by permitting them to deny themselves and to make a sacrifice of their little earthly belongings to carry on his kingdom work. For this reason opportunity is given to the people of good will to contribute for the literature a small amount of money. There would be no object or purpose in the Society’s trying to make money for the benefit of individuals. Those who are engaged in this work are anxious to use and do use everything within their power to further the Kingdom interests. It is found at the end of the fiscal year that there is a difference between the amount of contributions received for all of the Society’s publications and the amount expended in manufacturing and distributing such publications, and that this difference is, to wit, $141,665.95. This deficit must be made up in some way. It is made up by the voluntary contributions of men and women interested in the Kingdom work, which contributions are known as “good hopes” and which contributions are sent in regularly as the men and women interested can spare the money. The Roman Catholic organization that constantly solicits money from the people is not asked to pay taxes on its property. The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and the Peoples Pulpit Association are fully entitled to the benefit of tax exemption on the property held by said corporations for the Society, and yet a constant effort is made on behalf of officers to compel the payment of taxes on the Society’s property. Of course, if any taxes are paid, that money must come out of the voluntary contribution of poor people throughout the land who send in their little mite to help carry on the Lord’s work and to make up the deficiency such as above mentioned. There is no class of people under the sun who do so much work and who get on with so little money as those who are engaged in the Society’s work. They put in their time and effort in doing the work assigned to them in preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and receive in consideration only their food and lodging, and the small pittance of $10 per month by which they must provide their own clothing and other temporary necessities. The Peoples Pulpit Association holding title to property in the State of New York once had its ease heard by the courts of the State, which decided that it is clearly entitled to tax exemption under the law. Conditions have not changed in any manner whatsoever, and yet the tax officers continue to place the property of the Peoples Pulpit Association on the tax list. In all these years the property held by the Peoples Pulpit Association has not yielded one penny of revenue. The contributions received for its literature and for the products of its gardens, and so forth, each year have been used to carry on its benevolent work, and each year there has been a deficit, and for the fiscal year ending 1937 the deficit is more than $140,000, as above stated. Thus it is seen that, if ultimately the Society is compelled to pay taxes on its property, these taxes must be raised and paid by the voluntary donations of Christian people who are scattered throughout the United States. Mention is made here to show how there is much blindness concerning the work of the Society, and therefore no doubt much opposition is induced by reason of the religious influence exercised against the Society. It was clearly the purpose and intention of the lawmakers that such charitable and benevolent institutions as the Peoples Pulpit Association should be clearly exempt from taxes for the reason that the presumption is that such institutions do not operate for pecuniary profit. All the facts show that the Peoples Pulpit Assoclation operates without one cent of pecuniary profit to any person, but, on the contrary, operates at a financial sacrifice to many persons who contribute their money to carry on its work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“THE WATCHTOWER”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine is the official publication of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, issued twice each month for the benefit of all those who are deeply interested in the study of the Bible. It carries no advertisements, but every part of its space is used for the publication of the Kingdom message. The small subscription of one dollar per year that is received is used to help defray the expenses of the Society, including the publication of the magazine. Many subscriptions are furnished to the poor people for which no contribution or subscription is received whatsoever. There is therefore no pecuniary profit derived to any person by reason of the publication of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font7">magazine.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>“THE GOLDEN AGE”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">For the past eighteen years the Society has published a magazine under the title </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age. </span><span class="font7">Recently the name of this magazine has been changed to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font7"> the first issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> being published September 19, 1937. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> magazine, How </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font7"> is devoted exclusively to the publication of that whieh is of interest, convenience and necessity for the people in general. The small subscription price received for it is paid into the funds of the Society and used for the purpose of defraying the expense of the publication of the magazine and for other parts of the Kingdom work. No one receives any pecuniary profit by reason of the publication of this magazine. It is one of the means of carrying on the work of the Society. It carries no advertisements and receives no revenue whatsoever save the subscription paid by those who are able to pay, whereas many subscriptions for this magazine are furnished free to the poor. The purpose of the magazine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> is that it may furnish real consolation and help to the people by keeping them informed of things that they need to know.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>KINGDOM PUBLISHERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Every one of God’s people on earth who supports the Lord Jesus Christ and his kingdom is a publisher of the Kingdom message. They appreciate the obligation which the Lord has laid upon them to make known his kingdom. In keeping with their commission and their work in fulfillment of that God-given commission the assembly at the Columbus (Ohio) convention unanimously adopted and sent forth to the world the following Declaration, to wit :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DECLARATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">This company of Christian people assembled at Columbus, Ohio, declare</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That we are wholly devoted to God and his kingdom under Christ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That in obedience to Jehovah’s commandment we proclaim to the world his warning that the day of his vengeance is at hand;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That all religion originated with the Devil, and such the Devil employs to deceive the people and turn them away from God and his kingdom;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That religion is the means of carrying on the most tremendous and devastating racket that has ever afflicted the people;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That Jehovah reveals by his prophecy that soon, at the battle </span><span class="font6">of Armageddon, he will destroy the religious and all other parts of tiie Devil’s organization, and that such will be the greatest tribulation the world will ever have known;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That the only place of safety is the kingdom of God under Christ, and that those persons who desire to live must for ever abandon religion and every part of Satan’s organization and take their stand on the side of God and his kingdom under Christ and obey the commandments of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We bid you choose and serve God and his kingdom and thus find the place of complete safety and life everlasting. [Unanimously adopted September 19, 1937.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By the Lord’s grace the remnant and their companions who bear testimony to his kingdom throughout the United States have endeavored during the year to be faithful in the performance of their commission. The foregoing facts are set out in this report in order that it may be seen what they have been doing. The Lord, of course, is their Judge, and to him they are responsible; but each and every one who has had part in the witness work during the year will rejoice to know that so much has been accomplished in making known the name of Jehovah, his King and his kingdom throughout this land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>AFRICA (South, Central and East)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The witness work in South Africa has progressed during the year, and that in the face of the most bitter opposition against the kingdom of God prosecuted by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allied religionists. The publishers, fired with the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house, and their activity sharpened by such opposition, have pushed forward. The result is a wider distribution of the publications containing the Kingdom message than during the previous year, such increase exceeding the previous year by 30,000 and more.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font7">Following his age-old political trick, the Devil has made vigorous attacks on the outlying districts and colonies of the natives and, having worked up public sentiment against the Lord’s work, has then moved his forces toward the central governmental power. Using </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the clergy</span><span class="font7"> as his chief instrument, the Devil has induced the political religionists to enact laws prohibiting the publication of the Kingdom message in different parts of Africa. In the face of this opposition the faithful witnesses of Jehovah continue to put forth even greater efforts to give warning and to inform the hungry ones of God’s gracious provision for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The witnesses in Africa, operating with and under the direction of the Society’s office at Cape Town, have shown great courage and much joy in doing the work committed to them, and the result is gratifying. Says the local report of the Society’s representative:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the close of another year of Kingdom activity it gives pleasure to report that steady progress has been made throughout this part of the field. The publishers in each country under the jurisdiction of the Cape Town office have shown much zeal in their efforts to make Jehovah's name and </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font6">gdom better known. Keen opposition has again been encountered m several countries, but such has only served to stimulate the brethren to press the battle to the gate. The Lord’s blessing and guidance have been very manifest, and he has given the increase. The total distribution of literature amounted to 70,714 bound volumes and 363,447 booklets, or a total of 434,161 books and booklets. There has, therefore, been an increase of 1,107 bound volumes and 19,208 booklets over last year’s distribution. The literature has been spread in 26 different languages, as follows: English, Afrikaans, Arabic, Chinese, Chiwemba, Cinyanja, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Gujerati, Hindi, Hollandish, Italian, Malay, Polish, Portuguese, Sesuto, Spanish, Tamil, Telegu, Urdu, Kosa, Yiddish, Yoruba, and Zulu. About 80 percent of it has gone out in the two official European languages of South Africa, namely, English and Afrikaans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Union of South Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From reports in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> and the daily press of conditions in other lands we are of the opinion that South Africa is one of the most favored countries in the earth A democratic government is in control, composed mostly of men to whom the precious heritage of liberty still means something. It is possible, therefore, for us to worship God according to the dictates of his Word, our consciences and our steadfast belief. Climatic conditions are reasonably good, and there is little in the way of unemployment. The witness in the Union has gone forward with a swing. There has been an increase in every part of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The total number of books distributed during the year is 359,507, and the attendance at meetings conducted by the sound equipment totals 267,204. The total increase of books and booklets distributed during the year is 37,710, and the increase in the attendance at sound meetings is 46,759.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pioneers have averaged 117.5 hours per month; the auxiliaries, 51 hours; and the company publishers, 12.5. Regular reports are received from 70 different centers in the Union. Our quota of 75,000 hours was exceeded by over 8,500 hqurs, due in part to the increase in the number of publishers and also in part to the sterling effort put forth by a number of the pioneer brethren who worked many hours over the required minimum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The outstanding feature of the work during the past twelve months has undoubtedly been the commencement of the phonograph work in real earnest. Some work was done previously, but, as indicated in last year’s report, not all had appreciated the importance of this equipment. There was an immediate and enthusiastic response to your letter of January 16. There are now 220 phonographs, 4,112 discs (8,194 records) of the 4J-minute speech records and 442 Song discs in the hands of the publishers. The records are in English, Afrikaans, German and Hollandish. Additional phonographs are now on order, and we hope that every publisher in the field will shortly be supplied with one and a supply of records. The playing of the phonograph record in the homes has enabled us to establish much closer contact with the people. Reports from every part of the field indicate that the records are breaking down prejudice, uncovering Satan’s lies and helping the people of good will to appreciate the great issue. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> studies have been formed at every center, and the increase in the number of publishers is due largely to the effective witness now being given by means of the phonograph coupled with thorough and efficient organization of the back-call work. The Lord, of course, is the One who is gathering the people of good will to his organization, but it is a great privilege for us to do our part in putting forth the necessary effort to contact such ones and then m canng for the interest after it has been aroused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Cars and Transcription Machines</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are five sound cars in constant use. Two pioneer brethren travel in each van. Thousands of miles have been covered during the past twelve months and pioneers report that, when visiting territory previously covered by Sound Equipment No. 3, the earlier visit of the sound car and all that it stands for is still green in the memory of the people. In addition to the five vans, Sound Equipment No. 3 is attached to seven company cars, and these perform good service in the territory allocated to the companies who operate them. Supplementing the witness given by the sound cars, we have 12 transcription machines in action in various parts of the country. Eleven of these are owned and operated by companies, and two pioneer sisters have made good use of the twelfth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Campaigns</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The special campaign periods were seasons of great joy and blessing to all who participated therein. A very considerable number of the brethren live on farms and m small dorps, and they do not have a sufficiency of territory to keep them busy week by week. By careful planning of their affairs practically all the publishers can manage to have some share in these special efforts, and forty-three percent of the total literature distributed in the Union was placed during those campaigns The following extract from a letter received at the office is typical of many and gives some indication of the extraordinary effort made by publishers to enable them to enjoy some part in the campaign: &quot;We left for Nylstrdom at 5: 00 a.m. and assembled together for service instructions and to supply the brethren with campaign literature. After asking the Lord’s blessing, we got off just before 9: 00 a.m. into the field service. We were three cars carrying six brethren, and one horse buggy with two other brethren. We combed the surrounding precincts for a radius of approximately 20 miles, traveling jointly 648 miles, of which 312 miles were traveled to and from Nylstroom, while the rest was covered in the house-to-house work. What an encouraging time we spent in Jehovah’s service these two days! On the evening of the first day we met again to relate field experiences and to hear a few records by Brother Butherford. In the two days we visited approximately 140 homes, and, as you will see from the figures, we were privileged to leave literature in 80 homes. The gramophones gave us excellent results, and Jehovah’s rich blessing is most manifest on this mighty weapon in the remnant’s hands at this day. The farmers were simply delighted with the ‘Koninkryk’ message, and wo know they will receive much light from their study of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hylcdom.” </span><span class="font6">The report for the two days is as follows:</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Service conventions were arranged at Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban, and divisional campaigns at Pretoria and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Potgietersrust. A determined effort to give a good witness to the honor of the Lord’s name was made on each occasion, and we weie greatly refreshed and encouraged by partaking of the food provided by the Lord through his organization. One of the most successful transcription meetings yet had in this country was that at the Johannesburg convention. No press advertisements were used, and the advertising was done by leaflets, window cards, posters, banners, etc. There were several car parades through the heart of the city, and the signs and banners served to focus considerable attention on the Kingdom message. Three transcription machines were wired together to ensure good reception m all parts of the hall, and the 500 persons who assembled listened attentively to the lecture on &quot;Separating the Nations”. They showed their appreciation by joining heartily in the applause which follows the moving of the Resolution; availing themselves of the opportunity presented at the close of the meeting to obtain literature; and signing the cards requesting someone to call with the phonograph records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Nyasaland</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Solid progress has again been .made in Nyasaland. The veil of darkness is gradually being lifted from &quot;darkest Africa”, and the Kingdom message continues to bring enlightenment, comfort and hope to many in that land. During the past twelve months the work has been earned forward by approximately 1,319 brethren, divided into 48 company units In several districts there is not enough territory to keep the publishers busy, and the brethren work in relays. There has been a monthly average of 974 publishers, who have served 149,757 hours and placed 1,514 bound volumes and 19,146 booklets, with 20,514 obtainers. The total sound attendance was 7,548. The number of publishers and time spent in the field show a big increase over last year’s figures. Book distribution may appear low in comparison with time worked, but it should be borne in mind that the publishers have to cover long distances on foot. There are no &quot;streets” or &quot;blocks” such as we have m European cities. The huts and kraals are widely scattered, and the economic conditions amongst the native population are poor. A recent press report indicates that approximately 100,000 natives (heads of families) whose homes are in Nyasaland are at present in the Rhodesias and the Union earning the wherewithal to support their wives and families. The brother in the depot at Zomba, who is the only European witness in Nyasaland, reports on conditions m part as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Much difficulty has been experienced up in those parts (Northern Province) in getting the work running in an organized manner, but from the appearance of things today there is a change for the better. Ignorance has played a large part in retarding progress, but the regional work being done in those parts now is bearing fruit and it is hoped that conditions will improve. That is with special reference to the most northern part. Farther down along the shores of Lake Nyasa conditions are very fair and the truth fairly widely known, although there is much yet to be done in the way of educating the public. The Southern Province covers about two-thirds of the Protectoi ate, and operating in this area are the 33 remaining companies of brethren. In the larger portion of the province good progress has been made and a good witness given. The interest among the populace is steadily increasing, and the study meetings are proving of real benefit to many seekers. As a result many brethren are being encouraged to press the battle to the gate, setting a good example to their companions. The quiet behavior of Jehovah’s witnesses is proving the power of the Truth and the peace it brings, which fact even the authorities must recognize. On behalf of all brethren and well-wishers of the Society and its work, let me assure you of their sincere appreciation of all that is being done in this land that they may learn of Jehovah and of his boundless blessings stored up in his treasure-house for all who seek his praise and honor. The call to ‘Advertise, advertise the Kingdom, ye sons of the Most High God’ rings out still and with greater intensity than ever before, assuring us that at the head of Jehovah’s glorious organisation is his anointed King and Leader of the battle now being waged.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Northern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The opening of a depot in Northern Rhodesia has resulted in much good It has made possible a closer supervision of the work and provided the necessary opportunity to carry forward a real educational work amongst those who desire to serve Jehovah with clean hands and pure hearts. The peak number of publishers during the year was 1,081, and the monthly average 756. The total time spent in the witness work was 175,718 hours, and 914 bound volumes and 17,187 booklets were placed, in the hands of 16,487 persons. The sound attendance was 3,200. With your permission some six or seven of the unprohibited booklets were translated into Cmyanja and several into Chi-wemba during the year, and we are now eagerly awaiting supplies from head office. In the absence of any word to the contrary during the past twelve months we assume that the appeal in connection with the prohibited literature is still drifting in the direction of the Privy Council. The brother in the depot at Lusaka reports as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘‘The past twelve months have marked a steady progress which, due to its very nature, is not entirely reflected in the report of the witness work done. Before the depot was established many natives whose knowledge was limited or assumed, and whose actions were not prompted by a humble desire to honor Jehovah’s name, shared with the sincere ones in all their activities. Some of these selfish ones liked to adopt the ecclesiastical attitude of learned and important teachers, whereas others used their supposed knowledge for selfish puiposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The year under review, therefore, has been one of witnessing, separating and educating. The separation has been a difficult work, particularly in the isolated villages situated as far as 1,000 miles from the railway line, but very good progress has been made. In the villages, particularly, only a small proportion of the natives can read, and even then indifferently, generally speaking, and their languages vary considerably in different areas. There is therefore a real need for simple literature explaining the purpose of Jehovah to vindicate His name; the missions, as we might expect, have left the proselytes absolutely ignorant concerning the Kingdom and its establishment, and have warned them not to read the Society’s publications. Their efforts have been unavaihng, however, and some of our most active and understanding native pioneers have left Babylon for Zion. There is evidence to indicate that some of the missions, run by the Boman Catholic Church, have induced their boys to molest and beat Jehovah’s witnesses when they call on them at their homes. The placements amongst Africans have been small, due almost entirely to the fact that the Northern Bhodesia government has banned all but two of the Society’s available native pubheations; but we rejoice in the consistent effort put forth by many native witnesses in spite of the many difficulties under which they do their work, meeting opposition and walking hundreds of miles in rough, dry and dangerous country. The sincere ones are now becoming properly organized through correspondence from the depot and visits to it, as well the sending of pioneers who act as regional servants into the different provinces. Begular study and woikers’ meetings are being held each week; these are particularly necessary, as few boys can, by themselves, fully grasp the contents of a publication or even a long letter. We look forward, therefore, to the coming year’s activity with much greater confidence and assurance, as many of those who lacked the 'love of the truth’ have gone from us and those who remain really desire to ‘know, and believe, and understand’ the divine purpose and share in telling it to others. The Devil has done much to misrepresent the Society and its work, particularly as a result of the Beport of the Commission of Enquiry into the Copperbelt Disturbances and the influence of the religionists, but since last July a large number of responsible government officials, including the governor, have had the truth concerning this matter brought plainly to their attention. Some, as a result, have manifested kindness and consideration to Jehovah’s witnesses and dealt severely with those who have unlawfully hindered them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Southern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Contrary to the policy followed by the governments in surrounding territories, the government of Southern Rhodesia continues to obstruct the legitimate desire of the Society to establish a depot in that country. Representations were again made during the course of the year, to which the following reply was received from the Secretary, Department of Internal Affairs: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font6"> am desired by the Minister of Internal Affairs to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, applying on behalf of your Society to send European representatives to open a depot in this colony. In reply I am directed to inform you that the Government has considered your request that your Society be allowed to establish European control in this colony over the adherents of this Society. It is regretted, however, that the Government is not prepared, at the present time, to accede to your request.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Sedition Bill was promulgated on July 3, 1936, and a government notice under date of December 18, 1936, prohibited the importation of seven volumes and seven booklets published by the Society, on the grounds that they were “deemed to be seditious”. As far as we know, such publications are the only books banned under the Sedition Bill, which, of course, is corroborative proof that the Act was introduced by the religionists only to suppress the literature containing the message of God’s kingdom. The schedule of prohibited pubheations was submitted to Parliament for approval on March 24, 1937, by the Minister of Justice (the Hon. R. C. Tredgold) and his motion was agreed to without discussion. We should be much interested to know if all the members of the Legislative Assembly who agreed to the motion, without a single voice being raised in protest, had read the fourteen pubheations before agreeing to their being banned!!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On March 10, 1937, fourteen days before this action was taken by parliament, a letter of protest was sent to each member of the Legislative Assembly together with copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered.</span><span class="font6"> Their action, therefore, would appear to have been deliberate and not without knowledge; and the more knowledge, the greater the responsibility! At the same time copies of the letter of protest and one or other of these two booklets (15,000 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font6"> and 6,000 of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered)</span><span class="font6"> were posted to the 21,000 Euiopeans living in Southern Rhodesia whose names are published in the 1937 directory. As the total European population in the colony is 50,000, it will be seen that a very thorough and wide-spread witness was given. This work, and the expense entailed, was earned by European brethren living throughout the Union of South Africa. The Act makes provision for one who has literature seized under the Act to make application to the High Court for an order releasing such publications from arrest on the grounds that they are not seditious. A test case was duly arranged, and the hearing took place at the High Court, Bulawayo, on July 27-29, continuing for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2i</span><span class="font6"> days. The Society’s side was handled ably by counsel repiesenting us. Both the senior and junior barristers had made a diligent study of the 14 publications and, m addition to the legal aspect of the case, which was argued at some length, the contents of the literature and the nature and purpose of the Society’s work were fully outlined m a very convincing manner. At the conclusion of the hearing the judge intimated that his judgment would be reserved as he desired fiist to read the 14 publications. If a just judgment is given, there can only be one outcome, but, whatever the result, one is happy in the knowledge that by the Lord’s grace a good witness was given in the Court and also by means of the public press. The Bulawayo </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font6"> had a report on the case of 24 columns on the 28th, 1-J columns on the 29th, and 1 column on the 30th, and the full report was reproduced in the week-end issue of July 31. As that edition circulates throughout Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia, the matter would be brought to the attention of the majority of Europeans in both countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since posting the data contained in this report a cablegram has been received from South Africa reading as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“our application for return of literature </span><span class="font5">SEIZED UNDER SOUTHERN RHODESIAN SEDITION ACT ALLOWED WITH COSTS. MAGISTRATE GRANTED LEAVE APPEAL.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This means that the court has evidently seen that the act of prohibiting the distribution of the Society’s literature in Rhodesia has been without warrant. This will furnish a further opportunity for hearing the case on appeal, and, if it is the Lord’s will, the literature may be released and have even greater distribution than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are approximately 230 European and African witnesses at 24 different centers in Southern Rhodesia. During the past year they have served 31,388 hours in the witness work. That represents a considerably greater effort than what was accomplished the previous year. The introduction of the Sedition Act and the banning of certain publications has therefore increased the zeal of the brethren, who aie more determined than ever to be true and faithful witnesses and to give all in that land the opportunity of knowing about the righteous government of Jehovah God under Christ Jesus, soon to be fully established, and which will be administered justly in the interests of all mankind who love and obey the commands of the Supreme Euler of the universe. (Psalm 2) There were 5,007 obtainers of literature, who received 494 bound volumes and 4,873 booklets. The sound attendance was 2,354.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Portuguese East Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There has been a monthly average of 12 publishers, who have placed 90 volumes and 924 booklets, with 847 obtainers. Sound attendance totaled 302. Total time spent in the field service amounted to 5,709 hours. The Catholic religion is the state religion, and during the past year representatives of the Hierarchy have tried to suppress the Kingdom message. A European brother, formerly of South Africa, but who has been resident in P.E.A. for the past nine years, has been threatened with immediate deportation and the confiscation of his literature if he does not cease distributing the message. This threat was conveyed to him by the chief commissioner of police, and the reason advanced was that &quot;the books are against the Catholic religion ’ ’. A petition has been submitted to the governor-general, calling upon him to veto the police threat. The governor granted a personal interview, and the decision is now awaited with interest. The brother, although he has family obligations, is determined to stand firm and is ready to face deportation and possible loss of employment rather than to compromise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Helena</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are now 13 publishers on the small island of St. Helena, in the South Atlantic. They have encountered strong opposition from the religionists. The majority of the islanders are poverty-stricken, but a good witness has been given by means of two phonographs. Listeners numbered 1,534. There were 432 obtainers of literature, who received 500 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The activity of the small office at Cape Town was shown in the further fact that the office has received during the year 7,413 letters and dispatched 8,401 letters and, in addition thereto, 7,490 circular letters. The subscriptions for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> magazine (now </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation)</span><span class="font7"> have had a healthy increase. During the year more printing equipment was placed in the office, so that much of the printing is done locally, for the advertising of meetings. In addition to the work in the office the office force has averaged 20 hours a month in the field service, making a total of 1,243 hours, an increase over last year’s activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s gracious provision of all things needful is greatly appreciated. The food placed on the Lord’s table is completely satisfying and eneigizes us for the work on hand. Our hearts lejoice when we read of the stirring events at the bigger centers m America and Europe, and we especially appreciate the fidelity of those brethren who are standing for their lives and for the honor of Jehovah’s name where the conflict is the fiercest, in Central Europe, and elsewhere. The brethren in this part of the earth continue to stand “shoulder to shoulder’’. They appreciate their relationship to the Most High and to one another. Whether of the anointed or of the great multitude, all realize that absolute obedience, loyalty and faithfulness are required of all. We continue daily to uphold you before the Lord, and wish to assure you that we are wholeheartedly with you in the great ‘ ‘ Perazim ’ ’ fight now being waged. We appreciate your bold lead and all your labors for his name’s sake, and look forward to that day, which is drawing ever nearer, when Jehovah will perform his “strange act’’ and completely vindicate his name before all creation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>AFRICA (West)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The witness work to the kingdom of Jehovah God is done in West Africa chiefly amongst the poorer classes. The high and lofty, yielding to the cruel influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, not only refuse to hear the truth but put themselves in opposition to the truth concerning God’s kingdom. The Devil has used his instruments there during the fiscal year and has retarded to some degree the work of witnessing, but, in the face of all of this, a greater witness has been given than the year previous. From the Society’s local servant at that place, who makes report to this office, the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We remarked in last year’s report to you that we had determined to put in more hours this year and, if possible, to triple last year’s output of books and booklets. We therefore planned to make a record drive on the Gold Coast with the sbund car, beg</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:line-through;">innin</span><span class="font6">g with the “Battle Shout” period, October 3-11, 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An order was sent to Brooklyn for 20,000 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font6"> booklets and 20,000 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font6"> booklets, to be landed on the Gold Coast. On the first of October we left Lagos by boat with sound car and 40 cartons of books and booklets to arrive in Aecia a day before the period. On the steamer’s arrival at Accra the sound car and 40 cartons went ashore before the immigration officer arrived on board. When said officer arrived, all foreign passengers appeared before him with their passports. I handed m mine, was told to wait until he was through with the passengers, after winch I was called and informed that I would not be permitted to land on the Gold Coast. When the brethren ashore, who were expecting me, heard of it, they called on the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font6">igration officer with sixty pounds cash as a deposit against my landing, but that was refused On the following day I was placed aboard another boat with car and baggage back to Lagos, and was compelled to pay the return trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Later on we were informed that the so-called “Christian Council” there had decided that the Society’s representative be debarred from further activities on the Gold Coast, because of the response given to </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6"> a year ago by the people and the daily papers, when Judge Rutherford’s lectures were delivered to a crowded house of approximately 2,000 souls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A month later we shipped 19 cartons of books and booklets to Accra. The customs authorities banned them. A few weeks later 50 cartons of the booklets ordered for arrived, and they too were banned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A petition was forwarded to the governor for the release of the literature, but we were informed that he could not reverse the order of the customs authorities. Later the 69 cartons were burnt to ashes. But you will see that did not deter the determination of the publishers to press the battle with the enemy. I know you will be glad to hear that up to date we have succeeded in getting in over 100 eartons of books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few of the pioneers encountered much hardship in getting in the literature through the different avenues on the French border into the Gold Coast. But after they got in they were more than compensated by the ready response of the people to receive the literature banned by the authorities. Brother Adediji, our company servant, was sent by this office to assist in getting in the books, and also in the service work. He is still there and, from reports, doing well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonograph</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The phonograph campaign is doing well; same is much appreciated by the people who can understand the English language. If the records were in Yoruba and a few other dialects much would be accomplished. The publishers do enjoy the house-to-house witnessing with the phonographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Car</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For getting the literature into the hands of the people, especially the booklets, the sound car has no equal in West Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During a six-week tour after the “Faithful Warrior’’ testimony period covering 2,345 miles, we delivered 308 sound-car lectures, got out 200 bound books, and over 16,900 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We had two conventions this year, one in Umuahia, a distance of over 530 miles from Lagos, and the other at Ijebu Ode, 100 miles off. At the conventions a goodly number of Jonadabs came forward and symbolized their consecration, swelling the fold of the “other sheep’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The booklets </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font6"> have no equal; they put to silence all who have read them. They are having a steady flow. When the Yoruba and other translations arrive, the hiding place will be overflowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pioneers are trekking the country parts far into the woods with speaking trumpets, and it is surprising to note on their report cards the hundreds of booklets especially they are getting out by means of the trumpets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In spite of the opposition from all quarters of the Devil’s army we exceeded last year’s output of books and booklets by 97,074. The pioneer rank is on the increase, the auxiliary too, and also the company workers. We give praise to Jehovah for the inestimable privileges that are ours at this juncture. —Obadiah 1.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Society’s work for the Argentine Republic is directed from Buenos Aires. In that country the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has been exceedingly active during the past year and lias gained great power. That means that the Fascists now have the upper hand in the government, because the Catholics and the Fascists are one and the same. It is reported that the political powers that rule go to mass in the early morning, and then go to their offices and manipulate their schemes which have become very oppressive to the people. The conditions are such that the people are browbeaten and depressed. Amidst opposition, however, the Lord’s faithful witnesses, small in number but strong in faith and the power of the Lord, have pushed forward in the work. Up to the present time the radio has been used with good results. The work from this branch includes Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and the summary of the work there is appended hereto:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The remnant and the Jonadabs everywhere, reading the report of the work in Australia and associated territory, the work of which is directed from Sydney, will be greatly encouraged and will rejoice with our companions in that part of the earth. All of the faithful will have a deeper appreciation of the apostle’s inspired words: “We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.’’ Fully appreciating the fact that they are witnesses for and marching toward that righteous government, all of Jehovah’s faithful ones together will joyfully sing, “We glory in tribulations, ’ ’ because such are evidence from the Lord that the favor of the Most High is with them. The hope of all such faithful ones is centered in the Kingdom, and that hope ‘maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is in their hearts’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The earnest devotion of Jehovah’s witnesses and companions in Australia who carry the Kingdom message to the people has greatly aroused the wicked Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the Devil’s chief agents. The Kingdom message exposes the devilish racket of that cruel instrument of Satan, and the result is the united effort on the part of religionists in the countries here embraced to prohibit the publication of the message of the kingdom of God under Christ. God’s people know no national lines, but in every part of the earth they are truly companions engaged in the common and righteous cause. The net result of the work directed from Sydney, Australia, shows a healthy increase. The literature containing the Kingdom message, to the number of 1,407,382 volumes, has been placed in the hands of the people during the fiscal year, and this is an increase of 100,000 over that of the previous year. The enemy’s opposition has served to increase the zeal and activity of God’s faithful witnesses. Note the extracts from the representative of the Society’s office at Sydney:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s blessing on the witness work in Australasia during the fiscal year 1936-37 is aptly described by the prophet Malachi in quoting the Lord’s promise to open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that there be not room enough to receive it. From every corner of the vast field under the supervision of this branch reports have come, indicating the progress of the work and its effect on both the “sheep” and the “goat” classes. With the increase in intensity of the witness has come the increase in bitter opposition by the enemy, but, contrary to their expectations, this gives us even greater encouragement to “nse up against her m battle” with all of our equipment. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> has suggested that the Roman Hierarchy would attack Britain through her colonies, and during the year we have watched with interest the tentacles of tins beastly organization entwining themselves around this country. Honest people, however, are not deceived, and every day more and more are inquiring the way to Zion and expressing their disgust at the attempts by these racketeers to stop the spread of the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> articles of late have helped the publishers to realize more than ever their responsibilities in connection with the locating of the “other sheep”, and, manifesting zeal and determination peculiar to the Lord’s house, they have exceeded by 10,000 hours the time spent in the field last year. Correspondingly, the amount of literature has increased by 100,000, making the total for the year 1,407,382.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The highest number of pioneers enrolled for any one month was during October, when 194 were engaged m this branch of the service; and although the average per month (175) is somewhat below that, the biggest percentage of the work has been done by this noble little band. In their caravans, cars, trucks and other nondescript vehicles they have covered hundreds of thousands of miles throughout Australia, New Zealand and the hundreds of islands m this section, contending the while with rough roads, adverse weather conditions, and often short of food and shelter. Their lot, however, is a happy and privileged one, and seldom does a pioneer leave the service unless compelled by circumstances so to do. During the year the pioneers averaged 100.5 hours in the field monthly, which of itself speaks volumes for those engaged in this branch of the Lord’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Beginning their long journey in March, 1936, two pioneers set out m a truck to travel around Australia witnessing particularly to the people in the central, northwestern and western areas of this vast continent. The distance traveled was 12,250 miles, and it took just one year and five days to complete the round trip. En route from Strathfield they passed through Broken Hill, Alice Springs, Darwin, Wyndham, Broome, Perth, Adelaide, and returned to Strathfield bright and happy and having given a good witness to people in these otherwise inaccessible parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a result of their visit there is now a regular publisher working at Katharine, in the very heart of the continent, and many other persons of good will were contacted. In these parts the homes are often over a hundred miles apart, and on one occasion the truck m which they were traveling broke down 70 miles from the nearest inhabitant and 50 miles from the nearest water-hole. While one of the boys rode on his bike to the airport, where he waited for a part from Sydney, the other brother stayed with the truck for three weeks on very short rations. On a trip such as this other travelers take hundreds of pounds’ worth of equipment, whereas these two boys just took the bare necessities with them, and it is quite apparent that were it not for the Lord’s blessing upon them they would never have got through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Auxiliaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The maximum number of auxiliaries enrolled was 110 during March, and throughout the year the average has been 104. These brethren, unable to devote all of their time to the service, have averaged for the twelve months 46 hours per month in the field, and being 2 hours each per month better than last year is a commendable effort. We hope to see more company publishers join the auxiliary ranks this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Companies and Isolated Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As is to be expected, the number of company publishers actively engaged in publishing the name of Jehovah has also increased, the highest number reporting for one month being 1,516, and the average over twelve months, 1,127. Average hours per month for each of these publishers is 12.4, and, while it is below the quota of 15 hours per month, it must be remembered that many of these brethren are so isolated that there is no town within miles of them, and thus their work is limited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Jonadabs</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many people of good will have participated in the field work this year m each of the branches of service mentioned above, and have greatly appreciated, as did the anointed also, the articles ‘ ‘ Understanding ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ Companions ’ ’ in recent </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers.</span><span class="font6"> The relationship of these two classes to each other and to Almighty God is now clearly seen, and this revelation makes for one grand harmonious organization intent on publishing Jehovah’s name throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Machines</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It would be difficult to imagine our work today without the use of sound machines. Both the No. 3 sound-car equipment and the transcription machines have been used to advantage in street work, factories, beaches, parks, etc., and as the machines have such long range it is difficult to accurately report on the results of the programs given. In many country towns vicious opposition by the local priests and clergy has been shown to the sound work, probably due to the fact that while they can induce a proportion of their flocks to close the door when a witness calls, the lectures from the sound machines penetrate every corner of the territory. Their action has served only to confirm any doubts in the minds of honest people regarding the sincerity o‘f these parasites, and in the meantime said parasites get madder than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year 15 sound cars and 115 portable transcription machines have been operating very effectively in nearly every country of our territory. Comparing this with last year, we find that there are now 40 more of these machines in the field than previously. The total number of listeners to both sound machine and phonograph lectures amounts to 582,334, which is 28,603 in excess of last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Perhaps the most outstanding incident of the year relative to sound work was at Tamworth in October, 1936. The local radio station had been broadcasting Watch Tower programs for some time, and many people were enjoying the refreshing Bible talks over the air each week. It was not long, however, before the religionists sent deputations to the management demanding the discontinuance of the lectures, whereupon the station decided tp censor the lectures before playing them. This, of course, we did not tolerate for one moment, and advised them to broadcast the lectures in their proper sequence or not at all. The result was that the contract was broken and no further lectures have been broadcast from that station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A divisional campaign was arranged at Tamworth shortly thereafter, and publishers from all over the countryside, some from as far as 500 miles away, journeyed by night to Tamworth to participate in declaring the truth now denied the citizens of the town by radio. Literature to the amount of 1,018 pieces was distributed by 103 publishers, and a petition demanding that the station continue broadcasting Judge Rutherford’s talks was signed by 1,163 persons. The petition has been ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the Sunday evening four sound cars and a number of PTM’s were posted on private property at strategic positions on the outskirts of the town with the intention of presenting at the same time as it was being given in the Town Hall the lecture “Separating the Nations”. The lectures had been playing for some tune when the local inspector of police named Seery came tearing around to find the machines. He succeeded in locating two of them, but, as they were on private property, he could only try to intimidate the owners into canceling permission, and in this he was unsuccessful. In his uncontrollable rage he hit two of the boys and threw them out of a gate. The language he used was probably learnt in a parochial school! All present had a wonderful time, and since then a zealous little company of Jonadabs has been organized in the town, and so the work goes on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonograph Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the last twelve months, and particularly since Brother Rutherford’s letter of January 16, the phonograph work has increased beyond expectations. There are 825 of these machines being used in the field, the new hghtweight job being particularly popular. Even the elderly publishers are able to carry them, and some have two, so that they can loan one to newly interested persons. We are confident that in the year ahead every publisher will be equipped with a phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “Exposed” and “Religion and Christianity” series on the 12-inch discs have been a wonderful blessing, and in the short time we have had them many new ones have joined the ever increasing ranks of Jonadabs. The recent letter from Brother Rutherford instructing all publishers to use them in the homes of the people rather than in halls was gladly accepted, as it was found that for some reason we could not get </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">good attendance at these meetings. The people seem to feel more free to discuss these matters m their own homes than at </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">halL</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Back calls with the phonograph and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> studies have received special attention this year, and many of the publishers find that they have few spare evenings now, they having been taken up with back calls on interested ones. Eorms have been printed to aid in the organization of this work. Recently arrangements were made to press the recordings in Sydney, and this has proved to be most beneficial, as they are cheaper, there being no customs duty involved, and we can obtain supplies at short notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year the increase in opposition to the Kingdom work has been most apparent, the particular means used being that of mob action; and in several towns throughout the country priests, infuriated by the message exposing them to honest people, have organized these mobs for the purpose of intimidating and chasing out of town the witnesses. Eollowing instructions in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font6"> the pioneers, when such action is taken, leave the town for a while, returning there later to call at the people’s homes with the message. This method of opposition seems to apply more particularly to the sound cars and transcription machines in the streets, and we have had no record as yet of the brethren’s being attacked by mobs when going from door to door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another method used to hinder our work has been that of canceling hall engagements. This, too, has been worked overtime by the priests, but although they frequently succeed in intimidating hall owners to cancel the engagement just before the lecture, a great witness is given against them, and many people have noted the devilish spirit manifested by these men. The “Communist” bogey is also used here as m other countries to veil the actions of the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As has been the case in America, during the year several radio stations ceased broadcasting the programs, mostly due to threats of boycott, and lack of backbone on the part of their owners. The actual number refusing to longer take these lectures is 21 stations, leaving only 13 stations on the list. The number of these accepting the offer to broadcast the &quot;Exposed” series to date is only 4. The Hierarchy controls radio in Australia as elsewhere. For the first time m many years a station in New Zealand now sends out over the air the Kingdom message, and from the number of letters received it is quite apparent that many people appreciate it. Four years ago the Government ordered station 5KA Adelaide to cease broadcasting the lectures of Judge Rutherford, but now we are happy to say that they have advised us that they may continue. They realise that we will not compromise with them and, perhaps more important, that they are making themselves mighty unpopular by attempting to throttle free speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We quote from a booklet issued by a Catholic Society in Sydney as follows: &quot;If the recorded voice of the Russellite prophet is heard from any radio station in Australia, letters of protest should at once be sent to that station. Some action will have to be taken sooner or later; and it is better taken now, before the damage is greater than it alieady is.” Thus it is seen that while the author of the above a</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">dmi</span><span class="font6">ts that our work is having a tremendous effect upon the people, he is exhorting all Catholics to bitterly oppose it; but, as someone has said, one might as well take a broom and attempt to sweep back the Atlantic ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Islands</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the table at the end of this report it will be noticed that a valiant effort lias been put forth by a handful of publishers to magnify Jehovah’s name amongst the tee</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font6">g millions in the Far East. Small companies are springing up everywhere, and countries not heretofore witnessed to have been visited. The base of operations for Malaya, Siam, Indo-China, Borneo, Celebes, Java, Sumatra, Hong Kong and other places in the section is at Singapore, where an office is maintained. There is now an average of 30 publishers reporting each month in these countries, and of these 15 are pioneers. Witnessing m these parts is somewhat different from that on the m</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ainl</span><span class="font6">and, as frequently one has to carry books in six or more languages and it is considered advantageous to be able to speak that many. The hours of work are different also and no work is done between noon and three o’clock. Europeans all retire at midday to avoid the terrific heat. Time is redeemed, however, by working later in the evenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The five pioneers on. the Society’s ketch ‘ ‘ Lightbearer ’ ’ have had many wonderful and varied experiences on their trip around Borneo, Celebes and neighboring countries, and report on their travels as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The Hierarchy makes itself felt here too, but instead of doing the work haim, their <sup>1</sup> wlute-frocked woe-men’ have been the means of greatly advertising the Kingdom gospel. They ride around their flocks on ladies’ bicycles, telling the people to look out for the ship and to have notlung to do with the books. Often they wire the town ahead of us to beware, with the result that many people out of sheer curiosity go out of their way to see and speak to these ‘fanatics’ who have come so far in such a small ship and t-o read the books which have made the priests so very angry. Thus we often find the people ready, either to take the literature at once or to turn us away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘ ‘ Another scheme is to use the Merchant-Shipping Act in trying to prevent our books from coming into a port closed to trading. At Semarinda, Borneo, we were told that, as it was a closed port, we could land on condition that we took no books with us. After acquainting the harbormaster with the nature of our work he agreed to wire his head office on the matter. Some time later he advised that Semarinda was now an open port and that we could get on with our work. He was interested and took a set of books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The postmaster, who is also the independent minister here, told us that the wires had certainly been running hot and that as a result we had given the town a place on the map after alL He told us that the dominie from Balak Papan had been there and warned him against our message, saying that we were the ‘Anti-Christ’. After some discussion he invited us to deliver lectures in his church on the Sunday and said that he wanted all the people in Semarinda to have the books. ‘I will tell my people, ’ he said, ‘ that these books are fine and that the dominie is a liar.’ A number of lectuies were presented in the church on the Sunday, and many showed real interest in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The captain of the Dutch ship ‘Taradja’ took a full set of books in English because, he said, ‘if the power behind your work is strong enough to move the Dutch Government to open a closed port, then there must be something in it.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘ ‘ We have had many evidences of the Lord's blessing on our efforts to serve him, and wish to thank Brother Rutherford for his ministry and the comforting truths as they come to us from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower;</span><span class="font6"> to express our gratitude for the administration through the various branch offices, thus making it possible for us as a unit in this vast organization to be more efficient in our service to the Most High God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Slam</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the report of the brethren working in Siam we quote as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Since July, 1936, when the first pioneer arrived here, the work in Siam has been steadily earned on, and for the last four months of the year two brethren have been witnessing here. Only a very few of the Siamese are nominal Christians, the great majority being followers of the Buddhist religion, which is very effectively employed to keep the people in the dark so far as a knowledge of Jehovah is concerned. Though many thousands of them were witnessed to during the year, not one Siamese has manifested more than casual interest in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“There are, however, a great many Chinese in the country, filling practically every important political and commercial position, and a considerable amount of interest has been displayed by these people. Roughly speaking, about half the total output of literature was in the Chinese language. In considering the figures for this country it must be kept in mind that these pioneers woiked entnely without literature in the language of the country, and that they were without any practical knowledge of either Siamese or Chinese languages. With those aids it is quite probable that interested persons among the natives of the country would be found to take some part in the work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">French Indo-China</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two pioneers working in French Indo-China report as follows: “Several years ago an attempt was made to open up the work here, but Customs authorities refused to allow the literature into the country. Toward the end of 1936 another attempt was made, however, and since that time the Lord’s blessing has been manifested on our efforts to take the Kingdom message to the inhabitants of this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“French Indo-China consists of the French colony CochinChina and the protectorates of Cambodia, Annam, Laos and Tongkin. During the year most of our work was done in CochinChina, but an attempt was also made to begin in Cambodia. After about a week’s work in the capital, we were informed by the police that as the country was a Buddhist kingdom no religious work was permitted except by special authority of the king. Referring the matter to him, the king and his counselors decided against granting us this permission. As it was, most of the Europeans in the capital were witnessed to before we were stopped. The Roman Catholic church has permission to operate its fraud upon the people of Cambodia, and it is more than likely that they were responsible for the refusal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In the near future an attempt will be made to extend the work into Annam, Laos and Tongkin, and while it is possible that similar difficulties will be encountered in these protectorates, we are sure that Jehovah will cause them to be overcome in His own good time and way. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Java</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people of Java have had good opportunity to hear the life-giving message of truth, and during the year the little army over there has had quite a few new recruits. Due to the climatic conditions and high percentage of humidity Europeans find the woik rather strenuous, but with the joy of the Lord as their strength our brethren there are having a truly wonderful time. While this report is being written we have to hand advice that one pioneer placed over 3,200 books and booklets for the month of August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Malaya</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Malaya small companies have been organized in different parts of the land and the work has shown a substantial increase. The Catholic paper published at Singapore frequently prints lying articles about us, hoping thereby to discredit our work in the eyes of the “Catholic population”. Despite these vicious attacks the witness work goes grandly on and the stool pigeons of Mr. Hatti might just as well get used to it that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In last year’s report mention was made of a cinema in Singapore used once each week to present the lectures during intermission. The owner, a man of good will, now permits the local company to use the theater equipment twice each week for this purpose and also to have a book display at the entrance. No charge is made for the service, and a good witness is being given to hundreds of people by this means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FIJI</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">About the beginning of the year 1936-37 the colonial government of Uji imposed a ban on the literature and prohibited its entry into the colony. There is abundant evidence of the Hierarchy’s inflpence behind this move, but, as usual, it would be difficult to obtain proof. It is significant, however, that at the same time and in similar circumstances a ban was imposed on the literature in the British West Indies. The governors were being changed, the one from Eiji taking over the office m Trinidad. There is a Convent of St. Joseph de Cluny in each place, and shortly after the governor was installed at Trinidad the Eijian newspaper carried a lengthy letter from him eulogizing the convent and Roman system in Eiji. The acting governor in each place had been induced to impose the ban on the literature. This was done in Eiji on the advice of the governor that vacated the office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The priests, many of whom are foreigners, are loud in thoir denunciation of Jehovah’s witnesses as Communists, and, conscious of their power, they continue to oppose the entry of the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year a sound car was taken to Fiji and operated for about six months on the island of Viti Levu, the largest island of the group. The message was greatly appreciated by the Fijians, who are a noble race and who would gladly embrace the truth were they free to do so. As a result of the work done a goodly number have taken an active interest in the truth and will continue to proclaim this gospel of the Kingdom. A pioneer brother has been on the island of Vanua Levu, next in size to Viti Levu, and has, with the aid of a boat, managed to visit most of the villages there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">House-to-house work cannot be done in Fiji as in other places, but 1,751 pieces of literature were distubuted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New Zealand</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this land the faithful anointed and their companions, who are increasing in number, have been busily engaged during the year in making known the judgments of Jehovah, and have played their part in sending forth the hail which is exposing the enemy and breaking down his refuge. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Much opposition has been encountered, and there is a determined effort on the part of the Hierarchy to induce the authorities to impose a ban on the literature. &quot;Catholic Action” was responsible for a mob seeking to cause trouble in one of the country towns in Australia, and, although the mob did not number more than 150, the Catholic papers in New Zealand reported it as four or five hundred and endeavored to lay the blame for the disturbance of the peace on Jehovah’s witnesses. They urge upon the government to take action lest such disturbances occur in New Zealand. Thus they stir up strife and then use it as a lever to overthrow the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The faithful little band of pioneers in New Zealand continues actively to press on and is responsible for the message’s being taken to the people in the back country as well as doing their share to assist their brethren in the more thickly populated areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The light phonographs are proving a wonderful help in the work, and, as the brethren are beco</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font6">g more accustomed to the use of this means of bieakmg down opposition, they are getting on friendly terms with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One radio station has been bioadcasting for a part of the year, but the Hierarchy has brought such pressure to bear against it that it is doubtful if it will be able to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Tonga</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work in the kingdom of Tonga is going ahead, and we hope that much will be accomplished there in the next year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One brother who is able to do the translating for us has been very active and reports much interest in the publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Tongan people have a great regard for the Scriptures and only require to have the truth brought to their attention for them to give it consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Hierarchy, by a subtle move, has gained a footing in this group of islands and is working hard to take the lead there as m other places under the control of Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Hong Kong</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year two pioneers visited this island and did very good work, leaving with the people over four thousand pieces of literature. Now that the war is raging in China, it may be necessary for these pioneers to return to the more peaceful South and continue the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The members of the Bethel family at Strathfield appreciate the privilege which is theirs, and although there is a great demand on their time in order to cope with the increase in the work at the office and home, they manage to devote some time to the field service. During the special periods brethren have visited the companies within a reasonable distance of Bethel, and this has resulted in a closer unity between the brethren in the country districts and those at Bethel. The family desire to thank you, Brother Rutherford, for making it possible for them to thus engage in the service and also for the means to hand for making known the message of the Kingdom. They are determined to stand shoulder to shoulder with you as you “rise up against her in battle’’, and will do all in their power to proclaim the judgments written and the certainty of victory for Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year the witnesses in that land have responded earnestly and put forth united and faithful effort at the special testimony periods,&quot;more than 1,400 persons engaging in the witness work at these testimony periods, and have devoted a total of 126,288 hours to the work, placing literature in the hands of 171,431 persons. It is a real joy to report the result of the work in that land, upon which the Lord has manifestly put his approval and blessing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The heart of every earnest child of God is thrilled when learning of the zeal of the witnesses who work</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">in that part of the earth where there is much opposition and where there is great handicap to the work. Some of these faithful publishers, like the early Christians, sleep on the ground, in the open, with their books for a pillow, and refresh their bodies with the plainest kind of food, and then rise up early to go forward to proclaim this gospel of the Kingdom. They trudge about the country, bearing the fruits of the righteous government before the people and greatly rejoice that they are in the favor of God and the King, whose righteous rule will bring peace and prosperity to suffering humanity. They praise and serve the Most High. Praise God that the day of deliverance is at hand, and the time near for the vindication of his holy name! This </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font7"> attempts to serve as a medium of communication between the Lord’s children in different parts of the earth who otherwise cannot communicate with each other directly. The extracts from the annual report of the Society’s representative at Sao Paulo, Brazil, will be read with keenest interest, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah has multiplied his blessings upon his faithful people in this great land, and it is with thanksgiving to him that the following rSsumd of the year’s work is submitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Office. Directed by the president of the Society from the headquarters m Brooklyn, the brethren in the office in Sao Paulo transmit instructions to the field, receive and dispatch the literature, prepare the Portuguese translations, publish the Portuguese </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> print the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A Luz da Verdade</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informante </span><span class="font6">each month, in addition to testimony cards and radio programs, and all the members of the household, now 6 in number, take their part in the field witness, with the sound car, and from house to house with phonographs and literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Field Publishers. The publishers of the Kingdom message in Brazil are still very few in number, although they have increased from an average of 53, in 1936, to an average of 95, this year. Some who show the Jonadab spirit have taken their stand with the anointed and are carrying forward the witness work, while some who have long claimed to serve Jehovah have withdrawn. In various parts of Brazil, especially in the interior of this state, are study groups of from 10 to 30; not many of these yet see their privilege of participating in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the close of the last fiscal year there were 4 active groups. At the close of this year there are 5 organized companies, two smaller groups reporting regularly, and about 10 isolated brethren witnessing the best they can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers. The pioneers have averaged 16 per month, and the year closes with 16 in the field. These faithful brethren are bearing the brunt of Satan’s blows and, while feeling, peihaps more than others, the force of the enemy’s thrusts, are reporting great joy in the service of the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Some of the most earnest and diligent of the pioneers woik under the handicap of not being able to speak Portuguese, but this does not at all deter them. Armed with testimony card, phonograph, literature and radio programs, they go forth, and, true to his promise, Jehovah abundantly blesses their efforts, and they are placing considerable literature in the hands of the people. In the interior where, out from the small towns, there are many colonies, each of a different nationality, the pioneers sometimes find it necessary to stay over night, and, after a day’s work in the cause of the Master, they sleep on the ground with their books for a pillow, and rise the next morning to proceed with the work of telling the life-giving message to those who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Auxiliaries. In addition to the pioneers, 6 brethren who cannot devote all their time, but who witness more than 50 hours each month, are enrolled as auxiliaries. Five of these are in the city of Bio de Janeiro.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Portuguese Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord has increased our supply of literature in Portuguese. With the faithful co-operation of the brethren in Brooklyn, the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> and 4 new booklets were added during the year and 6 booklets were reprinted, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font6"> being printed for the first tune in Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Publications in Brazil</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Watchtower. In March, 1937, was resumed publication of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> in Portuguese. Issued monthly, it contains the leading article of the English </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> translated into Portuguese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Luz da Verdade, also monthly, has from one to three of the 5-minute recorded lectures of Brother Eutherford and rims, as a series, such articles from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> as “The Hierarchy’s War in Spam’’, “The Jesuit-Fascist Bevolt,’’ also short articles on health, “Aluminum,’’ “Vaccination,” with matters of local interest. Each month extra copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A Luz da Verdade</span><span class="font6"> are furnished to the pioneers to use for free literature for those who cannot contribute. There were on hand some thousands of copies of older </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers.</span><span class="font6"> These have been stamped with the Society’s present address and distributed gratis to the people. Some have read them and write or call for more literature. One man read one of these old </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font6"> and immediately came in to the office from a near-by town, said he recognized this as the truth and asked for a study in Iiis home for his family and friends. The Sao Paulo company is arranging for a study for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Informants, published monthly, carries the leading points of the Enghsh </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font6"> and local instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Radio programs to the number of 60,900 have been printed and distributed. These little up-to-date folders with their interesting questions and description of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> have placed many a copy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> as well as other literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Headquarters field service, included in the above report with company publishers, was the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Av. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sound</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sound Car. Our one sound car was put into operation early in March and, except for three days of witnessing in Rao de Janeiro and three days in Curitiba, has been used every week in the parks, residence districts and factories in and around the city of Sao Paulo. A regular announced program is given at the leper colony of Pirapitingui, 60 miles northwest of Sao Paulo. These monthly visits of the sound car have stimulated the brethren there to greater activity. They report that the attendance at their studies which they conduct every night in the week has increased from 8 to 20. They have now provided themselves with a phonograph and records with which they visit the hospitals, where many interested ones are bedridden and blind. Their latest letter expresses &quot;a thousand thanks for the phonograph. We are not able to find-words to express our joy </span><span class="font6">and the happiness which now reigns among us”. Perhaps only Jehovah knows what a great blessing it is to these, formerly isolated with a living death, now to be provided with the latest means not only of drinking the water of life themselves, but of having a share in offering the same to others. These brethren are arranging for a baptism next month when the sound ear visits the colony, and the car will assist by giving a program suitable to the occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Phonographs. Of the 35 phonographs in Brazil, 20 are already in the hands of the publishers. Those using them are reporting most enthusiastically that the phonographs help them to get a more respectful hearing and to place more literature with less effort than formerly; that while the territory is not covered so fast, the witness is more thorough. Some have hesitated to make use of the Spanish records, thinking that the Brazilians would object to Spanish, and so are waiting for Portuguese discs. Others, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ovei coming their own objections</span><span class="font6"> and proceeding with the work with the means the Lord has provided, not “leaning to their own understanding”, are delighted to find that the Brazilian people do not object to the Spanish records but express appreciation of them and say that they can understand them. One German pioneer, not able to speak Portuguese, working m strictly Brazilian territory, writes: <sup>1</sup> ‘ My only regret is that I did not get a phonograph sooner. I have played it in every home and store in this town. At first the people say, ‘I have no money’; but after hearing one or two records, they take at least a booklet. I do not cover the territory so fast as formerly, but place more literature, and I am not so tired at the end of the day.” Recently this pioneer visited a group of about thirty Jonadabs who were studying but not witnessing. He placed lus phonograph and records with them and ordered another for </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6">self. Result, they have decided to have a part in the witness work. We have a good supply of records on hand in English, Spanish and German, some in Italian, Hollandish, Polish and French, the new series in English and Spanish, and, as this report goes forward, we are receiving the new series of “Exposed” in Italian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Three conventions were held, one at Sao Paulo during the Memorial season the first week-end of the “Faithful Warrior” period, one at Rio de Janeiro the second week-end of the same period, and one at Curitiba during the first week in May. The brethren in Brazil are widely scattered, the means of travel by no means the best, and for the most part they are very poor, so the numbers attending were not large, but enthusiasm for the Kingdom service was manifested by those who did attend. The sound car assisted the house-to-house witnessing in the forenoons, and in the afternoons and evenings there were given transcription lectures and up-to-date </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> articles translated into the various languages, Portuguese, German and Hungarian; also there was conducted a study of the Organization </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font6"> and the brethren were shown the proper use of all equipment, transcription machine, phonograph, literature, testimony cards, radio programs, etc. A source of strength and comfort to the brethren at the headquarters is a full realization that we are part of the organization of Jehovah, backed by his illimitable power, directed by Christ Jesus through the Society, and not an isolated group depending on our own wisdom to direct anything. In these conventions, as well as in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informante</span><span class="font6"> and special letters sent out from time to time, an effort was made to help others of the Lord’s people to see this proper relationship to the organization of Jehovah and to one another in the organization, and, by the Lord’s grace, the brethren in Brazil generally are realizing this more and more, thus being better enabled to present a solid front to the enemy in this day of battle. At each convention some showed their stand on the Lord’s side by being immersed. An additional witness was given on the occasion of each immersion, the sound car broadcasting a program consisting of the “Baptism” record m English followed by a translation of the same in Portuguese spoken through the microphone. The immersion m each case took place in a river where people were accustomed to congregate ; thus many more heard the message than merely the brethren who were present. No words were spoken by the brother immersing; the sound car put on the recorded songs 101 and 299 in Polish and the brethien joined in singing them in various languages. It reminded one of how at Pentecost each one understood m his own language. Following is the report of the three assemblies:</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Sao Paulo, one of the most powerful stations of Brazil signed a contract to broadcast the 5-minute lectures three times a week in English, German and Spanish. Considerable interest was manifested; too much for the Hierarchy. The station was besieged with complaints, most of them from women, until the directors of the station, themselves Catholic, at the end of three months refused to broadcast further programs. Before the Devil could stop the broadcasting over Diffusora, however, a total of 45 programs were given, over a period of 15 weeks, from January 7 to April 20, 14 in English, 15 in German, and 16 in Spanish. Another small station in the interior broadcast a few lectures, but stopped them when the Catholic priest of the town objected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Enemy Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As is to be expected, there were attempts on the part of the adversary to interfere with the progress of the work. From within the ra</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">nks</span><span class="font6">, the Society’s former manager in Brazil, pretending for some months to work in harmony with the Society as a pioneer, was using his influence to try to disrupt the work, discourage the brethren and shake their confidence in the Society as the Lord’s organization. When he resigned from the pioneer service and went to publishing tracts &quot;of his own’’, his position of opposition was made manifest, so that he is no longer able to deceive those who are faithfully serving Jehovah. Many hindrances are encountered in our contact with officials in every effort made to advance the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A year of glorious privilege of service has closed, opening a new year of increased opportunities, increased knowledge, and correspondingly increased responsibility. The few besetments and </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">diffi</span><span class="font6">culties encountered are not to be compared with our blessings as, united more firmly than ever before, with a better understanding of Jehovah’s organization and our relation thereto, we in Brazil are j'oyfully facing the enemy, happy to realize that Jehovah, who 'teaches our hands to war, and our fingers to fight’, has provided for our equipment the same marvelous weapons of warfare as our brethren elsewhere are using.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Be assured, dear Brother Butherford, that the brethren here appreciate your tireless efforts and those of our brethren in Brooklyn to advance the Kingdom interests in Brazil, and it is with much pleasure that I here transmit to you the many messages of love and appreciation that are coming in to this office from time to time from all parts of Brazil. We love you dearly for your faithful service in the cause of vindicating Jehovah’s honorable name, and we hope that some day not too far distant your many duties elsewhere may spare you long enough for you to make a &quot;speaking acquaintance’’ with your South </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font6">erican brethren.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Kingdom witness work in the British Isles is directed from the Society’s office at London. For many years that land has been affected by religion, and many persons who forsook the denominations and turned their faces toward the Kingdom continued for a time to hold on to some religious practices; but in these latter days, when Jehovah has revealed so clearly his purpose, the remnant of his people in that land have broken away from religion and are now serving God in spirit and in truth. The Lord is gathering his “other sheep” out from amongst the British people as well as other nations, and these who make up the great multitude are showing their zeal and enthusiasm by participating in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the fiscal year the publishers of Jehovah’s kingdom message residing in the British Isles have placed in the hands of the people books to the number of 2,399,296, which is a decrease over the previous year. Generally, the British people are a reading people, and it is to be expected that most of those who have supplied themselves with these books explaining the Bible will read the same and thus gain a knowledge of and concerning God’s kingdom under Christ. The peoples of that nation, before the Lord, are being divided even as they are in other nations, and it is quite manifest that the “sheep” class are hurrying to the side of Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the southern part of Ireland, which is populated almost entirely by Itoman Catholics, there has been during the year and there continues to be much opposition to the publishers of the Kingdom message. Mobs have assaulted Jehovah’s witnesses at the instance of a Roman Catholic priest, and the public officials, being avowed religionists, have used their influence and power against those who bear the message of God’s kingdom to the people. In the face of this opposition and persecution some of Jehovah’s witnesses continue to go about and bear testimony to the truth in that part of the territory; but aside from southern Ireland there has not been a great amount of persecution in the British Isles. That there is a growing opposition to the kingdom of Christ in that land, there is not the slightest doubt, but that opposition has not yet reached its peak. In the colonies of the British Empire most of the officials are religionists, and particularly Roman Catholic men occupy the offices; and in such colonies there is a constant opposition to the Kingdom message, and persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. Here again the subtle political method of Satan is observed: The outlying territory is first attacked and organized against the kingdom of God, and then there is a movement toward the main part of the empire to crush everything that is in favor of God and his kingdom. Fascism is growing rapidly in the British Isles, and it seems more than reasonable to expect that Fascism will gain control of the nation before the final end. When Fascism does get the upper hand, then the persecution of the publishers of Jehovah’s kingdom will be far greater, and doubtless then there will be a still wider and more marked division amongst the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Amidst the gradual increase of opposition in the British Isles to God’s kingdom the zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses is made more manifest. The result of the witness work in that land during the fiscal year is proof of this fact. During the year it was the privilege of the president of the Society to visit England and meet with many of Jehovah’s witnesses, and it was observed that those children of the “King of glory” are greatly enthused and are doing all within their power to make known to others the kingdom of God and to publish the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A convention of Jehovah’s witnesses was arranged for Paris, and, although God’s people in England, as in other places, have only a small amount of this world’s goods, or money, twelve hundred of the British witnesses to the Lord’s kingdom went at their own expense to the Paris convention, and most of them there participated in the house-to-house witness work. That convention greatly enthused and encouraged the witnesses of the Lord in the land of Britain. Two special trains and a special boat were used to carry those witnesses to Paris. Although that was an unusually large number of persons to go from England to any kind of convention, not one word concerning this exodus was published in the English press. This is mentioned merely to show the studied policy of religionists to ignore Jehovah’s witnesses until such time as they are forced to recognize them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same method for carrying on the Kingdom work in other parts of the earth is used in the British Isles. Motor vans fitted with sound equipment and many phonographs were used during the year to preach this gospel of the Kingdom. This has proved one of the most effective ways of publishing the message concerning Jehovah’s purpose. During the year the London office supplied to the publishers 1,706 phonographs, which brings the total number of phonographs supplied by that office to the witnesses up to 2,800. Many others are now ordering phonographs, and the number in use is constantly on the increase. In addition to the phonographs, 4 sound cars are employed in the field service, all of which show good results. The following excerpts from the Society’s local servant are taken from his report to this office:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Assemblies</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The policy of arranging on an average not less than two assemblies for service per month during the year has been continued. All who are privileged to attend one of these gatherings are agreed that a great blessing is bestowed upon them. It assists in increasing unity of thought and action, and provides our companions with an occasion of happy fellowship. There were arranged 27 assemblies, mostly at week-ends, extending over two days. These were attended by 11,375 brethren, and this is an inciease of 2,823 over last year. Of these 9,304 took part in the witness service from house to house. Their service resulted in the placing of 58,435 pieces of literature, in 18,116 hours. No less than 37,601 obtainers took literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In almost every company of publishers the same faithful band have been going steadily on over the same territory regularly for at least ten years, and in many cases much longer. To these in particular the phonograph has come as a blessing from heaven; the Kingdom message given to the people without money and without price; all territory made new, and every record played a tribute of praise to Jehovah’s name. No wonder the joy of the Lord has entered into our hearts and renewed energy into our mortal bodies!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Compared with last year, the service units have increased by 5, to 369. The total number of publishers in these units is 5,590, and this shows an increase of 126. Of this total, 74 percent are regularly in the field week by week. The hours in the service, 489,131, is an increase of 67,930 hours, compared with last year. During the service hours, 4,082 publishers placed 1,547,321 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneer Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">British pioneers are working in several European countries. At the present another party of 12 is leaving to take up the work in Erance. This migrating has reduced the pioneer ranks during the year from 201 to 184. The monthly average is 174. The hours total 204,418, which is a decrease of 12,435 hours, compared with 1936. There is a decrease in the placements also, the total literature placed being 618,693 pieces, which is 120,677 less than last year. The obtainers were 533,967.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The auxiliaries number 118, of which 111 are engaged in the service, on a monthly average. They returned 66,912 hours, or a monthly average per auxiliary of 50.6, which is slightly better than 49.7 last year. Again there is a decrease in placements: 198,793 pieces of literature, to compare with 252,635, or 53,842 less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Transcription</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Most of the companies are now operating at least one transcription machine regularly in the field. One or two small companies, where the “elective elder” spirit controls, do not see the need or the privilege^ neither do they regard organization instructions. The number of machines has increased by 7, to 292. The 16-mch lecture records on loan to the companies increased by 163, to 11,169. It is difficult to obtain an accurate number who hear the lectures, but an estimated total is 1,002,077, and many of these took literature away with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonographs</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are now in regular service 2,800 phonographs supplied by the Society, and, of these, 1,706 were added this year. There aie also a large number in use which have been obtained from other sources. During the year the phonograph publishers have purchased 29,897 twelve-inch lecture records, making a grand total of 36,552 in the hands of the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Cars</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The four sound ears operated by the Society continue to give an effective witness. The London company bear the running cost of one of these. One of these has been working in North Ireland with excellent results as far as placements are concerned. One is m Scotland, and two are in England; one in the North, the other in the South.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Combined, they have traveled 23,128 miles. They have given 11,220 lectures, to an estimated attendance of 95,128 persons. The operators have also spent 9,499 hours witnessing and placed 12,017 bound books, 22,340 booklets, and 132 Bibles; a grand total of 34,489 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Regional Sound Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In place of the regional servants visiting the companies as heretofore, two regional sound servants have been appointed who visit the publishers and help and instruct them m operating transcription machines or phonographs. During the six months they have been commissioned they have visited 292 companies. At these visits they have led 222 phonograph witness groups and conducted 295 evening instruction meetings, with an attendance of 4,570 publishers. They have examined and repaired or adjusted 333 transcription machines and 305 phonographs In this service they have traveled 10,441 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Watchtower” and “The Golden Age”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> continues to be eagerly expected and carefully and prayerfully digested Readers have increased during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The information received by broadcast from you at the Columbus convention that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> magazine will in the future be renamed </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> brings satisfaction and joy to all who recognize the reason for the change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The arrangement by which you have made it possible for the Bethel family to engage in the field service is greatly appreciated. Amongst other reasons, the improved weather conditions this year have enabled us to put more hours in the door-to-door witness. Every member has a phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The average of twenty-three publishers in the field monthly is 100 percent. The total of hours, 5,576, is an increase of 2,108. As a result the placements show an increase of 1,012 pieces of literature, the total placed being 1,678 bound books and 13,332 booklets; a grand total of 15,010.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In addition to this field service, members of the family have the privilege of serving the companies within a radius of approximately 100 miles from London. Fourteen brothers share in this work, and have visited 201 companies, ministering to 3,825 brethren. On each occasion they have led the brethren in the service work in the morning. Eight brothers in. addition enjoy the privilege of leading </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">liwhes</span><span class="font6"> studies and “Exposed” series meetings weekly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Correspondence</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The number of letters received is 37,393. The outward mail also, naturally, is reduced: 40,323, to compare with 46,188; a decrease of 5,865. We have also redirected 8,359 pioneer letters. The small packets dispatched numbered 25,630; a reduction of 4,210, which is the result of the pioneers and others’ ordering m larger quantities, thus reducing labor and freight charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITISH GUIANA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A very limited number of workers who distribute the Kingdom message reside in British Guiana. These, although small in number, have put forth their endeavors during the year to publish the Kingdom message. The “West Bank brethren” mentioned in the following report have not yet reported to this office upon going to press. From the Society’s local servant at Georgetown, Demerara, British Guiana, the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are pleased to report an increase in the number of weekly workers as well as in the hours spent in service, and we hope to make further progress along this line next year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is also an increase in the number of gramophones m regular use, and we expect to soon receive a further supply of these valuable aids in witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A service convention was held on the West Bank of the Demerara river on 19th instant, coinciding with the Columbus convention! and this proved a real blessing to the brethren who attended from Georgetown and the near-by rural districts. Not many pieces of literature were placed, but this was due to the activity of our West Bank brethren, who are now organized for service, and who cover that territory regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We give below a summary of our figures for the period under review:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark115"><span class="font6">Companies organized for service</span></a></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s people in Canada have a vision of the kingdom under Christ Jesus, and by their efforts they have shown a determination to serve that kingdom faithfully regardless of all opposition. They have the joy of the Lord and recognize that such is their strength. They have, during the year, pressed forward with the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. Compared to the number of witnesses regularly in activity, the field is a vast one to cover. During the year the ‘‘other sheep”, or Jonadabs, have joined the remnant and increased the number of witnesses, and, in the face of opposition, they have pushed on with the work. They have been met with opposition in every place, and, instead of this dampening their zeal, it has increased their joy and earnest determination to continue on with the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year Satan has employed those who are of the Judas class to make every possible attempt to hinder the witness work, but that effort has fallen completely flat. The Judas element has printed and circulated false, vile and malicious statements concerning the Society and its servants. They have sent these publications throughout Canada and also to other parts of the earth. Not satisfied with publishing malicious falsehoods, they have resorted to fraud and deceit by mailing the same in envelopes on which they have printed the name of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, thus attempting to deceive those who receive them, and have tried to make it appear that such scurrilous literature is sent out by members of the Society. This was such a blundering manner of attempting to deceive the faithful witnesses of the Lord that it is laughable. Not one person has been deceived by this fraud. Those who are really devoted to Jehovah give no heed to the lying methods employed by the Devil and his agents to hinder the witness work concerning Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has been unusually active during the year, and in its nefarious work has been assisted by the afore-mentioned Judas class. The Hierarchy in portions of Canada, particularly in Quebec, as in other parts of the world, have organized and carried forward the Fascist movement and their cry is against “Communism”, using that as a camouflage to deceive the people and to induce the credulous ones to join in the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. The Hierarchy’s Fascist combine has caused laws to be enacted in Quebec leveled specifically against Communism, but, in fact, for the purpose of punishing those faithful men and women who bear testimony to the kingdom of God. The books and other literature explaining God’s kingdom have been seized by police officers in that land, who act under the direction of the aforementioned religionists, and they have abused and ill-treated Jehovah’s witnesses, arrested them and thrown them into prison, where they have been held on excessive bail and punished with fines and imprisonment wrongfully leveled against them. Some ask, “Why does God permit his faithful people to be thus maliciously and cruelly treated?” The Scriptural answer is that God permits the enemy to afflict his witnesses even as Jesus was afflicted, in order that such consecrated ones may have opportunity to prove their integrity to God under adverse conditions. Without persecution the opportunity could not be afforded for those faithful men and women prove their integrity toward God and to prove that Satan is a liar. By having such opportunity and faithfully standing by the Lord, these loyal and faithful ones have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Those devoted to the Lord clearly see and appreciate that every man, from Abel to this very day, who has given his allegiance and devotion to God and his kingdom has suffered persecution at the hands of the Devil and his religious agents. This fact encourages the people of God, because they now see the Kingdom at hand and are fully acquainted with the Devil’s methods, and they take this as further evidence that God’s favor is upon them, and therefore they courageously press forward with a greater determination than ever to serve the King and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The result of the work in Canada during the fiscal year has received the great blessing of Jehovah, and his people rejoice who have had part therein. These witnesses, the remnant and Jonadabs, have placed in the hands of the people during the fiscal year books to the number of 917,590. Their companions in every part of the earth will read the report of the work in Canada with a keen interest and much joy. The Society’s local servant has well covered the matter,- and from his report the following is taken, to wit :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work of Jehovah in Canada has been engaged in with joy and gratitude by the anointed and their companions during the past year. Jehovah has truly blessed our efforts, and increase has been made. The windows of heaven have been opened so that we have been unable to contain all that He has given. The richness of the food given by Jehovah through the pages of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> has been meat and drink, strengthening us continually for the work in hand, and giving an ever-increasing vision of the work immediately before us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year text, “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle,” has been ever before us. These tidings from the heavenly ambassador helped us to recognize the need for activity, and we have responded to the call. The end of the year sees us more m line as an army m solid phalanx, united and at peace, eager and attentive to the further commands of Jehovah by his anointed Son, through the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The enemies of Jehovah have attacked from both without and within. Continued attempts have been made to throw a scotch block before the wheels. We have pressed forward vigorously in the battle, and more opposition has been encountered. The most antagonistic part of Satan’s army has been “organized religion”, with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in the lead. From within, the “evil servant” has endeavored to hurt the interests of the Kingdom, taking up an axe in a feeble attempt to tear down the work of the Lord. The poisonous literature circulated amongst the brethren has not disturbed them, but enabled all to appreciate the activities of Satan, and has shown up the wickedness of those who forsake &quot;the law of [their] mother”. Such vile expressions which have been circulated have manifested the corrupt condition of a mind and heart at enmity with the Lord, for &quot;out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketli ”, and ‘ ‘ an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bnngeth forth evil things”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your presence with us in June, and the assembly of the brethren to Toronto to welcome you and let you know of our warmth and love for you, was clearly seen by the fact that one of the largest theaters in the city was packed to its full capacity as eaily as ten o’clock on Sunday morning. The unmistakable pleasure and joy all had m meeting you was an open rebuke to the slanderous assault of the &quot;evil servant”. In fact, such experiences have joined the brethren even closer to the organization. We were all blessed and strengthened through your fellowship, and thank the Lord for the visit. We praise and magnify the Lord for the discernment given. He warned us that such men would arise. He has graciously fed us and granted armor so that the wiles of the Devil would not seduce those who put their trust m Him. His promise has been fulfilled. He will never see the righteous forsaken. The food supplied by our Teachers has been more than satisfying; it has nourished and made us all healthy in the spirit so that we can lift up our voices m thanksgiving to Jehovah. One or two, snuffing at the table, saying, &quot;It is contemptible,” have gone into complete darkness. They know not where they are going. Only one thing they know—to oppose the truth. They have become insane, and all understanding has left them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A greater appreciation of our position as Jehovah’s covenant people has come through one of the greatest revelations yet given, viz., the truth concerning religion. Jehovah has done more than throw a searchlight into Satan’s darkness. He has switched on the floodlights, and now the hideous, corrupt organization is seen. We see that religion is the greatest racket on earth. The warfare is on; and to have further share in this great warfare, sound equipment and records have been supplied. This is one of the greatest things yet done in these days to enable us to leach the homes of the people with the pure message of truth. Jehovah’s message is placed before the people m a clear, concise, and yet a very gracious way, much better in every way than the stammering bps and hesitant tones of pre-plionograph days. The voice is one, all are unified, shouting the praises of our God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work with the phonograph and records has changed the whole aspect of our activity. Jehovah desires the message to reach the people, and it must be declared. Without money or piice they can hear. This provision, made possible by the records, has brought joy and thanks for such a means of doing the Lord’s work. The people are beginning to appreciate their greatest Friend, Jehovah, and also his people as their friends. Invitations into the homes are now numerous, and letters received in this office from brethren expressing their pleasure would fill books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Machines</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some phonograph work was being done twelve months ago, but after the instructions were received here at the end of January, to prepare for the work of exposure, this phase of service went forward by leaps and bounds. The publishers responded wholeheartedly, and this was clearly shown by the enormous number of phonographs and special sets of 21 dises which were ordered. On April 18 the brethren in Canada went forward as one man, engaging night and day in this great campaign. Thousands of invitation folders were distributed, and much time was spent m this new phase of service which cannot be shown in figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year nearly 1,400 phonographs have been supplied to the brethren, and 19,231 records, of which 14,707 were the special “Exposed” and “Religion and Christianity” senes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Forty large transcription machines have been made in our factory and supplied to the brethren, and these have been act-tively engaged in the proclamation of the truth. The sound machines, large and small, have increased from 664, at the beginning of the year, to a total now of 2,100. The total attendance for the year does not show the real increase. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font6">instructed over twelve months ago that the counting of those hearing the lectures should be more exact. Instead of counting those who merely heard a few sentences, in future only those who heard three or four minutes of the lecture should be counted as listeners. This reduced the numbers, but the count was accurate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is very gratifying to note that, in addition to all this sound service, the Canadian biethren have been able to maintain the same distribution of literature as the year previous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Output of Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The output of literature from the Toronto office and subdepots has totaled over a million books and booklets. The field work shows splendid increase in many ways. There has been an increase of 251 publishers monthly, bringing the total to 2,543 engaged monthly in the service. This has meant an increase in hours of nearly 20,000. The total hours for the whole year were 508,478. The books and booklets totaled 917,590. In the year ending 1936 the output of literature included a great number of booklets distributed free. There was no such free distribution during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Witness Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The six campaigns for the year have been engaged in with real zest by the brethren. In every case the titles are studied and kept before the mind of all during the period. Without question, these periods are a means of quickening the brethren to greater possibilities in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These brethren have gone forward enthusiastically in their work. Although the hindrances have been many, by the Lord’s giace they have been surmounted and increase has been made. The number of pioneers has increased. There are now enrolled 220. Some are compelled to leave the service during the severe winter weather, and a few others go into the southern parts of the States, yet an average of 176 has been maintained, as against 152 the year previous. Their activity in the sound work is splendid, showing an increase in attendance of 78,000 over that of 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta there has been a terrible drought. Saskatchewan has been labeled the “Dust Bowl”. The farmers here have practically no money nor harvest, nor any feed even for cattle. They cry out for relief. In spite of these distressing conditions there has been more interest manifest by the people of Saskatchewan than in any other province in Canada. The pioneers have labored long hours in these provinces to reach the people. Many roads are in poor condition, and in some parts gas costs 40c a gallon. The Society has assisted some pioneels financially; others have had their cars repaired. This has enabled them to contmue in the pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the coming winter some pioneers are contemplating continuing their work in the rurals with the use of horses. A team of horses and a bennett wagon, or one horse and a toboggan, will enable these brethren to reach the distant parts and keep the witness going during the winter. In some parts of the West horses are prefened to automobiles. The farmers can provide feed for the horses, but cannot supply gas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the province of Quebec there is fierce opposition, yet pioneers volunteered to work this priest-ndden district. They have gone forward and trusted entirely in Jehovah. During the past three months, in the province of Quebec, literature has been placed to the total of 888 books and 4,877 booklets. The sound machine attendance has numbered over 6,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Auxiliaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is 100 percent increase in this service, the enrollment having increased to 87. Some were forced back to the company ranks owing to the severe winter, but the monthly average has been 60, whereas in 1936 it was 30. The hours have practically doubled, and attendance at sound machine meetings have increased from 5,000 to 49,000. This is evidence of Jehovah’s blessing upon this phase of service. Now other brethren are considering joining these ra</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">nks</span><span class="font6">. This service enables many in the companies who cannot leave all and join the pioneer service, to curtail their domestic and business duties and devote at least fifty hours per month to the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font6">gdom service. There is a definite objective, and it is anticipated that during the coming year the number will again double itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Company Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The number of publishers in the companies, including the isolated servants, has increased by a monthly average of 200, making the total now 2,307. The hours have increased by 50,000, making a total of 272,860.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We had on record at this office 1,500 names of people who received the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font6"> monthly. Over 50 percent never took any share in the service. During the year the company publishers called on hundreds of these people, and as a result the list has been sifted. Some have been brought into association with the local company, while other names have been deleted. The list at this office now stands at 200. During the year, hundreds of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> subscribers not yet associated with any company organization were visited by the company publishers, and many of these are now actively engaged in the Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bethel family at Toronto have gone forward enthusiastically. There is no increase in the staff, but the average publishers monthly is 15.1, as against 13.7 the previous year. The hours have increased from 2,234 to 2,685 as a result, and every member of the family possesses a phonograph, and the sound attendance has increased from 2,513 to 4,778. Every one is grateful to Jehovah for the privileges of service. There is peace and unity, and an earnest effort made continually to serve Jehovah and the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Regional Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dour brethren engaged full time in this service, visiting 345 companies, traveling 58,699 miles. Each one has a ear equipped with a sound machine, and the attendance was 50,448. The hours reported in the service have been 2,794, and the books and booklets placed 7,711. These brethren not only have served well in the actual door-to-door service, but have organized the work in the field and have taken service, study and public meetings. Their visits to the companies aie always looked forward to with keen, anticipation, the brethren knowing well they will be further assisted and strengthened to continue serving the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Four radio stations have been broadcasting the message of the Kingdom during the year, and the total of programs broadcast has been 275. The only station now used is CKOC at Hamilton, Ontario, for one hour every Sunday. The shps advertising these radio stations distributed throughout Canada during the year were 1,130,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation duimg the year placed the following ban on “religious wars” over the air: “Sermons and talks about rehgion will have to be confined in future to positive pleadings for the cause being promoted by the speaker, and attacks on other faiths or creeds or parsons or sects will not be permitted. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year, the truth contained in the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font6"> and booklets including </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered,</span><span class="font6"> has been given over the radio stations. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has now threatened to cancel the license of any station broadcasting such lectures as Jehovah’s witnesses put forward, which m any way comes inside the ban. We are, therefore, restricted from attacking any religion or creed over the radio. This is the Devil’s tactics to hinder the command of the Lord being put into operation, “Arise ye, and let us nse up against her in battle. ’ ’ The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation will not permit this work to be done over the air, but we are mighty glad the Lord has provided us with other instruments whereby the work can and will go forward in obedience to his command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Printing</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Society maintains its own printing plant at Toronto, which cares for local work. During the year, m addition to the 1,130,000 radio slips, there were 85,460 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informants</span><span class="font6"> and other items printed, such as special letters and instructions, which make a grand total of practically two million pieces in all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Watchtower” and “Golden Age” Subscriptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> subscriptions have increased from 4,657 to 5,541, and subscriptions for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> increased from 4,341 to 5,002. The number of distributors’ copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font6">increased from 24,778 to 27,716. In addition, theie were sent to the pioneers 4,481 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> as against 4,022 last year, and 14,692 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font6"> as against 8,363 the previous year. We look forward to greater increase in the magazine </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> during the coming year. The title will appeal more, and as the brethren advertise it, it will truly be a consolation and comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Divisional Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year, 14 divisions were formed throughout Canada. The whole of Canada is not yet completed for divisional work, but is well under way. These divisions assist in unifying the companies and isolated, and are now organized to concentrate in any one district when required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Divisional Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Capable and dependable brethren have been chosen to attend to the service in the divisions. In the majority of cases they are pioneers and free to move at the Society’s direction in any part of the division. They advise, recommend and encourage the brethren in the companies to faithfulness, and help the interested in the field. They take ‘ ‘ Exposed ’ ’ meetings and help the brethren in their local studies. Their service has been appreciated by the companies and the isolated. The length of time a divisional servant stays in a company is determined chiefly by the need for assistance, the company’s hospitality, and their contributing toward the gas expense while the brother is in their locality. These brethren serve as pioneers during the day, and there is no expense to the Society. Interest has been biought together, studies formed and companies established as a result of the work of these brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Divisional Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These serve in the field during the day, and in the evenings and week-ends serve as assistants to the divisional servant, giving help where required in the division. The divisional servants and pioneers have worked hard to contact all in their area, no matter what the distance, and as a result many who have little opportunity of meeting in companies have been contacted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Eastern Ontario Division opposition was encountered at Hawkesbury, a town on the border of Quebec. The mayor and chief of police labeled the witnesses as “foreign labor agitators”, and stated through the press that if they came again they would be removed, if necessary by violence. A divisional assembly was arranged at Ottawa and a visit made to Hawkesbury, which is 67 miles away. The publishers worked through the town without hindrance until on their last calls, when the police interfered. The reason for the non-interference was because the chief of police had to take a prisoner to another town and had taken with him the officer responsible for answering the telephone. The police station was closed. The telephone was ringing, but no one to answer it. The work was about completed when the police arrived back. The mayor and chief of police weie interviewed and informed that Jehovah’s witnesses would continue to proclaim the message whether protection was afforded or otherwise. The mayor and chief of police are Roman Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Opposition In Quebec</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tills continues in Quebec province. During the year, three brethren were ‘found guilty’ on the charge of sedition and sentenced to thirty days’ imprisonment. Two sisters were given suspended sentence on a bond of $200 to keep the peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nine brethren were arrested in Montreal in July, charged with selling without a license. The magistrate, who has always been fair toward Jehovah’s witnesses, dismissed all but two, and these were given suspended sentence. At Valleyfield eight were arrested and charged with the same offense. These were ‘found guilty’ by a Boman Catholic judge, and sentenced to a month’s imprisonment, and a further charge laid against them of ‘blasphemous libel’. The brethren served the month in prison and now await the spring term to meet the further charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Archbishop Forbes, Ottawa diocese, issued a pastoral letter on February 1, 1937, to all the churches in his diocese, which letter got into the hands of the press and was published in the newspapers. The letter referred particularly to “the works of Jehovah’s witnesses ’ ’ and stated :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We, by virtue of canon 1398 of the Canon Law of the church, declare prohibited, and by these presents we prohibit in our diocese these writings, booklets, pamphlets, circulars. They are not allowed to be published, read, kept, bought or sold, nor to be translated into other languages nor to be passed out m any way. They are to be destroyed. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This was a wrong statement. Even though the Catholics in Quebec were against our message, there had been no banning of the message in the Ottawa diocese. A letter was written to “All Sincere Catholics” in the diocese, printed, and over 50,000 delivered. 27,000 were mailed, and the remainder distributed by hand. Everything was timed for the people to have their letters on the same day, so preventing the priests from balking the message. The brethren commenced distributing at 7 a.m. and worked until the distribution was completed. At the same time, the mailing of the letters began in the early morning and continued all day. The police in the district endeavored to interfere with the work. In the strong Catholic sections the children were organized to follow the woikers and, where possible, take the envelopes and destroy them, but on the work went until it was accomplished. This letter has been translated into the French language, and thousands of copies have reached other parts of Quebec province. A new French tract was also published, setting out pertinent questions. All this, together with the work of the sound machines, phonographs, raised the ire of the strong Catholic priesthood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Quebec form of government is clearly Fascist and makes a loud noise about fighting Communism. During the year, a law was passed making it necessary for permission to be obtained to rent a hall or meeting place, and if Communistic, or tinged with the Communist brush, or made to appear so, the landlord can be proceeded against. An informer may lay information against such a person, and the local magistrate, if he is so moved, can proceed under the bill to punish such landlord presumed to have harbored Communists. While the bill is aimed against Communists, yet Communism is not defined in it. This is called the “Padlock Law”. It is supposedly to protect the province against Communist propaganda, but, as one journalist has stated (J. E. Keith, in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Maclean's Magazine</span><span class="font6"> for August 1, 1937) :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Mr. Duplessis (the premier) stated openly in the legislature that the idea of the Padlock Act was suggested by Cardinal Villeneuve. While ostensibly anti-communist, the law can also be used against anti-clericals, who are growing stronger every day in the province. It is significant that the only sedition charges laid in the Quebec courts in the past five years have not been against Communists, who attack the economic system, but against Jehovah’s Witnesses who attack the priesthood.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Following the distribution of the letter addressed to “All Sincere Catholics” (French translation), the police m Montreal proceeded to the home of the brother whose local address was used, and with a warrant to search they seized his books, papers, records, etc. The parents were not at home at the time; only the children were m. The parents returned as the police were leaving, and they stated that the regular meeting place would be next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two brothers arrested at St. Jerome, Quebec, in September, on the charge of distributing tracts without a license, were not even permitted to telephone. The judge, a Boman Cathohc, demanded a very heavy bail of $500 cash, or $1,000 bond. The bond was produced and refused, stating it must be cash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In spite of all this, the work continues to penetrate in this province. Many French Catholics desire the truth and to be free from the superstition, ignorance and oppression by the priesthood. During the last few years there has been a definite breaking away in the province of Quebec from the Cathohc church, and we trust the time is not far distant when thousands will see her wickedness and give themselves entirely to Jehovah and obtain his blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Maritime Provinces</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work continues to make increase here, although the Roman Catholic Hierarchy are getting a tenacious hold on big jobs. Opposition to the Kingdom service is here. One pioneer m a Boman Catholic district had his records and phonograph stolen, and when complaint was made to the authorities, nothing was done, but the next day he was arrested on a charge of vagrancy and made to pay $5, and told to leave the town. Hie phonograph and records were never recovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In practically every place where Catholics are in control opposition to the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font6">gdom message is in evidence. Letters are sent in continually reporting their tactics. The following is one from Cheticamp, Cape Breton Island, reported by a regional servant:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘<sup>1</sup> Have worked in many tough and tight spots, but Cheticamp and district holds the title for devilment and opposition to the truth. Eighteen of us engaged in the service work. When first calls were made there was a war-whoop by women and children, and the whole settlement took up the yell. All received abuse. One had water thrown on her, another pushed out of a small store and kicked as she was leaving. One was manhandled and kicked. At another place two went together, expecting trouble. No one answered the door, and as they were leaving the door opened and a bucket of water was thrown over them. Proceeding to the gate the husband met them and said, ‘What are you doing here?’ Reply, ‘Preaching the gospel of the Kingdom.’ He raced at them, kicked them, punched them and threw one of the brothers (a cripple) on the ground. No resistance was given. One woman threatened me with a hoe. I dared her to use it, stating it would be a nde to the police station for her if she did. She put down the hoe and used her tongue; and such vile language! it was worse than the hoe. Children and grown-ups gather at the corners and heap all kinds of abuse, using horns, tin cans and anything that will make a noise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“On the last occasion in the district a pail of buttermilk was thrown over one, others got hot water, one chased with a horse-hide whip, and another chased with an axe. A charge of assault was made against one man, but the brethren failed in court to obtain a conviction.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The priest had told his people to hit Jehovah’s witnesses, kick them and drive them off their place. When visited by the regional servant and challenged, he would not admit it, but the following Sunday at mass he told his congregation they had done the right thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The hypocrisy of these pnests is everywhere in evidence, and we know that the time is here for Jehovah to search out the hidden tilings of Edom and make her bare, bring her into disgrace and make her the despised of all nations. All these experiences have enabled the brethren in Canada to appreciate more fully the Year Text, “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a grand conclusion to a full year of activity, Jehovah arranged for his people to assemble in convention at Columbus, Ohio. There were brethren there from practically all parts of Canada, from the east up to Cape Breton Island, so far west as Vancouver island; also they came from northern Saskatchewan. It was the greatest representation from Canada at any convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The pioneers, regional servants and Bethel family were very grateful to you for the arrangements you were pleased to make to assist them to get to the convention. There were 168 pioneers present. Some traveled 3,000 miles, and one brother who had been working in Alaska came 4,500 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The spiritual food was so abundant, and service instructions so clear, that it can well be said that this convention was the greatest and most blessed ever held. It will surely mark a date from which time onward unity and peace will prevail in all companies, and even a more definite forward movement to carry on Jehovah’s work in the intensive warfare against every part of the Devil’s organization. Jehovah spoke peace to his people (Psalm 122), and we all truly appreciated the fact that Jehovah is using his anointed to sound a warning to the nations and to show the only place of safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The inauguration of the ‘ ‘ special pioneers ’ ’, the new method for studying </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> the publication of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font6"> booklet, the lecture ‘ ‘ Safety ’ ’ in booklet form, the advent of the magazine </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font6"> and, greatest of all, the releasing of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font6"> showed us why Jehovah had called his people together. The richness, the blessedness and the strength obtained during those six days have given to us that which is so necessary to press the battle to the gate, and our hearts burn with a desire to serve Jehovah faithfully and to maintain our integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is difficult to find words that can adequately express our appreciation of the new book, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font6"> Without a doubt this new instrument enables us to put into the hands of the people a message that will cause them to decide their course of action and quickly take a stand for the Lord. We express, in closing, the word of the psalmist, “Thou crownest the year with thy goodness. ’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Society’s work in Canada is in a far better condition at the end of this season than it had been in previous years. This is due to the fact that the brethren there are really devoted to the Lord now and the Lord adds his blessing. The donations during the year are practically double what they were in the preceding year. The expenditures have been kept within the receipts as near as possible. The Jonadabs are seeing their privilege of having part in this work and are coming to the front and showing their love and devotion to God and his kingdom by helping to bear the burden of publishing the same. The brethren are realizing that it is a great privilege to have any part in bearing the burden of advertising the King and his kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>CENTRAL EUROPEAN BRANCH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During the fiscal year it was the privilege of the president of the Society to visit Berne, Switzerland, where is located the office of the Central European Branch. The organization of the work at that place was found to be in a good, healthy condition, with all the workers joyfully and enthusiastically engaged in the service. In order to reduce the cost of caring for the Bethel family and the office force employed at Berne, Switzerland, a small farm has been acquired upon which vegetables, some live stock, and other food are produced. The publishers in this part of the earth work always under a handicap and many difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Freedom of speech and freedom of worship in the Republic of Switzerland was a thing to which the people pointed with pride, but such freedom is now rapidly disappearing. Each year greater restrictions are put upon the people. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which years ago controlled Switzerland, but lost control with the fall of the House of Hapsburg, now again is rapidly gaining influence and control in Swit-Zetland. The people seem to be put in fear and are yielding without resistance. This Catholic movement is in fact a Fascist movement backed by both Germany and Italy. In Switzerland an attempt has been made to suppress the publications of the Society because they make known the truth of and concerning the racketeers who prey upon the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While in Berne, Switzerland, a public meeting was addressed by the president of the Society, at which much interest was shown, and because the facts concerning the Hierarchy, the Catholics, and the League of Nations were pointed out clearly and without putting on the soft pedal, the religionists were greatly enraged. It appears it will be only a question of time when a desperate effort will be made to suppress the truth entirely in this part of the earth, but we well know it cannot be done without the permission of the Lord; and when it is done, that will mean the witness work is completed and the time for Jehovah’s “strange act’’ to take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The countries under the immediate direction of the Central European Office at Berne are as follows: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxemburg, Poland, Rumania, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Yugoslavia. The Society’s representative in charge of the Central European Office, in his report, gives a general summary of the work in that part of the earth, and from his report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the activity in each of these countries is described separately under the respective heading, we give heie a general picture of the work in Central Europe and submit also a statistical chart on which the results of the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses are recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we realize that this witness was given in the presence of our enemies, under most cruel persecution and in the face of ever-increasing opposition, we must acknowledge that the work could go on only by the Lord’s grace, protection and guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Resting safely in the hands of the Lord, while the world is a seething caldron in which the scum of gangster polities is coming to the top, God’s faithful children continue to hold up the torch of God’s truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan’s power and conspiracy, often camouflaged as “Realpolitik” or “Nationalism”, which favors always the own race or nation and flaunts the rights of God or man, is particularly manifest in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Constitutions and governments which formerly guaranteed equal rights to all and valued the liberty of the individual in matters of faith and conscience are crumbling under the ruthless chariots of autocratic dictators or are succumbing to the Roman Hierarchy’s crusade to save the world for the pope and religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The famishing millions look vainly for hope and salvation unto their tin gods, who promise honor and glory on the battlefields and lead them like brute beasts into the dark valley of self-annihilation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is evidence upon evidence of the Hierarchy’s bloodguilt, not only in the World War, but also in the Abyssinian conquest, in the Spanish rebellion, and in the persecution of true saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Europe are awake to the issue and see clearly that Jehovah and Christ have risen to engage the enemy in battle, that soon the hypocrisy of the Hieraichy and her allies will be fully recognized by the people of good will, and that the strange act of Jehovah is imminent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. A summary of the work done in the fifteen countries above mentioned is as follows:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark126"><span class="font7">Company publishers</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark127"><span class="font7">Pioneers</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark128"><span class="font7">Auxiliaries</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font7">The total placements of books and booklets during the year is, to wit, 2,041,773; sound equipment employed in preaching the gospel, 691; sound meetings held, 33,946; attendance, 188,635. In addition to this the magazine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> was distributed to the number of 821,922.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The total distribution is a little less than last year, but considering the violent opposition, particularly in Germany, Hungary, Danzig, Rumania and Austria, it is a remarkable demonstration of Jehovah’s power with his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moreover, the phonograph work has taken more time in the beginning, but is preparing the way for a greater result in regard to the great multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In every land of Europe the Jonadabs, our companions, are coming to join the organization of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Outstanding Events</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last December a special petition and protest regarding the persecution of our brethren in Danzig was submitted to the League of Nations and to each delegate of the many nations assembled at Geneva, Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then on June 20 a large distribution of an “Open Letter” in Germany, winch caused the enemy to tremble and wonder at the courage of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another joyful event was Brother Butherford’s visit to Europe, the public meeting at Berne on August 10, and the conventions at Paris and at Prague.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A newspaper sailing under the flag of religion warned the people against the American judge, who had compared religion to a harlot, but 1,500 people at Berne listened attentively to Brother Butherford’s lecture on “Intolerance”, and, at the close, half of those present obtained literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Nazis lodged a complaint with the Swiss authorities regarding the truthful words said about their attempting to get' Switzerland and about the persecutions of our brethren m Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The report of the conventions at Paris and Prague is given under the headings of France and Czechoslovakia respectively. It may suffice to say here that 3,500 persons attended the Paris convention, and 1,500 the Prague convention, and, in addition to the public-meeting witnesses at both cities, about 3,000 publishers distributed approximately 60,000 books and booklets. The Prague radio station for the first time broadcast several short talks in English and Czechish on the convention proceedings, which were also a good witness to the people of good will. Nearly 200 Jonadabs used the opportunity of these assemblies to symbolize their consecration by baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The high points of the Paris convention were: (1) Brother Butherford’s talk to the anointed and their companions on “Kingdom Interests”, showing the necessity of diligent and faithful performance of one’s duty and the constant guarding of and caring for the Kingdom interests entrusted to us; (2) the public lecture attended by 4,500 people, who, at the close of the meeting rose from their seats and unanimously adopted the resolution to take their stand on Jehovah’s side; (3) Brother Butherford’s final words regarding God’s organization, that each one must recognize his place therein and obediently fulfill his assigned task. Only those who are faithful and work for the peace and prosperity of Zion are equipped and prepared to stand in the battle and may apply to themselves Jehovah’s promise of protection and deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the closing prayer Brother Butherford asked for song No. 67, which expressed beautifully the unity which binds our hearts together in love. The faces of all were radiant with the joy of the Lord, as the refrain of the song filled the great auditorium: ‘ ‘ God be with you till we meet again I ’ ’ No doubt the heavenly Father looked down with pleasure upon his faithful people, and the invisible host rejoiced with us here upon the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many letters received at this ofiiee since the conventions express the giatitude and joy of the brethren who attended, and particularly the pioneers (200 were at Paris, and 150 at Prague) thanked Brother Rutherford and the Society for the special provision which had been made for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The purpose of the Lord is being accomplished, which is also shown by the fact that a number of new pioneers are enlisting for the work in France and that in a number of the European countries, as elsewhere, Jonadabs are getting into the chariot. How glorious it will be, when &quot;Jehu”, the great Executor for Jehovah, vindicates His holy name and avenges the blood of the innocent, which is found upon the skirts of the old harlot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was a very happy occasion when the brethren in many places throughout Europe heard Brother Rutherford’s lecture from Columbus, September 18. Even though not all understood the language, they rejoiced to know that a great battle was being fought and that they were thus united with their brethren in America, and many of us joined them in singing the battle song 283: ‘‘Then up, up, my soul, linger not; today must a battle be fought. Let us compass the foe, and shout as we go, ‘The sword of the Lord, and of Gideon! ’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We were glad to learn from Columbus that the phonograph army is to be increased, and we can report that we now have 12 sound cars, 41 transcription machines and 683 phonographs in the service, and our own factory is producing more equipment for this activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A number of printing machines formerly used at the Magdeburg factory are now set up in Berne to take care of the increasing demand for literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The crowning blessing of the year, however, is the new book Enemies, a mighty weapon for the fight and wherewith we will pursue our enemies and not turn back until they are run off the earth and chased into hell, by the Lord’s grace and power and to his glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brief statement relative to the witness work in the separate countries embraced in the list of the Central European Office is here set out in the order named, to wit:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">For two years the Society’s publications in Austria have been forbidden. The Lord’s faithful witnesses there, realizing their obligation to obey God rather than man, have gone ahead regardless of the prohibition and done what work they could to publish the Kingdom message. In that time 549 have been in the field, working 29,701 hours and placing with the people 3,622 books and 48,137 booklets and 43,280 copies of the magazine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> and 554 Bibles. The Jonadabs, or “other sheep” of the Lord, are coming together and joining with the remnant in giving testimony to the truth as opportunity appears. In Vienna, Austria, there are about 50 groups of Jonadabs. Recently 100 of these Jonadabs symbolized their consecration by water immersion. About 60 phonographs were used by the publishers in the service. Some of these phonographs have been seized by the police, but after listening to the records they have released them. A large number of the brethren there have been arrested, charged with disturbing religion and with blasphemy, “blasphemy” meaning against the clergy, of course. The clear distinction made between religion and Christianity has greatly encouraged and helped the workers in Austria. It is quite manifest there is a conspiracy between the Catholic priest representing the Hierarchy and the political judges of courts. The Hierarchy gets the evidence to the courts, and they act upon the bidding of the Hierarchy in punishing Jehovah’s witnesses. The Hierarchy has gone so far in Austria as to have the children of non-Catholic parents declared to be Catholic, and these children are forced to take part in religious exercises in the schools. Quite a number of persons who have heretofore been classed as “good Catholics” have turned away from that organization and found refuge in the Lord’s organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The work has made some progress in Belgium during the year, and there has been a comparatively small amount of persecution. The police officials show consideration for Jehovah’s witnesses and often say to them: “You are in order; go on with your work.” The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is back of all the persecution, and there would be more, but the Catholic party is not in the majority in Belgium at the present time. More literature has been placed in the hands of the people of Belgium during the year than in the previous year. This consists of 3,000 books and 147,715 booklets, all of which are embraced in the general summary set forth by the Central European Office. It is reported that the working people are easily approached and often gladly hear the truth. Few of them oppose. The phonograph has been a great help to reach more people of good will. Many of the poor, ignorant people, when approached, answer that the Catholic priest has forbidden them to have or to read any books, and therefore they are kept in ignorance. The remnant and the Jonadabs work together as companions and go joyfully on doing what they can. There are 16 companies organized, the largest one being at Brussels. The following is quoted from the local representative’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nearly 100 Belgian brethren and Jonadabs attended the convention at Paris. These were unforgettable days. On our homeward journey we were filled with joy remembering what we heard at Pans, particularly Brother Rutherford’s words about putting a fire under the skirts of the old harlot; then we rejoiced greatly to listen in to Brother Rutherford’s discourse from Columbus on Saturday, the 18th of September. We rejoiced over the unfolding of Jeremiah’s prophecy, over the new name of our companions, and over the fact that the antiquated title of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> is to be replaced </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">by the new </span><span class="font6">name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font6"> Jehovah is patient with his people, but gradually everything disappears which is not in harmony with his Word. Most of the brethren did not understand the English discourse, but they joined with our brethren at Columbus in the same song at the close of the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BULGARIA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font7">Bulgaria belongs to the Balkan peninsula and supports a population of more than six million inhabitants, 80 percent of whom are agricultural workers. This country is extremely superstitious, and therefore ex-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">tremely religious. The literature of the Society has been forbidden in Bulgaria, but, notwithstanding that prohibition, more than thirteen thousand pieces have been placed in the hands of the people during the fiscal year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark135"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This country is situated immediately adjoining Germany and has furnished a place of temporary refuge for a number of German brethren. The work has progressed in Czechoslovakia, where there are now 134 organized companies. In the field service there were 1,166 publishers during the year. The distribution of the Society’s literature containing the Kingdom message totaled, bound books, 19,034; booklets, 390,799. In addition thereto 165,631 copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font7">were put in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Preaching the gospel by means of sound machines has progressed in this country. Seven transcription machines and fifty phonographs were used. 2,946 lectures, with an attendance of 31,279, were had. This method of preaching the gospel has aroused the interest of many persons, and the gospel is being received by many with gladness. These sound machines are used at restaurants and other public places. The brethren have little difficulty in the Czech section, but in the .Slovak the Roman Catholic Hierarchy exercises a greater influence and caused the witnesses of Jehovah much trouble. The Czechs, remembering what their forefathers in Bohemia experienced by reason of the intolerance of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and particularly having in mind Johann Huss, who was burned at the stake because of his preaching the gospel, show more consideration for the followers of Christ at the present time. In the German section of Czechoslovakia Nazism and Fascism are growing rapidly because the Catholics are there in control. In the Hungarian section the population are more sympathetic toward the truth. In that section a year and a half ago there were scarcely any publishers, whereas today there are 60 publishing the truth and they are manifesting real zeal for the Kingdom message. In the eastern part of Czechoslovakia, inhabited chiefly by Russians and Hungarians, many receive the message of the Kingdom gladly. In one Hungarian village, Seme, there are 50 witnesses amongst the population of 2,000 and their influence in that village is so marked that the people do not longer attend the religious organizations. That being true, the clergyman left the village because he had nothing to do. The mayor refused to have another clergyman come to take his place, because he did not want to go to church himself, and he said if he wanted to know anything about the Bible he would go to Jehovah’s witnesses. A number of Jonadabs are joining themselves to the organization and are participating in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The convention held at Prague in the latter part of August, attended by 1,500, greatly encouraged the workers in that land. At the office in Prague fourteen brethren are employed. In addition to doing the office work, they participate in the field service with other workers. A number of presses and bookbinding machines have been installed in Prague, which now produces the literature in the Czech, Slovak, German, Hungarian, and Russian languages. Recently arrangements have been made to purchase and enlarge the quarters for the carrying on of the work in that land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>DANZIG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Amidst great opposition the work in Danzig has made some progress during the year. At the instance of the religionists the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses have been forbidden for the past two years, but the faithful, relying upon the guidance and strength of the Lord, continue to carry on the work. By reason thereof several arrests have been made and the courts have pronounced severe sentences against those arrested. The judge of one court said that this was done to frighten the workers and to prevent their activity. It was difficult to get a full report from this country, but that which has been received shows that the total distribution was a little less than it was last year. Ninety-seven publishers have reported; they have been in the field service 6,485 hours. Nazi spies are throughout the country, who constantly spy upon the people of the Lord. These always look for phonographs and records when they are searching the houses of the witnesses. Some of these have been confiscated, but there are five phonographs still in use. A report from Danzig from some of the faithful brethren contains the following :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Devil was enraged because the witness work continued in the Danzig district, and therefore at the beginning of the year, Buhnau, the representative of the Society at Danzig, was arrested, imprisoned and then was Caused to disappear entirely. Soon thereafter a faithful pioneer m Danzig, who had been imprisoned, also disappeared. Today, after a year, the families of the two brothers have had no communication from either one, except that a letter written by Brother Buhnau without giving his whereabouts was received by his wife. The letter was mailed in New York and was used to deceive the family as to Brother Buhnau's whereabouts and to cover the tracks of the Devil’s representatives. The Devil always uses fraud and deception. The same thing happened, to a political man of the opposition party in Danzig. The family also received a letter which had been mailed m Spain. In both cases the police appeared soon thereafter and confiscated the letters to use them as proof that they had had nothing to do with the fate of the above. However, the letter was copied, and we have full proof that the Danzig Nazi police has violated all law and has carried Brother Buhnau off to Germany secretly. Becently a report from the German consulate in Danzig in answer to a request from England stated that Buhnau is supposed to be m a concentration camp near Berlin. This case and other cases of persecution of Christians was also submitted to the League of Nations and to a number of governments having to do with the Danzig affairs. Several government officials, hearing of this case, stated that they were sorry about it, but that they could not do anything for fear that Europe and the world might be plunged into war on this issue. Altogether fifty-four brethren and Jona-dabs served prison sentences during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, these experiences have not deterred the faithful from continuing the work. Becently eighty-three anointed and Jonadabs declared their willingness to further carry on the witness work as commanded by the Lord through the Society, regardless of the resulting difficulties. Two cases in this connection, demonstrated how the heavenly Father takes care of the faithful and that he does not forsake those who serve him. In one family the father was arrested by the pqlice and the next day the mother was also taken away, and four children, ranging from four to thirteen years of age, were left to themselves. The brethren trusted in the Lord, and, to their joy, they heard that their children were taken to an orphanage, where they were taken care of by a nurse, who was herself a friend of the truth and who noticed the children because they refused the Hitler greeting, and even the little ones gave a courageous witness of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In another case a brother had </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">finis</span><span class="font6">hed serving a three-month prison sentence and was again arrested and sentenced to a term of a year and a half. At first the other brethren felt sorry for the brother, but soon they were encouraged on account of the joy which the brother in the prison experienced. The prison official who had known the brother from his first stay, and thought well of </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6">, now appointed the brother to a position of confidence, similar to Joseph in prison. The brother had charge of the clothes and came in contact with every newcomer and thus could give a word of comfort to many a prisoner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As reported last year, a petition regarding the ill-treatment of our brethren in Danzig was submitted to the High Commissioner of the League of Nations, who, contrary to his promise, did nothing about it. The disappearance of two brethren then gave occasion to submit a petition and protest directly to the League of Nations. 'While the League had the Danzig minority question on the program, and while the League had a wonderful opportunity to recognize and deal with the petition, it did nothing, although it had solemnly declared to guarantee the Danzig Constitution and to protect the rights of Danzig citizens. It was another evidence that the League of Nations, parading under false colors, really is a part of the Devil’s organization; which is becoming more and more manifest to all honest people. However, the petition was printed in three languages and copies were transmitted to every representative of the League of Nations at Geneva. Copies were also given to all the prominent journalists, but only a few papers had the courage to publish a short notice concerning the matter. Nearly a thousand copies of a special </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font6"> issue, carrying this report, were distributed in Danzig itself, and the result was that the brethren mentioned in the report were then arrested and punished because they had dared to appeal to the High Commissioner and to the League of Nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Jonadabs</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the Lord has shown us the meaning of ‘the great multitude’, we can testify that the multitude is coming forward. Even though the activity is forbidden m Danzig, Jonadabs are coming to join us. Ten of them were recently baptized, and they are taking an active part in the house-to-house service, and some show remarkable courage. Here is an example. One sister, going from house to house, heard that the owner of a restaurant had telephoned to the police for the patrol wagon to arrest her. Other guests in the place had informed her, and she ran to the next house and told the man there what was about to happen to her if she was caught. This man was friendly to the Lord’s people, and he hid the sister in his house and told her that he had heard lectures in the past and was glad to do something for Jehovah’s witnesses. The sister then could escape through the garden into another street, but the woman who had ordered the patrol wagon had to pay the cost. Another case: One sister in the service happened to call at the door of a Nazi leader, who took the sister at once to police headquarters. The officer there asked the sister whether she had any of the forbidden literature with her; but the sister answered, “I have but a Bible ’ ’; the few booklets she had had, she had dropped secretly on the way to the police station. The officer then said to the Nazi leader, “Let this woman go in peace. Fortunately we are not that far, that it is forbidden to recommend the Bible to our fellowmen”; and then he bid the sister farewell. In the meantime the companion of the sister in the service had come to the same door, where the wife of the Nazi leader said that her husband had just taken a woman like her to the police station. Then the sister took the same street towards the police headquarters and gathered up the booklets which the sister before her had dropped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While we realize that the difficulties are increasing, we also appreciate that the strength and the encouragement from the Lord is also greater, and the faithful are becoming more courageous. Most of the brethren, having passed through ill-treatment and prison terms, are more determined than ever, and they lead others in the service. We know that all things work together for good, to those who love God, and that all these difficulties give us an opportunity to prove our fidelity to the Lord. Thus trusting upon the Lord, we shall continue to joyfully do the small part which the Lord has entrusted to us, being certain that he will bless all of our efforts.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord has revealed that those who serve him shall be of many nations, kindreds, peoples, and tongues; and further proof of this was made manifest at Paris, France, in the convention held there in August, 1937. The work in France is conducted chiefly in French, Polish, and German. At the convention many other languages were spoken by those who attended, some eoming from Holland, Belgium, Scandinavia, Germany, Austria, Italy, and other places. Prior to the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple of God there was small interest and a very small number of French people that had any disposition to serve the Lord. At the convention about 3,500 persons attended, and at the public meeting upward of a thousand additional came. The main auditorium and the adjoining halls were filled. A novel thing at this convention was this: While the speaker addressed the audience in the main auditorium in English, that auditorium was connected with various other halls by wire, with an interpreter in each hall, who immediately interpreted the speech in whatsoever language he represented, and thus the entire convention heard the same speech at the same time. Paris had the most extensive witness to the Kingdom it has hitherto had, and it is believed that much good has resulted therefrom. The witness work has progressed in France during the past year, the distribution of books and booklets reaching a total of 528,566. The sound equipment that proclaims the message by means of electrical transcription numbers 114 pieces. These figures are included in the main report from the Central European Office. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> magazine has grown in popularity, and the subscriptions have largely increased. Quoted further from the local representative’s report is the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Taking advantage of the International Exhibition at Paris this year, we obtained a stand in one of the most frequented sections of the grounds and which remains open daily until midnight. By this means Jehovah’s visible organization is brought more prominently to the attention of the people. As people pass our stand and point it out to one another, one can observe that “La Tour de Garde’’ and “Les T&amp;noins de Jehovah” have become household words in France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The one outstanding event in France this year for us was Brother Rutherford’s visit, coupled with the general convention, August 21-23 at the Maison de la Mutuality, which contains some of the largest and certainly the most convenient halls that could have been obtained for the purpose. The French brethren were on this occasion specially favored in the arrangement of the program, and their joy and gratitude at having heard Brother Rutherford personally at different times was betokened by their enthusiasm and their radiant faces. Their determination, and particularly also that of the Jonadabs, to take their stand firmly on the side of Jehovah and boldly proclaim his message to the people is becoming daily more evident. It is indeed a great joy to see so many people of good will coming to the truth and so rapidly grasping the vital truths which </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> is bringing to our attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The radio work in France has stopped during this year, and that because of the underhand activities of the clergy of the Devil who managed to intimidate the owners of the stations into refusing to broadcast our message unless it were first submitted to a kind of censorship. His witnesses do not submit Jehovah’s message to the censorship of the Devil! But His arm is not shortened, and the transcription and phonograph work have taken its place. At the moment of writing these lines, a faint echo of the Columbus convention has reached us concerning some greater activities in this field, and we are awaiting fuller details with joyful anticipation. It is inspiring to know that Jehovah’s organization is moving forward as one man and that He is permitting ns all to be doing the same thing at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">France is really Fascist, in spite of its &quot;Popular Front” government; otherwise, how explain its attitude toward the Spanish question? Of course, this applies only to the very small minority who really run the country, regardless of the wishes and interests of the people. The situation may be likened to that of &quot;sitting on the safety valve”. The bust-up may come at any time. And so we have been witnessing lately a series of acts of provocation exactly si</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">mil</span><span class="font6">ar to those which occurred in Spain just prior to the Hierarchy’s war there, and on the model of the Reichstag fire.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Because of the wicked conditions prevailing in the Catholic Hitler government of Germany it is impossible to give any report that would adequately describe the conditions there. When it was learned that a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses would be held at Paris, though other Germans were permitted to go to Paris to visit the exposition or do whatsoever they pleased, the passports of all of Jehovah’s witnesses were taken away from them and they were not permitted to leave the country. Only five did get out of the country, and as soon as they returned they were all incarcerated in prison, and now almost all of Jehovah’s witnesses are held in prison or concentration camps in Germany. Many of them are in places unknown to their friends and relatives. This is not because they have done any evil to any person or to the government, but because they have dared take their stand on the side of Jehovah God and his kingdom These faithful men and women for some years now have been undergoing experiences similar to those described in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews, and without doubt God will remember them with kindness in due time and see that their martyrdom is rewarded by his boundless blessings. It is well known, however, that a large number of books and booklets have been distributed in Germany during the year, but to get a report as to the exact number is an impossibility, and therefore no attempt here is made to give the number. It is impossible to conceive of such cruelty and wickedness as now exists in that land, and all who love righteousness anxiously await the day of complete deliverance.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark143"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">For several years the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society has maintained a branch office at Budapest, the capital of Hungary. The efforts put forth to give testimony concerning the Kingdom have been attended with much cruel treatment on the part of religionists. Hungary claims to be a constitutional state with liberty laws, but since the Roman Catholic Jesuits interpret the laws, these are never used in the interest of liberty or righteousness. The right of worship is guaranteed by the Trianon Treaty and also by the laws of the land, yet such right is never permitted. If complaints against such ill-treatment ever get into the courts, the decision is always adverse. The magistrate of the court usually remarks, “This law concerns only the confession recognized by the State.” The right of freedom of assembly does not exist. The press is muzzled. Laws are being made and applied as if the whole country had remained in a state of war, even though the war ended nearly twenty years ago. The country is ruled in an arbitrary manner under the cruel dictates of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. God’s people have suffered a long and cruel persecution in that land, but in the face of all opposition they have boldly kept on doing the best they could. During the year books and booklets to the number of 102,690 were placed in the hands of the people, and when the circumstances under which this was done are considered, the result seems nothing short of miraculous. There is only a small body of true Christians in that land, 310 of whom are workers in the field, and many of these spend much 6f their time in prison. From the local representative’s report that comes to this office the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">My brethren in the faith were never allowed to assemble peaceably for the purpose of mutual edification in God’s Word. The vainest excuses were brought forth in order to support orders of suppression. It was claimed that: “You have no superintendents; your hall is unhealthy; there is a church in town where everybody can attend; your assemblies appear to be political meetings, etc. ’ ’ Due to such circumstances we could meet but secretly, and in most places a widespread spying system and force of arms prevented us from gathering together, even to make private visits. This work is done by a military police who, in most cases, do not distinguish themselves by intelligence or fine maimers. The most brutal, narrow-minded class of men is being chosen for this service. Now Jehovah’s witnesses are being suppressed with ever-increasing fury. Who else could be interested in the destruction of honest-minded, God-fearing men than the light-shunning racketeers in priestly robes?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In March, 1937, a young Cathohc priest, manifestly sent by some higher-ups, appeared at the office of the Society, proceeding hke a clerical detective and trying to obtain as much information and material as possible. A slanderous press-campaign was then launched. From the pulpit and by sermons which were broadcast, the people were warned. The attack started at Pore-salma, in the northeastern part of Hungary. Five witnesses of Jehovah were ill-treated there in such a way that they were incapable of doing work for many days. In all the northern section of Hungary the campaign then continued methodically and in rapid succession. All lodging quarters, where the inhabitants could perchance be brought into connection with the mentioned Bible Society, were rummaged, and all the publications found, even Bibles, were confiscated. Everywhere scenes of beatings and thrashings were repeated. And many persons were hurt in such a way that the marks of ill-treatment will remain for ever. They were beaten with bludgeons in order to get their promise of rejoining the church and of regularly attending it, or to make them betray their brethren in giving the respective addresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The trustees of the Hierarchy for such actions were the detectives Balazs and Sarkozi. On March 24 they also arrested the representative of the Watch Tower Society in Budapest and brought him, under the pretext of wanting a confrontation, and even though he was ill, to Kisvarda, a place about 300 kilometers from Budapest. The purpose of taking him so far was that they might be wholly undisturbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was the Easter season. Jehovah’s witnesses had been brought by the dozen from that district to the town hall of </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Wis</span><span class="font6">varda The Budapest Watch Tower representative, having been together with some of these brethren for two days in the same room (with five men and one woman), had occasion enough to see how his friends in the faith came back from numerous hearings. They had been terribly beaten and lay on the bare stone floor groaning. After such a thrashing, one of them had to stand erect for hours in a corner with his face towards the wall, until a compassionate town policeman, upon his own authority, gave </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6"> a chair to sit down. Each was heard individually, each mishandled without any outsider present, m fact, true Jesuitical inquisition proceedings. The foreign representative of the Watch Tower had his share also in such experiences. From March 25 to 28 one trial followed the other, day and night. Although he remained polite, the detective Balazs allowed himself to be carried away by anger, and dragged the brother along through the room by the hair, tearing out whole tufts of hair. This was repeated several times. Finally, at a hearing that began before midnight and continued until four o’clock in the morning, regular inquisition methods were employed. The hands of the brother were bound together to his back and then drawn above his head until the feet (toes) barely touched the ground. After that the wrist joint was twisted and wrenched, and then he was thrown to the floor with his face to the ground, whereupon a robust man stood on him, which for a man suffering from kidney trouble is not a very agreeable feeling. Two other men drew his feet toward the head, and, the hands still bound to his back, these “heroes” continued their work of twisting the joints until they were perspiring, even though their victim was a man of small stature. All this was done with devilish prudence behind carefully veiled windows in order to avoid being (later on) called to account for such “unlawful acts”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The whole drama was enacted during the Easter season. It was a tragedy: “Good Friday,” memories of the day when Jesus Chnst, the Chief Witness for Jehovah’s truth, had been tortured and put to death; and now here, just on this memorial day, seeing supposed Christian people at work torturing true followers of Jesus Christ on account of the same work! “Easter,” the Sunday of the great procession. What did they celebrate on this resurrection day? The resurrection of the Boman Inquisition? Is it, therefore, any wonder when God speaks of the “dung of [their] solemn feasts”? It may be that these repugnant scenes meant nothing strange to the members of this strong-arm squad, used officially by the State and unofficially by the “Church”, who count such scenes as belonging to their daily-bread routine. But it means more to a person who still believes in human rights and human dignity. When the Watch Tower representative at Budapest defended his brethren in the faith, one detective said to him: “Does that hurt </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">you,</span><span class="font6"> if we give a good beating to some of these stupid simpletons?” Once this detective cynically remarked to his colleague: “Strange as it may seem, not long ago I had my thick wa</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">lkin</span><span class="font6">g stick newly painted, and now again all the color is gone.” For weeks he had beaten Jehovah’s witnesses therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the Watch Tower representative at Budapest was arrested, many Hungarian and also quite a few foreign journals in a subtle way launched false reports with regard to the arrest of a “Communistic agitator”, and the Catholic press rejoiced over the fact that finally this man had been put behind prison bars. The truth, however, is that the one referred to had never had anything to do with Communistic or any other political ideas, that he never in his life had attended a political meeting, that he hasn’t a Communist as friend, and has gone so far in his unpolitical views that he does not even take part m elections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After three months’ detention on remand in a filthy, badly ventilated, stinking cell full of vermin, sometimes together with 14 men, and mostly under the care of rude guards, the m</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ain </span><span class="font6">trial took place and ended with a sentence of three months’ imprisonment, which had already been served by the detention on remand. Furthermore, expulsion from Hungary was decreed, and after a few days’ stay in the Community’s prison, where one had to sleep on the bare stone floor, the order of expulsion was carried out. The court trial was a mere form. They avoided and absolutely forbade speaking of the contents of the publications objected to. The examining magistrate, the judges, and the attorney general gave the impression that they wanted to be nd of this case. One of these men said privately: &quot;Some statements in these pubheations are too sharp, but m a sense it is just what the people need for their education with regard to true Chnstianity. ” A pnson keeper at Budapest told the brother, when accompanying him to the examining magistrate: &quot;I am acquainted with your case as well as with the literature of your Society. Everything said therein is but truth. You say today what Jesus told the people in His day, and that is the reason why you encounter the same persecution as He did.” This is what the people think. Of course, m most countries, the people are not allowed to say much, and in many countries, for instance in Hungary, they have no voice at all and must but look on at their persecutors and the instigators of such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We informed the Hungarian president of the Council [prime minister of the Government] of these persecutions of Christian people, and advised the former president, Count Stephan Bethlen, as well, by dispatching to them as registered mail a detailed statement of these things, but we are still waiting for an answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Has Hungary forgotten that in the course of history she has had to protect her own country, even by force of arms, against the claims of sovereignty raised by popes, who imagined that the country belonged to them because they had instituted the Hungarian crown? Poor, oppressed, beautiful Hungary! Demon powers plunge you into the Eascistic-Hierarehical night. There remains one hope, however, that this night will not last long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers m Hungary will need some time to find their way m this present storm. But notwithstanding the fact that in the Hungarian rural districts a sharp control of individuals is carried on, the Lord will give wisdom and courage to His people to faithfully carry on His work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Devil’s cruel and devastating hand is rapidly laying hold upon the continent of Europe. His chief agent, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, is pursuing its long practice of the malicious and wicked inquisition. Happy will be the day when Jehovah rises up, as He did at Gibeon, and clears the earth of this infamous crowd that has persecuted for years honest and sincere followers of Christ and, above it all, has defamed and blasphemed the name of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">As is well known by all today, Italy has a Fascist government, operated now in conjunction with the Vatican, there being an alliance between the Vatican and the visible government. Nothing can be said in favor of righteousness’ being in that government or in any part of it. In that land there are a number of books and booklets published by the Society, and many of these are circulated amongst the interested, but it is impossible to get a report out of that land, because the brethren are not permitted to meet together to combine their reports. At the Paris convention only one sister was able to attend. For fifteen years she has been faithfully performing the service to the Kingdom in Italy and has suffered many indignities, but she has gone bravely on. Mingling amongst brethren of like precious faith at Paris, her countenance shone brightly and she gave evidence of a great joy in being at liberty to worship God without hindrance from anyone else. From information obtained from Italy, amongst other things is the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brother was summoned by the law authority and brought into court. The official bringing him in said to him privately: “A liberal government would, of course, be better for you. I have read your books. They are good. Unfortunately we are forced to forbid their distribution; but take courage, perhaps the time will come when you are able to work again. Do you know if there are any of your people imprisoned in Italy because of their faith?” The brother answered this in the affirmative, describing the places of the </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font7">prisonment of Jehovah’s witnesses, and shortly thereafter they were released. In that land houses are searched and literature is taken, and all who love the Lord are kept in restraint. The information is also given that many Italians are quite ready to receive the message of the truth, as they are sorely dissatisfied with the harsh rule under which they must live, and have a keen desire for the kingdom of God under Christ.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>LUXEMBURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The work in Luxemburg: There is a small number of Jehovah’s witnesses doing the best they can to distribute the literature. Over ten thousand books and booklets have been put in the hands </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font7"> the people during the year there, and that under most adverse conditions. More than thirteen thousand copies of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> magazine have been distributed, and there are several hundred subscribers for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ruling authorities endeavor to suppress the activities by every method possible, and this action they take at the instigation of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. This “Catholic Action”, which now is carrying into operation the cruel methods of the Inquisition, resorts to all manner of means to hinder the people from receiving the truth. When the Society’s European representative, an American citizen, visited Luxemburg in June last, he was immediately expelled and taken to the frontier by the police, and he was refused the right to address a public meeting which had been advertised. The religionists, discovering some literature, notify the police, and the literature is seized and confiscated. Some of the police freely admit that they are serving the Black International rather than the State, which has a constitution and guarantees religious liberty, but which acts at the dictates of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The public press joins with the rest of the foes of the Lord’s kingdom to persecute Jehovah’s witnesses. While most of the population are Catholic, they are not deceived by the rackets of the racketeers, and many of them gladly hear the message of the Kingdom and would be pleased to read the literature of the Society, but they are fearful and yield to the threats of the clergy. Many of the brethren are haled before the courts and there have an opportunity to give a witness to the truth, and thus there has been some advertisement of the King and the Kingdom. Of course, almost all the expense of carrying on the work there must be borne by those who live outside of Luxemburg. Amidst all the trying circumstances and conditions a few witnesses of Jehovah in that land stand firmly and are joyful in the service, and ‘ ‘ other sheep”, the Jonadabs, are joining themselves unto the brethren, and thus members of the great multitude are coming from that land also. There is one electrical transcription machine in that vicinity, and ten phonographs. A few meetings have been held, in which upward of eight hundred persons have heard the message in this way. The phonograph proves the most efficient method of giving the witness there. Those who have them get into the homes and personally meet those who, reside there, and are able to reproduce the message by electrical transcription on the phonograph and open the way for the hearers to get and study the literature.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>THE NETHERLANDS (HOLLAND)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The fiscal year ending was marked by increased activity in the service of Jehovah’s King and for his kingdom. During the year twenty additional companies were organized in that land and more than 200 publishers were in the field. Forty-four pioneers actively engage in the work, 10 auxiliaries following up. The amount of literature distributed is embraced in the general report of the Central European Office hereinbefore set out. The opposition to the truth is increasing in Holland, for the reason that religionists are now in complete control, there being an alliance between the Catholic, Protestant and Calvinistic wings of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sound service is better organized, and during the year one sound car, two Brooklyn transcription machines, and 40 phonographs were used to give a witness. 6,571 meetings were held, and attended by 22,714 persons. As the pioneers report the literature they distribute while out with the phonograph, on their regular report, we can merely quote how much literature was distributed, at 1,150 meetings, which were attended by 7,117 persons, namely: 88 books, 1,954 booklets, 642 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font6"> 2 subscriptions, 4 Bibles and 1,246 leaflets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As is to be seen by this yearly report, the continuous proclamation of the message is not without success. Many suddenly take their stand on the Lord’s side, and it is quite remarkable that Jonadabs, who join up, desire to immediately take part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Many are so eager, and so fully convinced by the message, that they are willing to suffer for the truth’s sake, to give up their positions and endure persecutions. They are also glad to put their homes at the disposition of the friends who wish to assemble and study the truth. They invite pioneers to their homes. This spirit of unselfishness encourages us and makes us rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a result of the last election Holland now has an exclusively religious government, made up of Catholic, Protestant and Calvimstic ministers. What this means to the continuation of the proclamation of the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font6">gdom message is not hard to guess. We are therefore beginning this new fiscal year with different lawsuits, which we hope to fight out, by the Lord’s grace. It will surely be hard to further proclaim the day of vengeance here. In the course of the year we were accused in court of having hurt the feelings of a certain class of people, that is, the Boman Catholic population, by an article published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font6"> “The Boman Church Blesses Murder.” The State attorney, backed by the Catholic minister of justice, raged against the methods used by Jehovah’s witnesses to proclaim the truth and demanded that the one principally accused, the representative of the Society, be sentenced to one month in jail. The representative of the Society then was given the opportunity to defend himself, and thereby a testimony for the truth was given. After two weeks all the accused were acquitted. There were no other really important trials in the course of the year, and we actually do not have much trouble with the authorities, in spite of the fact that we have many foreigners helping us to do the work here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Four regional service meetings were held. The first in Apel-doorn, where 100 assisted, the second m Utrecht, where 250 were present, the third in Groningen, 50 assisting, and the fourth in Eerbeek, with an assistance of 90. There were, further, 8 presentations of the ‘ ‘ Drama of Creation ’ ’, which were attended by 1,320 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bethel family was mostly occupied in office work, translating, etc., but as far as the ever-increasing work in the office permitted, they also took part in the service out in the field. No special report of this activity was made, as the Bethel family works together with the Haarlem company and their reports are included in the report of that company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As proof of the increased appreciation of Jehovah’s work and his </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font6">gdom, it can be stated that there are always more wishing to attend the large conventions. Ninety-three Holland-ish brethren and Jonadabs attended the last convention in Lucerne, whereas 108 Hollandish friends attended the convention in Pans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With fresh courage and with full confidence in the Lord, we step into the next fiscal year and, by his grace and strength, hope to take part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name during the year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark150"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark151"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">For a number of years the message of God’s kingdom has been proclaimed in Poland. The Society has maintained a branch office there, and much money and effort have been put forth to bear witness before the people of and concerning God’s kingdom. During the fiscal year just closed the Devil and his religious agents, and particularly the Hierarchy, have been more active than ever in launching vicious attacks against Jehovah’s witnesses in an effort to keep the people in ignorance of the truth. In the face of all this a few faithful witnesses continue to boldly proclaim the message of God’s kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society purchased property and established an office there, where eight persons do the work. Over two hundred thousand books and booklets have been placed in the hands of the people during the year, and that in the face of much cruel persecution. The exact figures appear in the preceding general report. These publications that were distributed were in the languages, to wit, Polish, German, Ukrainian, Russian, Yiddish. The following quotation is from the Society’s local representative’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the be</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:line-through;">gin</span><span class="font6">n</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:line-through;">in</span><span class="font6">g of the year, instigated by the administrative authorities, the Polish </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> was forbidden by order of the court, and soon thereafter the German issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> was not allowed the use of the mail. Then the Minister of Interior, by three special decrees, forbade all literature, even </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> in the Polish language. A good portion of the literature was first put under seal and later carried away. We were cut off from the outside, and literature we had printed in Poland was confiscated. Nevertheless we were able to have two of six booklets printed. While the Constitution remains the same outwardly, many sincere Polish citizens are realizing that the Boman Hierarchy is causing the Canonical law of the church to replace constitutional rights and thus a Hierarchical dictatorship is being established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The enemy thinks that he will triumph and that he will soon have reached the point of saying “Peace and safety’’, but the Lord’s people, strengthened by “meat in due season’’, are prepared for anything. The witness work could not be stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Beahzing these things, we are grateful to the Lord that the number of organized companies has increased from 115 to 121, and the number of pioneers from 40 to 49. It is true that the number partaking of the Memorial supper has decreased from 1,751 to 1,527, but this is due to a better understanding of their responsibility in this connection. In addition to those participating, 1,096 were present at the Memorial celebration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a monthly average of 800 publishers in the field, and the highest number in the active service was during the spring season, at the time of the Memorial, when 1,040 publishers called upon the people of good will with the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the hatred and madness of the Catholic clergy increased constantly, and while Catholic Action has begun to commit Cath-ohc acts of cruelty, we find a large number of people of good will, who receive the message with gladness, and which encourages the publishers to go on with the witness work. During the year two cases are reported where the Devil’s crowd caused the death of two witnesses, and there are 75 cases where the publishers were ill-treated by the Catholic Action. In 108 cases the police had a protocol made, and 263 cases were taken into court, whereby brethren were acquitted 99 times, and in 71 cases they were sentenced; the other cases are still pending. This means a total of eleven years, two months, one week and six days in prison, and fines amounting to 6,629 zloty and 283.80 costs. In 129 cases literature was confiscated, but returned again in 99 cases. The branch servant was also charged with having dispatched ‘ ‘ forbidden literature ’ ’, but he was acquitted, and then he was charged with blasphemy for distributing the Kingdom booklets. He was sentenced to six months in prison, but the sentence was not executed. This month there are two more trials because of printing and distributing “forbidden literature”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although the situation is much more difficult than a year ago, we are going courageously forward, and all the Lord’s people in this land are determined to carry on the witness work regardless of whether it pleases men or not, remembering the words of our Lord that ‘we must obey God rather than man’.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark152"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark153"></a>RUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Amidst much cruel persecution and opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses a large amount of literature has been placed in Rumania during the year, the number of which books and booklets is included in the general report of the Central European Office. Rumania has been one of the chief places of the Devil’s operation for some years. The Society had a well-established office and printing plant there, and the one in charge of it defrauded the Society and caused the property all to be taken away or destroyed. The “evil servant” class is still working in that land, and these, together with the clergy which rule the land, carry on their wicked and malicious opposition to Jehovah’s King and kingdom; another evidence that the Lord is separating the people and causing the “goat” class to don their garments, that they may be identified for destruction. From the local representative’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses in Rumania have suffered great persecution during the past year. The clergy rules the land. Recently they held a conference, and at a banquet they resolved to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. In the official paper of the government, dated April 21, 1937, the minister of education published the decree, which was then copied by all the newspapers, that “the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses is strictly forbidden throughout the land. Whoever distributes their literature or reads it shall be punished and the literature shall be confiscated”. There is also evidence that the “evil servant” class has a part in the conspiracy with the clergy and that they together seek to destroy the Lord’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A brother who happened to overhear a conversation between false brethren stated that these false brethren were mad because Brother Rutherford had not heard their complaint against the branch servant and, because of that, they wanted to destroy the work, hoping that they will then be heard. The “evil servant” class also reported to the government officials that the books of the Society are not in order, but the official auditing of the books proved that everything was in order. Then the Society was charged with being Communistic, and the suits resulting are still pending in the martial courts During the past year we had 56 lawsuits and 43 acquittals, 198 arrests, and 36,000 lei worth of literature was confiscated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While writing this report, a letter was received telling of the experiences in a village where there is a company of 41 brethren. A whole squad of policemen was ordered to search the homes of these brethren and, in doing this, several houses were practically wrecked. They destroyed the roof, pulled down the hay and the straw, and searched every corner for Bibles and literature explaining the Bible. All Bibles, all literature, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> copies, phonographs and phonograph records were confiscated, and all the brethren were arrested and were led about from one village to another, and were mocked and beaten exactly as in the days of the Inquisition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The priests go with the gendarmes from house to house looking for the literature distributed by Jehovah’s witnesses. They ask the little children whether the parents have taken this literature, and when they find any in a home, they threaten the people with beating and prison if they take any more of such literature. The people of good will tell the publishers that they like our literature and they would like to take it but then the priest comes with the police and they are beaten for having bought the literature. One Jonadab told that he hides the literature and his Bible under the sauerkraut barrel and reads it secretly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Despite this great opposition and persecution, the faithful brethren have gone forward during the past year, and even though the total amount of hours and distributed literature is less than last year, we are thankful to our dear heavenly Father that he gives us an opportunity, not only to believe and to work, but also to suffer with our forerunner, Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are 75 organized companies. 2,609 attended the Memorial. 2,079 partook of the symbols. The highest number of company publishers was 842. The average was 344. The highest number of pioneers, 14; the average, 7. The highest number of auxiliary pioneers, 30; the average, 8. Eighty-nine were baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work with the gramophone has merely begun, and therefore many have not reported as yet. The companies are working with 70 phonographs.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark154"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark155"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It seems quite evident that the Lord is permitting the Devil to go his very limit in suppressing all freedom upon the European continent in particular. Switzerland has for many centuries been known as a land of freedom of speech and freedom of worship, but those days of liberty are gone. Any class of people on earth, except Jehovah’s witnesses, would be discouraged to proceed amidst so much opposition and persecution. Instead of being discouraged, Jehovah’s witnesses know that all this cruelty heaped upon them proceeds from the Devil and his religious agents and is clearly in Harmony with the prophecies God caused to be written centuries ago; and, therefore, having full faith and confidence in Jehovah and looking forward with great eagerness to his kingdom’s establishing a righteous government on earth, these faithful witnesses press on, counting not their life dear unto them, but determined by God’s grace to boldly declare the message of his kingdom in this day of judgment. The Society’s representative in Switzerland makes report of the activity of the work in that land, and the following quotations are taken therefrom:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus prophesied: “Ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake. ’ ’ For centuries Switzerland has claimed, rightfully, the honor of being a nation where tolerance, liberty, and freedom of speech rule. For a long period of time Switzerland kept from dishonorable political machinations, but now she also is yielding to the increasing influence of that sinister institution, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Heretofore Switzerland was considered a model democratic state; but the fact that the Boman Hierarchy wants also Switzerland is another proof that the Hierarchy has stooped to conquer the world, and the time prophesied by John the revelator has come, when the voice of the bridegroom shall be heard no more in Babylon, or “Christendom”, which includes Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the past eleven years the voice of the truth has been heard loudly in this little country. 350,698 books, 2,859,507 booklets and 4,000,000 magazines declaring the message that God’s time to act has come, have found their way to the Swiss people. Thousands of people of good will have taken a great interest in the work of Jehovah’s witnesses and have given their support. But here, as in all other lands of ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’, a group of deadly enemies of the truth is revealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the memorable general convention at Lucerne last year a fire was started which no doubt will continue to bum until the great issue is settled and when Jehovah will destroy Satan’s organization. It will be remembered that the Lucerne city authorities, because of their fear of their clergy allies, tried to stop Brother Butherford’s public meeting; thereupon hundreds of Lucerne citizens protested, and many newspapers continued criticizing the action of the Lucerne city authorities. In that way large circles of the city and country inhabitants were stirred up and desired of us explanation of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We then printed an extra </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font6"> number having as title picture ‘ ‘ The New Gessler Hat ’ ’, the meaning of which would be clear to those who know something of Swiss history, and which contained a report of the true facts. The same issue also published Brother Rutherford’s public lecture and was mailed to 20,000 families in Lucerne. The people demanded further lectures, but, after we had rented the halls and advertised the meetings, they were forbidden and the people were chased away by the police. The Cantonal Government of Lucerne then issued a decree forbidding all further public activity by Jehovah’s witnesses. The case was taken to the Supreme Court, which canceled the decree issued by the Lucerne authorities, stating that freedom of speech is a democratic heritage and cannot be taken away. Nevertheless, local authorities continued to make difficulties for the publishers, arresting them, etc. So the hatred of the clergy increases and their influence with the authorities is felt more strongly, particularly in the Catholic sections of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Several years ago the State attorney of the Canton St. Gall requested the cantonal authorities at Berne to take steps against the Watch Tower Society. The Bernese court, however, refused to take part in this conspiracy and asked whether the Canton of St. Gall would pay the costs, stating also that Jehovah’s witnesses would doubtless make a big cry in their defense. It is interesting to note that the city of St. Gall is the spot from which most of the opposition has emanated. In St. Gall, in 1931, an organization, “For the Pope and for the Church,’’ was formed. This organization is publishing a news bulletin, which is affiliated with the Nazi government of Germany. The former editor of this news correspondence instituted suits against two officials of the Society at Berne, charging them with dishonoring religion and with the distribution of trash or immoral literature. The first court acquitted the accused and sentenced the complainant, but the higher court, greatly under the influence of religionists, reversed the verdict. The literature was not confiscated, however, the charge being directed particularly against certain illustrations and certain paragraphs in the books. This action of the Berne Higher Court has disappointed a large number of Swiss citizens, whose disappointment and protest were also expressed in several Swiss dailies, which revealed that the man who had instituted the charges against Jehovah’s witnesses is really a Nazi agent in the service of German propaganda organizations. The accuser is now exposed as a German spy, and the whole conspiracy between the Nazi agents and members of the Catholic Hierarchy against the representatives of the Watch Tower Society is shown up in the correspondence confiscated by the Swiss federal police. For instance, Todtli, the Nazi agent charged with spying for Germany, corresponded with Colonel Fleischhauer of Erfurt, Germany, and with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. </span><span class="font6">Jonak of Vienna, who published a book against Jehovah’s witnesses, and Todtli said in part: “I have now made good connections with Catholics in our fight against the Bible Students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I was received by the Papal Nuncio and conferred with him. I also received from him two letters of recommendation for Zurich and St. Gall. ’ ’ In nearly every issue of hrs paper he slanders Jehovah’s witnesses and tells lies about them. In his correspondence which was confiscated there is also a letter wishing him success in his battle against the Society’s representatives at Berne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have mentioned these things in detail, in order to show up the conspiracy of the Devil’s crowd in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s people in Switzerland take a very active part in this battle. The company publishers, with few exceptions, stand shoulder to shoulder, attentive and ready to do joyfully whatever they are called upon to do. Thus a recent attack made by members of the &quot;evil servant” was turned back with determination and with full confidence in the guidance of the Lord’s work. It is characteristic that a false brother, residing in St. Gall, receives regularly the above-mentioned slanderous Nazi news-service about Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In view of this opposition we rejoice in the Lord’s grace, under which the witness work could be carried on vigorously this year. We have 50 organized companies, and 1,121 persons partook of the Memorial. The highest number of company publishers was 947, and a monthly average of 695. Then we have from 3 to 6 pioneers, and 10 to 14 auxiliaries.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The hours spent in the service are about the same. The number of hours for .pioneers is higher. Considering the fact that the companies used 14 percent of the time for serving 4,500 regular </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> readers, who are served directly, and that they used 8 percent of the time in the phonograph service, we believe that the result of distribution is fair, even though a little smaller than last year. A special work was done with the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> magazine, and thus 78,000 more copies than last year were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonograph Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brethren and companies are now better equipped for the phonograph work. There are 6 sound cars, 20 transcription machines, and 160 phonographs in the service. 8,172 sound meetings were held, which were attended by 34,455 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Often when the Lord gives us a new instrument in the witness work some hesitate to use it, but our experience with the phonographs has proved that any doubts were not justified. The publishers have much joy with the phonographs and greatly appreciate this means of service. The personal contact helps to make the people of good will realize who Jehovah’s witnesses are and what their mission is, and they understand more readily that our enemies lie when they claim that Jehovah’s witnesses are trying to set up a Jewish-Bolshevistic world rulership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The service, by playing the records, is especially timely and suitable for the Jonadab work. All addresses obtained when people take literature are carefully kept, and these are visited every two weeks with the phonograph. Quite a number have thus learned to know the truth and have not hesitated to participate in the service and to talk about the things which now fill their hearts. It is touching to hear them tell their experiences with their relatives and friends, when they first take their stand for the truth, and how the Lord gives them strength and courage to face opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Several Jonadabs, spending their vacation in a far-off mountain village, heard the people m a small hotel talk about the hermit “Bnschli Sepp”, who is said to be a wise man, but that he has nothing to do with religion. Hearing this, the Jonadabs were curious and decided to call upon “Busehli Sepp”. They found him an old man, living in a hut in the cleft of a rock. As they entered this hut, they found upon his table the books </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font6"> and a number of booklets. He said that he has studied this literature, and that he preaches its message to all people who come to visit him, namely, all the vacationers in the vicinity. Some who would not hear his message said that he was probably full of sweet wine or was not normal; but the Jonadabs were convinced that the old man understands the truth and proclaims it. He told the Jonadabs that he had studied Catholic theology, but he sees now that the people are greatly deceived thereby, and that because of the Catholic religion the Bible is being despised. This confirmed the explanation of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> that the Lord is about to liberate sincere prisoners in the church systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Aside from 11 regional service conventions, with 2,450 attendants, 28 public meetings were held, with an attendance of 7,287; two of these public meetings were held in the city of Berne. The first public lecture was given March 17, on the subject “Why (in Germany) the Death Penalty for Jehovah’s Witnesses?” Several German newspapers had published slanderous reports, and one of these papers, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Blade Corps,</span><span class="font6"> demanded the death penalty for Jehovah’s witnesses. Several Swiss papers took up the lies and slanders, amongst them one that Jehovah’s witnesses believe in Stalin of Bussia as their Messiah. Before the lecture took place, 50 Swiss newspapers published our answer to these Nazi lies, and in the lecture some of the authentic reports of the cruel persecution of our brethren in Germany were read to the audience, which made a deep impression upon the sincere people of the city of Berne. We quote herewith the last part of our answer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Brought to the issue, Jehovah’s witnesses will obey God rather than men, and even under the most severe attacks of religionists they will stand for the truth of the Christianity of the Bible, and this in order to maintain their integrity and faithfulness even as their Master, Christ, unto death. (Revelation 2: 10) As evidence that Jehovah’s witnesses take Christianity seriously, may serve the unquestionable fact that at present about 4,000 Bible Students or witnesses of Jehovah for the sake of their faith are languishing in prisons or concentration camps in Germany and m Danzig. These brutal measures against the Bible Students </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(The Slack Corps</span><span class="font6"> demanded the death penalty) are supported only by the enemies of Christianity and of the constitutional liberty of faith. These enemies demand that the witnesses of a better and new world, in which righteousness and peace shall rule, should be oppressed also in Switzerland by order of the police, because the proclamation of the truth reveals their undemocratic lust for power and their opposition to Christianity. People of Switzerland, be not deceived by the above-mentioned slanders against the Bible Students, for these people are not influenced by Moscow, by Berlin or by Borne, but they are God-fearing Christians and at the same time free and peaceable citizens of Switzerland I ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The second special lecture was Brother Eutherford’s at Berne, on August 10, on the subject of &quot;Intolerance”. A representative of the German embassy and about 25 Nazi agents or storm troopers were present. Although a religionist newspaper warned against the lecture, 1,500 persons were present and listened very attentively, and half of those present obtained literature at the close of the meeting. Later a complaint against the lecture was submitted to the Swiss government. The complaint was directed against what was said about the Hitler government and about the cruel persecutibns of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany and because Brother Butherford warned the Swiss nation not to follow the example of Germany. The remark that the League of Nations could not be of God, but of the Devil, was also objected to, and the representative of the Society at Berne was advised that according to a new law, which really applies only to political meetings, in the future, notice must be given to the Swiss police concerning any public lectures to be held by Judge Butherford in Switzerland. The lecture, of couise, had nothing to do with politics, and the Society’s representative offered to submit the lecture, which had been recorded when it was held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, the chief politician in Switzerland is a personal friend of the pope and has privately given orders to restrain Jehovah’s witnesses, fearing that the people might come to know the truth concerning the Hierarchy’s efforts to grab the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Although the printing factory at Berne has been kept very busy and further printing machines and equipment have been set up, the Bethel family rejoices to take part regularly in the house-to-house service. The result of their activity was 4,961 hours, 1,306 books, 19,258 booklets, 10,433 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> copies, 1,265 phonograph meetings, with 7,951 listeners. The Berne office received 15,686 pieces of mail and dispatched 14,080.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There can be no doubt that many persons residing in Switzerland have a desire for the Kingdom, but comparatively few of these are willing to trust in the Lord. They fear men and man-made institutions. Whether they will break away from Satan’s organization and take their stand on the side of God’s kingdom before Armageddon cannot now be answered. The faithful witnesses of Jehovah in that land continue to press on in their work, with full confidence in the Lord and complete courage, because they know that the everlasting hands are beneath them, and they make no apology or excuse for representing Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">YUGOSLAVIA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font7">Yugoslavia as a nation resulted from the carving up that followed the World War. It is inhabited by three Slavic races, named the Serbians, Croats, and Slovenians. Jehovah’s witnesses are able to make more progress in the Serbian district because they are less under the dominating control of the religionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Boman Hierarchy has recently exercised a strong political </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">infl</span><span class="font6">uence and has foiced the government to accept the Concordat, through which the Hierarchy has greater advantages above other religions, and it is claimed that this policy had something to do with the recent death of the head of the Serbian Orthodox church; in which happenings the eyes of many were opened. The people begin to think for themselves, and we feel that we have entered a special period in the service, because people of good will manifest themselves and take part in the service and often these Jonadabs are more diligent than members of the old companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All authority is now in the hands of the Minister of the Interior, who is a Roman Catholic pnest, and he caused all activity to be forbidden in April 1936. This measure was in force against us until March, 1937, when the Senate or government Council canceled the verdict. However, this decree did not stop us from carrying on as before under the wondeiful guidance of the Lord. Of course, the decree brought some disadvantages and has hindered the progress of the witness work because of the greater difficulties. Arrests, confiscations, stopping of meetings, occurred continuously, but then we used other methods, which the Lord blessed, and the arrests merely held up the work of the individuals temporarily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are now 14 organized companies, with 82 company publishers as the highest number, and an average of 54. The highest number of pioneers was 25, and an average number of 20, and 2 auxiliaries. The highest number of workers in the field was thus 109, with an average of 76. 129 persons celebrated the Memorial, and 123 partook of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Comparing the total result with last year, we find it to be a little smaller; but when we realize that we worked eight months of the year under restraint, we find that the Lord has blessed our efforts nchly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We carried no cases to the courts except the one complaint to the government Council, which was settled in our favor. However, the Catholic Minister of the Interior issued another decree declaring that it is forbidden for foreigners residing in Yugoslavia to distribute our literature, yet the Lord shows us other ways, and thus the pioneers continue to work without senous trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sound service was gradually organized during the past six months. Thus far we have had an average of 14 phonographs in the service, with 1,614 sound meetings and 6,676 listeners, placing thereby 2,108 pieces of literature. We have one transcription machine from Brooklyn, and several groups and pioneers have received phonographs and new instructions; thus we hope that this instrument will be used more effectively in sounding foith Jehovah’s praise. One pioneer reported that he played a record in the village street, that a crowd gathered about him and listened. Finally the village priest arrived, called the police, and told the brother to leave the village at once, but before the officer arrived, everyone had taken booklets. When the officer had examined the brother’s papers, he said, “You can go on with your work.” Similarly, a company publisher played the records in the street and, upon the instigation of the piiest, he was arrested and his phonograph and records were confiscated, also a box full of needles. The phonograph and the records wandered from office to office up to the highest office of the district, and everywhere the records were played. When the phonograph was finally returned to the brother, the needle box was nearly empty and the records showed that they had been played often. This ease made a deep impression upon the brethren, who at first were timid about using the phonograph. The Lord thus demonstrated that he guides us as long as we obey him and faithfully carry out our service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The past year was truly a year of battle, during which the enemy with his earthly representatives, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, has put forth every effort to destroy Jehovah’s people and to keep the people of good will from hearing the truth. As a result of the various attacks, some who were not firm have fallen away and others continue in the fight, shoulder to shoulder, regardless of all opposition, knowing that their Commander will gam the victory. With courage and determination we have risen “against her in battle” (Obad. 1), and we pray to the Lord that he may give us strength to continue faithfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Taking a retrospective view of the work done in the territory comprised under the jurisdiction of the Central European Office, the results of the year are very encouraging, and all of God’s people are rejoicing and giving thanks that still the witness work continues and that the evidence points to the early approach of complete deliverance and the full vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark160"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark161"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">For some time the Society has maintained a representative at Shanghai, and the few brethren there have put forth a strenuous effort to give a witness to the truth. The work now is greatly retarded by the war that Japan is prosecuting against China. It seems quite certain that this war is largely due to the influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. There are many circumstances to support this conclusion, and this further shows that the Hierarchy is really the one responsible for the Fascist organization in the various parts of the earth. Japan has, acting under the influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, forbidden any of the literature concerning “this gospel of the kingdom” to be distributed in Japan. Italy is likewise against the Kingdom message, and Italy is co-operating with the Hierarchy and with Japan in its murderous assault upon China. The same may be said of Germany. At this point a little historical statement contained in the report of the Society’s local representative will be read with interest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It might be of interest here to relate the early history of the Catholic movement m China. In the year 1582, under disguise of a Buddhist monk with shaved head and in Buddhist attire, Matthew Ricci, a member of the Catholic Jesuits, by bribing the high official of the state and through his influence succeeded to gain an interview of the Chinese emperor of Ming Dynasty, and in whose presence presented gifts of a baby organ and a clock and some other colored paintings of Jesus and Mary. The emperor was pleased with the organ and the clock and gave permission that he might stay in China and erect his temple and preach his religion among the Chinese people. Seeing the images put up in the temple, the counting of beads and saying prayers out of a book, the emperor naturally thought that he, Matthew Ricci, was a Buddhist monk from a foreign country, therefore he gave a name to the temple and called it &quot;Ta Ching Sz” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Sz</span><span class="font6"> means the Buddhist temple). Later, when he had gained the confidence of the people and the officials of the state, and when he had learned the mea</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font6">g of Chinese characters, he changed that name into &quot;Tien Tsu Tang” (Catholic Church) and also put away his Buddhist robe and wore the costume of a Chinese scholar. This was the beginning of Catholicism in China. The above is cited from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic History m China, </span><span class="font6">a book published in Chinese under this title by the Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since then other members of the Jesuit Order swamped into this land, and they began to participate in the C</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font6">ese government affairs and oppressed the common people, resulting in the Boxer uprising in 1900—an attempt to overthrow the foreign oppression, especially the wicked influence exercised by these Romish gentlemen of the cloth through their teachings and practices of their devilish religion under the name of &quot;Christian”, falsely claimed. After signing the unequal treaty known as Boxer Indemnity, China has since been obliged to protect the foreign missionaries of any kind that come into her border and to regard them as her friends instead of enemies. Backed by this treaty and the gunboats furnished by the Powers for their protection, the missionary work, so called, began to flourish in Chinese soil. These blackbirds travel even into far distant interiors, making their dupes the poor, gullible and ignorant Chinese natives, and keep them prisoners in the Babylonish systems. According to the claim made by a Catholic Chinese bishop over radio in Nanking last year, after thiee hundred years’ hard underground labor the Catholic movement in China has reaped a wonderful harvest. She has now a population of 2,934,175, with 6,150 Chinese bishops, priests and nuns, and more than 20,000 others of less degree. Schools under Boman Catholic auspices have numbered 16,213. The Catholics begin to show themselves in the recent years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Following the footsteps of the Catholics in China came the Protestant proselyte-makers in the year 1807, beginning with Bobert Morrison as the first Protestant missionary. At the end of 1934 the Protestant forces in China are reported to be as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Communicant members &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;512,873</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ordained native clergy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Missionary staff, includes wives 6,100</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Besident mission stations &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,207</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Organized churches &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,281</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With this historical background in mind, one could readily see how the adversary is working in this heathen land through these would-be ministers of gospel of Christ, bringing reproaches upon God’s holy name and won in g great injury to the people’s eternal welfare. While witnessing among the Chinese in Shanghai, one Chinese scholar said to the pioneer indignantly: “You Christian people claim to preach the gospel of peace to the Chinese. What is the idea? It was the Christian nations that started the World War in 1914, and the next war will again be started by the Christian nations. Why not go and preach to your own country people? We love peace; we do not want anything to do with you Christian hypocrites, the running dogs of imperialism and capitalism.” With this he banged the door. This is but one of many instances which shows how the Chinese are disgusted with so-called “Christian” religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The witness work started only in 1933, with one brother (Chinese) as Society’s representative, who resides in Shanghai and who began to translate the books into Chinese language. Shortly thereafter came two Australian pioneers, a brother and his wife, who since that time have traveled all the main cities of China proper, such as Peking, Tientsin, Tsingtao, Peitaiho, Chefoo, Weihaiwei, Canton, Hongkong, Swatow, Amoy, Foochow, Hankow and Nanking, the last being the capital of the Chinese Bepublic. The work has been steadily m progress under His guidance, and by His grace the following report for the year 1936-1937 is herein submitted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the beginning of the year Brother Rutherford’s 5-minute recorded speeches were broadcast over one Chinese radio station, with Chinese translations, every Sunday for a period of six months. Later the broadcast has been shifted to the most popular foreign radio station in Shanghai, XMHA, and is still conveying the message of truth to the public daily amidst war conditions existing at the present time. The speech ‘<sup>1</sup> Separating the Nations” was put over the air once in Peking and once in Tientsin last fall, with fine reception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Jonadabs Organized</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On August 18 the Shanghai company has been properly organized as an independent unit: it has its own chairman and secretary and is solely responsible for the radio broadcast m Shanghai. A resolution has been adopted and forwarded to Brother Rutherford by the Shanghai company, expressing their appreciation and thankfulness for the great and marvelous truths the loving Creator has unfolded to them through the pages of the Watch Tower publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Translations</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year one book, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font6"> and three booklets, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing, Protection</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon,</span><span class="font6"> have been translated into Chinese for general distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Free Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Most of the Chinese people are poor in substance. It is necessary for the Society to give out free literature from time to time in order that a wide witness might be given to the people in this land. Hence it was decided that Brother Rutherford’s speech on “Separating the Nations” be printed in Shanghai in the form of a special pamphlet for free distribution. As soon as the notice of this free publication was advertised through one of the Chinese periodicals, more than 200 requests swamped in from different parts of China representing 14 provinces. This indicates the eagerness on the part of the Chinese people in getting a knowledge of this thrilling message from God’s Word in these days of peril. However, these hungry souls can be reached only through correspondence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to Brother Rutherford’s instructions public lecture meetings were held at the Chinese Y.M.C.A. hall on April 18 and 25 (two succeeding Sundays). The new sets of records on “Exposed” and “Religion and Christianity” were played on transcription machine before the public. Besides advertisement in the daily papers, 2,000 invitations were printed and distributed. Owing to the bad weather, and trams on strike, etc., the total attendance of these two meetings numbered 60. A good impression was left in the minds of the Chinese who attended the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Devil sees that the witness work of the Lord’s people is steadily growing in this country and, if left unhindered, it would pull down the structures that he has for so many years built on this land, and set free the prisoners in the Babylonish systems. Hence he causes the war to break out between Chinese and Japanese in Shanghai for the purpose of stopping the Lord’s work if he could. But the Lord protects his own, and the work is still carried on unhindeied. The friends meet together and study the truths as usual.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">There is now great distress in China, but amidst all the opposition and trouble and difficulties the few workers there placed in the hands of the people during the year books and booklets to the number of 9,067. Jehovah’s few witnesses in that land are putting forth their best endeavors to bring consolation to the hearts of the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark167"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark168"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">If anybody acquainted with God’s Word and the present-day events has any doubt about the approaching battle of Armageddon, the activities of the old harlot throughout the earth should fully convince him. In every country Catholic Action is being pushed against God’s kingdom. This of itself is evidence that Jehovah is permitting the enemy to go his limit now, just before Armageddon. Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic, so-called “Protestant”, “Christian Science,” so called, and every other religious element is arrayed against Jehovah and his King and kingdom. They are marking themselves as “goats”, and putting on the garments identifying them entirely and completely with the Devil’s organization, and they are marking themselves for destruction. These facts are encouraging to the anointed remnant and to the Jonadabs. Added to the evidence that comes from other parts of the earth is that from Greece, where the Greek Cath-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">olic religious element is pushing the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses and showing their opposition and venom leveled against the kingdom of the Lord. The Society’s representative at Athens reports the increased persecution in that land in connection with the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses, and from his report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We thank the Lord for his loving-kindness toward us. With gratitude we see his protecting and directing hand among the bitter opposition of Satan and his tools. The Lord blessed His work this year also in Greece. It is true that we cannot compare the work of the last year with that of previous years, because the work this year was done under adverse circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan and his consorts were very vigilant and bitter against the work of the proclamation of the message of the Kingdom and the publishers of it, and as the brethren went to the field they were seized and prosecuted. Some of the brethren, are in prison, and some in exile, among them two sisters with their little ones. In. the country repeated researches were done in the houses of the brethren, and many books were seized and confiscated. Many cases are still pending in the courts. These conditions brought to many brethren financial distress, and so the brethren were unable to move.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is true that some relaxed their hands, but they that love the Lord unselfishly continue with zeal doing whatever their hands find to do to the glory of the Lord and vindication of his name. Our literature is barred from the post ofiices, and this added to the difficulties of providing the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is one regional servant who visits the brethren. Also five pioneers have spent as much of their time as possible in the field work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work done is as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Re the Albanian territory:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There also Satan through the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has acted against the proclamation of the message of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The books were seized and, notwithstanding the petitions to the Albanian Government, until now they were not given back. Still the brethren have not relaxed their hands, but they try among the opposition to serve the Lord faithfully.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The witness work to the name and kingdom of Jehovah has made progress in the Hawaiian Islands during the fiscal year just past. The total distribution of books and booklets in the Islands is, to wit, 28,041. The number of workers is small, of course, the territory very limited, with many foreign-speaking people, and, taking into consideration the difficulties that beset the work in that land that is ruled by religionists, the result is very gratifying, and we rejoice with our companions there that they are privileged to carry on the work to the Lord’s praise. At Honolulu the Society maintains its operating office for the Hawaiian Islands, and from the local representative’s report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rich blessing and provision of Jehovah has attended the witness in Hawaa during the year, as shown by the increase granted by the Lord. The message was spread over a greater area of the islands, and placements of 6,248 bound books and 21,793 booklets, totahng 28,041 pieces of hterature, with 7,840 persons. This is 6,175 pieces more than the year before, and more than 1,200 hours over time devoted to witnessing last year. Sound and phonograph meetings to the number of 1,391, attended by 19,222 persons. Literature placed m English, Japanese, Hocano, Tagalog, Visayan, Chinese, Spanish, Korean, and Portuguese. Complete totals:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">During the year 22 persons took their stand on Jehovah’s side and were immersed. Two study groups were formed on the island of Hawaii, one studying in Spanish, and one in Hoeano. Now the latter group orders a transcription outfit, and, by the Lord’s grace, it is hoped that many more will hear and join m saying, “Come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers: Largest number at any one time was 5, working under handicap of heavy continued rams, and the high cost of travel between islands. Their placements for nine months’ work: 3,586 bound books and 9,926 booklets; totaling 13,498 pieces of literature. Two pioneers are taking one island now as permanent territory and hope to better serve Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The company at Honolulu has been very active and faithful, and the totals of their witnessing are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Books 1,264 Average Number Publishers 6 Obtainers 2,143 Booklets 6,212 Hours 1,259</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each publisher is equipped with phonograph, and 662 meetings were held, attended by 2,367 persons. Two auxiliary publishers in Honolulu placed 1,398 bound books and 5,649 booklets; totaling 7,047 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> books in English were placed, and now, thanks to Jehovah’s provision, they are going out in Japanese and Chinese as well in good numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The crowning blessing of the year was the sending down of the two main convention addresses from Columbus, September 18 and 19. This was indeed a great boon from the Lord, and the listeners at </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font6">gdom Hall were profoundly stirred to greater activity in the Lord’s service. It was a wonderful testimony to Jehovah’s name, and against his enemies. The city was well covered and everyone invited to hear. Large signs were used on cars, and smaller signs as well Parades using sound equipment and cars were held daily. Printed invitations were delivered from house to house. Many shortwave receiving sets enabled a great number to hear, in addition to audience at Kingdom Hall. The enemy here had thought they put the Society’s president “off the air”, and stopped the work, but the September 19 address served a strong notice on them that the Lord’s message was going out in force and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Publishers here rejoiced at the announcement of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font6"> and look forward eagerly to placing it in the hands of the people. One copy has been received, and we are taking turns day by day reading and feeding on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions in the Islands unite in thanking the Lord for the service of the year past, and look forward to greater privileges and opportunities, by the Lord’s grace, in view of the many provisions Jehovah is making for his work through his organization. This report is submitted with many thanks to Jehovah, and with much love and best wishes to you. Brother Rutherford.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark179"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark180"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Considering the vast territory of India, the many castes, the language vernaculars spoken, the ignorance of the people, the depressed conditions under which they must exist, the witness work in India is carried on with a great handicap. During the year bound books and booklets to the number of 94,264 have been placed in the hands of the people. While this is small, the people who have received them give evidence of reading, and many Jonadabs are manifesting themselves as on the side of the Lord. It could be expected, of course, that only a small number would be taken out of that land, but surely God has some people there as in other parts of the earth, and these are showing interest in and a desire for the kingdom of God under Christ. The witnesses of Jehovah in India have the deep sympathy of their companions in other parts of the earth, and this report will increase the sympathy for them and remind each one again that where one member of the body suffers all suffer and where one rejoices they all rejoice. The following is quoted from the report of the local representative in India:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work, of course, is carried on under difficulties. Where is the country where it is not? But in India there are factors peculiar to the country which </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">mili</span><span class="font6">tate against progress, and it will aid the people of othet countries to know something of these conditions. The Indian branch office superintends the work done in India, Burma and Ceylon. India itself is really a continent of nations speaking widely different languages, and the addition of Burma and Ceylon makes this one of the most far-flung fields operated from one office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great mass of the population is religious, steeped in prejudice and superstition. This is true of both educated and the illiterate. The proportion of Indians who are broadminded is very small, hence it is exceedingly difficult to do much work m any given locality; one has to pick out of the mass that which is reasonably likely to give ear to the message, and this entails much time, effort and traveling about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To the pioneer these conditions mean hard work. He is faced with traveling expenses disproportionate to the scope for work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">His boarding expenses are comparatively high (for there are no boarding houses in India such as one finds in every village in Western countries where cheap accommodation can be had), and the cost of supplying him with literature is relatively high because of the long distances and frequent shipments which are necessary. Ono might write a book on the filthy, noisy and climatic conditions facing the pioneer in India. Of course, housecars solve the problem of board and lodging, but, so far as expense is concerned, this is more than counteracted by heavy taxation and cost of petrol. So the pioneer in India is faced with difficulties. The Lord supplies the strength for them to carry on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The total placement of literature this year is 94,264 books and booklets. This is a decrease on last year’s figures, but it does not represent lack of progress. The decrease is all in the placement of vernacular literature, and last year much vernacular literature went out to non-Christian communities without bearing any tangible result. The hours spent in service this year are several thousand more than last year, and the visible result is gratifying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Progress has been made particularly among the Indian Christians of the Punjab. It is estimated that there are now at least a thousand people there who may be classed as Jonadabs, besides many more who are quite eager to listen to the message of the Kingdom but who, as yet, have not dared defy the missionaries under whom they receive certain material benefits in the shape of land settlement schemes, schools, etc. It is often laughable to see how the mission pastors try to prevent the people from hearing the truth, and how the people just boldly tell these hireling shepherds that they have no faith in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The chief drawback to progress in the past has been the lack of means for placing the truth before the people in a way they can assimilate it. The book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font6"> which during the year has been published in four Indian vernaculars, is now facilitating progress and enabling the people to obtain a more comprehensive grasp of the truth. A report from the Punjab says: “The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> book in Urdu has broken the backbone of the enemy, and it is seen in the hands of every Urdu-reading man and woman in the Christian villages around Khanewal. ’ ’ In Travan-core there are 23 centers where </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> studies are now being held, and 12 in the Punjab. There is a lack of capable leaders among these people, but one or two regional servants are trying to cater for all who will organize themselves for study, and progress is being made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the English field the progress has been much slower. The majority of Englishmen in India, and also the Anglo-Indian community, have little regard for God or his Word. A good witness is being given in many localities, especially Bombay city, but the evidence of the real Revelation-Seven type of multitude is scarce. Some have thus identified themselves, of course, but the majority are indifferent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Machine Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sound machine work was very much handicapped by reason of the language problem. During the year the Lord has provided us with our own recording equipment, so that now we are able to make our own records in any language. The short 4j-minute lectures have been translated and recorded on two sides of 12-inch discs, each disc complete with an opening announcement and mention of the literature at the close. This enables anyone to use the machine for witnessing to any community. The results may be judged by the fact that over 60,000 people have attended public lectures, as against about 20,000 last year. There are six transcription machines in the field, three of which have given a really good account of themselves. The others, for various reasons, have been in use only spasmodically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The portable gramophone work has been properly organized and carried on in Bombay city, while a few in the country have also supplied themselves with this equipment. It has enabled us to get into closer touch with the people and to locate those whose interest is sufficient to dig deeper down into the mine of truth. This phase of work, however, suffers somewhat from the general poverty of the people who form Jehovah’s witnesses in India. Not many have been in position to supply themselves with this means of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">House-Cars</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There have been three house-cars operating in India, and one in Ceylon, throughout the year, while an additional one was purchased privately and began operating in India last March. All are equipped with sound machines and, it must be said, without these cars it would have been almost impossible to give an effective witness in the vast majority of Indian Christian settlements. They penetrate into rural areas, give transcription lectures in the vernacular as well as in English, and rarely fail to attract a crowd of people, often to the complete dismay of the missionaries, whose pastures are thus being &quot;spoiled” by the Lord.—Jeremiah 25: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Publications</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the greatest needs, and one which it is not always easy to fill, is the translation and printing of vernacular literature. India is about the limit for languages. There seems to be a different one every hundred miles, and each has its own peculiar script. It makes this work very complicated. We have capable translators for Malayalam, Urdu, Tamil, and Kanarese, but all others have to be done by outsiders and it is costly. Also, in addition to our own requirements, there is a demand for Indian literature in other countries where Indians have settled, notably in the Straits Settlements, Fiji and Africa. During the year </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> has been translated and pubhshed in Malayalam, Tamil, Urdu and Kanarese. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing</span><span class="font6"> was published in Malayalam, Urdu and Gujerati. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Protection,</span><span class="font6"> in Malayalam, Tamil, Urdu, Gurmukhi, Gujerati and Marathi. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered,</span><span class="font6"> in Malayalam; and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon,</span><span class="font6"> in Malayalam and Urdu. All together, 82,000 books and booklets were printed. This represents a good deal of expense, for which there is only a very small return, fot the work is carried on at a great loss. As the Lord supplies the means, so the work is carried on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In conclusion, I wish to express gratitude on behalf of all who have labored in this iield during the year for the Lord’s preserv</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing</span><span class="font6"> care and provision for our needs, and also to say that we have been privileged to carry on the work without any official interference. When we read how the enemy interferes and causes hardship to our brethren in other countries it makes us feel sorry, but glad we are identified with them m this great work. We are grateful to the Lord for an open door of opportunity to serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The total number of pioneers in that land is 28. Twenty-two of them are about the average of those who are continually engaged in the field service. Eleven auxiliaries spend a part of their time in the field. There are 365 company publishers, who do some work. The public meeting attendance during the year has totaled 60,934. The subscriptions for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> have increased during the year. Also the subscriptions for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> magazine. Of course, it will be understood that India cannot finance the work in that land, but must be financed from the Society with funds received from brethren in other parts of the field.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The island of Jamaica makes report in part concerning the work there. The total distribution is 48,000 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is with gratitude to Jehovah God that we hereby forward our report for the work done during the year just ended. We are truly thankful for the privilege of doing the little that was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As you are aware, our island is small and is being worked from end to end. Nevertheless through much zeal and deterurination the workers continue to make some placements, chiefly by the aid of the sound machines, of which we have 83 in the service: 2 sound cars, 6 PTM’s, and 75 phonographs. All are being used to convey the message of God’s kingdom to the people, and it is very gratifying and heart-cheenng to note how many persons of good will are breaking away from the wicked organization of Satan to seek protection in God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The records dealing with the subjects “Exposed” and “Religion and Christianity ’ ’ are making very deep impression on the minds of the public, and many of the people are giving better attention to the message of the Kingdom. One man, an official, on hearing the sound car in his district, tried to evade the message by moving from one room to another, but ultimately he had to approach the car and get a copy of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are pleased to state that there are many homes in this island that are tuning in your lectures, chiefly on Sundays. Your lecture on “Safety” was well received and greatly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The press here, being awfully prejudiced against our publications, will not give us any privilege unless we pay very heavily for same; but we are not discouraged, because we know that God will soon destroy all his enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year we had our general convention in Kingston and several service conventions in other parts of the island, all of which proved very helpful to the friends.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark183"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy exercises great power and influence in Japan and, joining together with the politicians of Japan, has forbidden the distribution of the Society’s literature in either Japan or Korea. Consequently, no books and booklets were distributed in that land during the year. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> being classed as a newspaper, has been permitted to be published. The issues have contained some articles concerning the truth. 1,167,690 copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font7">have been distributed during the year, but these are not counted in as a part of the books and booklets mentioned in the year’s distribution.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Mexican people are showing an increased interest in the truth of and concerning Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ Jesus. This is true both in Old Mexico and along the border line of the United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico. The Society’s branch office in Mexico City has been diligent during the year in sending forth the publications concerning God’s kingdom. There have been shipped out of the office 22,896 bound books and 234,478 booklets, or a total of 257,374 books and booklets. The average number of workers in the field during the year is 243, with 50 pioneers giving all their time. The total number of hours of the workers in the field is 123,499; 110,365 persons have obtained the Kingdom literature, and 51,667 have heard the message as proclaimed by the records reproduced on the sound equipment. It appears that during the year some of the workers have failed to report as to the number of books and booklets placed in the hands of the people, but those who have reported show a total of 20,843 bound books and 214,642 booklets, or a total of 235,485 books and booklets placed in the hands of the people. In addition thereto 500 Bibles have been placed in the hands of the people. In view of the fact that the Mexican people have been so hindered by the Catholic Hierarchy in having possession of the Bible, the 500 Bibles in question will be a great help to those people in finding out about God’s kingdom. There are now in Mexico 124 phonographs which are being put to use in proclaiming the Kingdom message, and for use on those phonographs there are 1,682 recorded dises. The stock of literature recently shipped to Mexico furnishes a good supply for the country for the immediate use of those who are interested in the Kingdom. Recently one worker has been sent into Guatemala and is proceeding with the witness work there, but, at the time of the report’s being received from Mexico, no definite information as to the distribution had been received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The six international campaign periods during the year have increased the activities of the witnesses in Mexico. 29,739 hours were spent in this field work, and 29,173 persons obtained literature concerning the Kingdom. During those periods 62,996 pieces of literature were placed in the hands of the people by the workers, 245 of whom engaged in those campaigns. It has been necessary for the home office to send considerable money to Mexico to aid in the work there, as most of the people are very poor. There were sent out 3,698 letters, 2,440 packages or cartons, and, in addition thereto, 9,353 small packages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year additional literature has been translated and printed for Mexico, as follows: The book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah;</span><span class="font7"> booklets, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Health and Life, Choosing, Protection,</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered.</span><span class="font7"> These books were translated by the Society’s representative at the Mexican branch office, who also translates </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> in Spanish is translated at the Brooklyn office. In addition to the foregoing, a number of Song Books have been published for Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Concerning conventions the Society’s representative reports the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As this was a banner year for Mexico, we also had the “best convention yet” ever held here. Of course, we do not deal in thousands, but in hundreds. A very &quot;active, pleasant and profitable convention was held late in May, at which about 400 were present. Close to 90 publishers were accommodated, for sleeping purposes, in the branch’s headquarters, having as beds 20 cartons of books apiece, in rows. This helped us to solve the storage problem and at the same time furnish sleeping quarters for male workers, who found beds softer and warmer than the cement floor. An empty carton lying flat served them as mattress, and, as they brought their bedding, they did not find it too bad, but rather were pleased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Against Her In Battle&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The keynote of our convention was responding to the call to arise “against her in battle”, in full co-operation with the visible organization. Glad we are to locate our enemies (Jehovah’s enemies) and fight against them with the weapons he has given us, to His glory and for the benefit of the humble and oppressed “Catholic population” and others of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All companies were visited and encouraged during the year, and it was the privilege of the branch servant, returning from Columbus, to visit some of the Spanish-speaking companies in the States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholic Hierarchy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It does not really seem that the government is directly helping the Catholic Hierarchy to regain power here. True, some liberties were accorded to it, to which they would be entitled were it not that it is not a “religious organization” only, but also a “political” one parading as a spiritual helper. As a result, the “meh” they were given is fast becoming a mile. Churches are being reopened, and a little more arrogance is shown by the bigot. But the government once in a while gives her a ‘ ‘ kick ’ ’ to keep her down a little. Recently in a church in Orizaba, in a religious show honoring one of their ‘ ‘ virgins ’ the national anthem was played and sung, but this only succeeded in provoking a fine from the government. We still have splendid opportunities of service among the honest and sincere.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark187"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>NORTHERN EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">For greater efficiency and to facilitate the Kingdom work the Society maintains a branch office at Copenhagen, Denmark, known as the Northern European Office, and which has immediate jurisdiction over the Scandinavian countries of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Iceland. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has desperately attempted to break the ranks of the Lord’s organization in those lands, but has not succeeded. The brethren having zeal for the Kingdom, fired with the further revelation of Jehovah God’s purpose, and having a clearer vision of the Kingdom than ever before, have pressed on with their work and the result exceeds that of a year ago. Within that territory the total distribution of booklets and books for the fiscal year is 1,666,779. The religionists amongst those who think themselves to be for the Kingdom still have an apparent disposition to retard the onward march of the chariot of the Lord, but in this they cannot succeed, of course. A brief resume of the work as viewed from the Northern European Office is given, and then separately the brief report from the respective countries. The Society’s representative in charge of the Northern European Office, amongst other things in his report, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord continues to bless us out of Zion and to send more workers into our ranks, so that we have surpassed all previous records by 7,500 books and 110,000 booklets. Five years ago we had a regular average of 1,030 workers out each week, and a recoid number m a campaign of 1,554, but this year our weekly average was 1,445, and our record number in a campaign 3,147. This is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous m our eyes! There were placed 126,675 books and 1,540,104 booklets, giving a total of 1,666,779. Then when we take into consideration the number who receive </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> by post and in copies placed singly, another 1,052,411 pieces of literature fall to be added, making a grand total of 2,719,190 for the eight countries of Northern Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Testimony Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These were wonderfully blessed again, for we had an average of 2,704 in the field and our placements were 984,025. Such a result for 54 days ’ intensive work left us on each occasion tired but rejoicing. It is grand to visualize the remnant going into the fight as one man all over the earth. They are fearless, for their King knows no defeat. Only by his grace and the continual assistance, monetary and otherwise, which he supplies through his organization, could such results be achieved. We have established records in the placing of big books, little books, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font6"> Praise ye the Lord!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Regional Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have now only ten in all Northern Europe, for the number has been gradually reduced as you directed. These do a very good work, for the brethren m our tiny Companies constantly need more help than where larger companies obtain. Then, too, in isolated districts the great multitude are coming forth and require that help and guidance which we are so glad to give in order that they too may obey the Scriptural command and also say, “Come!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here, of course, we cannot get on over the radio, and therefore many public meetings are held, but, as the sound work comes more and more into its own, these will naturally fall to be restricted somewhat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Riches”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> studies have been established to take care of the newly interested, and quite a few brethren thereafter join the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> studies and take part in the work. This book has been much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year an average of 216 have been out regularly and spread 584,480 pieces of literature, rather more than a third of the total Surely the Lord must love these brethren very dearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Watchtower”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our circulation has gone up by 395 to 6,347, but some 146 of these cannot be got into Memelgebiet. It is somewhat amazing that, with a circulation of 6,347, our record number in the field was only 3,147. The other 3,200, apart from those who are sick, are evidently sound asleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Consolation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This magazine has now a subscription list of 66,959, an increase of 7,235 in the year. Additionally, about 230,000 copies were placed singly. The clergy hate it, but when they attack our doctrines, we deal with them faithfully in our pages as well as with the other wings of the Devil’s organization. People appreciate that, and so they are encouraged to read also the truth articles and finally the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Gramophone Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This has progressed well in Finland during the year, as they could import pressed records, while m Denmark they were talked in singly. Now, however, we have begun to get pressed records in Denmark also, and await supplies in Norway and Sweden. Again and again we have had evidence showing how effective a weapon the gramophone is in breaking down prejudice and opening the way for the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Assemblies</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These have been held from time to time for the encouragement and instruction of the brethren. After the work the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> is studied, and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font6"> and so more and more unity of action is had. It is wonderful to see how in course of time the Lord has trained the &quot;people for his name” so that all over the earth they march forward in solid phalanx against the enemy. They see themselves fulfilling the prophetic dramas which shed light on their pathway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The brethren in many parts were very interested and much encouraged to hear about the conventions in Paris and Prague, which I had the privilege of attending. Such international events fire the imagination of the friends everywhere and are mightily used of Jehovah for the blessing of his people. Mere words are inadequate to express the cumulative effect of your wonderful discourse on Jeremiah sent out by radio to the whole earth on Saturday, September 18. We immediately cabled: &quot;Reception splendid. The Lord strengthened you out of Zion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the year there has been peace for the work in the four old countries and almost complete harmony among the consecrated. This is to be expected; for &quot;Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together”, and, therefore, we &quot;give thanks unto the name of Jehovah”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark189"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Contrary to the prognostication of some of the “evil servant” class, the Jonadabs, or great multitude, continue to come in greater numbers and announce themselves for the King and the Kingdom, and these join heartily with the remnant in the proclamation that Jehovah is God, Christ is King, and the kingdom of heaven is here. Such is the attitude of the people of good will of Denmark. This necessarily has augmented the number of witnesses in the field. During the special testimony periods last year 920 workers took part. The local representative at that office includes in his report to this office the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">AU in aU, we placed 438,327, as against 435,116 last year, and though there was a slight drop in hound hooks, from 25,955 to 25,499, it was more than offset by an increase of 1,684 in our subscription list for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> and the spread of an extra 29,000 copies of that magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This has meant a lot of real hard work, for conditions make it really more difficult to place our literature. However, nothing is impossible with our God. He sends us more workers, and we work more hours; so the work increases to the praise of his name. Workers at times work two and three hours on end without any visible result, other than the hope that they have prepared the people for the next visit. The well-to-do are not interested, and those who are interested are often too poor to take our books. Then, of course, they get some free literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is interesting to note that, roughly, 68 percent of our total placements for the year were made in the six special periods, viz., a total of 295,094 pieces. During the year we received </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font6"> and 15,924 were sent to the companies. It was used as the textbook at Jonadab studies, of which 965 were held, with an attendance vf 13,168, though that number also includes friends present. It is really wonderful to see how quickly people appreciate the truth in these days. Recently a young man got two or three of our booklets, and he has written us as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Through some booklets of Judge Rutherford’s I have come to know the truth, and I was so enthused by a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font6"> book I got hold of that I wrote for all Rutherford’s seventeen books. Then I had a visit from a pioneer, who played some gramophone records, which I liked very much. . . . When one learns the truth, it gives one an entirely new viewpoint. One can understand present world conditions and is not afraid of the coming frightful war, because it will destroy the Devil’s domination over mankind for ever. The truth makes the Bible a wonderful book and shows how great and loving Jehovah God really is. . . . Therefore I write you to ask if you can and will use me in the work. ... I wish to carry out the message about Jehovah, who is in position to give man everlasting life in happiness and to destroy the Devil’s influence over men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since we won our case in the Supreme Court, all our workers have been supplied with identity certificates issued under the seal of the Society, together with a brief explanation as to our work and a reference to the case. This has been proved to be very useful; for on several occasions our brethren have been apprehended and in one instance the case was again carried to the courts. However, m every instance the decision of the Supreme Court has been held to be binding. Doubtless the clergy are behind the police, who are in general very helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In November last year we dealt faithfully in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font6">with five clergymen who misrepresented our doctrines, and we spread a 40,000 edition of that number. Not all clergy are against the truth; for recently one had an hour’s talk with a worker and specially commented on our July number, which also contained a radio talk, “Why the Clergy Oppose the Truth.” He renewed his subscription and also took </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Creation </span><span class="font6">We now requiie a 17,000 edition and shall have to increase it for next year. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> has 2,112 subscribers in Denmark and Norway, an increase of 115. It is easy to see the Lord uses it to feed his people. No mere man could have given the flood of light contained therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The gramophone, of which we have between 40 and 50 heavy ones to take 12- to 15-minute talks, has been used a great deal in the past year, but it was too heavy for door-to-door work. There were played 2,191 different talks, to 4,861 people. Now, however, in September, the first seventy portables were dispatched, and we are in full swing for the manufacture and delivery of another 180. Owing to Valuta difficulties we cannot import these machines. Then, too, we have made arrangements whereby we can have records pressed by the hundred. Without a doubt the Lord has placed this wonderful new weapon m our hands, especially as we cannot get on over the radio. Recently a man and his wife, members of the evangelical part of the State church and strong believers in hell torment, heard a record on child baptism and confirmation. This shook them; for they remarked: “Yes, when the clergy have taught us that child baptism and confirmation are Biblical, there’s likely to be a lot more that’s all wrong. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It just rejoices our hearts to see the truth being spread in this small democratic, liberty-loving land, where the people as a whole are not very “religious” and so can come the more easily to appreciate the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.</span><span class="font6"> few years ago the Catholics tried to present a hospital to Copenhagen, but the medical faculty turned down their offer. At one Boman Catholic se</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">mi-na</span><span class="font6">ry a pnest, who was a teacher, was convicted of sadism; but nothing abashes them, they just cany on their underground woik as usual. Becently, in Bornholm, they opened a hospital and a school and are now doing their level best to get hold of the children. In 1914 Bishop Johannes van Buchs said: “I believe that Denmark will again be Cathohc. We Catholics are working to that end. ’ ’ At that date there were 12,087 Catholics in the country, but now there are 26,000. However, we know that no weapon that is formed against us will prosper, and last year we held 148 public meetings, with an attendance of 24,000, of which 17,000 were strangers. So we come in touch with those who have hearing ears, and invite them to our service conventions, of which we had 24 in the course of the year, attended by 2,632.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At four points in Denmark your inspiring discourse on Jeremiah, given at the Columbus convention on September 18, was heard excellently, and we have just received </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font6"> with the &quot;tan” cover of which you spoke. Already the translation is in full swing, and shortly we hope to have it off to our pnntery in Berne. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Safety</span><span class="font6"> is also being got ready, and we look forward with joy to spreading both of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the time of Columbus convention special stress was laid on the work, in accordance with instructions, and we had three conventions, at Elsmoie, Odense and Banders, when 368 took part in the service and spread 1,107 pieces of literature. No less than a dozen brethren from Denmark visited the Paris convention, and all came back with the firm determination to press the battle to the gate. Truly the Lord has done great things for us: we are glad, and, during the coming year, we shall with our brethren everywhere do our utmost to spread the hard hail and the sweet waters of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bethel family rejoice to share in the witness work, and during the past year an average of 13 spread 12,091 books and booklets. They unanimously asked me to convey their warmest greetings of love, and with that message I gladly associate myself.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark210"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark211"></a>ESTONIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In the face of the continued and vicious opposition put forth by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy the few witnesses of Jehovah in Estonia have pushed forward in their work. From the Society’s local representative at Tallinn a report is filed, from which the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Throughout the past year the work of the Kingdom has gone steadily on. There is a slight increase on last year’s results in the number of books sent out and spread and in the time spent in the service. All together, sixteen brethren engaged in the service as whole-time pioneers. Only ten of these were regular workers each month of the year, and therefore largely responsible for the distributing of 38,279 books and booklets. In actual witness work from door to door they used 14,038 hours and spent the greater part of that time in the rural districts. From ten to fourteen isolated workers, including Jonadabs, devoted 1,685 hours to giv</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ing</span><span class="font6"> witness and placed another 5,099 books and booklets. This is about 1,300 pieces more than were spread by fifteen ‘ ‘ company ’ ’ workers in 2,101 hours last year. Books and booklets otherwise placed with the interested number 563, thus making a grand total of 43,941 volumes distributed. This represents an increase of 2,344 books and booklets on last year’s sum total. Reports received show approximately that, for every big book placed, 12 booklets were placed. The total number of books and booklets dispatched from the depot during the year was 48,866, an increase of 6,524.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As reported last year, it was necessary to have some Estonian books reprinted, and this has been done. Now, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Creation, Dividing the People, Prosperity Sure</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World Recovery</span><span class="font6"> form part of the stock While these pubheations were being prepared and shipped the booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hereafter</span><span class="font6"> was translated and imported for distribution. Thus by the end of the year 1936 several up-to-date pubheations were in circulation. The number of books and booklets then being spread increased, and this brought much encouragement to the brethren. It was like a revival, and there was added joy when instructions to translate </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing </span><span class="font6">were received. These two mighty weapons of truth are now in circulation. About eight months ago 20,000 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing</span><span class="font6"> were received, and the balance on hand today is 8,600. The book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches </span><span class="font6">bids fair also to have a quick distribution, and every effort is being made to get it into the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many are interested in the message contained in the Society’s literature and admit that it is true and necessary, but they do not yet see the great importance of separating themselves from religion and the world and taking their stand pubhely on the side of Jehovah and his </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font6">g- A few do see the issue and have symbolized their consecration to do the will of God, by water </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">i-mm</span><span class="font6">ersinn, and have continued to keep their agreement by publishing the message of the Kingdom as opportunity affords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the early part of this year, by arrangement between the governments of Poland and this country, many hundreds of men and women came from that Roman Catholic country to work in the oil-stone mines and on the farms. These Poles cannot speak the local language, and only a few of them understand Russian; and thus at present, after working hours, they feel the separation from their homeland quite keenly. As might be expected, some of them cannot read or write, but most of those called upon with Polish books containing the Kingdom message have readily taken them. It is hoped that much more may be done to awaken interest in the truth amongst these people; the more so, as it is proposed to bring another batch numbering 4,000 into the country next year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is said that the birth rate in this country is declining, and the Boman Catholic Hierarchy, knowing this, may be attempting to offset that tendency with a view to increasing its own population. It is therefore very appropriate that we are circulating </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Some and Happiness, Protection</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font6"> in the Estonian language. Delivery of the Estonian booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon, </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Piches,</span><span class="font6"> and other books in Bussian and Polish, is expected very soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Constitution of the Estonian Free State has just been revised, and it is of interest to note what it says concerning a few points that are of interest to the Lord’s people. In chapter two, paragraph 14, of this man-made instrument of government it is stated that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Freedom of conscience and religious belief are guaranteed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Adherence to churches and religious societies is free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Certain public rights may be given to the more prominent churches. [These are the Lutheran and Greek Catholic, at present.] There is no State church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The performing of religious services is free, provided this interferes with neither the pubhc peace and order nor morality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A creed or confession of faith cannot be taken as an excuse for the committing of crime or for the failure of one to fulfill the duties of a citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has been possible to continue to send out the truth contained in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> and this has been and is a very great stimulus to those who receive it. Every now and then about fifty copies find their way into the hands of appreciative readers </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informants</span><span class="font6"> to the number of GOO have played their part in guiding the brethren in the service Several of the 211 letters received at the depot were concerning Bible questions, many of which were answered by means of tracts and booklets. All together, 343 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> were spread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So far, sound cars and phonographs are but names to Jehovah’s witnesses in this corner of the field. Good use could be made of a few gramophones with records in Estonian, Bussian and German, and no doubt in due time these will become realities. Meantime the Lord has provided the most modern and effective munitions of war obtainable, and with these instruments a handful of native and foreign publishers are day by day engaging the enemy in battle. Their task is one that calls for determination and devotion to duty, even when conditions are at the best. They travel about on foot and by pushbike searching out the people in their homes and in the fields. Notwithstanding the difficulties encountered, there is scarcely a home in Estonia where a testimony to the name of Jehovah and his kingdom has not been given.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark212"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark213"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">At Helsingfors, Finland, the Society maintains a branch office, and from there comes a gratifying report concerning the progress of the witness work done there during the year. The number of workers is not great, but they are zealous and earnest. Like their companions in other parts of the earth, their vision concerning the Kingdom is clarifying day after day. Viewing the conditions that now exist in this wicked world over which Satan holds dominion, and turning their hearts and faces toward Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ Jesus, the righteous One, they are rejoicing to know that the final conflict between the two is near at hand, that righteousness shall prevail, the victory of the King, Christ Jesus, will be complete, and the desired blessings of every honest heart will be more than realized. It is a blessed company of devoted followers of Christ Jesus, who know no national lines and who are not separated by reason of language, but who are all moved by one spirit, united in the holy cause of righteousness and pressing forward to certain and complete victory. It will give their companions in other parts of the world a real joy to read the following extracts from the report filed in this office by the representative of the Society at Helsingfors, Finland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the following figures you can see the nice increase in the spread literature. The spread of the big books has gone up from 18,031 to 22,179, booklets from 293,447 to 338,334, or the whole spread of books from 311,478 to 360,513. Especially the spread of covered booklets has shown a big increase, from 31,110 to 51,555, which is almost 66 percent increase. Also the papers show an increase, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> copies from 62,011 to 71,336, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> subscriptions from 1,672 to 1,706, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> from 13,992 to 14,831. If we take in consideration also the free literature, the whole spread of literature during tho year has been 918,394, which means more than a copy to eveiy family in Finland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The main reason for the encouraging increase has been, as much as we can see, in the big increase of the work done with sound equipment, which we were privileged to start already last year, and which, after we got the new records spoken in Beme, has shown a marvelous rising. During four months last year we had together 117 meetings, and the attendance was 1,787. But as we in the beginning of this year received the new records the work has increased month by month, and now over 100 machines are in use in Finland, and Finnish records have been sent from our office to an amount of 1,170. During the whole year there have been held 2,896 gramophone lectures, to an attendance of 26,510. It is interesting to compare it with the public lectures held during the previous year. The number of public lectures then were 165, to an attendance of 28,697. And as we have this year had 171 public lectures, to an attendance of 17,636, we have succeeded in coming in connection with many more interested than ever before. That shows clearly that the Lord’s tune has come to gather the great multitude, and he has given us the means to carry the message to them so that they may be able to take their stand on his side before Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work with sound equipment has awakened a great interest, opening now ways to forward the truth. So one owner of a bathing establishment bought the records and with the aid of a loud-speaker is letting his customers hear the lectures. In another place a brother succeeded in arranging a meeting in a big factory, where 100 workers were watching the machines. At an appointed time all machines were stopped, and as it was the working time, all the workers had to stop on their places at the machines and listen to the lectures. He said that it was a wonderful occasion to see how the machines stopped before the voice of the truth. After the meeting 60 of the 100 took books, showing a great interest. From open-air meetings we have also many good and interesting reports. We have observed that people even at a distance of two miles have heard the lectures, desiring afterwards to know more of the truth. I myself have also had the joy to go from home to home with one of the gramophones made at the head office, and the people have been so interested that they have offered money in order to hear more. That has, of course, given me the best opportunity to present them literature, and it has been apparent that after the lectures it is much easier to place literature, especially big books, than otherwise. We are very grateful that you arranged so that still new records were prepared at Berne, as the demand for records is still increasing, although it was a pity that it was not possible to get enough good records for the whole amount we wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There has been also another great help in the woik during this year, and that has been the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Etches,</span><span class="font6"> which has aroused great interest, and certainly the truths set forth in that book are meat in due season not only for the anointed but also for the great multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every one who has had the privilege of working for the truth as it is directed by the Society should not have the least doubt that the Lord himself is guiding the Society. Who else could give the splendid explanations of the prophecies which we have read in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Towers.</span><span class="font6"> They are too many and too marvelous to even be hinted in this connection. They are far beyond what a human </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font6">d could find out. Only a blinded fool can’t see it. Another marvelous matter is the scheme of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">periods.</span><span class="font6"> It is so wonderful to see the brethren all over the whole earth arise and fearlessly proclaim the truth as one man, and the joy filling our hearts is so sweet that only the Lord can give anything of that kind. Is it any wonder that half of the amount of the books during the whole year have been spread just during the periods, amounting to 183,568 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The biggest number of workers last year was 777, with an average output of books 401. This year the biggest number of workers has been 760, but the average output 475. Of the whole amount of books, the pioneers have spread 85,127, and together with auxiliaries, 104,746. That shows that pioneers have spread 5,000 more than the year before, which is, of course, encouraging, as many of the pioneers have to work in poor and veiy thinly populated districts. A considerable amount of work has been done by our ordinary regional servants. Not only have they helped the classes with advice and guided the friends into the service work, holding also public lectures, but they have additionally acted as real pioneers, spreading a considerable amount of literature. Their whole output has been 15,625 books and booklets, 2,147 copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font6"> and 476 subscriptions, or, together, 18,248, which means about 5,500 each, as only in the begi</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">nnin</span><span class="font6">g of the year we had four, and afterwards only three in that service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The little Bethel family has shown great diligence in the service work, and they have spread 18,226 books and booklets, 1,853 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> copies, and 561 subscriptions, or, together, 20,640.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A special encouragement have been the 59 conventions, at which the highest number of workers was 323. At these conventions were spread 35,702 books and booklets, and 57 symbolized their consecration. Especially the annual convention in Hels</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">inki</span><span class="font6"> was of great encouragement to the friends. Some of the speakers had had the opportunity to be present at the marvelous convention in Eans and had succeeded in taking a good amount of the fine spiritual food with them, and as it was presented to the fnends, the joy and enthusiasm rose day by day; and although we at the service occasions offered only big books and covered booklets, the result was very fine, 609 books and 3,000 booklets. In the end of the convention were heard the remarks that it was the best convention ever held in Finland, and it was certain that never has a better spirit aiid greater zeal prevailed at any convention in Finland. With great enthusiasm the friends decided to send their love to you, dear Brother Rutherford, and to the convention in Columbus.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark214"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark215"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The population in Iceland is very limited. The workers are fewer, but the zeal manifested by those who labor there is that peculiar to the Lord’s organization. From Iceland’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The work here during the past year has been somewhat hindered by the lack of new books. However, the one pioneer who is there spread 2,898 pieces of literature. At the moment </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches, Protection</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font6"> are going through the press in Brooklyn, and these in due course will give a welcome fillip to the work and fresh encouragement to the worker. We are glad of the continued support given by Headquarters to the work in this large territory with its small population.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark216"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark217"></a>LATVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Wherever the combined influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy together with the present politicians of Germany reaches, there is great opposition to the message of God’s kingdom. This only increases the evidence that the combine of Romanism, Nazism, Fascism and rebellion are all against God and his kingdom and that soon these shall perish from the earth. The small country of Latvia contains some true and sincere followers of Christ Jesus, who are anxious to proclaim the message and who do so. At Riga the Society maintains an office and a local representative, and from his report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year just ended has seen no relief from the vexatious hindrances and restrictions imposed by the operation of martial law, which has now been in force since May, 1934. There has been little of unusual interest, but it is pleasing to report a steady increase throughout the year in the amount of literature spread and to mark the appreciation of our message by the people. ‘ ‘Bring me some of those books which tell of Satan’s organization,” and, “We read only the Bible Students’ literature, ’ ’ were among some of the comments made to publishers. On another occasion, a worker was told by a woman on whom sho called: “I’ll show you a book that a book about the Bible,<sup>1</sup> ’ and who then went into the house and brought out a well-used copy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is evidence here, as elsewhere in the world, of the sinister designs of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. It is clear to be seen that that organization purposes to strengthen its hold over the people of Latvia. The eastern province, Latgale, bordering Russia, has always been predominantly Boman Catholic, but the other parts of the country are mainly Lutheran. In August, this year, a provincial council was held in Riga, attended by 57 clergymen and presided over by a papal nuncio. At this synod two papal bulls were read, one raising the archbishop of Riga to the rank of metropolitan, the other creating a new bishopric to include the western and southern provinces of Kurzeme and Zemgale, with the seat of the bishop at Libau. During or at the conclusion of the synod, the new metropolitan, called personally upon the dictator and promised in the name of the synod to co-operate with the government for the good of the state and people of Latvia. Photographs of the metropolitan and dictator taken together on this occasion were published in the newspapers. In this connection it is of interest to note that the vice-minister for education m Latvia is a Catholic priest, notwithstanding the State rehgion is Lutheran.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Last year the distribution was almost equally divided between pioneers and companies. This year the figures for the pioneers show an increase of nearly 9b percent. The companies too have done better; their figures represent an increase of 21 percent over those for the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> that link which in one way unites us to the Lord and to one another, comes to us regularly and is studied with deep interest. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> also keeps us informed of Kingdom activities and other interesting events in. other parts of the earth, and is read with much interest. This latter magazine is, however, restricted to those who read English and German.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The friends here all unite with me m sending you their warm love and all best wishes.</span></p>

Together with their political allies, they carry on a racket by which the people are robbed of their money and deprived of their liberty of learning concerning God’s gracious provision </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font7"> humankind. That wicked and unholy alliance always opposes the truth, because it is the instrument of the prince of darkness. Darkness surrounds them, and gross darkness those people who support them. In that land of darkness there are some faithful and true followers of Christ Jesus, who during the year have put forth their best endeavors to serve the King and the Kingdom. From the local representative’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is a religious country, full of “churches”, crosses and the accompanying parasites, priests, monks and nuns. As is therefore to be expected, the Word of God and the message of his kingdom are opposed with bitterness. The claim is made that the clergy have no influence with the government; but the facts prove to the contrary, for action is taken time and again against the publishers of the Kingdom message, by the authorities and at the instigation of the representatives of the Hierarchy, working, as ever, in the background.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each year a further move is made to prevent the message of the Kingdom from reaching the people. This year particular attention has been paid to the district known as Memelgebiet, mandated territory formerly a part of Germany. Up to a few months ago action here has been taken by the local authorities only, moved by the local (Lutheran) clergy; but evidently these children have not accomplished what theii father has desired, and another part of his brood have now taken action, namely, the Boman Catholic clergy, working through the central government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this territory the friends speak German, and the literature spread is chiefly in that language, obtained from abroad and therefore having to pass through the office of the censor. For several years the Society has been registered in Memel, and, when court action has been taken against us at the instigation of the religionists, in each case a decision in our favor has been reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These facts prove that the cential authorities are, or should be, fully aware of our purpose and work, and that everything has been carried on in harmony with the existing laws. It was therefore surprising when some of the workers were arrested and their literature confiscated. Following this the home of the local regional servant was searched and suggestions of “Communistic activity” were made. This showed that the Hierarchy were behind the move. The authorities, as the above-mentioned facts show, know full well that there is not a whit of truth m such suggestions; but they demanded that the stock of literature be returned to the country of origin or destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shortly after this the regional servant received a paper from the military commandant of this district stating that the latter had considered the case and had reached the conclusion that the defendant was guilty of “spreading literature which </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'had caused </span><span class="font6">one section of the community to rise against the other”. It is hardly necessary to remark that no such rising has ever taken place. A heavy fine with the option of imprisonment was imposed. There was no trial of any kind; no opportunity for explanation or defense, and practically no opportunity for an appeal. Lovers of liberty in other lands might think such conditions impossible in a country boasting of its freedom, and especially m mandated territory. Furthermore, the regional servant was “warned” to have nothing more to do with the Society, although the latter is a registered, legal body. Some idea of the slight attention given to the matter by the military commander may be had when it is known that the Society, clearly registered as the “International Bible Students’ Association”, is referred to in the above-mentioned document as a “Bible explanation society”. As a result of this action, literature of the Society sent from other countries is stopped by the postal and customs authorities, although freedom of the post and “religion” are guaranteed under the constitution In a state of emergency, however, such paragraphs can be suspended, and where the message of the kingdom of Jehovah is being spread a state of real emergency exists so far as the religionists are concerned, for their refuge of lies is being exposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This opposition has affected the amount of literature spread, but the Devil has not had matters all liis own way, as 10,645 books and booklets have been placed in the hands of the people, and, apart from copies sent to regular subscribers, 1,830 numbers of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> have also been spread. These results have been accomplished by a weekly average of only 3 pioneers and 12 company workers, frequently over very scattered territory. Conditions among the people generally are very bad. Prices are high and wages very low, especially in the country districts. It is not unusual to meet people who have absolutely no money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As it is impossible to import literature, most of the work has been carried on with books and booklets which were first published several years ago. For example, the latest booklet in Lithuanian is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis.</span><span class="font6"> Only very few of the later booklets have been received through the post. This adds to the difficulties of the work, as many people who already have the literature would take new books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some who have hitherto taken an active part in the service work have left us. One man, for many years a zealous worker, allowed family ties to bind him and renounced his privileges in the service of Jehovah to join his Nazi sons in Germany. He has actually started work in a munition factory and is, of course, “heiling” with the others and supporting those who are persecuting, torturing and murdering his erstwhile brethren. This would not be worth while mentioning were it not for the fact that it is an example of the manner in which the Devil is able to subvert those who fail to remember that it is complete loyalty and faithfulness that is required of those who would continue in the favor of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In closing, I would like to mention what a joy it was to share in the Columbus convention to some extent. Apart from a few woi ds lost while t</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">unin</span><span class="font6">g in during about three minutes, the whole of the address on the Saturday was heard, and it was indeed thrilling. Unfortunately nothing was heard of the public lecture on the Sunday.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark220"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark221"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It is gratifying to note that those who have formed the great multitude are coming from every country where the message of the Kingdom is proclaimed, and this serves to remind Jehovah’s witnesses of the responsibility resting upon them to put forth all diligence in faithfully representing Jehovah’s kingdom, safeguarding the Kingdom interests and giving close heed to the commandments of the Lord to proclaim the praises of the King and the Kingdom. Oslo, Norway, supports an office of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, which branch has jurisdiction over Norway and is under the jurisdiction of the Northern European Office, as heretofore stated. The local representative at Oslo files a report here, from which the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By the Lord’s grace we have also this year walked in the light, and been delivered from the snare of &quot;the fowler’’, and with our heart’s sure conviction we have the privilege to be among them that are exalting Jehovah’s great name today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Also this year the work in Norway has progressed. The great multitude is more and more partaking in the witness work from door to door. Their zeal and devotion are very encouraging to remark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The publishers have spread 25,123 books and 252,972 booklets; in all, 278,095. It is 31,658 more than last year. Of this are 7,835 books more. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age (Ny Verden)</span><span class="font6"> has 8,544 subscribers; 2,354 more than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have sent out 10,000 copies of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font6"> 17 companies are organized for service, and the average number of publishers in the witness work each week is 143. Forty-two pioneers and auxiliaries have been out; 8 more than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brom the head office we have got 9,000 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font6"> and in six months the whole stock was gone. But we hope soon to receive the 10,COO </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hiches</span><span class="font6"> ordered. It is a wonderful hook and fine for teaching the great multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The remnant and Jonadabs work together in good harmony in the companies. Just a few friends have been snared by the Devil on account of the activity by the Judas class in America, whose agitation also has reached Norway, but just a few of those who have not kept their hearts clean have believed their indictments. Practically the whole flock of the publishers Ure going on without noticing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This year we have had no notification from the police, only some malicious articles in some country papers. As a rule we have been permitted to give an answer. The result has generally been that the people Wanted to read the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Divisional Campaigns</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These have been a great encouragement and have also specially been richly blessed of Jehovah. As usual the companies have been out by buses, trains, ships, cycles, and motorboats, on Sundays, up to 80 miles from their home towns, and, with autocars every day in the surrounding country, a lot of literature has been spread and the publishers always extremely happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Motorboats</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The two brethren on the Society's boat “Ester” have done a great work on the west coast. They have had many interesting experiences. They arrived once at a place where the people had a colossal interest for the truth, so in five days they spread 53 books, and one Of the people told them that in this little district the people were legulated by the books of Brother Bussell and Bi other Eutherfdrd. Practically every home was interested. A district with 1,500 people, more than the half of it was interested in the truth. The church was empty, no sign of inission work, 95 percent of them had read some of the books. This year the brethren have distributed 13,913 pieces of literature; 2,453 more than last year. Another young man with his wife sold their small house and bought a motorboat for pioneering. They are also doing a good work on the south part of the west coast. In north Norway two brethren 70 years old and a third 35 years old bought a motorboat and are going from place to place doing a real pioneer work on the thousands of islands and in those long fjords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Broadcasting</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Still we are not allowed to speak in the radio. Ender these circumstances we are glad to have our magazine, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age (Ny Verden).</span><span class="font6"> We often hear that some people prefer to read a magazine, rather than a book, and when </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ny Verden</span><span class="font6"> is visiting them by post every month, they get the truth in small shares dropping into their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are not able to visit those long and many fjords more than once a year, some places every second year, and therefore it is fine to be able to send them </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ny Verden</span><span class="font6"> every month. 8,544 subscriptions and about 1,257 single copies are going out every month, so an average of 10,000 people are reading the magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonograph Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The phonograph work is just now to be started. We shall be glad to go on with full speed when our new records arrive. Just now we had the pleasure to receive 95 of the new portable phonographs from the head office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Economic Pressure</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The economic pressure is still hard, and many people out of work, but the last of this year has been upward-bound with great rise of prices, as Norway has a proportionally great fleet of merchantmen who got much freight on account of the war in Spain and China. The government such as we now have in Norway is surely trying to do their best, but they are now feeling they can’t help as they thought. Remarkable to think that the Norwegian king is chairman for a government which is socialistic-communistic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Hierarchy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Hierarchy is more and more working in Norway in spite of the fact that the Norwegian fundamental law forbids the Jesuits to stay in the country. They are smuggling themselves in by building fine fashionable hospitals in nearly every town and engage the most clever doctors, especially surgeons, and start language schools for girls, to catch them and their parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Paris Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All of us were encouraged to get your greeting through Brother Dey, with your words to the friends, to wit: “Let us work and fight, and die with our boots on.’’ And that will we do. Our hearts sympathize with all our brethren in Germany and other places, where they are persecuted, and we pray Jehovah to strengthen them to be steadfast and faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Columbus Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We participated by going from door to door. In the Bethel home we succeeded Saturday in listening to your speech on the radio. We had some disturbances, but, as a whole, it was fine. Very encouraging to listen to your inspiring speech, and remark the power the Lord gave you. We heard the friends’ applause as a sound of many waters. The song and music were very distinct; we fetched our song books and joined in the singing, so we felt as if we were participating in the convention. We remarked the new book coming and the changing of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font6"> We got some enthusiastic reports from friends who also heard you.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark222"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark223"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Kingdom message has gone forth to the people of Sweden during the year, the work being directed from Stockholm, where the Society maintains a branch office. There has been difficulty in getting phonographs in use in Sweden, but this difficulty we believe will shortly be overcome. As the facts show, the phonograph is increasing the witness work in other countries, and it should be expected that they will have a like result in Sweden. Those professing to be followers of Christ Jesus are zealous in the work. The few complainers are not retarding it, but it is a great pity that they do not see their privilege to lay aside all selfishness and join heartily in announcing the Kingdom. There is nothing that can be compared with the Kingdom, nothing that can bring blessings to the people like it; in fact, nothing will bless them at all except God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus. Everyone who appreciates this fact is now giving all diligence to make proclamation to those who have a hearing ear that the kingdom of heaven is near at hand, and pointing them to the admonition given by Jehovah that the people shall trust in the King because in Him is the only hope. It is gratifying to see the zeal manifested by the brethren in Sweden, and from the local representative’s report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Limited though our resources are, as compared with those of our brethren in bigger countries, and without the aid of the radio (which is still completely State-controlled and will probably so continue until Armageddon) or of sound cars, and with only a very limited number of phonographs yet available, we have still been able to keep our ground, and even make some progress. No persecutions have been met with; with the one exception of the radio ban, we have been allowed perfect freedom of work. The population is comparatively prosperous, owing, it is true, to the colossal boom in the armament industry, Sweden being a supplier of both raw material and finished products along this line. Thinking people, of course, see the graveness of the situation, and so many good-willed ones have been found who have gladly accepted the Kingdom message and lined up on the side of the new and rightful King and started to proclaim his message as commanded in Revelation 22:17: &quot;Let him that heareth say, Come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are now the number of 1,109 persons in Sweden who hold a peimit from the Society to act as publishers, aside from the pioneers. This is an increase of 149 over last year, and the number who have been out in the work regularly week by week has increased by 47 to 455. In the number of hours worked there is, seemingly, a decrease: This year the hours amount to 139,644, as against 154,789 last year, but then we counted, during the first six months, half of the time used for travel to and from districts; thus, in fact, there is at least no drop, but probably an increase, seeing that it takes a long time to get to the districts, or territories, m many parts of this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature Placed</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the 538,464 copies of books and booklets sent out from the office the number of 518,566 have been actually placed among the people. There were placed 48,980 bound books, which is 2,646 less than last year, owing to the fact that this year we have not got any new item to offer. (We are still waiting for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font6"> book, which is being done for us at the Brooklyn plant.) Of the bound books placed about four-sevenths were </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Biches. </span><span class="font6">Of the “colored” booklets we placed 97,450, an increase of 15,189, and of the “white” ones, 372,827, or 19,827 more than last year. Thus the net increase is 32,370 copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The now regularly returning international periods of witnessing have proved to be a great blessing this year as ever previously. Well over half of all literature placed during the year was put in the hands of the people in these periods. Below I give a table showing number of publishers in the field, hours worked and literature placed during each of the six periods.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">Name of period “Battle Shout” “His Victory” “Jehovah of Hosts” ‘ ‘ Faithful Warrior ’ ’ “Ghttering Sword” “Mount Perazim”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">The number in the field during ‘ ‘ Faithful Warrior ’ ’ was the biggest ever in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fifty-eight persons have been engaged in this service, winch is one more than last year, and the average per month was 49. It is indeed encouraging to see how some old ones still carry on with rejoicing, and new ones entering, some after having known the truth but a short time. Seeing that some have to leave this branch of service for such reasons as poor health, family obligations, etc., and because we have not been able to cover all our territory so often as we would like to, there is still room for more brethren to join this line of service. And to those who put their backs to the work with a real zeal, using proper forethought and planning, and follow the advices given by the organization, there are rich blessings, and Jehovah makes them to prosper in a wonderful way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A special joy to the pioneer is when some Jonadab is met who has been waiting for someone to come and take him by the hand and show him how to start regular witnessing and put him in contact with the organization. In this way several little groups of Jonadabs have been formed, and as soon as possible a regional servant is sent round to help them, organizing the work on a proper basis, starting regular studies, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Regional Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Four brothers have been engaged in this work, who have 95,581 miles of travel to report. This is somewhat less than last year, owing to the fact that there were five brothers occupied in this service during the first months of that year. They have held 405 public meetings, attended by 19,052. The number of meetings is 42 more than last year, whereas the attendance has decreased by 4,005; this is due to the fact that last year we had two big public meetings at the capital, Stockholm, one of them the biggest had in tliis country, addressed by Brother Howlett, and tliis year it has not been convenient to arrange any such big meeting at Stockholm. The attendance at the smaller meetings held in the country places, however, has been decidedly increasing. As these meetings are mostly advertised by poster bills, the number of folders put out is consequently down. The meetings hold for friends were 758, one less than last year, but attendance was up by 1,383, to 14,028.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Speaking of meetings I beg to say, too, that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> studies are progressing in an encouraging way, and it has proved a good thing to have the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> study chairmen lead those among the attendants, who desire to take part in the work, out on stated occasions as a group by themselves; later they are joining the companies, attending their service meetings and getting regular territory assignments. That the great multitude is thus being helped along is an indisputable fact. Among our limited number there are many of that company, which is shown by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Memorial figures: 1,128 persons attended the Memorial service, 711 took part of the emblems, and 1,052 went out m work during the period at that season. And more are coming along all the time, even more than shown by the figures of publishers in the field, because some of the older ones are dying, and others becoming so bodily weak that they cannot go out, and so the increase m numbers out is so much bigger, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The regional servants have a great service to do in this country where there are no possibilities of getting lectures out to the isolated friends over the radio; some of these friends do not see another Christian’s face except when the regional servant calls. And it is a real encouragement to them to have him around, giving public lectures as well as talking to them about the work. On one such occasion just the other day, the regional servant and the isolated brother had to go by bicycle 18 miles in pouring rain to get home after a public meeting arranged in a small village still farther back in the woods. It was just forest, forest, forest, the brother wrote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonographs</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In places like the one just above described, as well as all over, these machines will be a real blessing. Just a month ago we had quite a big shipment of phonographs sent us from Brooklyn, but we are still waiting for the records. These were spoken in, in March, down in Paris, as you instructed, but there have been several delays from the manufacturers, and when this report is being written there is no word of their having been shipped. But, as the saying has it in Sweden, one who waits for something good does not wait too long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Whether big or small, these gatherings are a special blessing. In Sweden there have &quot;been held 24 service conventions during the year, attended by a total number of 2,074, of which 82 symbolized their consociation to do the will of God. 12,574 copies of literature were spread during these conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Seven friends from Sweden attended the Paris international convention last August and carried home many valuable lessons and happy memories therefrom. At Columbus none of us could attend in person, but some did listen in to your talk, Saturday, September 18, and were able to get the discourse and catch up some of the enthusiasm manifested by the vast throng gathered there. Prom one place the friends reported that they had listened in although they did not understand the English language; they recognized the tunes, though, and joined in the singing, having tears in their eyes for joy because of the realization of oneness thus experienced. The broadcast of your public lecture on the Sunday did not go through, though, to any point in Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Golden Age”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By the Lord’s grace this magazine has continued to do its good work in “sweetening the waters” for the people. Many persons now rejoicing in the truth had their first taste of it from this journal, and it is doing a great work in preparing the way for the books to get into the homes. The number of subscribers is increasing year by year. The last three years now, the increase has been very nearly 3,000 annually: in 1935 we had 23,624 subscriptions, in 1936 the number was 26,498, and now it has risen to 29,401. There are good prospects of getting past the 30,000 mark in a few days’ time. Loose copies were placed to the number of 71,124, or 11,925 more than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The new name for this magazine will be effective in Sweden from January 1, according to the Postal regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Watchtower”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This magazine is now being sent in the Swedish language to 2,334 subscribers, an increase in the list of 163. And certainly it is being appreciated. How could a child of God exist without the food there provided for him by the loving Father? And how it answers all our questions, in Jehovah’s own due time, and settles matters to our full satisfaction! It is true there are some, wise in their own conceit, who reckon that they can get out “underlying thoughts” from the presentations in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tower, </span><span class="font6">which are too deep for the majority of us who are not on the same spiritual level with them, as they claim. But we desire to appropriate to ourselves the tilings stated, and not to speculate as to thoughts “behind” the plainly written words. These “wise” ones are, I am glad to say, but a small minority, even though some of them are able to “raise a cry”, and in some companies they have gone so far as to make it necessary for the loyal ones to ask them to keep quiet altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We thank God, Brother Rutherford, that he has been so wonderfully using you, all through this past year as hitherto, in explaining to us the meaning of the grand prophetic dramas now going into fulfillment and applying in full weight for the encouragement and guidance of his faithful servants. May we always be found of a teachable and truly childlike disposition, willing to accept the instruction given through the appointed channel, and then going forth to honor our Father by obeying his commandments according to 'the law of our mother’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In closing I beg to convey to you my own very best love and that of the office staff. We are all enjoying our privileges of service and desirous of co-operating to the best of our ability in this grand work of vindicating Jehovah’s blessed and holy name. May he keep you, and all of us, in the shadow of his hand as a testimony to his own power and wisdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark230"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark231"></a>PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The poor means of transportation has been the chief means of retarding the work in the Philippine Islands during the year. Many of the pioneers have to travel for long distances between points where they work, and this has hindered the placement of literature. During the year 81,935 books and booklets have been placed in the hands of the people. It must be remembered that the native people of the Philippine Islands are very poor and many of them very ignorant. The sound machines and phonographs are doing good work. Many who are unable to read can understand the message when spoken, and thus show a real interest in the truth. The phonograph has only recently been introduced in the Philippines, and there is a marked development in the interest shown by the people by reason thereof.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark232"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark233"></a>SPAIN AND PORTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Because of the war in Spain no report from there this year could be had. Portugal being under the direction of Madrid, likewise no report from Portugal could be had. There has been some literature distributed in both places, but there is no way of ascertaining the amounts so far as this office is concerned.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The work in Syria during the year has made very little progress. Not a great number are interested in the truth in that land, and those who are interested do not seem to be unusually diligent in the work. Most of the work done there during the year was done by a brother who journeyed from America and worked there for a season, and that brother is returning shortly to Syria, and we expect the work to make further progress during the year. Books and booklets to the number of 2,142 have been placed in the hands of the people. Recently the phonograph records have been made in the Arabic language, and this is aiding in the introduction of the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">At this depot or branch the work has not progressed during the year. The distribution of the literature is down because of the interference of the government, acting at the behest of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. 21,518 books and booklets have been placed in the hands of the people. 79 phonographs are in use, and 6 electrical transcription machines and one sound car. The chief part of the work has been done with these, the attendance at these sound meetings totaling 51,982. 78 public meetings were held, addressed by persons, the total attendance at which was only 1,375.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark238"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark239"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">Why should men oppose the kingdom of God and persecute those persons who make known that kingdom to others as the only means of their blessing? Why should Jehovah’s witnesses be persecuted, arrested, fined and imprisoned on the false charges of peddling without a license and going from door to door without a permit, when the indisputable facts show they are carrying the message of God to the people as He has commanded, and this they are doing at a financial loss to themselves? Generally men are reasonable about things of this world which they understand. Court officials try to hear the evidence and render a reasonable judgment. This cannot be said to be true of their dealing with Jehovah’s witnesses Then it must be that public officials and judges of courts who cause the arrest and punishment of Jehovah’s witnesses do so either maliciously or else ignorantly and without understanding. The most reasonable and charitable view to take of the matter is that such public officials are made blind to the truth by reason of the influence and false representations made to them by the religious agents of the Devil. The clergy of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy take the lead in exercising such undue and wrongful influence. They are politicians bent upon the “Catholic Action” gaining complete control of the people. The time is not far distant when the political and commercial elements of the ruling powers of the present day will see that they have been woefully deceived and misled by the religionists, and particularly by the clergy of the Roman Catholic Hierachy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But why does God permit such opposition to his kingdom and to his witnesses? There are two reasons: (1) the opposition furnishes opportunity for his devoted witnesses to prove their integrity to God under adverse conditions, and thus they prove that Satan’s statement to the effect that God cannot put men on earth who will be faithful to him when subjected to persecution, is a lie and Satan is a liar; (2) the opportunity is also furnished for those who are against God and his kingdom to fully identify themselves as being on the side of the Devil and fit for destruction. By opposing God’s kingdom and persecuting his witnesses they thus identify themselves. They will have no excuse at Armageddon and nothing to offer in mitigation of the punishment God will inflict upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The consecrated followers of Christ Jesus must be fully obedient to God’s commandment, and particularly the commandments set forth below, to wit: ‘And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached to all nations as a witness, and then shall the end come.’ (Matt. 24:14) ‘ ‘ Thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.” (Ezek. 33:7-9) “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, east up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.” (Isa. 62:10) “And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.”—Acts 3:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The religionists try to compel Jehovah’s witnesses to obtain permission to preach “this gospel of the kingdom” and to get this permission from worldly men, regardless of God’s commandment. They induce the lawmaking bodies and law-enforcement officers to compel men to salute flags and hail leaders and bow down to such things, in utter violation of God’s law. (Ex. 20: 2-5) If the Christian obeys these laws he violates God’s law and commandment and subjects himself to complete destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Christian must obey God, and it pleases him to obey God, because he loves God and his kingdom; and therefore as the apostles of Jesus said, so now say all of Jehovah’s witnesses: ‘We must obey God rather than men. ’—Acts 5: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In obedience to God’s commandments these faithful witnesses of the Most High have gone forward during the fiscal year now just closed bringing the fruits or message of the Kingdom to the people. At the conclusion of the fiscal year ending 1936 the books containing the message of the Kingdom and published by this Society from and after the year 1921 to that date had been placed in the hands of the people, to the aggregate number of 229,675,028. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 1937, there were added to the foregoing, books and booklets to the number of 22,577,146, thus making the grand total of distribution of such publications, to the end of this fiscal year, 252,252,174 volumes. This in addition to the radio and sound-machine methods of preaching the gospel. Never in the history of man has there been such a witness to the Lord’s kingdom, and it has all been done by the grace of the Lord, and to him is due all praise and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This report is submitted, hoping that it may bring courage and confidence to those who are devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom and that each and every one of Jehovah’s anointed remnant and the Jonadabs will continue to press forward, holding high the banner of truth and thus honoring the name of Jehovah, his King and his kingdom, having in mind at all times that the day of deliverance is at hand and soon the will of God will be done on earth as it is done in heaven, and then every creature that lives and breathes shall sing his praises and dwell in everlasting peace and joy unto the Lord’s glory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">‘Be not afraid,: the battle is God’s&quot; —2 Chron. 20:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font0">EHOVAH has graciously revealed to his servants the complete identity of his enemies. He commands his servants to engage the enemy in battle. The “faithful and wise servant” the Lord has made ruler over all his earthly kingdom interests or “possessions”, and has commanded his servants to protect, safeguard and advance such Kingdom interests. The Jonadabs join the remnant in their witness Work. The visible instruments of Satan, arrayed against God’s people, are the religionists, aided and abetted by lovers of money and political job-holders. Those men have conspired together to deprive the “faithful and wise servant” of their “possessions” or Kingdom interests and are bent on the destruction of God’s people. Seeing the wicked horde moving against them, the faithful servants of Jehovah fully realize their inability to cope with the enemy. From the human viewpoint the position of the servants of God now on earth appears to be hopeless; but it is not so in fact.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark241"></a><span class="font0">Jehovah caused his covenant people, Israel, and their enemies, to wit, Moab, Ammon and Mount Seir, to make a prophetic picture exactly describing the present-day relation of his covenant people to their enemies, the religion-199 ists and others. As then, so now there is a mighty multitude of the enemy pitted against the small number of God’s servants on earth, the latter realizing that in themselves they have no strength; and yet they do not fear the Devil or any of his visible horde. The faithful trust in God, who says to them: ‘Sanctify Jehovah of hosts, and let him be your fear.’ (Isa. 8:13, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font0"> The war is now in progress, and on comes the multitudinous enemy with murderous intent and with much boasting noise. For the encouragement and assurance of his faithful servants Jehovah now says to them: “Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.” The forces led by Christ Jesus are invincible, and the time has come to vindicate Jehovah’s name. Obeying every commandment of the Lord, his faithful servants are certain to share with him in his complete victory over the enemy. Let the faithful servants and companions, now fully united in action, march on against the enemy and, as they go, continue to sing the praises of the Most High and of his glorious King. The enemy shall bite the dust, and God’s faithful servants shall see it and rejoice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. Who is like unto Jehovah our God, that hath his seat on high?—Ps. 113: 4, 5, A.P.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah is supreme. He is the Creator of heaven and earth, and the fullness thereof belongs to him. From the beginning his purpose is that all creation that lives .shall praise his name and do so joyfully. That purpose is certain to be fulfilled. The faithful prophets of old wrote of that purpose. Jesus often emphasized the paramount importance of magnifying Jehovah’s name, and the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ frequently spoke of the supremacy of Jehovah’s name. But when so-called “followers” began to practice religion and called it “the Christian religion” they soon lost sight of the name of the Most High and of the supreme importance of magnifying his holy name. In due time at the temple the matter was made clear, and now, thanks to God, the faithful and true see that Jehovah’s name is the great issue and shall be vindicated. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Cause all the nations to whom I send thee to drink it. And they shall drink.—Jer. 25:15, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses must carry the message and proclaim it, regardless of any organization. They are merely bringing the message of Almighty God and are not claiming any credit whatever to themselves. It is impossible for Jehovah’s witnesses to make “Christendom” drink the contents of the cup, but they bring the message to “Christendom”, informing them of God’s purpose. Jeremiah could not “cause all the nations . . . to drink”, but he delivered the cup with its contents, which Jehovah compels those to whom it is presented to drink. And so it is today. Jehovah’s witnesses bring the prophetic message of God to the attention of the people and the nations, and it is the Almighty God who will compel them to drink of the cup of this fury. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W11/1/37</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Get wisdom, get understanding ; forget it not: neither decline from the words of my mouth.—Prov. 4:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Understanding</span><span class="font7"> does not mean merely to be intelligent and to grasp ideas and unravel deep problems or questions. In addition thereto it means that one must be discreet; it means to be prudent, to discern and to take a wise course and, above all, to have a proper discernment and appreciation of the creature’s relationship to the Almighty Creator. As man progresses in information and knowledge of and concerning God and his purpose, and if that man’s heart is right toward God, he continues to increase in his appreciation and he grows in understanding. The creature who begins to have understanding not only has respect for the Creator but stands in awe and fear of his unlimited power, his complete justice, his perfect wisdom, and his boundless love. He sees that his own continued existence depends upon rendering himself acceptable unto the Lord. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous.—Heb. 11:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The practice of religion had its beginning with Adam and Eve. Thereby they expressed selfish desire to have that which their Creator had not given to them. The Devil’s purpose in introducing religion was to alienate the devotion of man from God; and this is conclusive proof that the Devil is the author and father of all religion. At the beginning Adam’s children were not commercial. Then Cain began to practice religion, in this, that he adopted a form of worship, but without faith in God. He had no love for God, nor for the true worship of God. Then followed the great crime of murder by Cain, which was induced by religion. Adam’s son Abel was never religious, because he was fully obedient to and received approval of God the Creator. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/37</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.—Jer. 49:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Christ Jesus at the temple is dividing and judging the nations, causing the various ones to identify themselves, and all the forces of the wicked one are being gathered against those who serve God. All such are adversaries of God and his kingdom. Regardless of how much a Christian loves peace and quietude, this is no time to seek a place of seclusion and quietness. It is the time of war with the enemies. It must of necessity be the time of peace within the ranks of the Lord’s people, when they must dwell together in unity and fight in one solid phalans. All of God’s temple company are now under Christ’s leadership and must be of one mind, the mind of Christ. God and Christ have risen up against the enemies. All on the side of God and Christ must always take their place against the adversaries and do their part in the war. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The way of the ivicked is an abomination unto the Lord.—Prov. 15: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s adversary the Devil has employed and continues to employ every possible means in opposition to God. One of the most subtle means employed by the adversary, and which has accomplished the greatest injury to the people, is religion. Had they been informed that religion is of the Devil, no doubt there would have been a far less number of religionists in the earth. The time has now come for them to be informed. The Devil has for centuries been using religion to oppose God and to injure humankind. For the benefit of the people of good will toward God and who therefore sincerely desire peace, contentment, happiness and life, it now appears imperative that the wickedness of religion should be brought clearly before the minds of the people, that they may have full opportunity to safeguard themselves. Publication of this truth will bring great persecution. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/37</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.—Mark 13:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those not of the very elect will be deceived by such schemes and schemers. They are being deceived, because we are now at the end of the world and the wicked crowd are putting forth their greatest endeavors to deceive. The elect are not of this class that can be deceived, because they are always diligent to ascer<sub>r </sub>tain the truth, that they may do God’s will. Because they are pure in heart and are diligent in obeying his law Jehovah grants them the desire of their heart to know his will and to be led by him through Christ Jesus. Such faithful ones, taught by Jehovah and Christ Jesus, cannot therefore be deceived. It becomes their duty and privilege also to transmit to persons of good will toward God such information as is made available concerning wicked racketeers and their rackets. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/37 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">God’s purpose first expressed was and is to populate earth with a perfect race. His last or second expressed purpose is to create a spirit class from among men. His purpose is to have two companies, taken from among men, that shall live for ever in vindication of his word and name. One of those companies is spiritual, the other human, and they must of necessity be companions. There could be no discord between the two companies Not only will Jehovah God vindicate his word and name by placing on earth perfect men who shall live for ever, but he will take out another class, which shall be exalted to a higher place than Lucifer ever occupied. These two classes are designated in the Scriptures as “companions”. The word means “knit together, associated together, neighbor, brother”.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Do not interpretations belong to God?—Gen. 40:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Joseph took occasion to inform the butler and the baker that the interpretation of their dreams was not of his own knowing, but that it came from God, and thus he gave honor to Jehovah and took none of the honor to himself. Jehovah’s prophecies cannot be interpreted by men, but interpretation is from Jehovah and he gives it in due time to those who love and serve him. Christ Jesus at the temple is Jehovah’s great Servant and Interpreter, and by God’s permission and direction he gives to the faithful ones an understanding of God’s prophecies and his coming to the temple. Those who attempt to run ahead of the Lord and try to interpret prophecies to suit their own ideas never get the proper interpretation thereof. The meek are those who wait upon the Lord and seek to learn. “The meek will he guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his way.”—Ps. 25: 9. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">At the temple judgment those approved receive such approval that they may “offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness”. They are brought into the covenant for the kingdom and henceforth must prove entirely faithful to God and maintain their integrity, if they would live. From that time on the understanding of the faithful remnant must increase and they must appreciate more fully than ever their proper relationship to God and Christ Jesus. All in that covenant who ultimately gain the victory through Christ Jesus must continue lawfully and obediently faithful to God. No one should be deceived into believing that from the mere fact that he is taken into the kingdom covenant he is certain to participate in Christ’s resurrection and reign with him. The condition of faithfulness must be met to the very end. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/37</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Before thou earnest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee; and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Jer. 1: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah appointed Jeremiah to a responsible position, and as Jehovah’s servant he was commanded to go and do a specific work. “Jeremiah” means “raised up of Jehovah”, or, “Jehovah establishes,” or, “exalted by Jehovah.” Jeremiah was modest and meek, and from the beginning he had a proper estimate of the duties assigned to him. “Meekness” does not mean to be cowed in the presence of others. It means a willingness to learn, and an alertness, that one may learn what is the will of God. Many who have made a consecration to do God’s will appear to have great difficulty in learning what meekness means. Only the meek will properly see and appreciate the instructions coming from God’s organization and will be on the alert to perform them.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah putteth the righteous to the test, but the lawless one and the lover of violence his soul doth hate.—Ps. 11: 5, Botherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Being subjected to persecution because of faithfulness to God puts to the test his servants, which test, if properly met, will work to the good of the righteous. Jehovah hates the wicked. “As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.” (Rom. 9: 13) This does not mean that God loved Esau some and loved Jacob more. “Jacob” stands for those who faithfully serve Jehovah; “Esau” stands for those who practice the Devil religion for gain; and Jehovah hates that class, because all such are on the Devil’s side. The lawless and the lover of violence are the religionists in particular. The fact that the Lord now makes clear his purpose concerning the wicked is strong and persuasive proof that the time of the execution of Jehovah’s wrath against the wicked is near at hand. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/37</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">So the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the Lord—Jer. 26: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why does God give “Christendom” such emphatic ■warning, seeing, as he states, “ye have not hearkened”? The reason is that they may be duly informed and may therefore bear their own iniquity. Their coming destruction is nobody’s fault but their own, and the only way for the servants of God to relieve themselves of responsibility is to deliver to “Christendom” the message of God’s warning as commanded. (Ezek. 33: 8-12) No one could have any reasonable excuse to say that God has taken snap judgment of them. They cannot say that God is not long-suffering. Jehovah gives them ample warning and ample time to repent, and for that reason the “strange work”, the witness work, goes on and will continue until God’s time to begin the destruction.

<p><span class="font7">Jehovah will not permit wickedness to continue for ever. Regardless of how much good and righteous work any people may do, if they afterwards turn to wickedness their previous righteous work will avail them nothing. The Israelites were God’s typical people, organized in righteousness, and for a time doing a righteous work. That nation was destroyed. Let honest and sincere people now take warning that God will destroy “Christendom”, regardless of the boast of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to the contrary. Millions within “Christendom” look to the religious organizations, particularly to the Hierarchy and their buildings, as a place of safety. They trust in the power of this organization to save them. They will all fail and go down in Armageddon. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">. . . all nations shall serve him.—Jer. 27: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The name “Babylon” was adopted by Satan to bring reproach upon Jehovah’s name. By his decree Jehovah has ordered the destruction of Babylon, Satan’s organization; which decree will be executed in due time by Jehovah’s elect servant. Meantime Jehovah uses Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, to play a part picturing the rightful king of the world, Christ Jesus. It may therefore properly be said that when the name </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon</span><span class="font7"> is used as applied to the work done by Jehovah, it means “the gate (or way) to God”. Christ Jesus is the only way unto God. (John 14:6) Appropriately Jehovah causes the king of Babylon to act as executioner of the rebellious people of Judah and Jerusalem, the destruction of which foreshadows the destruction of “Christendom”. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth?—Isa. 23:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For centuries the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has claimed that the pope has the power and authority to crown and to depose earthly kings. To those thus crowned and who have submitted to the domination of the religionists, the Hierarchy has been and is the ‘higher powers’. It bestows titles upon whomsoever it chooses to honor, and thereby makes men “princes of the church ’ ’, and these traffickers, acting at the behest of modern Tyre, are the “honourable of the earth”. It is Jehovah who has purposed the destruction of modern Tyre, the great religious harlot organization. And why? The Scriptural answer (vs. 9) is, “to stain [profane] the pride of all glory.” Certainly this means all glory taken away from God, to whom it belongs, and bestowed on creatures.

<p><span class="font7">Jeremiah delivered Jehovah’s warning and admonition to the Jews. Now Jehovah’s witnesses must continue to deliver His message of warning and admonition to the people, that they may have an opportunity to flee from idolatry and idolatrous worship of the Devil and his crowd. Religionists teach the people to believe that so-called “rulers’’-are the higher powers to which they must render full obedience, and that the Hierarchy itself is the highest among the higher powers, and that if they do this in the name of God they are rendering to God the things that are God’s and are therefore safe.

To safeguard them from the Devil men are commanded to worship the Lord God and refrain from worshiping before images. Use of any kind of image in connection with worshiping the Lord is a sin. God gave his law to the people, therefore, to safeguard them from the influence and power of the Devil, who, operating chiefly through religion, endeavors to turn all people away from Almighty God. God’s law looked forward to the coming of the promised Seed, Christ Jesus, and he gave the law because of sin, to safeguard Israel that they might be in proper condition to receive that Seed. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/37</span></p>

The lifeblood of Christ Jesus purchased as many of the human race as believe and obey, and no other. The ransom sacrifice does not result beneficially for the willful and deliberate sinner. Adam was a deliberate sinner because he was fully aware of God’s law and the effect of his disobedience. (1 Tim. 2: 14) There is no reason to believe that the ransom sacrifice was for his benefit, but was and is for the benefit of those of his offspring who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and obey. All the Scriptures concur that those who receive salvation must believe on God and Christ Jesus and obey.

The Lord God has commanded Jehovah’s witnesses to speak and has put in his Word what they shall speak, and for them to ask permission or to submit to censorship would be a direct violation of his commandment. Fear of bodily injury, or desire for admiration of men or a “good neighbor’’ feeling, or “national patriotism”, so called, or anything else, must not be permitted to hinder full obedience to God’s commandment. Nothing would be an excuse or justification for putting on the soft pedal or omitting certain parts of the message of truth.

<p><span class="font7">The paramount obligation laid upon the temple company is to show forth the name and praise of Jehovah God and his King. That is done by making known to the people that the only true God is Jehovah, and that his kingdom under Christ is the only hope for mankind. The reason why he has laid this obligation upon his people is that the world may know that soon God will exhibit his supremacy by destroying Satan and his entire organization. These things are kingdom interests. These interests must be given the closest attention by the “faithful and wise servant”. If you are of the temple company, you will be diligent to do your part in making known Jehovah’s name and kingdom, having in mind that God says: “In his temple doth every one speak of his glory.” (Ps. 29: 9) Those who fail or refuse to make known these great truths to the praise of his name are not now in the temple. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The name &quot;Joseph” has a two-fold meaning. At the time of his birth his mother Rachel said: &quot;God hath taken away my reproach”; and she called him Joseph, which means &quot;remover”, that is, remover of reproach. And then Rachel said: &quot;The Lord shall add to me another son”; meaning &quot;increaser”. Thus she foretold that the one whom Joseph foreshadowed would be the Vindicator of his Father’s name, would remove or take away the reproach of His name, and would be an increaser and would increase the number of those who would maintain their integrity toward God and magnify his name. During the seven years of famine in Egypt and in the land round about, Joseph in a typical way was the &quot;seed” of Jacob in whom all the families of the earth who obey him shall be preserved alive and blessed.

All creatures should obey the &quot;Higher Powers”, Jehovah and Christ Jesus, rather than men. Joseph’s brethren pictured that class of persons who seek the Lord first for self-preservation and who thereafter learn of his loving-kindness and put themselves gladly under his control. It was not until 1935 that the Lord revealed that his &quot;other sheep” constitute the &quot;great multitude”, which will live for ever on earth.

<p><span class="font7">God’s judgment upon the new Jerusalem, that is, the faithful remnant on earth, brings no evil upon them, because he approves them and clothes that faithful company with the robe of righteousness that they may offer unto him an offering in righteousness. He puts his name of approval upon them. The organization that has presumptuously assumed the name of God and Christ and brought great reproach upon that name and continues to do so is exactly in a contrary position. Upon that unfaithful crowd, ‘upon that city (organization) on which my name is called but which is unfaithful to me,’ God inflicts full punishment, and that punishment is the beginning of Armageddon, hence the beginning of his ‘ ‘strange act”. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W12/1/37</span></p>

Those who have agreed to do God’s will and to follow in Jesus’ footsteps should have in mind those faithful witnesses who went before and should follow a similar course. No person can faithfully and truly serve God and permit anything to divide his affections between God and any creature. He cannot practice religion and at the same time serve God faithfully. He must lay aside these weights, and do as the apostle did and said: “This one thing Ido” (Phil. 3: 13), and that is, follow in Jesus’ footsteps and obey God’s commandments.

Eventually all those willful defamers will be destroyed, never to rise again. As Jehovah removed everything from Shiloh that pertained to his worship, so he will remove from “Christendom” everything that might betoken the divine presence and place of worship, and will thereby disclose that the so-called “Christian religion” is a fraud and a snare of the Devil to turn the people away from God.

Those who hear the message proclaimed and hear emphasized the commandment that the kingdom must now be preached, and then go their way and ignore the Lord’s command and fail or decline to take any part whatever in preaching this kingdom gospel, thereby show they have no appreciation of the kingdom and will never be permitted to share its profits, unless they are quickly aroused and become truly active. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/37</span></p>

As the famine was still sore upon Egypt and the nations round about, so now famine for a knowledge of the way to life is sore upon all under Satan’s dominion. As Joseph was made known to his brethren, so now Christ Jesus, the Savior of mankind, must be made known to those who desire righteousness and life. Joseph caused everyone to withdraw from his presence, except his brethren.

This message is now proclaimed by Jehovah’s witnesses and is in the “cup” which is taken at God’s hand; therefore the “cup’’’ pictures Jehovah’s servants.

The religionists induce people to believe that Christianity and religion are one and the same thing, whereas “Christianity” means to observe and practice the truths which Christ Jesus taught and which he received from Jehovah God; whereas “religion” means observing and practicing that which is taught by men contrary to God’s Word and which emanates from the Devil.

But to learn of and trust in and follow God’s direction leads to life and happiness.

Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to salute flags of “Christendom” and thereby to impute salvation to that which the flag represents. They know that protection and salvation proceed from Jehovah God, and not from any man-made institution. The doom of “Christendom” and of all religious organizations is certain and is duly certified to by Jehovah, and therefore it is contrary to his will to pray that such doom be averted. Those who truly love and serve Jehovah God will pray for nothing that is contrary to God’s will, but they pray as Jesus commanded them: “Thy will be done.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Joseph and Benjamin together pictured Jehovah’s royal house in the entirety. Their mother, Rachel, was especially loved by Jacob, and gave birth to these two sons; and in this she foreshadowed Zion, God’s universal organization in its capacity of bringing forth Jehovah’s royal family. As Jacob loved Rachel most, so Jehovah loves most his organization Zion, for she brings forth the royal family, and he loves his royal offspring most, which is the kingdom of heaven class. Until the birth of Benjamin Joseph was his father’s only begotten son by Rachel his beloved wife and was always the favorite son of his father. Likewise Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s “only begotten Son” and favorite (John 3:16), “the firstborn of every creature” (Col. 1: 15), “my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.” —Matt 3:17. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">God has chosen the true followers of Christ Jesus as his people and has brought them into a covenant for the kingdom, and made them his “holy nation, a peculiar people”, selected for a purpose. It is certain from His fixed rule that only those faithfully obedient to God’s commandments will continue in that holy nation and will live. The Lord emphasized the importance of his people’s keeping constantly before their minds the things which he requires. The human mind and organism, defective by reason of inheritance, require constant study and application that the right rule may always be pursued. The Israelites who departed from the Lord were void of understanding. (Deut. 32; 28) They did not have an appreciation of their relationship to God.

<p><span class="font7">Jonadab was an honest man. He was against Devi] religion. He was not a religionist. He had learned of Jehovah God and sought to serve him. His descendants, the Rechabites, were honest and sincere men, diligent in performing their vows and agreements even though made to men. This shows that the first essential for one to appreciate God’s goodness is honesty. It supports the conclusion that dependability is required of those pleasing to God. Jonadab clearly pictured that class on earth who at the coming of Christ Jesus manifest good will toward God and his organization and are against Devil religionists, including those who practice so-called “Christian” religion. They are men of sincerity, believe in right and try to do right. When they learn of God and his kingdom they seek him. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s purpose is to first destroy “Christendom” and then to destroy the remaining parts of Satan’s organization. For that purpose he sends his Executioner, Christ Jesus, against “Christendom” first. It was Jehovah who brought disaster upon Jerusalem, and it is Jehovah, acting by his Executive Officer, who will bring destruction upon “Christendom”. If he would employ his power through his angels to put in the mind of a heathen king the conclusion to act in a certain way, then certainly Jehovah would employ his power through his angels to put in the minds of his servants to take the course he would have them take. He directs the way of his people, who in all their ways acknowledge him. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/37</span></p>

They think she is too ancient to ever have to move. With the beginning of Armageddon modern Tyre will cease, and no more will her feet carry her and her missionaries to many lands, there to seek new markets in which to exploit the people, but she will go to where she will remain permanently. “Though from ancient days is her antiquity, yet shall her own feet carry her away, far off to dwell” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth./</span><span class="font7"> by being removed from her place of existence into destruction.

<p><span class="font7">The provisions of Jehovah’s organization are pictured by these seven cattle. Being warm-blooded creatures, they pictured the complete fullness of sin atonement for mankind and the spiritual “strong meat” to be found only in the provisions Jehovah has made, and which he administers through his organization under Christ Jesus, the Greater Joseph. This means the kingdom has come and the Chief Corner Stone and Foundation Stone of God’s organization, which is Christ Jesus, has been laid in Zion. Christ Jesus is now upon his throne, the rightful Ruler of the world. The “pure river of water of life” is flowing forth from “the throne of God and of the Lamb”, and is the provision God has made for those to live who will obey. Abundant provision is made for those who come to him and prove their integrity. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“Zimri” means “musical”, “my song.” The paid choirs of church organizations fit this description exactly. These professional choirs indulge in music for commercial purposes, but their own hearts are not stirred in the least toward God thereby. Compare this with the untrained voices of ten thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses assembled in convention, who sing songs of praise to Jehovah, which songs thrill the hearts of those devoted to him because they sing with the spirit of loving devotion to God and praise to his name. Music, which should be employed to praise the Creator, is wrongfully employed to swing people into the Devil’s trap and rob them. Such crowd is among those employed to turn people away from God, and they, the Lord says, must drink of the cup of this fury.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“God is not</span><span class="font7"> mocked.” Therefore the unfaithful “priest”, who attempts it, is cursed of Jehovah. The deceiver is a hypocrite, who puts stumbling blocks in the way of those faithfully endeavoring to serve God. Thus the deceivers show contempt for Jehovah and for his name. They are cheats and frauds. Could any person who understands and loves Jehovah treat the Most High with such contempt ? The Lord answers in the negative. Jehovah is “The King of Eternity”, the Supreme One, the Most High over all, and the One to whom every soul must be subject if he would live. Jehovah, particularly since 1914, is King, having then placed his anointed One, Christ Jesus, as his vicegerent upon the throne of Zion to rule.

It is the obligation and duty of the remnant to see that instructions relating to the organization are carried out, and it is the prerogative of Jonadabs to have part in doingservice unto God. Therefore those of the remnant or anointed should take the lead, and the Jonadabs should go along with them, and the spirit of unselfishness and complete devotion to the Lord should guide. The Lord has laid upon his anointed servants the duty and obligation of taking the lead in the matter of service. If one is assigned to that duty he will perform it with meekness and humility and be prompted by unselfishness.

<p><span class="font7">The work in which Jehovah’s witnesses are now engaged is not their work, but is the Lord’s work, they performing service assigned to them, and without any credit due to them whatever. Jehovah sends forth his servant class today and commissions them to declare “the day of vengeance of our God”, and “to comfort all that mourn”. In doing this work they are not to engage in physical combat. The proclaiming of Jehovah’s Word today as he has commanded operates to root out, pull down, throw down and destroy the stronghold that the Devil has erected by religion and religionists; and at the same time the work performed by them brings comfort and aid to those that mourn and builds up that sincere class of persons seeking God and his kingdom. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/37</span></p>

What God did with the Israelites and those connected with them pictured what he will later bring upon his pretended people. God permits some of the Devil’s own crowd to inflict punishment upon those who have become unfaithful to God. Note what God did to the Philistines after they smote Israel and carried off the ark of the covenant. The Philistines therefore had no reason to boast against Jehovah that they had prevailed against him.

<p><span class="font7">“Burden” means something heavy to be borne by ancient Tyre and foreshadows a greater burden to be borne by modern Tyre. Applying the prophecy to modern Tyre, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization, the ships of Tarshish well picture the underpriests and subordinate organizations working under the command of the ruling Hierarchy, which is designated “The Hierarchy of Jurisdiction”, to perform the more direct work with the people, “the sea.” The word “howl” clearly shows that a great calamity will come upon modern Tyre, that is, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization. A howl means a wail of great distress or despair. When is that howl to begin ? From the Scriptures it seems certain it will be at the beginning of Armageddon, that is, the beginning of the “strange act” of the </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Alm</span><span class="font7">ighty God. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/37</span></p>

Religion was the besetting sin of Israel, which sin has been the besetting sin of those who have professed to follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. Man’s besetting sin, from the time of Eden till now, has been and is religion. It has been the means by which Satan has deceived man, and he has kept it around man and turned him away from God. It was the instrument that the Devil used to cause the Israelites to fall away from God.

<p><span class="font7">All who will be faithful to God and prove their integrity to him will quickly and gladly obey this commandment. No one can obey this commandment by substituting some other person for himself. It is an individual responsibility. It is an opportunity for each one to prove his devotion to Jehovah. One’s responsibility is in proportion to his opportunity. God’s people must now be wholly devoted to him and his cause, and be blind to everything else. The Jonadabs will remain in the city of refuge and show their devotion and faithfulness to God by joining in the proclamation of the kingdom message as opportunity is afforded them. It is now war time, and the Lord’s witnesses must now be engaged in that war.

<p><span class="font7">The selfish and self-important ones of the Judah class “dealt treacherously” in that they did not hold strictly to the covenant and to Jehovah’s organization and keep themselves separate from Satan’s organization. “Married the daughter of a strange god” means the god of this world, Satan, whose “daughter”, his organization created on earth, is a stranger to and against God. The mixing up with religionists and following their formalism, while claiming to be God’s servants, is profaning his name. Unity with this crowd is marrying the strange or foreign god against God’s covenant. Any union of God’s covenant and consecrated people with Satan’s organization constitutes a violation of their covenant, because there is no concord of God’s organization with the enemy’s. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/37</span></p>

The Hierarchy and their supporters will come to the point where apparently they have succeeded in suppressing the witness work of Jehovah. Feeling they have triumphed over opposition, they will think themselves secure and will say: 'We are in peace and safety.’ But their safety will be for a very brief period of time, because God will suddenly bring destruction upon them.

God accepted the challenge and suspended the execution of judgment against Satan in order to give him the full opportunity to prove his challenge and then to have God’s power demonstrated against that wicked one and, before so doing, to have Jehovah’s name proclaimed throughout the earth. (Ex. 9:16) A host of angels joined the Devil in his rebellion against Jehovah. They too were sentenced to death, but execution thereof has been withheld until God’s due time to destroy those adversaries. Awaiting that day, he degraded that host of wicked angels by holding them away from the light of his purpose and by keeping them in the darkness.

If one of the remnant becomes heady, self-exalted, and angrily expresses himself in wrath against Jonadabs or others, he has very little understanding. But if he is kind and considerate and slow to wrath and avoids contention, he shows that he possesses understanding. Those who think themselves of the remnant and who disregard the Lord’s instructions are following a fatal course. “The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead. ’ ’ (21:16) Those who are of the remnant set a very poor example when they attempt to drive others.

Then if occasion offers, the clergy start a riot and lead a mob to inflict further indignities on those who represent the Lord.

The Godless ones may conclude that after the destruction of the religious systems, which operate in God’s name, then they (the Godless) will have larger freedom and license for wickedness and can therefore entirely ignore Jehovah. They will find, however, that destruction of the religious systems does not mean there is no Jehovah God nor Christ Jesus. Rather prophecy shows that they will learn that overthrow of the religionists means that non-religionists are next in line to be dealt with by the Lord and thereby wiped out in disgrace. Ungodliness is no more justified than hypocritical religion.

<p><span class="font7">God sent Christ Jesus to the temple to shorten or cut short the days of tribulation and to “preserve life”. The remnant now appreciate as never before that the shortening of the tribulation was to give them the opportunity of declaring “this gospel of the kingdom” and to give to the “other sheep” the opportunity to be saved by fleeing to Christ. These great truths are disclosed to the faithful remnant, and the remnant transmit the same to those who are of the “other sheep”, and they all rejoice, because all see that ‘except those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved’.

<p><span class="font7">The howl is because incoming ships of Tarshish, laden with merchandise, could find no berth, wharf or warehouse in which to put the merchandise intended for Tyre. The text ‘The gates of hell cannot prevail against it’ has no application whatsoever to the Roman Catholic Church, but has been wrongfully applied by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to deceive the people, resulting in deception and great injury to them. No more will the Catholic Hierarchy organization carry on its work of ‘compassing sea and land to make proselytes for hell’, because the modern Tyre will be done.

Jehu’s motive was to do the will of God and to do so with real joy. He was commissioned to do a work and he delighted in doing it. He was fighting against the Devil religion, which defamed God’s name. He therefore showed a pure heart devoted to God and his law. To the question of Jehu Jonadab said: ‘I am with you; my heart is with your heart.’ Otherwise stated, Jonadab was in full sympathy and accord with what Jehu was doing, and desired to join him in his work. Jehu then offered his hand unto Jonadab and took Jonadab up into his chariot.

This is not a symbolic, but a real cleansing. Why has Jehovah repeated this fact so many times? Manifestly for the purpose of thoroughly impressing the fact upon those who would hear, that they may know and understand it is Jehovah’s act. Human creatures are so inclined to forget, and God prevents man from having any excuse to plead ignorance. The destruction at Armageddon is not the vengeance of any class of individuals expressed against another class. Armageddon is the battle of the Lord God Almighty, with Christ Jesus as the Field Marshal leading that fight to complete victory, and the slaughter will be so great that all will be convinced that it came from the Lord.

<p><span class="font7">The song of praise to the Most High announces that his kingdom is the only hope of the world and that Christ will now reign in righteousness and will destroy all hypocrisy and wickedness. This song greatly disturbs the old “whore” and she whangs her harp with all her power and energy and uses all her power and influence to get the harpers of the Lord out of the way. Her persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in every country is conclusive proof of this.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.—John 3: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All men came under condemnation by reason of sin, and God’s wrath against sin is death. If one believes on the Lord Jesus Christ God removes that condemnation from him. But if man prefers to remain on the Devil’s side and continue in sin, then God’s wrath or condemnation abides on him and is not removed. Thus it is seen that God’s intelligent creatures are made free agents to choose life or death after having received a knowledge of God’s provision for them. The provision God has made to give life to men is prompted entirely by unselfishness. “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” Those who do not believe “perish”, which means to be completely annihilated.

Thereby he will annihilate all defamers of his name. “Tophet” shall be a graveyard for Satan’s crowd, memorializing the disastrous end of all who worship Satan or willingly practice his religion.

Jehovah will show his strength over Satan and all his places of worship. Devil religion and willful practitioners thereof shall be completely wiped out. “Tophet,” thereafter bearing the name of “The valley of slaughter”, shall be filled so full that there will be no room to bury more.

<p><span class="font7">Joseph’s brethren, the ten half brothers who at first envied and hated him, appear to picture persons in the -religious organizations that have envied and ill-treated the true followers of Christ Jesus because they observe that Christ’s true followers have had greater favor from God. Later, when these half brothers became reconciled to Joseph and sought his favor, they picture those who are not members of the body of Christ, and hence not spirit-begotten, but who are of good will toward God and Christ Jesus. Hence they picture the “great multitude” or “other sheep” that Christ Jesus brings into his Father’s fold. They are the earthly children of God’s organization. Those of God’s “faithful servant” class are hated by the religionists because the faithful servants are true and faithful to the name of Jehovah and Christ. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/37</span></p>

They do not die with Christ Jesus a sacrificial death. Their hope is for life on earth as God’s people. Justification, the right to live, is not theirs yet, but will be granted unto them, in due time, through Christ Jesus, if they prove their faithfulness and maintain integrity. Such are the “other sheep”, who compose the great multitude. Their relationship is that of subjects to the Lord Christ Jesus. By and through him God will grant to such life everlasting, if they meet his requirements.

<p><span class="font7">All the lawless shall perish: the “evil servant” class, all religious hypocrites, and particularly the Boman Catholic Hierarchy crowd, who have so cruelly persecuted Jehovah’s witnesses. The Hierarchy has no excuse and will find no way of escape. It is written concerning the Lord Jesus, Jehovah’s Executive Officer: “He beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.” (Bom. 13: 4) Jehovah’s witnesses, in obedience to his commandment and for the good of those to whom they have been sent, have carried the message to the people and the clergy of the Hierarchy, and the Hierarchy have refused to hear and have prevented the people from hearing. All their wicked deeds the Lord counts as done to himself; and the Lord Jesus, the great Judge, says: “These shall go away into everlasting punishment [cutting-off </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Dia-gfott)]”—TAatt.</span><span class="font7"> 25:46. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">God receives man and extends favor to him by reason of his faith and agreement to be obedient to God’s will. He justifies man in order that the man so justified may take the next step, that is, follow in the footsteps of the perfect man, Christ Jesus. Justification granted unto man extends to him the right to live as a man, which right he surrenders in obedience to God’s will. It is God’s will that such creature may be called to the high calling, and therefore that he should die with Christ Jesus. God then brings him forth as his child and acknowledges him as such. Therefore God becomes his Father, the Giver of life to the creature, to this one who has fully agreed to be obedient to his will. God begets that person, which means that He acknowledges him as his own, and this is according to His will. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The meekness of Jeremiah is demonstrated: he was willing to learn and anxious to know what to do and then do it. Manifestly Jehovah informed his young servant at the time that he would be bitterly opposed by the religionists, because the Lord said: “Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord.” (Vs. 8) Jeremiah, being a faithful servant of Jehovah, pictured those now of the remnant or “faithful servant” class and who continue faithful even unto death. Jeremiah had much opposition from religionists then. Even so now the “faithful servant ” of Jehovah is greatly opposed by the religionists of “Christendom”. This means that men, as the Devil’s servants, fight against God by bitterly opposing his servant company. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/37</span></p>

The seed of Satan has therefore ever been the enemy of God and righteous creatures. The wicked seed or organization of Satan embraces the host of wicked angels. The chief part of the Devil’s seed which is earthly is religion and religious organizations, which are operated by Satan to oppose God, and all of which tend to turn men away from God and to the worship of creatures or things. Religion has at all times been the binding tie that has held together the political and commercial traffickers and the military elements of the nations of the earth.

<p><span class="font7">This feast, also called “the feast of ingathering”, which God commanded should be observed by his covenant people once each year, was participated in by the Israelites, women, children, and ‘the strangers within thy gates’. At the end of every seven years, at this feast the law of God must be read in the presence and hearing of all those who are gathered. This illustrates the selection of the spiritual class, which has been made; and now the “strangers”, the great multitude, are being gathered in. The spiritual remnant and the earthly great multitude become companions in the feast of rejoicing to the Lord. This is the time of rejoicing by all those who are devoted to Jehovah because these by faith see that the day of deliverance is at hand, and also the time for the vindication of Jehovah’s name.

<p><span class="font7">The Bible contains spiritual food and is used as spiritual food to be consumed before and during Armageddon. The food provided by Jehovah through the publication of his Word must be used before the saints are taken from earth. The Bible must be used now; and because it is being used to feed the souls of those hungry and thirsty for righteousness, Satan-and his agents desperately attempt to keep the people away from feeding upon God’s provisions for them. There is no reason to conclude that the publications which God’s visible organization now publishes and distributes will be found of use during the Kingdom reign, nor that even the Bible will be used during that time. Those publications are for present-day use to inform the people. When Christ Jesus has brought all the &quot;other sheep” into the fold of God, then some other provision of the Lord will certainly be employed for them.

<p><span class="font7">No good can result by abusing any practitioner of religion. Personal attacks on anyone are uncalled for. The servant of the Lord will not indulge in controversial harangue with the wicked who are attempting to do injury to God’s cause and people. When the wicked resort to lies, slander and vicious and malicious charges, the proper course is to ignore such wicked ones; but, if opportunity arises, then speak the truth, that those of good will may be benefited. Jehovah’s witnesses will be looking out to give the message to those who have an ear to hear. The purpose of giving testimony is not to convince the wicked, that such ones may reform, because that is an impossibility. The purpose is to aid those truly seeking knowledge.

<p><span class="font7">The “people for his name’’ should be the first to praise his name, not only for a time, but at all times. “From the rising of the sun even unto the going down” thereof means all the day long, that is, all the time, continuously. Therefore the name of Jehovah is great all the time, and all who ever receive life everlasting must come to see and acknowledge that fact and joyfully praise his holy name. All of the temple do now praise the name of Jehovah. (Ps. 29: 9) Jehovah’s decree is that his name “shall be great” among the multitude without number, and those who are now coming into that company sing the praise of his name. Jehovah is now gathering the “great multitude” from all nations, kindreds, peoples and tongues, and this he does in spite of those professing ‘ ‘priests ’ ’ who despise Jehovah’s name and his gracious work. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">What Jeremiah did was not an easy task for him to perform, but he did not refuse it because it was hard. His commission from Jehovah obligated Jeremiah to perform faithfully the duty laid upon him. It was a God-given job. Jeremiah was fully advised of the mental condition of the clergy of his day, and he knew that to carry out his commission would bring hard things upon him from the religionists. But it was a joyful service because he was rendering it according to God’s will. Jeremiah had learned that the joy of the Lord was his strength. That joy was an antidote for all the disagreeable and painful parts of the tasks that lay before him. And what did that foreshadow ?

<p><span class="font7">The two sons of Joseph seem to picture the remnant. Those boys’ carrying forward the name of Joseph and his family indicates that Satan does not get rid of the remnant from the earth before Armageddon, although he desperately wars against them. This prophecy is a great comfort to the remnant, because it is an assurance from the Lord that he is with them and his hand is over them. Hence they go forward in the land of the enemy, holding high the banner of the kingdom and pointing the peoples to what that banner means and that it represents God’s kingdom under Christ, which is the only means of salvation for mankind. During the rest of their earthly pilgrimage they have the assurance from the Lord’s Word that he will feed them abundantly upon the spiritual food necessary for their maintenance and support to continue strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.

<p><span class="font7">“Thy stranger’’ refers not to the ones in the covenant directly, but to those who by reason of seeking protection with God’s organization must, in order to continue in his favor, be faithfully on God’s side. These Jonadabs or the great multitude are not party to the covenant for the kingdom, and are not to be made part of the royal house; but by reason of their association with God’s organization and in consideration of the care and protection they receive from the Lord they are in an implied covenant at least to be faithful to God and his kingdom.

Folio-wing out the picture, Christ Jesus invites his “other sheep” the Jonadabs to find refuge in his organization and to go along with him; but there is no Scriptural authority for their attempting to say who among the anointed shall or shall not serve in a position among the anointed. The Jonadab should always keep in mind that he finds protection, by the Lord’s grace, in His organization, and, his heart being in harmony with the Lord, he will delight to do whatever is the will of God. Those selected as servants in the church should be the ones who give evidence of having a deeper appreciation of their own relationship to the Lord and to their brethren.

<p><span class="font7">God sent his holy angels to put into the mind of Nebuchadnezzar, whom he had chosen to be the executioner of Jerusalem, the conclusion and determination to go and make war on it. God called him “my servant”, because he used him to picture his great Servant and Executioner, Christ Jesus. The name “Nebuchadnezzar” means “the Prophet is the protector”. Therefore the name properly applies to the Lord Jesus Christ, that great Prophet, who is the protector and savior particularly of his people, whom he protects from the assault and injury by his foes. Nebuchadnezzar pictured the One of whom Jehovah said: “Behold my servant, whom I uphold.” He is the one to whom the “nations” that survive must look and hope for protection and salvation.

This is Jehovah’s “strange work”. This work being completed, he visits her and executes judgment upon her, and that marks the beginning of his “strange act”, which is the second part of his visit. During the first part of his visit, Jehovah gathers the evidence against her as to her activities as a harlot operating with a harp and song. During the first part die returns to her hire as a harlot and uses that hire to commit fornication with the rulers of earth. Her activity in committing harlotry with all the kingdoms of the world means the carrying out of the Hierarchy’s objective to set up a Fascist government controlling the nations, to rule in dictatorial manner. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">No creature can divide his affections and devotion between God and any thing. Jehovah God is his only protector and is the Life-giver. He is therefore a “jealous God”, or zealous for righteousness, and will not permit his name or his Word to be sullied by any part of the Devil’s operations or schemes. Therefore he will not give life to those who indulge in things invented and used by the Devil to defame Jehovah’s name. God’s law which provides that men shall have no other god before Him and shall make no image of anything and bow down to it, is solely for the purpose of safeguarding men from the Devil’s wickedness, “the sin which doth so easily beset” all creatures.

(Matt. 24: 38, 39) The facts today fully corroborate these prophetic words. At Armageddon “Christendom” will become a waste and totally joyless.

The Lord requires of the temple company full and complete faithfulness. That means faithfulness in performance and a correct report to the King. The Lord has entrusted his “goods” or “possessions” to the temple company. The “talents” handed to his servants they must increase by faithful devotion and performance, and that is exactly what he demands of all who prove faithful. They must advance the kingdom interests. To be faithful one must be entirely trustworthy and wholly dependable. Whatever may be assigned, that duty he must perform and render the service report to the Lord.

<p><span class="font7">All who receive God’s approval must render justice to all others. They must love mercy, and when opportunity is afforded they must extend that mercy to others. They must shun everything that pertains to malice. Instead of disregarding the rights and privileges of others, they seek to do good unto all as they have opportunity. They must walk obediently with God, as he has pointed out they have to walk. The course is marked out in his Word. (Ps. 119:105) To all such Jehovah alone must be their God. To all such God has given the great privilege of knowing him and his provisions through Christ Jesus, and that such provision is life.

They gladly submit without resistance, and come from all nations of the earth to place themselves under the protection and rule of Christ Jesus, whom Nebuchadnezzar foreshadowed. All the other people of the nations, which hold to Satan’s organization, are angry and oppose Christ’s reign, and will be compelled to be submissive to the Lord.

For this reason witnesses of Almighty God today suffer persecution. They are doing no wrong. On the contrary, they are doing exactly right; and the Devil hates that which is right and true, and seeks to destroy those who will obey God. Jehovah permits this in order that Satan may have full opportunity to attempt to make good his wicked challenge and that men subjected to his persecution may have opportunity to maintain integrity toward God. Ultimately victory is with Jehovah completely, through Christ Jesus. Those who stand with the Lord will have part in that victory. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jacob, like his grandfather Abraham, “looked for a city [the kingdom organization] which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.” (Heb. 11:10) Joseph dwelt in the land of Canaan with his father and was his father’s beloved son and, like his ancestors, would be looking for the kingdom of God’s building. His antitype, Christ Jesus, said to the Jews who were against him: “Ye are from beneath</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">; I</span><span class="font7"> am from above; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ye</span><span class="font7"> are of this world; I am not of this world.” “My kingdom is not of this world.” (John 8: 23; 18: 36) Concerning his disciples, who were like Benjamin to Joseph, Jesus said: “They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.” (John 17:14) Since Joseph and his brother Benjamin were, like their ancestors, looking for the kingdom, therefore all pictured by Joseph and Benjamin are “strangers and pilgrims” to the world, looking for that better world.

<p><span class="font7">The sincere people who love righteousness will break away from the religious prison house and speak against that wicked organization. Those who compose the “great multitude”, as waters, are first turned away from the support of the religionists and give their devotion to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. Then will follow in due time the masses who will renounce and turn away from and against the religionists. The above prophecy shows that in God’s due time the relationship of the sincere people with the religionists will be broken off. “The sea” (that is, the people used and exploited by the Devil to mother, nourish and support the religious systems, and who have been ruled) become the rulers or “kings” that will turn against the “whore” and disclaim relationship to her. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">—Prov. 4: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah repeatedly emphasizes the importance of understanding on the part of his creatures who love his approval. The present time is a time of great peril, fraught with many dangers to those who have covenanted to be the servants of the Most High. There is no good reason for any of God’s servants to be ignorant of their enemies that lurk in the way attempting their destruction. We are at the time of the greatest climax of the history of man and of the earthly journey of the church. Those who will stand with the Lord in these evil days are those who have been called and chosen and who continue to walk lawfully, who are entirely faithful, and who are maintaining their integrity toward God. To all those who are in the Lord’s organization the importance of “understanding” cannot be overstated. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ten</span><span class="font7"> is a symbolic number denoting completeness. “The ten commandments” really means all or the complete statement of God’s fundamental law to man. His “statutes” (vs. 8) specifically define man’s duty to be performed in harmony with the fundamental law. The nation of Israel was in direct contrast to all other nations and peoples because Israel was the people chosen by the Lord God for himself, by and through which people he would and did make prophetic pictures foreshadowing greater things to come to pass in the future. God gave to that people the fundamental law, which law applies to all people who undertake to do his will. If every creature were perfect and obedient to Jehovah there would be no need for a written law prescribing what is right and commanding to refrain from what is wrong.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.—Matt. 19:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s purpose first expressed was to have on earth a perfect human company; his last expressed purpose is to take from among men those who shall be made spiritual. Therefore, in harmony with Jesus’ words, ‘the first shall be last, and the last first.’ In carrying out his purpose the spiritual class is first selected and the human company is the last selected. The condition or provision precedent, which is given to both the spiritual and the human company, is this: Complete devotion to God by laying aside every selfish thing and joyfully doing the will of God. That means a full consecration to God and then faithfully carrying out the covenant made. Salvation to those of either company depends on full faith in God and in Christ Jesus and in complete obedience to God’s will at all times.

<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses, because of preaching the kingdom gospel in obedience to God’s commandment, are often assaulted, arrested and thrown into prison and subjected to ill-treatment while confined in filthy cells, and are there compelled to listen to Jehovah’s name being slandered and vilified, and surely they cannot be happy by reason of such condition; but these same conditions cause them to be joyful in the Lord. They know they are right and are suffering because of righteousness, and that this is according to God’s will, and therefore they rejoice or delight to do his will. Jesus makes this clear distinction in the parable of the talents. To his servant, who has been faithful over a few things and who brings a faithful report to the Lord, he says: “Well done, good and faithful servant: ... I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.’’ Jesus thus invited the temple company to enter into his joy. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W12/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Seeing that the Bible and the books published making known the contents and meaning of the Bible must now be used, because such is God’s provision, the obligation upon those who have these truths is therefore greater. Jehovah has taken out a people for his name, and these are sent forth from the temple to make known to others his name, which is the chief matter involved in his Word. Such is his provision for mankind to live. He warns the witnesses that they must carry this message to the people of good will, and he tells those who are of good will that when they hear this message the obligation is upon them to join with the anointed to carry the truth to others that they may hear. Such is exactly his command. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jehovah is long-suffering; but he has fixed a limit, and religionists have without doubt reached that limit. It is bad enough to practice Devil religion, but to do so in the name of Jehovah and Christ Jesus, thereby deceiving many sincere persons and defaming the name of God and Christ, is provoking to the superlative degree. Religionists, who improperly call themselves “Christian”, have commercialized the names of Almighty God and Christ Jesus. While differing in many things, all are at unity in being against God and his truth, and have produced such confusion of and among themselves that soon they will hang their heads in shame.

<p><span class="font7">Strife among the people of God shows a lack of understanding on the part of those who participate in it. It shows a lack of appreciation of the relationship of the creatures to God. Strife in companies of those who profess to be of the remnant is entirely out of harmony with the Scriptures, and therefore very wrong. There can be no strife or quarrels unless someone or more are at fault. It is often true that both sides to the strife are at fault. If those who profess to be servants of the Lord God and of his anointed remnant indulge in strife, they are certain to lose the favor of God, as it is declared in Galatians 5:15. Those who possess the wisdom from above appreciate their relationship with God and Christ. They fear God and dwell together in peace among themselves and see to it that they are united, standing shoulder to shoulder fighting on the Lord’s side. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/37</span></p>

Not even representatively or typically could Jehovah dwell in the defiled place. Religionists in this present day do exactly as the religionists did at Jerusalem. They erect buildings, where they meet, and call them by the name of “the church of God”. The Lord says to all that such are “lying words” spoken by the religious leaders, and that the Catholic population or other church-goers must not rely upon such words. Those lying words are in no wise a safeguard or guarantee against calamity or disaster to such church-goers or to anyone else. Claiming to thereby be leaning upon the Lord, at the same time they are relying on the works of men’s hands. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/37</span></p>

It is the day of battle and of victory. Let all those who love Jehovah rest in him with full assurance. As he did to Shiloh, so shall he certainly do to “Christendom” and all other parts of Satan’s organization in the very near future.

<p><span class="font7">Jesus understood it was the will of his Father Jehovah not only that he tell the truth and become Vindicator of his Father but that as a man he must die to provide the ransom or redemptive price “for many”. For how many of the human race: all or only a part? Not for all, because the redemptive price results beneficially only to those who believe on and obey God and Christ Jesus. Therefore he gave his life a ransom for as many of the human race as take their stand on the side of God and Christ and maintain integrity toward God when put to the test. (Rom. 6:23) The matter is squarely put to every man: If you prefer to continue on the Devil’s side and against God the result will be complete destruction; but if you take your stand on the side of God and Christ, you will receive the gift of life. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/37</span></p>

Zion is the habitation of Jehovah, his capital organization, chosen for himself. He shall utter his voice therefrom. This he does by proxy through his great Judge, Christ Jesus, now at the temple. God is against the unholy organization of “Christendom”. Against that organization he begins his “strange act”. He begins it by Christ Jesus, who utters the voice of Jehovah. “Christendom” is entirely of the earth, being completely removed from things spiritual. ‘At his voice the earth melted.’ (Ps. 46: 6) That will be the effect upon the religious systems.

They know they have no defense and they strike Jehovah’s witnesses in the dark, always hiding behind someone else and relying upon their reputation and standing among the political and commercial elements of Satan’s organization.

Those kingdoms will not be able to stand up under Jehovah’s shaking, but will be shaken to pieces and destroyed. The old “whore” goes first into the ashean, and then the others follow.

Thereafter he employed religion, politics and commerce to further feed his insatiable and covetous desire. “Money” means anything by which gam is measured. The evil is not in the circulating medium which is called “money”. The wrong results from loving or desiring that which enables one to reap selfish gain. Many men who have at first had faith in Jehovah God, and who began to serve him, have been led to covetousness, and that unsatisfied desire for gain has brought about their complete downfall.

Is it wrong to be self-willed and act independently? Concerning the Lord’s work, yes, it is wrong. There must be unity of action in God’s organization. Each one who really loves the Lord not only is eager to do God’s will but delights to do so, and needs only to ascertain what is the Lord’s will and then does it.

<p><span class="font7">The wise man is he who learns what is God’s will and then is diligent to conform himself to it. He is teachable and with all sincerity seeks knowledge at the hand of the Lord. Because he does so he is blessed by the Lord in that way. Such persons learn to discern and appreciate that Jehovah God is the Most High and that he does all things unselfishly and in righteousness, that Christ Jesus is his Executive Officer, to whom Jehovah has committed the great work of vindicating his name; that God has taken out a people for his name, and that such no longer follow their own selfish desires and ideas, but are guided by the Lord. They are certain they can accomplish nothing in themselves, but by following his way can accomplish his purpose. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Who is blind as he that is perfect?—Isa. 43:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah often sends his message by an imperfect man. The fact that Jehovah uses a man does not mean that the man is perfect, or even blameless so far as he himself is concerned. The man whom Jehovah uses must be loyal and faithful to God in order to be pleasing and acceptable to him. No man is perfect in his organism, but he ean be perfect in heart; he can and must love God if he pleases the Most High. The faithful servant always considers how he ean please the Lord. He is indifferent to everything else. Faithful men, whom Jehovah sent as his prophets to deliver his message, were that kind of men; that is, they were perfect in heart and unselfishly devoted to Almighty God. Because of faithfulness to God the Devil and his visible agents bitterly opposed them and induced the people to treat with contempt both messenger and message. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">That was a warning that they could not continue to break their covenant and still expect to stand before the Lord and receive his approval. Today, those who profess and practice what is called the “Christian ’ ’ religion are bound by the terms of the everlasting eovenant, and bound by the terms of the implied covenant to do God’s will, and hence are bound to be governed by and obey his commandments as written. In the face of these covenants and God’s commandments the religionists have broken their covenant with God and every part thereof. Claims founded upon lies will profit nothing. Those who hold to and rely upon religious organizations and follow the clergy’s lead are certain to come to great sorrow in the day of God’s wrath at Armageddon. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The truth when promulgated interferes with the racketeers in carrying on their racket. The proclamation of the truth offends the selfish leaders in the religious part of Satan’s organization and causes them to berate the Lord’s witnesses, who proclaim his Word of truth. The religionists do not wish to hear the truth, because it burns their ears. They do not wish others to hear it, because they know those who honestly hear and believe will withdraw from their organization and thus the pastures of the religious practitioners are spoiled and their source of revenue ends. Those religious systems and practices are the worst kind of racket, for the reason that by such means the people are easily deceived.

<p><a name="bookmark248"></a><span class="font7">Jeremiah had done nothing of the kind. He had pronounced Jehovah’s ultimatum against the wicked city; and had that message been properly received, the clergy would have been concerned with what they found in the prophecies and the manner in which they should obey God. It is always the clergy of the religionists that demand the lifeblood of those who dare tell the truth as commanded by the Lord. No moderate punishment for such offenders satisfies them. They desire to be rid of everyone who calls in question their acts and points out the crookedness of the clergy, as declared by God’s Word.

<p><span class="font7">Today the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other clergymen prophesy falsely before the people in order to keep them in ignorance of God’s purpose. It means, therefore, a fight against these false prophets for Jehovah’s witnesses to continue to carry the message to the people that they may have an opportunity to be informed. The clergy, although hearing the message, are too proud to repent, and therefore they will not tell the truth to the people, and hence attempt to prevent the people from hearing it in any manner. Jehovah’s witnesses, informing the people of the truth, thereby show to them that those clergymen whb prophesy contrary to God’s Word are deliberately lying.

<p><span class="font7">The faithful servants of the Lord “know”, because they have been given the truth and joyfully received the same. God’s purpose is that the covenant must continue to be performed by the faithful. They must show their devotion to him by the performance of their covenant continuously. The Levites, as a tribe, stood on Jehovah’s side on the occasion of the ‘golden calf’ incident at Mount Sinai. Prior to that time Aaron and his sons, who were Levites, were chosen and appointed to be priests. The Levites were charged with the duty of keeping the tabernacle. This constituted the covenant with all the tribe. The Lord Jesus at the temple reveals to the antitypical priesthood these truths concerning the covenants, and now there is no excuse for them to fail or refuse to know and to obey the Lord’s commandments.

Concerning the faithful ones and the condition in which they find themselves, it is written: “He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.” (Ps. 147:14) Every one of the faithful can testify joyfully to the fulfillment of this Psalm, foretelling peace in their borders, and that they have been filled with the finest of wheat, that is, the most precious truths, which have gladdened their hearts. These are God’s ‘other children’ by his woman Zion, now brought forth, and these are abundantly fed upon God’s gracious provision through Christ.

<p><span class="font7">“Jehovah’s day” relates to the time when Jehovah enthrones his commissioned King and sends him forth to rule. It is also referred to in the Scriptures as “that day”. It marks the time when Christ Jesus the King began to interrupt the rule of Satan which he had so long carried on unhindered. It is marked by the beginning of the war in heaven, which resulted in ousting Satan and his angels from heaven and casting them down to earth. Practically at the same time the World War began on earth. It is the time of the beginning of Satan’s overthrow, which will ultimately culminate at Armageddon. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy was forgotten and neglected “in that day”, from 1914 to 1919, and the forgetting was by her former political associates who had committed fornication with her. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/37</span></p>

That he may live for ever with Christ Jesus he must be baptized into Christ’s death. God baptizes the creature into the death of Christ, and now the creature must die a sacrificial death, even as the man Christ Jesus died, if he would live with Christ and reign with him. Being brought forth and acknowledged as a son of God, he is now a new creature in Christ Jesus. (2 Cor. 5:17) The relationship now existing is that of Father and son. He is now in God’s family under Christ Jesus, the Head thereof. He has left behind all things of the earth. His hope is entirely for the things heavenly. His right to life as a human creature has expired. Henceforth if he lives he must live as part of the family of God under Christ. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Devil and his angels have been active from the time of the rebellion at Eden until now, and will continue active until their destruction at Armageddon. As Satan “that old Serpent” is the arch deceiver, also all his wicked angels are deceivers, and the undisputed evidence shows that they continue to deceive men. They operate by gaining control of the mind of man and thereby compel or lead man to commit wrongful acts. When one undertakes to serve Almighty God and thereafter becomes unfaithful, he is easily a victim for those wicked spirit creatures. A striking example is that of Saul, who was selected as the first king of Israel. The Almighty God gave a specific command to Saul that he must perform a certain duty, and Saul, although attempting it, deliberately failed. Because thereof he fell into the snare of the Devil and his wicked angels.—Prov. 29:25. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The man who says there is no Creator is a fool. If a man puts himself in the fool class, that shows he is completely under the Devil’s control, who is his worst enemy. God does not force man to believe the truth. He puts the truth before man and permits man to exercise his own desire and to accept it or not. God is light. He it is who ‘covers himself with light’. (Ps. 104: 2) His light of truth is not given to those who serve the Devil; and that is shown by the fact that the wicked angels are restrained in darkness. “Light is sown for the righteous.” (Ps. 97:11) The man who delights himself in God’s law and strives to walk righteously is a man who walks in the light and is blessed.

<p><span class="font7">Such was typical or prophetic, foretelling the complete destruction of “Christendom”. The destruction of the religious systems by Jehovah will mark the beginning of Armageddon. The Scriptures show that God will use a visible, godless element to do the destructive work against the religionists, a crowd that has been hoodwinked by religionists, particularly by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Jehovah’s witnesses have no part in the destructive work upon “Christendom”. Their work is to bear testimony to the people in obedience to God’s commandment, even as Jeremiah carried God’s message to the people.

Many centuries ago Jehovah God declared his purpose to establish the world in righteousness and to give it to a righteous ruler. Rebellion against God caused him to declare his purpose to establish a government to be ruled in righteousness by the seed of his universal organization. From that declaration until now the thing of greatest importance among creatures is the completion and setting up of the promised kingdom. Creatures now on earth are beginning to realize more fully than ever before that all their interests and welfare are centered in God’s kingdom.

Therefore the message is of the greatest public interest, convenience and necessity. The message was from the Lord and was a warning for the people of Jerusalem. Likewise the message delivered today is a warning to the people of “Christendom” and is for their good, if only they would so regard it. It is far more important that the people should know the truth, that they may learn and take the right way and find protection, than for Jehovah’s witnesses to put on the soft pedal to avoid shocking the religious susceptibilities of pious clergymen.

Through it Jesus remained true and steadfast to God his Father, always maintaining his integrity toward God. Jehovah raised him out of death and bestowed upon him the greatest of all gifts.

Being spiritually sick and blind to God’s purpose, they continue to claim to be his servants, but they seek the approval of men.

<p><span class="font7">That selling of food does not mean that Jehovah’s witnesses may commercialize the kingdom message for selfish gain, but that it is right and proper for the people who have some means with which to buy that they shall show appreciation of God’s provision by contributing something toward the further spreading of the kingdom message that others may hear. For this reason Jehovah’s witnesses take a small contribution from those who desire and are able to contribute for the literature. When those who are unable to do so desire the message in printed form, it is freely given to them. When the people learn that the provision is not that of man, but is God’s gracious provision, they want to make a little sacrifice to show appreciation. Their hearts’ desire is that their fellow man have opportunity to learn of His provision. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/57</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">When Solomon was enthroned he did not pray that he might shine in the eyes of men, but prayed that the Lord might give him understanding and wisdom; and the Lord was pleased therewith and granted his prayer. Such is proof that this is the proper course for all of God’s servants to pursue. Solomon then discerned and appreciated his relationship to the Almighty God. Later he fell away because he became void of understanding. Those who are without understanding are worthy of death, because God gives life to no creature who exalts himself. (Bom. 1:31, 32) “Only by pride cometh contention.” (Prov. 13:10) The necessity is for complete unity of the remnant at the present/ that they may continue in understanding, which is a proper appreciation of their position before God, in his organization. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Christian is commanded to tell the truth and to leave all punishment to the Lord, who will render just recompense to the wicked in his own due time. The fact that religionists desire to do injury to and do inflict bodily punishment upon Jehovah’s witnesses is proof conclusive that such religionists are moved by the spirit of the Devil and his wicked angels. Hatred and malice of one person against another open the door for the Devil and his wicked spirits to come in and take complete charge of one who permits hatred, ill will and malice to dwell in his heart. The demons, swiftly taking advantage of that condition of mind and heart, seize his mind and use the same as an instrument to fight against the followers of Christ Jesus, and thus the human creature becomes an adversary of God and his people.

<p><span class="font7">Jeremiah must make proclamation of the message without first asking permission from the temple priests. Likewise Jehovah’s witnesses must now make proclamation of God’s message of truth concerning his name and kingdom and must do so without first asking permission from the clergy or for a license from the police authorities so to do. If among those who are held in the religious organizations any are truly seeking after God and his truth, they will hear and give heed to the message of warning that comes to them from Jehovah God and that is delivered by his witnesses, and they will recognize and accept it as the truth, and will flee from the religious organizations and thereby receive comfort, and find the plaos of safety.

If there is strife, faultfinding, backbiting or fighting in the company, that is evidence that the demons are exercising influence over some of the company, and those who are causing the strife are going to lose out unless they quickly amend their course of action. This is the time of unity in Christ, when all must stand firmly united together. (4:13) They must all present a solid, united front, fighting shoulder to shoulder, against the enemy and for the common cause of righteousness. (Phil. 1: 27, 28) Let everyone who is of the temple see to it that he abides entirely in peace with his brethren; otherwise he will not remain in the temple.

He brings it on those who merit punishment. That punishment will begin with the Catholic Hierarchy and then extend to all other visible parts of Satan’s organization, which are pictured in all nations to which Jeremiah, at the command of the Lord God, handed the cup of His fury. The nations will then begin to fall, and from one to the other the calamity will pass on until all earthly things of Satan’s crowd shall perish. The last “nation” to which the calamity comes is “Sheshach”: “the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.” (Vs. 26) Satan, first seeing his power and supporters gone, must then drink the cup of calamity. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1/37</span></p>

But in the fulfillment of the prophecy “m that day” from 1914 forward, Christ Jesus, the enthroned King of Jehovah, began and has continued his reign. The pope tried to have illicit relationship with the political powers of the nations during the World War but was pushed to the side and forgotten, between 1914 and 1919. The World War closed November 11, 1918. Shortly after that the tight position of the pope began to be lifted and the ‘being forgotten’ period began to end.

He was blind to everything else. Having heard the testimony against him, he proceeded with his defense, and in doing so he did not try to hedge or compromise. He made no apology for what he had been doing. He told the plain truth. This he did that the court might be fully advised of the facts and that those of the people present and desiring to hear the truth might hear, see and understand he was the representative of Almighty God, as he stated. By making his defense in this manner he performed his duty and obligation. Thereafter the responsibility was on those who heard him speak.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits.—Matt. 21: 43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic Church organization has never at any time brought to the people the fruits or messages of God’s kingdom. On the contrary, that organization has at all times co-operated with politicians, militarists, commercial giants, and other gangsters to rule and control the nations. Instead of bearing before the people the fruits of God’s Word, which sustain them, that is, the fruits of God’s kingdom, the Catholic organization has bitterly opposed the kingdom under Christ. Jehovah covenanted to give to Christ Jesus and his faithful ones who follow him and who are made members of his church the kingdom, which shall in time rule in righteousness and minister blessings to the people. God’s kingdom has nothing commercial and nothing in common with the wicked system that now rules the world. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/37</span></p>

By virtue of their relationship to Christ they are pictured in Jehu. The anti typical Jonadab, the people of good will, are against the Devil religion and are now seen seeking Christ Jesus, that they may learn the way to God’s organization. They must now see the zeal of the antitypical Jehu, that is, Christ Jesus. Jehu’s purpose in inviting Jonadab to come and see his zeal manifestly was that Jonadab might learn what is required of those who serve God, and this shows that those of the great multitude must also possess the zeal peculiar to God and his kingdom.

<p><span class="font7">Jehovah, through his Word which is delivered by his witnesses, informs the people that they should not believe the clergy, the preachers, or the politicians, who tell them there is no possible danger of Armageddon’s coming. The clergy are therefore the more reprehensible ; for they not only decline to ally themselves with God’s kingdom under Christ, but prevent many other people from doing so. In view of the punishment inflicted upon other prophets of Jehovah it took real faith in God, and therefore genuine courage, for Jeremiah to deliver the message that he did deliver. Having full faith in Jehovah. Jeremiah courageously called a lie a lie, regardless of what might be said of him as using rough talk. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The “wife of thy youth” stands for God’s organization, Zion. In the early days, or “youth”, of the church the apostles and their faithful co-workers were inseparably wedded to Jehovah’s organization under Christ, the Head thereof. For many years Jehovah has been a witness of the treachery against God’s organization under Christ Jesus by a class of men who have professed to be his followers but who have played with and connived at Satan’s organization, Babylon. Says the Lord to the unfaithful “priests”: “Yet is she [Zion] thy companion,” meaning “one who is joined”. Mixing with Satan’s organization and imbibing its spirit is treacherous dealing. “Let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth,” Zion, to which the priestly class are joined. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The dreams foretold not only Joseph’s exaltation but also the opening to Christ Jesus of the heavenly things, that is, the unseen things of God’s holy Word, which told of the coming exaltation of Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s King and Vindicator, above every other creature in the universe. (Matt. 3:16) The exaltation of Christ Jesus was further foretold by the vision of transfiguration in the mountain. When Jesus stood before his accusers he said: “Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.” The Jewish clergy hated Jesus and sought to kill him because he said that Jehovah was his Father, and that his Father loved him. Faithfully obedient to Jehovah’s commandments, Jesus did “bear witness unto the truth” concerning himself and the kingdom of God.

<p><span class="font7">The great and primary purpose of Jehovah is the vindication of his name and to clear his name of reproach brought upon it by the Devil. He has appointed Christ Jesus to the high office of Vindicator. He sent Jesus into the world to deliver God’s message of truth concerning his purpose, and appointed and anointed him as King of the world. Every person whom God puts into his family under Christ Jesus must hear the voice of Christ Jesus, be obedient thereto and walk as he walked, always faithful and true to God, maintaining his integrity toward Him. Those in Christ Jesus must therefore do what Jesus does, because they are called to follow where he leads them. They are taken out from among men and made new creatures in Christ for the sake of God’s name. IV </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/37</span></p>

They were not Israelites. There were thirty-eight in all of the Levites and 220 Nethinim brought to Ezra, all of them expressly named. The men of understanding, those who showed their qualifications, were placed in key positions of service. “Iddo the chief” appears to have been one of the Nethinim and was assigned to a place of service over others who ministered at the house of God. Thus the type shows that the “Levites”, the anointed class, and the great multitude, the class not anointed, work together. Nethinim assisted Ezra’s delegation in the work assigned to them, thus proving that the two companies on earth as companions serve together.

From that point forward Babylon symbolized exclusively the Devil’s organization, and her king Belshazzar is a symbol of the Devil. The end of the seventy years pictured the climax of Armageddon.

If they showed the spirit of kindness toward the least of Christ’s brethren, pictured by Benjamin, and sought to do them good because they served God and Christ Jesus, this would show a right heart condition and they would be adjudged worthy to be of the “sheep” class.

He informs the nations, in advance of approaching Armageddon, of the great ills that will come to them by refusing to bow themselves willingly to the rule of his servant, Christ Jesus. This is done that they may not have an excuse for ignorance. God will permit to survive and live only those who willingly put themselves under the rule of Christ Jesus, pictured by the king of Babylon.

The Lord God therefore tells these unfaithful “priests” that they have enjoyed great privileges of serving him but have proved unfaithful, and now others of less privilege are seeking the way to his organization and are singing his praises. The unfaithful “priests”, by their course of conduct, have said and continue to say louder than by uttered words that “the table of the Lord is polluted”.

The truths made known and published do not belong to any man or company of men. The truth is the Lord’s and is progressive and shines with increased brilliancy unto the perfect day. This should be the strongest kind of proof that God’s people are led by him and that the Lord is feeding them by placing upon his table from time to time such spiritual food as he sees is to their good, and to his glory.

The temple had been built, and their faith was in it and not in God. What came to pass upon Jerusalem is duplicated upon “Christendom”, except, as to “Christendom”, upon a far greater scale. Many believe the Catholic church is a charm against all ills.

<p><span class="font7">Why has God permitted the Devil to oppress and afflict those on earth who have agreed to serve him? Why has he not safeguarded these faithful ones from all assaults of the Devil? The answer is that if God should do so, the Devil would not have free hand in his effort to prove his wicked challenge; and, furthermore, those who have agreed to serve God can prove their integrity and faithfulness to God only by resisting the Devil’s assaults, and under all conditions of persecution continuing to maintain integrity toward God.

<p><span class="font7">As Jehovah’s witnesses are now subjected to all manner of ill-treatment and persecution by the so-called “higher powers” of this world, and particularly by the religionists, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, let them take courage and rejoice in the fact that they are privileged today to stand in a place similar to that occupied by Jeremiah and to declare a message similar to what he declared. Let them take courage, having in mind that Jehovah God is backing them up, and that they are doing his will and as long as faithfully doing this no evil shall befall them. His faithful witnesses are now in God’s secret place, and for their help and comfort it is written: “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.”—Ps. 91: 1. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Those to whom the kingdom interests are committed, and who perform the assigned duty in an indifferent or careless manner cannot properly seek some way of justifying their mistakes resulting from carelessness. If a task is assigned to one of the temple company and he performs in a careless and indifferent manner and then tries to justify his action, he is unfaithful and makes an unfaithful report and of necessity must be displeasing to the Lord. To profit by mistakes or carelessness one must acknowledge to the Lord his weakness and be diligent in seeking to do the right thing and see to it that he does not act carelessly again. The Pharisees sought to excuse or justify themselves before the Lord in failing to do their duty. He who tries to justify his action to have men’s approval is not faithfully performing duty.

<p><span class="font7">Such Medes appear to picture those organized elements who work with religionists in striving to prevent the activities of God’s covenant people, and who endeavor to hold such witnesses in restraint and prevent them from worshiping God as he has commanded. In various political and judicial offices are many who claim to be Christian, but have no faith in God and Christ, but work with the high-up religionists who do claim to be Christians, and co-operate with such in inflicting punishment upon Jehovah’s witnesses because it appears to be to the advantage of such political and judicial tools of the Hierarchy. They work together with the police or the military crowd to compel obedience to their unrighteous judicial decisions against God’s people. All must drink this cup of his fury. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/37</span></p>

There is no other privilege today comparable with that, so far as the “other sheep’’ are concerned. Great responsibilities and requirements are now laid upon those of the “other sheep” of the present time, that is, the great multitude. They must be fully and wholly consecrated to the Lord and must render themselves in full obedience to his commandments and joyfully engage in his service. They must, together with the remnant, joyfully take up the message of life, which God has provided, and bear it before the people of the famine-stricken world, that those now in the world and who so desire may learn the way and flee to the place of refuge. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lift up a standard for the people.—Isa. 62:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is the time of war. It is a war of righteousness against wickedness, a war of truth against entrenched lies. All who love God and righteousness will now with gladness do their part by lifting high the standard of the Lord that the people of good will may see the way of righteousness and the place of refuge. Those of the remnant possessing the spirit of Christ will take the lead, and the Jonadabs will march with them, and all together they will be singing the praises of Jehovah and of Christ Jesus and his kingdom, and all together participating in the Lord’s service. The Jonadabs are in an implied covenant to proclaim the truth, and thus identify themselves with the Lord’s organization. Therefore the remnant and the Jonadabs engage in the witness work together. Never before have creatures enjoyed such a privilege, and never again will that privilege come, because the “strange work” is now being done, and when it is done, to completeness, his “strange act” will quickly follow. 17 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The company of faithful witnesses receives the Lord’s command to go throughout “Christendom” and mark the forehead of the sincere ones that sigh and cry because of the hypocritical practices and wickedness done by religionists. Thus the Lord by his witnesses puts the mark in the forehead of such by giving them information from God’s Word, that they may intelligently get an understanding of Jehovah’s purposes, which will enable them to flee out of the wicked religious organization and find refuge under God’s King. His witnesses must vigorously, boldly and fearlessly declare his name and purpose regardless of opposition and attacks upon them by the enemy. It means a war, which is now in progress; and that is a war of righteousness carried on by proclaiming the truth against wicked hypocrites.

<p><span class="font7">The lean and ill-favored cattle picture the people of good will, held in the prisons of Satan by reason of his religious agents and starving for want of nourishing food. These prisoners must be fed. The seven lean cattle’s eating the seven well-fed cattle here shows that the people of good will toward God must feed upon and consume the provisions which Jehovah has made for them by and through his organization. Sin atonement has been provided, which they must learn about, and they must exercise faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus. They must learn of and do the will of Jehovah God in order to be hid and escape the sword of slaughter at Armageddon, and then “inherit the kingdom [blessings] prepared for [them] from the foundation of the world”.—Matt. 25: 34.

<p><span class="font7">God permitted his enemies to put Jesus to death, knowing that Jesus would remain faithful even unto death, proving his integrity to God, and that God would raise him up out of death. Because of his faithfulness God raised up Jesus out of death and gave him life and immortality, not as a man, but life divine, an endless and indestructible life, and exalted Jesus to the very highest place in all the universe next to Jehovah. God committed to Christ Jesus, the immortal One, all power in heaven and in earth. Christ Jesus, therefore, became clothed with all power and authority to act for Jehovah in all things as his chief executive officer. Jesus proved Satan a liar, and this in vindication of Jehovah’s name and word. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">7/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The names of Joseph’s two sons are significant and show that all blessings of Jehovah’s remnant on earth are such as to “make to forget’’ all the afflictions they must endure as pilgrims and strangers in this world in order to enter into the kingdom. The faithful followers of Christ Jesus know that they must suffer with Christ Jesus and be made of no reputation among men. They gladly bear such and forget these sufferings, well knowing that they are not worthy to be compared with the glory that follows. The name “Manasseh” means to “make to forget”. The name “Ephraim” means “fruitful” or “double fruit”, and shows that the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses are loaded with kingdom fruits, by which they first feed themselves and then bear the kingdom fruits to others that they may be fed. This they joyfully do, despite afflictions. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Here is a precedent Jehovah’s witnesses are counseled that such witnesses, accused, might follow, to wit: To cite the court to the instance recorded in the Bible where men have shown wisdom by giving heed to God’s warning, as the elder did on this occasion. With propriety counsel might cite Psalm Two, in which the Lord warns the rulers to give heed now, since Christ has been enthroned. Jehovah’s witnesses are not attempting to wrong anyone by obeying God’s command or giving God’s warning to the people. This fact should be plainly put before the court. How foolish it is for men upon the judicial bench, or elsewhere, to attempt to override and push aside Almighty God’s Word! All who claim to serve God should keep in mind that the Almighty is supreme. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">God’s instruction to Jeremiah was mandatory, and the prophet had no alternative. Jeremiah would have been disobedient to God had he gone to the king or court officers or priests in charge of the temple, or to anyone else, and asked for a permit or license to preach the message which the Almighty God had commanded him to deliver. For the same reason Jehovah’s witnesses today would be disobedient to God and to his great prophet, Christ Jesus, by applying for a permit or license to preach the gospel by going from house to house and delivering the message. The Lord has given , his positive commandment that his witnesses shall thus preach and obey him. A failure to obey his commandment means their complete destruction.

Thus the “abomination of desolation” is complete. Jehovah is now carrying on his “strange work” which serves to enlighten the people of good will and to show them the only way of escape. Only those who find that way will escape. The old “whore” sitting upon the back of the League “beast” may soon be expected to say: ‘Peace and safety; we have silenced all opponents.’ Then Jehovah’s “strange act” will begin, and sudden destruction comes upon her as travail upon a woman with child. Her triumph will be short. Her end will be complete destruction. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/37</span></p>

I</span><span class="font7"> willingly walking with Christ Jesus, suffering with him as he suffered for righteousness’ sake? Have I the zeal for the Lord and his house, and am I performing my vow of consecration fully?” One examines himself in this way in the light of the Scriptures and determines from the witness of the spirit whether or not he is the Lord’s child. It is the called, chosen and faithful ones that shall be for ever with Christ in glory. It is not sufficient that a man merely names the name of the Lord and calls upon him. The approved ones in the temple are sent forth in obedience to the Lord’s commandment, and that commandment they must obey, to be witnesses for Jehovah and proclaim the truth of and concerning his kingdom. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The howl comes, not from the pagan clergy, but from the clergy and “elective elder” class of “Christendom” and who call themselves leaders and shepherds of the flock, and to whom Jehovah refers also as those who have assumed to use his name. For some time now the clergy have been howling and importuning selfish politicians and commercial men to help them to make a great fuss and to prevent Jehovah’s witnesses from telling the truth about them. The clergymen'howl because the truth of God’s Word now proclaimed exposes them and puts them in the class where they properly belong, that is, of fraudulent hypocrites, and because truth is sweeping away the refuge of lies behind which they hide. Jehovah says they will howl, and he is seeing to it now that they do howl. When Armageddon begins their howl will reach its climax.

<p><span class="font7">Joseph’s ten half brothers here represented those who have had a change of heart and become persons of good will toward God and his faithful remnant and therefore have become of the “other sheep” of Christ Jesus, the great multitude. Pharaoh’s words to Joseph show the propriety of the remnant’s appointing as servants of the Lord the Jonadabs and assigning such as are qualified to places of responsibility in the service. It is proper for Jonadabs to be associated with the remnant in service, to be assigned to such places by the service committee, i. e, places as captains of a division or like places in service. Where Jonadabs exhibit necessary qualifications, and particularly the zeal for the Lord and full humility in walking with him in obedience, they are Scripturally assigned to places of service over others. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/37</span></p>

Christ is not and never was for one moment a religionist. He always strictly obeys the commandments of Almighty God. He instructed his faithful disciples in the Word and purpose of Jehovah. After the resurrection of Jesus the holy spirit, God’s invisible power, came upon the faithful apostles and they understood the truth as it was not possible for them to understand it before that time. In the name of Christ they went about “from house to house”, teaching and preaching. Because they were freely telling the truth to the people concerning Christ, the religionists among the Jews assaulted the apostles and brought them into the courts. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of the Lord our God.—Jer. 26:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That sets a proper precedent for judges of courts of the present time to follow. The fact that many presentday judges do not makes them bloodguilty with the clergy. Magistrates even place the law of man above the law of Almighty God and openly and flagrantly insult Jehovah’s name. Let them take notice that God will not permit their conduct to pass without consideration and due recompense. Many of those magistrates profess to be Christians and that they follow the Lord. For that reason they are bound to take notice of the prophecies which the Lord caused to be recorded in his Word. Jehovah never changes a rule for any person, be he clergyman, high judicial official, politician or ordinary man. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The prophecy refers to two opposing organizations. It could not be that Jehovah would supply an abundance of spiritual food for his remnant on earth and then stop that supply and compel them to live on old supplies of the past by stopping the progress and unfolding of his prophetic truths. The facts show fully the very opposite. “The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” (Prov. 4:18) God’s people once anointed and brought into the temple progress in understanding and appreciation of his Word. In the modern fulfillment the two periods or conditions run along side by side, the one condition in God’s organization, and the other in Satan’s, “seven years,” that is, from the Lord’s coming to the temple and until the vindication of Jehovah’s name at Armageddon.

<p><span class="font7">Clergymen stand in the same position Hananiah occupied, in their efforts to destroy faith in God’s message that is brought to them. But the Devil and his agents cannot thwart Jehovah. Jehovah tells the people, through his Word, that not only are the false prophets or clergymen, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their supporters, uttering lies by their words, but all their efforts to thwart God’s purpose will fail, and that only those who will give heed to God’s Word and put themselves under Christ Jesus shall ever live.

This is especially true since Zion gave birth to the nation and has brought forth her other children. (Isa. 66: 7, 8) It is the selfish ones who fight against their brethren, insisting on having their own way. They fail to heed the admonition of the apostle to stand shoulder to shoulder and fight for the kingdom gospel and against the common enemy. They are out of harmony and not at unity.

By “men” is meant those who have come to maturity in Christ and who therefore must be at complete unity, appreciating their position and responsibility before God. To God’s people are addressed these words: “Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ; that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro.” (Eph. 4: 13, 14) These words apply now, because the present is the time of complete unity.

On the contrary, they are to be avoided. Those of the “evil servant” class employ soft speech and smooth words to beguile and deceive others who are seeking the truth. They are mere tools of the unseen principalities, powers and wicked rulers that control this wicked world. Many political, judicial and military rulers of this world are enemies of God and of the “faithful servant” class but are less reprehensible because of lack of knowledge.

He is the Father of the “Lion of the tribe of Juda”, who executes His judgments and vindicates his name. Jehovah refers to himself as the One who is all-just, symbolized by a lion. He justifies and vindicates himself in righteousness by destroying his enemies, that the universe may be clean and all who live shall do righteousness. Every part of Satan’s organization shall fall. As Jeremiah warned the people, so now the faithful ones on Jehovah’s side, who proclaim his truth, must continue to warn the people during the progress of Jehovah’s “strange work” and until its finish. “My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the Lord. ’ ’—51:45.

Such are the ones that mourn and desire to be comforted and to whom the remnant are sent as anointed servants of God to bring them comfort. Such are the people of good will, and the obligation is upon the remnant to make known God’s provisions for all those who diligently seek to know and to do his will.

<p><span class="font7">Chittim, being near to Tyre, would represent any subsidiary organization where the old woman might seek rest and relief but find none. This would seem to indicate that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy system will be seeking a place of consolation, and therefore abasing herself by going to some lesser organization, seeking a way to escape the deepest abasement, certain to come upon her by reason of being cast into Gehenna. Will the Hierarchy system find rest there? Jehovah replies: “There also shalt thou have no rest.” Not even individual members of the religious clergy will be able to disguise themselves, thus hiding their identity. They will not escape the scrutiny of others, and certainly not God’s Executive Officer.

Contention and strife among those who profess to be of the remnant are entirely wrong. Our fight is against the common enemy, not against one another. Everyone who really loves God and his people will put forth his best endeavors to serve in an unselfish way, having in mind that every servant must be accountable to the Lord.

<p><span class="font7">Obedience is better than sacrifice. (1 Sam. 15:22) That is an unchangeable rule given by the Lord to those who claim to serve him. Speaking to the Israelites by his prophet Jehovah tells them that their sacrifices without obedience avail them nothing. He says to them: “Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; ... Yet they hearkened not unto me.” The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the under-clergy pretend to offer sacrifices to the Lord, but utterly ignore his commandments, refusing to obey him, and they teach for doctrines the commandments of men. The same message declared to typical Israel Jehovah commands shall be declared to “Christendom”. The Lord now sends his witnesses to “Christendom” to speak his message. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Exercising his loving-kindness, God has provided that the attention of the people should be brought to the truth concerning himself and his provision to give them life. He causes his Word to be proclaimed that they may hear. Satan seeks to destroy all mankind, but Almighty God graciously informs man that all who will get on God’s side, believe upon and serve the Lord Jesus Christ and Jehovah and prove faithful, shall live. After the flood Satan induced men to practice religion in mockery of God and all nations adopted the Devil religion. Jehovah then chose the people of Israel, and gave them his commandments and instructed them how they could obey God and live. Thus the matter was clearly put before mankind. Man could choose to stay in the Devil’s crowd or could faithfully serve Jehovah. TV </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">7/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Take note that Jehovah’s witnesses, whom Jeremiah pictured, now are not permitted to except or pass up or excuse any peoples or nations. Their duty is to declare the message of Almighty God as it is written. Religionists of “Christendom” are astounded and greatly offended because Jehovah’s witnesses classify, not just one religion or church system, but all religions and religious systems, as devilish and therefore wrong and dishonoring to God. They set up a mad howl and shout: “Jehovah’s witnesses say every religion is wrong except their own”; but the facts are, Jehovah’s witnesses have no religion whatever; they stand solidly and entirely upon God Almighty’s Word and point out the authoritative words of Jesus that religion is of the Devil, the purpose of which is to make void the Word of God.

Those possessions or goods mean all the interests of the kingdom now pertaining to the earth and the peoples thereof. The time is at hand when the Lord will clear out all unrighteous rule and will substitute a government of complete righteousness to the glory and honor of Jehovah’s name. The preliminary work to be done before this clearing out is the work of making known God’s name and purpose, that the people may learn about it and have due notice. Jehovah grants that every one of the temple company shall do his part in making known His name and kingdom. Is that commandment discretionary or mandatory? It is an imperative mandate, the responsibility of which cannot be sidestepped. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/37</span></p>

Likewise Christ Jesus expressly says of the members of his household that they are not of the world, “even as I am not of the world.” The remnant on the earth have so arranged their affairs and so deported themselves as to show they are not of this world. The same is true of the great multitude, who have so arranged their affairs and earthly circumstances, and by their course of conduct declare themselves to be separate and distinct from this world over which Satan now exercises power and control. Remnant and great multitude have eye and heart set on God’s kingdom and are merely sojourners, having here in this world no permanent abiding place, but waiting for full establishment of the kingdom. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/37</span></p>

That class of creatures will maliciously exult over the destruction of religious organizations that claim to represent God, and will also exult over any punishment inflicted against true Christians, who in truth and in fact represent God. The purpose of God’s message is to give warning to the evildoers so that they will be without excuse.

<p><span class="font7">God’s first and greatest commandment to all creatures means there is no division of affection between God and any creature. One must unselfishly devote himself to the Almighty God in exclusion of others. He must have no other God. He must not compromise by serving Jehovah a while and trying to serve and receive favor of any of God’s enemies at any time. Then says the Lord: &quot;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” (Vs. 39) That means that the man recognizes that the rights and privileges of other creatures are equal to his own, and therefore he desires to do and does to others what he would have them to do to him. He puts himself on an equality and demands nothing more for himself than he is willing to give to others. &quot;On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”—Vs. 40.

Within the ark, both before and during the flood, there were daily duties to be performed of feeding and caring for those living creatures, and the family of Noah rendered assistance in this behalf, thereby foretelling what is to be done by the Jonadabs as helpers or companions of the remnant. Noah’s household had recognition of Jehovah God through Noah. Certainly Noah would direct the members of his family as to what they should do. Noah’s family were carried over from the old world, being protected and saved from the deluge.

All coming to the knowledge of the great truths must give glory unto the name of Jehovah God and cease bestowing adulation, honor, glory and praise upon men. To obey this commandment those servants in the priest’s office must correct the abuses and practices of which they were guilty and into which error they had led others. Formalism, assumed sanctimoniousness, the ‘more holy than thou’ attitude, seeking honor of men, and giving glory to men, and all things of that nature, must be put away.

Do not permit yourself to become bitter or have hatred and ill will or desire to do bodily injury to any workers of iniquity. The Lord will take care of them in his own due time and good way.

The fact that his “strange act’’, that is, the battle of the great day of God Almighty, will begin by the destruction of the religionists of “Christendom” does not mean there will thereafter be a period of witness work for the purpose of gathering the “great multitude”. On the contrary, the Scriptures show that the witness work must be completed before the great tribulation begins. When the “old whore” goes down, there will be some that will weep and wail.

<p><span class="font7">Jehovah does not bring the 'merchandise and hire of the harlot ’ into his temple, but by carrying on and doing his “strange work” he exposes the wickedness of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the religionists, and thus counteracts the effects of her merchandise and hire and causes the same to work against the religionists, and the result is beneficial to those who love righteousness and hate iniquity. This he does by causing the people to have their eyes opened to the truth, and those people of good will, who thus see and identify the Roman Catholic organization as a part of Satan’s organization, separate themselves from that wicked organization and hasten to Jehovah’s 'city of refuge’, the place of holiness.

As Jeremiah, God’s servant, warned the rulers and the people to give no heed to false prophets, such as Hananiah, even so today Jehovah, by sending his witnesses with his warning message to the rulers and to the people of “Christendom”, tells them to give no heed to the false prophets, such as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other clergymen, and their supporters.

To the remnant has been committed or entrusted the great privilege of delivering the testimony of Jesus Christ in obedience to God’s commandments. If they continue to be of the remnant they must faithfully obey his commandments and thereby prove their love for God and Christ. As the ambassadors of Christ and the servants of God on earth much has been entrusted to them, and in order to receive God’s approval and maintain their integrity toward him they must render a full account of their stewardship in harmony with his commands, and the moving cause for doing such must be love or unselfishness.

If we observe others doing despite to the commandments of God and attempting to work injury upon God’s people and his kingdom, shall we not be angry against such ? We may properly be righteously indignant against all unrighteousness, but it is not our prerogative to apply the rule of retaliation against evildoers. A hatred and malice toward evildoers, and a desire to do them bodily injury, would be sin, but to hate the wrong and let the wrongdoers take their own course is a different thing entirely. To the Lord belongs vengeance. It is not any Christian’s business to mete out punishment to another ; and the one who does so is certain to fall under the influence of the Devil and his demons.

<p><span class="font7">It being important that the Jonadabs get on peacefully together, it is certainly of equal importance that the anointed proceed peaceably. To all of these the Lord now says: “Do not quarrel in the way” (Swedish Bible); meaning that you must see to it that you dwell together in peace and go forward unitedly in the Lord’s service. This is a time for peace and harmony among the people of God’s organization, and a time for war between his organization and the Devil’s crowd. Loyalty and faithfulness, peace and harmony are therefore essential that all may manifest the spirit peculiar to the Lord’s house and that they may present a solid front against the enemy.

A careless, indifferent or “happy-go-lucky” person cannot maintain his integrity toward the Lord. Faithful performance of duty is required by the Lord of his servant, and one cannot be negligent and indifferent and at the same time receive the Lord’s approval. From the time the kingdom interests are placed in the keeping of the “faithful and wise servant” and until the battle of Armageddon is a time of conflict, and when one is fighting the enemy he must be on guard, be watchful and see to it that he does not perform his duty in a careless and indifferent way and permit to slip by him opportunities for advancing the kingdom interests.

Religion is a racket, and those who practice it for gain are racketeers. Chief among all racketeers are those who form the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, who rob the people of their money, take away their liberty of thought and action, and put in jeopardy their lives. Against such deceivers God says: “The wicked worketh a deceitful work.” (Prov. 11: 18) The wicked are those who once had God’s favor by being placed in position to know his Word and who then employed what knowledge they obtained for selfish gain. Since Satan’s world has reached its climax, the time has come for the people to know the truth and determine whether to follow their worst enemies or to render themselves in obedience to the great God of the universe.

The remnant and the Jonadabs must keep in mind at all times that their only place of safety is to remain true and faithful to Almighty God as Jesus and other witnesses in the past have done. They are not to put trust in princes or in any man. They are not to attempt to compromise or soften Jehovah’s Word with the hope of being let off easier by courts of the land.

The people of good will must now show that they have the spirit of sacrifice and unselfishness and that they desire to aid others to get the needed spiritual food, and hence they make a small sacrifice to that end.

Having taken our stand on the side of God and his kingdom, now let us stand firm and quit ourselves like men fully matured in Christ Jesus. That those who have taken their stand on the Lord’s side may remain firm and maintain their integrity and engage successfully in this fight, performing the part assigned to them, the apostle says: “Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness.” (Vs. 14) Their girdle of servitude is that of the truth. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/37</span></p>

The cup of wine which Jeremiah was commanded to take was a symbol representing what God would present to the people. The cup was a vessel holding a potion, and therefore pictures the vessels which Jehovah uses to present “the wine of this fury” to those who must drink it. Hence the cup pictures (1) his faithful witnesses under Christ Jesus, who are sent forth to the nations to bear witness, which nations include “ Christendom ”; and (2) Christ Jesus, the great Vessel, the mighty Executioner, and all his holy angels associated with him in executing Jehovah’s judgment.

<p><span class="font7">At the very beginning of the organization of the League of Nations the Roman Catholic Hierarchy sought a place or seat therein. She there began to put on her show to get into it and to dominate the League. When that ‘beast came up out of the pit’ (Rev. 17:8) following the World War, the old “harlot” climbed on its back, and has been riding since, and exercising the guiding control of the League, claiming the right to rule and vigorously attempting to rule the world in the place and stead of Christ Jesus; therefore the “abomination that maketh desolate” is the League of Nations, labeled by organized religion “the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth”. It stands where it ought not. This is a warning to flee to God’s organization. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Perfect creatures are moved by unselfishness to do what is right. Laws are necessary for imperfect men to have as a sure guide, that they may go the right way. The laws were made for just such. (1 Tim. 1: 9) Love, which is the perfect expression of unselfishness, is the complete fulfillment of the law, therefore making enforcement of law unnecessary. The very essence of the law is written in the heart of every creature that is in full harmony with God and delights to do his will. The law which God gave to the Israelites was not for God’s benefit, but entirely for man’s benefit. If a man walks with the Devil he is certain to die, but if he maintains his integrity toward God he will live. Therefore God gave Israel his law through Moses, which law applies to all who want to do right. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jehovah God is the Creator; man is the creature. The creature is entirely dependent upon the Creator for life, blessings and happiness. The creature man begins to get some sense when he fears the Creator. He learns he must be entirely subject to the will of the Creator. Appreciating his own imperfections, he then sees the necessity of rendering himself in obedience to God’s will. He denies himself and knowingly and gladly takes the course all sensible creatures should take; that is, he voluntarily agrees to do the will of God. He learns that the Devil is the wicked one, God’s adversary and the great enemy of all men, who tries to turn men away from God and to destroy them. Therefore the creature flees from the Devil and seeks protection through Christ Jesus in God’s organization. He covenants to do God’s will.

<p><span class="font7">Before tailing his stand in that place and delivering the Lord’s message, did Jeremiah first apply to the king or his officers for a permit to go and thus testify? He did not, because the Lord had not so instructed him and he was there to obey the Lord. God sent his prophet to do what he was told to do. A definite precedent for Jehovah’s witnesses is here fixed by the positive course taken by Jeremiah. In the days of the apostles they followed the same precedent when they said to the officers of the law: “We ought to obey God rather than men.” Jehovah’s witnesses are to go out among the people that attend religious meetings and that support organized religion, and inform them of Jehovah’s purpose, warning them of his impending strange act”. 7/ </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In beautiful poetic phrase Jehovah’s prophet describes the spiritual class, which constitutes the bride of Christ Jesus and is designated in the prophecy as “the daughter” of the “King of Eternity”. Then he tells of a class, purified ones, because they are called “virgins”. This shows that those associates must be washed in the blood of Christ Jesus by exercising faith in his blood, and be devoted to him, they devoting themselves to God’s service. In Scripture these “virgins” are specifically called the “companions” of “the King’s daughter”: “The King’s daughter is all glorious within; her clothing is of wrought gold. She shall be brought unto the King in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.” (Vss. 13, 14) They did not merely adorn Christ’s bride by their presence, but rendered assistance to her.

He has no desire to act selfishly or presumptuously. His one desire is to perform the Lord’s will, recognizing the Lord has an organization and his own way of instructing his people. Someone must outline the method of work and send forth the instructions concerning the outline. That part of the Lord’s organization on earth performs the duty as assigned to it, and is responsible to him, and surely the Lord has one way, and not divers ways, of carrying on his work. If a mistake is made the Lord will correct it, and that duty of correcting will not be left to some local service committee. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">When Christ Jesus gathered to himself his faithful followers, it was then, and still is, a joyful time, because it is the time for vindicating Jehovah’s name. Therefore he says to the “faithful servant” class to whom he has committed the care of his kingdom interests: 'Come, participate in this great joy with me.’ In obedience to the Lord’s commandment the servant now goes about proclaiming Jehovah’s name and kingdom. Because they do so they are subjected to all manner of abuse and ill-treatment, even as Jesus foretold. They are not happy because of ill-treatment, abuse and imprisonment, but are joyful in the Lord; for this is evidence they are following in Jesus’ footsteps and will have part in vindicating His name. Many suffer bodily pain, bitter tears are forced to flow, but they rejoice that they are God’s children, privileged to prove integrity under adverse conditions that they may have His approval.

<p><span class="font7">God’s organization is pure and guilty of no fornication or illicit relationship. When one enters the covenant relationship with God and is united with his organization through Christ Jesus, he cannot divorce himself therefrom on the ground of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">uncleanness in that organization.</span><span class="font7"> It is not possible for God’s organization to be unclean. The uncleanness is in the one who mixes with Satan’s organization, which is unfaithfulness and rebellion on his part against God, and so therefore he deals treacherously. There is no excuse or justification for one to withdraw from God’s organization. If he does withdraw he thereby shows his own uncleanness.

(Ps. 18: 2, 3) Suppose the name and reputation of all God’s children should be trampled in the mire and they be made to appear as wicked lawbreakers and as corrupt. The enemy can do that, but that amounts to nothing in the Lord’s sight. The reputation of God’s people among men is of no importance. Their standing with the Lord Jehovah and Christ Jesus is all-important. Jesus made himself of no reputation. What others think about us need not disturb us in the least. Every servant must stand or fall to his own master. If we are faithfully trusting and serving God, he will make us to stand. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/37</span></p>

After the battle, they will, if continuing faithful and obedient, find life in abundance.

In due time they shall all be of one fold, giving praise and service to God. The faithful men of old who served as “witnesses” for Jehovah, even to pouring out their lifeblood, are set forth as examples of faithfulness which the spiritual class are admonished to follow. Those faithful men are called martyrs or “witnesses”. (12: 1) They were witnesses to Jehovah then as some are witnesses to him today. All these firmly stand together, each class joyfully taking the position assigned, and render service as assigned, to God’s glory. Thus they are shown as companions knit together in His service.

(Prov. 12: 11) He must keep always in mind that Jehovah is the Most High and that the creature is the servant, of whom God requires full obedience. Therefore he must think soberly of himself, and not think more highly of himself than he ought to think. (Rom. 12: 3) He must not seek praise of men nor even to be a pleaser of men, but must seek always to please the Lord God and have his approval. Those who seek to shine before men may be highly commended by others. Their immediate reward, and the sole reward they receive, is the approval of men, but not the approval of God.

The noise that begins at “Christendom”, a “noise” because of destruction, will go around the entire earth, no nation being omitted.

It does not mean “hilarity”. Anyone who is careless and negligent in performing his assigned duty and is chastised for that reason and then sings and says: “Well, I’ve told the Lord all about it, and now I am happy,” that person is deceiving himself. To be sure, God knows everything. Mistakes cannot properly make one happy, but will make him sober and thoughtful that he may profit thereby and make further progress.

Jeremiah delivered the message from the Lord, like that delivered by Urijah, and instead of showing fear he stood his ground and said to his accusers: 'I have delivered the message God sent me to deliver; now do what seems good to you.’ Jeremiah showed faith in God and therefore no fear of man. Taking refuge in another part of Satan’s organization furnished no protection whatever to Urijah, and it also showed a lack of faith in God. It appears that Jehovah removed his protection from Urijah because of his fear of man. Urijah would as well have stood his ground and died there. He would then have died for his faithfulness, if he died at all. Fleeing into Egypt resulted in no good to him. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">When Armageddon begins and progresses, the slaying will not be only in “Christendom”; it will necessarily include all the nations of the world, because such shall drink of the cup of this fury, as the Lord declares. Weeping for the destruction of the wicked is now and always will be out of ojder. “They shall not be lamented,” because that is Jehovah’s commandment to the anointed and to those of good will, who alone will survive that day of slaughter. His will is that those fully devoted to him pray for destruction of the wicked who oppose Jehovah and his kingdom. The slaying of such wicked ones, instead of being cause for lamentation on the part of God’s faithful ones, will be a cause of joy, because such see the vindication of Jehovah’s name and his Word. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W12/1/37</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips.—Mal. 2: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This describes Christ Jesus as Jehovah’s great High Priest. All his true and faithful followers are necessarily included in this description; that means also the faithful remnant now on earth. As Jehovah’s servant Jesus spoke out boldly and plainly published God’s law and denounced the counterfeit law of the religious organization that defamed Jehovah’s name. He openly showed that God’s law is supreme and far above the law of man-made governments or institutions. “Iniquity,” that is, disloyalty or lawlessness and perversion, “was not found in his lips.” He upheld the law of Jehovah. The same must be true of his faithful remnant who in the face of cruel opposition continue the service. Being part of the priesthood, they will go courageously on proclaiming the kingdom message, which God has commanded them to do.

<p><span class="font7">“A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men. ” (18:16) Gifts or contributions are made at a sacrifice or eost, and show an unselfish disposition and willingness to obey and serve the Most High. Gifts carried to the King Christ Jesus manifest the spirit of unselfish service and devotion. Unselfishness, which is love, is demonstrated by a willing desire and effort to further the cause of righteousness. Those of good will, the “other sheep” of the Lord, now show their unselfish desire to aid in supporting the kingdom message to the honor of Jehovah’s name and for the good of those who love righteousness. They manifest this disposition by making a sacrifice, willingly contributing their means to further publication of the kingdom message. Thus they grow in godlikeness.

For many years that religious organization has boasted, ‘The gates of hell shall never prevail against us,’ and now not only will those-seeing it go down be shocked, but to them it will appear very strange that such a calamity could come to an organization that claimed to represent God. This indicates that at the very beginning of Armageddon the religious organizations as such will perish and others seeing it will wail. Religion has been a means employed by the Devil to build his mighty organization on earth,which has deceived millions. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">4./I/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">One who has understanding is wise, and his appearance and deportment are in keeping therewith. The understanding servant of God appreciates his relationship to the Lord. He is the representative of Jehovah and Christ Jesus to deliver to others the Lord’s message. Certainly this means a clean body, clean in physical appearance, and clean in mind. When appearing before others as the Lord’s representative the witness of the Lord should be gentle, pleasing, and his words should be gracious. Called to follow in the footsteps of the Master, he should keep in mind that ‘gracious words fell from His lips’. The witness should tell of God’s purpose to destroy the wicked and bless those who are righteous. But such speech should be without offense. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Early in the day of his dealing with his covenant people God began to instruct them. His prophets rose up early in the day and there began to preach to the people. There was much complaint against them for so doing. Even today complaint is made by religionists against Jehovah’s witnesses, objection being made that they come early and ring doorbells and wake them up and speak to them about the Lord; and then the clergy induces the officers to arrest and hale them into court. Jehovah caused his message of warning to be given a sufficient length of time before the day of his wrath in order to give ample time to have it heard. Instead of reforming and doing what is right, religionists continue to persecute the faithful witnesses of Jehovah. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jesus taught the people fully and sincerely to obey God’s commandments. Thus Jesus established true Christianity. “Christianity” means the full and complete obedience of man to God’s commandments, even as Christ Jesus taught and obeyed God’s commandments. A person is a Christian only when he is a true follower of Christ Jesus, which means he must be diligent in obeying God’s commandments and follow them, not man’s teachings. Religion is a great enemy, always working injury to man, without regard to whether man is sincere or otherwise. Religion is entirely out of place in the church of God. The enemy has at all times attempted to corrupt the “church of God”. He has used wicked angels and men. All on God’s side must resist the enemies in order to maintain integrity toward God. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">His people must pray for unity and peace among themselves. They are specifically admonished to pray for prosperity. As the fight grows in intensity they pray: “Save now, I beseech thee, 0 Lord: 0 Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.” (Ps. 118: 25) This means prosperity or advancement of the kingdom. All must be in unity in order to look well to the kingdom interests. His faithful ones must and will avoid all covetousness, ill will and harsh criticism. They will give every one of the saints credit for doing his best and will pray that God’s people or sons may be made to do his will. Thus praying, God’s people can never fight one another, but always fight harmoniously together against God’s enemies and thus maintain integrity toward Him. The fight is on. The victory is certain for God’s Field Marshal. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jehovah has given warning to “Christendom”, not that he expects religionists, who knowingly defy his Word, to reform, but he affords them the opportunity that they may have no excuse. By willfully rejecting his warning message and by willful opposition to the kingdom proclamation, they have demonstrated clearly that they are willingly wicked and justly deserving destruction. Within the religious organizations of “Christendom” are some meek ones of sincere heart and who desire to be taught the right way, and these are given opportunity to hear the truth and seek a place of safety. As the message delivered by Jeremiah shows the only way of safety, so now Jehovah’s message sent through his faithful witnesses shows the only way to protection and safety. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/37</span></p>

Jesus, when knowing he was about to die as an accursed sinner, was joyful because he knew that such suffering would ultimately result in vindication of Jehovah’s name. He knew that so was the will of God; therefore he rested in calm delight that he was permitted to fulfill his Father’s will and that he had assurance that in due time he would vindicate his Father’s name. When Christ Jesus was enthroned and came to the temple, he had reached the point of great joy because the time had come to vindicate his Father’s name. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s great Prophet, Christ Jesus, is uttering this command by authority conferred on him by Almighty God; and it is written that everyone who does not obey this prophet shall be destroyed. (Acts 3:23) Jehovah’s witnesses, therefore, have no alternative. They must obey Jehovah’s commandments, and they delight to obey them. No one person can perform service for another, but each one who is a witness of Jehovah must perform his part. The religionists, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, now vehemently rage against Jehovah’s witnesses and desperately attempt to stop these servants of God from carrying out the commandments' of the Most High.

It does mean that for the great multitude to survive Armageddon and to get life from God through Christ Jesus these must fully comply with God’s terms, which terms are that men shall fully, unreservedly and completely consecrate themselves to God and his faithful service, and acknowledge and serve his King. There is nothing that they may withhold. Nothing that they can give can compensate for the free gift of life and all its attending blessings, because all that men have, to begin with, belongs to the Lord. “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.” They must show their full willingness to become the servants of God and Christ Jesus, and must serve “day and night”, that is, all the time.

His organization is our mother. (Isa. 54: 5, 13) Christ Jesus is the Head of God’s capital organization, and all of the anointed are under him and must be obedient to his commandments. Failure or refusal to obey the commandments of God and turning aside from instructions of his organization show that the persons so doing are greatly wanting in understanding. The Lord’s organization on earth is his and there are no earthly bosses, but all those who are part of his organization on earth are servants of the Lord. The ones who are more diligent and careful to observe the Lord’s instructions and do accordingly are the ones that are most pleasing to him. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/37</span></p>

Religion, which she wrongfully claims is “Christianity”, is used by her to gain political power. She is determined to suppress everyone who dares declare the truth of God’s Word. Jehovah’s witnesses are commissioned to speak the truth; therefore Jehovah’s witnesses constitute a stinging thorn in the flesh of the old “harlot” because they lift high the banner of the Lord, pointing the people to the declaration of Jehovah that his kingdom and King is the hope of the world and there is none other.

The people will refuse to hear, except a few; but the faithful witnesses will continue to say; “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Ye shall certainly drink.” They will not stop to argue with opposers. That is not their business. Their work is to bring the message of the Lord to the people’s attention, that they may have opportunity to give heed thereto. Much and prolonged talk at the door with those of the homes is not obeying God’s commandments. His message must be delivered as the Lord’s message and as he has commanded it, and those who refuse to hear cannot be forced to hear, but, having opportunity to hear, must bear the responsibility.

The fact that the famine did not hurt Joseph and those under him in Egypt shows that this famine for spiritual food in the earth does not exist in God’s organization, and that during the period of famine upon Satan’s organization God does not stop feeding his people, but brings to them meat in due season. The facts show that since 1919 many more have been brought to a knowledge of the truth and been received into the temple and made a part of God’s organization and part of his remnant.

When Armageddon begins that restraint will be removed and “no restraint any more” (A.E.T<sup>7</sup>.) will be upon Jehovah’s witnesses, because the witness work will then be finished. Until then the ‘four angels, to whom is given to hurt the earth and the sea’, continue to hold back the storm of the Lord. (Rev. 7: 1-3) The time comes when the restraint ends, and no more restraint is on the “ten horns” of the beast, which shall turn and rend the Hierarchy organization, and when Jehovah’s great Executioner shall completely wreck every part of Satan’s organization.

That means they are commissioned to perform certain specific duties, among which duties is that they must be witnesses of Jehovah God, having received from him the commission of authority to represent him and speak in his name and deliver his message. The relationship now is that of Father and son and Master and servant. Jehovah is the great Master, and the creature is the servant. Christ Jesus himself is the elect Servant (Isa. 42:1).

<p><span class="font7">Jeremiah’s message by prophetic emblems was delivered to the official representatives of the heathen, the haters and opposers of God. Such heathen representatives were in diplomatic relationship with the Israelites. Jehovah would see to it that his message of warning should reach the masters or rulers of the nations. Likewise the ambassadors of the nations that maintain relationship with “Christendom” and that therefore “come to” “Christendom” shall know of God’s purpose to destroy Satan’s organization. Such notice has already been served upon many of the foreign diplomats, and they are taking notice in practically all nations.

The people of good will come from many parts of the earth, saying to each other: ‘Let us pray before Jehovah, seeking the Lord of hosts’; and they seek him in his organization. The prophet says that “ten men”, all the men of good will who will compose the great multitude, “shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew,” Christ Jesus. Since the skirt hangs down in proximity of the feet, “the Jew” also represents the remnant, the faithful members of Christ’s body.

In doing our duty we cannot compromise with religion, or shun to declare the whole truth, even though that truth may shock others’ religious susceptibilities.

Today “Christendom” assumes to be God’s people and boastfully claims to represent God on earth. Therefore what befell the Israelites foretells what shall befall “Christendom”, it being the counterpart of the former. Citing that as a warning, God says: ‘I will do rm to this house what I have done unto Shiloh.’—Vs. 14. 17 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Take the helmet of salvation.—Eph. 6:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Salvation depends upon one’s understanding and relying upon the Lord and not upon any object or thing. The helmet symbolically represents the head or mind, which must feed .upon God’s Word. Some foolishly conclude they learned the truth years ago and do not need to study God’s Word in these days. Such are almost certain to fail. God reveals his truth in his own due time, as his people need it. He is now unfolding his prophecies, that his people on earth may have greater comfort and strengthened hope. The Bible proves whether we are pursuing the right course. Theories of men are of no value, but, on the contrary, such theories make the Word of God of none effect. God’s people not only must avoid religion, but must fight against it now and proclaim the truth, that others may have an opportunity to learn the truth and flee to the Most High and his King.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Pharaoh king of Egypt.—Jer. 25:17-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The religionists, particularly the priests or other clergymen, have ‘gone down to Egypt for help’, as Isaiah 30: 2 puts it, and have turned their backs upon Jehovah and his King, just as the kings of Jerusalem did in their time. Reliance of religionists or religious practitioners upon “Egypt”, the world, is like leaning upon a bruised reed: “Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.” (Isa. 36: 6) Egypt is dealt with after Jerusalem. This supports the conclusion that when the religious systems fall, then punishment will proceed to the Godless element, the commercial and political elements, their allies and supporters.

<p><span class="font7">In proclaiming the truth controversies should be avoided. The remnant do not seek controversies, but are anxious to do God’s will by bearing testimony to others, that such may avail themselves of the privilege to serve the Lord. The truth should never be used as a club to punish others. Telling the truth, however, necessarily exposes rackets and racketeers. Such exposure is to enable those of good will to learn where to get protection, that they may go in the right way. Testifying to the truth necessarily discloses those against God and his kingdom, and such truth is a punishment to the wicked. But Jehovah’s witnesses must always keep in mind that their duty is to tell the truth as God has commanded, and the result will be according to his will, and therefore right. If this results in chastising the wicked, then it is according to his will. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/37</span></p>

What I say and have said cannot harm anyone. To inflict punishment on me because I give you a friendly warning, as commanded by Almighty God, is taking great responsibility upon yourselves, and you must account to God for your conduct. I am entirely innocent of wrongdoing, and it is my duty to warn you that my punishment by you God will not permit to go unnoticed. You will suffer the consequences at his hand, because no one can successfully oppose the Almighty God.” W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">No doubt there are yet within the religious organizations those persons of good will who are prisoners. (Isa. 49:9) They must be given the opportunity to hear and to hearken unto the Lord. There are those outside of the religious organizations that desire righteousness and hence are of good will toward God. These must have the opportunity to hear the kingdom message and be told that the only way of escape and the only place of safety is by serving the Lord Jesus Christ, the King whom Nebuchadnezzar foreshadowed in the above prophetic picture. The goodness of Jehovah God is manifested toward the people by sending them the message of warning He therefore makes it an imperative obligation upon Jehovah’s witnesses that they must deliver this message. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/37</span></p>

He could know in advance just ho.w many will be in it, but manifestly he withholds that from himself. He causes the people to hear about his gracious provision for them, and without partiality or undue advantage every one is permitted to accept that provision and live or reject it and remain under condemnation and perish. The way to life Jehovah God has opened. That one way is for the people to seek the Greater Joseph, Christ Jesus, and feed upon the food which Jehovah provides for them and to learn the truth, and put themselves completely under the control of the Lord, remain there, and joyfully obey him. God’s provision is open for all countries of the world. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The combination of the League of Nations is made up of religion, politics and commerce, religion being the binding tie and riding on the back of the beast and claiming the right to rule. The old “whore” gains her dominating position in this combine when she ‘returns to her hire and plays the harlot with all the world kingdoms on the face of the earth ’. This is further proof that the combine is the abomination that maketh desolate. (Matt. 24: 15) When the Hierarchy has gained complete temporal power of the earth, that will in her mind fully establish the conclusion that her desire has been fully accomplished, and then she will say: “Peace and safety.” Then Jehovah’s “strange act” will begin. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">God’s remnant are placed in a position of responsibility and honor above all others of earthly creatures, but this honor they do not take to themselves, nor do they boast about how important they are. They are servants of God, and they appreciate their position and delight to occupy that position which God has given them. “No man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.” (Heb. 5: 4) God, through Christ Jesus, has honored them by choosing them and putting them in positions of service in his organization. They hold that position only if they have understanding and continue in wisdom and faithfulness. To them God will give victory through Christ Jesus, provided that they are faithful unto death. Such faithful ones are now honored to have part in God’s “strange work”. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A person once having a measure of the truth and then losing the light and turning to the Devil becomes the worst among the human agencies used by the Devil and that fight against the faithful followers of Jesus Christ. The “evil servant” falls under the power and influence of Satan and the demons and becomes part of the wicked organization and the enemies of the Lord God and his kingdom. Thereafter the Devil uses the “evil servant” to make war upon the Lord’s faithful servants. Before anyone can become a servant of the Lord he must be cleansed by the blood of Christ, and when that person becomes a part of the “evil servant” the demons have control of him and he is entirely unclean, and he is in a far worse state and condition than he ever was before.—Luke 11: 24-26. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Whether the message offends or pleases men is not for us to consider. The message of truth is not the message of any man, but is God’s message, and it is entirely absurd to even think of refraining from doing what the Almighty God has commanded in order to please men or institutions or to ask selfish imperfect men for a permit or a license to do what the Almighty God has commanded shall be done. Jehovah’s witnesses are not to act in a belligerent way. They should do nothing to unnecessarily provoke opposition, but they should with calmness, with sobriety, without fear, and with boldness, declare the message of truth, regardless of what any creature may say or do about it.

<p><span class="font7">God’s law never changes, because God never changes. His law points out the way to everlasting life. No creature will ever be given life everlasting who willfully, intentionally, violates God’s law. If a man chooses another for his god, Jehovah will not grant him life. For a man to violate the fundamental law of God means that that man puts himself on the Devil’s side, who therefore leads him to destruction. For the benefit of man, then, God provided in his law that man should have no other god before Him, because. God alone is the source of life. Religion has been and is the most effective means to induce violation of God’s law, and God would safeguard man from that destructive influence.

The Nethinim separated themselves from the heathen and associated with God’s remnant people returned to Jerusalem. (Neh. 3-1-31) “The Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over the Nethinims.” (11: 3, 21) This definitely shows that non-Israehtes had joint charge over other Nethinim, and that it is Scripturally proper to assign the non-anointed, that is, the Jonadabs or “other sheep”, to places of importance in the service and to assign them over others or companies or divisions, and also to put them in positions as leaders of study classes composed of Jonadabs. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jehovah begins his “strange act” and the lighted candles in the habitation of the Catholic Hierarchy become darkness. With the beginning of the “strange act” the witness work will have been done throughout “Christendom” by Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, who since Jesus’ death have held forth the light of the world, letting their lights shine before men to the praise of Jehovah. The faithful followers of Christ know these things are coming to pass soon, because Jehovah has so declared and he is certain to perform his purpose. To be reassured now strengthens their faith, and their praises are to Jehovah God as they press on in the face of vicious opposition, knowing victory is near.

<p><span class="font7">Why was that admonition given ? That the spirit of the godly seed be not spoiled by mixing with the spirit of the world or heathen. The real seed must have the spirit of entire devotion to Jehovah and his organization. There must be no union with any part of Satan’s organization. To taint or to lose that spirit would cause one to be entirely unfit to be of the real “godly seed”. That is a great calamity to the creature. The mixing with Satan’s organization and imbibing the spirit thereof is treacherous dealing. By his prophet Jehovah therefore says to those who have covenanted to do his will: “Let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth,” that is, against Zion, God’s organization, to which the priestly class are united or joined. And why not? Because “evil communications corrupt good manners”. W</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Those who hear the kingdom truth and then boldly declare themselves on the King’s side and joyfully obey his commandments are the ones who love God and his King and prove it by their actions. The fact that Jehovah has devoted centuries to preparing for his kingdom and the further fact that now he has enthroned his King are proof conclusive that the kingdom is of paramount importance and that in this day God’s people face the greatest responsibility and enjoy the greatest privilege that men have ever had. Everything pales into insignificance when compared with the kingdom of God under Christ. Because of the great importance of the kingdom this is the time when we must get understanding; which means, among other things, that we must have a proper appreciation of our relationship to the King and to his kingdom. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The prophetic truths revealed by the Lord at the temple are a blessing to the faithful servants, but these same truths become a curse to the unfaithful, and thus their “blessings” have been “cursed” even now. The truth was placed before them which would result in their blessing, and by their refusal to give heed thereto the truth operates as a curse. Others, who are not of the “evil servant” class but who are guilty of shortcomings, carelessness and indifference to their duties, need to be warned that God “will curse your blessings” if they do not mend their course and render full devotion to the Lord and show real care and dependability on their part in looking after the kingdom interests committed to their hands. “Good intentions” furnish no excuse for failure.

The Devil himself shall be the last to go into oblivion, after seeing all of his organization destroyed. The king of “Babylon”, who is therefore the chief in the universal organization of wickedness, is Satan himself. “Sheshaeh” is a symbolic name for Babylon. (Jer. 51: 41) It shall fall in the great day of God Almighty. When Satan’s organization begins to tumble, the religionists of “Christendom ’ ’ being first, from then on those who have looked upon the world as perpetual, unbreakable and immovable will be greatly surprised.

The purpose thereof was to bring forth a pure and undefiled people for Jehovah’s name, and for that reason the law of God forbade intermarriage with the heathen. This shows that the people chosen for Jehovah’s name, that is, his witnesses called out for his name, must be separate and apart from the world and must refuse to compromise with worldly organizations or to have anything- in common with any part of the worldly organizations. Faithfulness and dependability is required of those whom Jehovah approves. If one is not dependable, is careless and indifferent, or opposes the united action of Jehovah’s organization in giving witness to the kingdom, such is evidence that he is not of the temple company. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy classes everyone that is opposed to her as “red” or “communist”. This is done to incite the people against those who stand for whatsoever is right. The Hierarchy is particularly opposed to and persecutes Jehovah’s witnesses, because they proclaim the truth of God’s name and kingdom and point to God’s kingdom as the world’s only hope. Jehovah lays upon his witnesses the duty and gives to them the privilege and opportunity to proclaim his name and kingdom in the earth. Thus they have a part in his “strange work”. When that work is done, then begins his “strange act”, which is the battle of the great day of God Almighty. During the period of his strange work the great multitude , must take their stand on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom and prove their faithful obedience and maintain their integrity toward God.

In this provision the people of good will have opportunity to assist in whatever manner they can. If any of these had part in mistreating God’s children in 1918 and prior thereto, and later with grief and sincerity confessed their wrongdoing, that would show them as out of harmony with Satan and his organization and his agents and would prove their heart condition toward the Lord himself. Those of the “sheep” class are thus manifesting themselves.

Religious leaders, and particularly the “evil servant” class, constitute the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition”. All of those wicked ones fight against God and against his servants.

A small number of the common people hear, understand and appreciate this message as from the Lord, and give heed thereto; but the far greater number of the people think that this work in which Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged is a ‘very strange work’, and so they dismiss it.

(Prov. 6:20; Matt. 24' 48-51) Dealing treacherously with God’s organization destroys the spirit of the Lord in one and makes him the Devil’s servant.

<p><span class="font7">The girdle around the loins symbolically says: “I am a servant of the Almighty God and Christ Jesus, and my girdle of servitude is that of the truth.” In the breast is situate the heart, and the breastplate of righteousness means the proper keeping or shielding of the heart. Therefore the admonition is, “Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.” (Prov. 4: 23) Those who stand firm now must see to it that they are unselfish, that their motive is pure toward God and toward man; otherwise they cannot stand. God’s warriors, his witnesses now on the earth, must be on their feet and on the march; therefore the admonition: “And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.” (Vs. 15) Peace must now be the condition among God’s people.

<p><span class="font7">The Devil is the god of this wicked world and rules and claims the right to rule all the kingdoms of the earth, and which the Lord will destroy; and therefore all such must drink of the “cup”. The Devil offered to turn over to Jesus all these kingdoms, upon condition that Jesus worship him. Jesus rebuffed that wicked one, because in the heart of Jesus has always been the law of God and the will of his Father he always does. He could not and would not take possession of the world until Jehovah’s due time. Now at the present time Christ Jesus has been placed upon the throne of full authority, and he must and will destroy all rule in all the nations under Satan, because they are against God and his kingdom. Armageddon will not omit any nation or government on earth. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">What causes one who starts on the way of serving God to later fall away? Lucifer was the first of that class. It is written (Jer. 51:13) that covetousness was the cause of his rebellion and downfall. All who follow after him get into the same wicked condition. God directed that those who should be the rulers of men, holding prominent places among the Israelites, should be “such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness”. (Bx. 18:21) One who fears God will not covet that which God has committed to another, because he will not presumptuously attempt to get what has not been assigned to him, knowing that God hates such. “He that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.” (Prov. 28: 16) It is the covetous persons that the Devil seizes upon and employs as his visible instruments to make war on God’s remnant. (Rev. 12:17) Covetousness is the worst type of selfishness. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1 /37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The antitypical “sons of Levi”, all those consecrated and wholly devoted to God, are promised the peace of God, glory, honor, immortality and life everlasting. (Rom. 2:6, 7) Jehovah gave the tribe of Levi the service of his holy tabernacle as priests and Levites, and this he did “for the fear wherewith he feared me”. The Levites feared God, as shown at Mount Sinai, when they took their stand on Jehovah’s side and then acted as executioners of those who had turned to Devil worship. Later Phinehas showed a like fear by zealously serving Jehovah as executioner of the unfaithful. This foreshadows the antitypical Levites acting fearlessly and boldly in declaring God’s judgments upon those who become unfaithful It shows the obligation laid upon them to so declare God’s judgments. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W1/1/37</span></p>

And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day . . . upon the ground.—Jer. 25: 32, 33. </span><span class="font7">That terrible storm comes from beyond the utmost parts of Satan’s organization on earth. Therefore it is not Satan’s judgment, but is raised up and comes from Jehovah God, by his Executive Officer, Christ Jesus. It is God’s storm, which wrecks Satan’s organization completely. Jehovah has recorded in His Word prayers suitable for his servants to utter, for the manifest purpose of showing what is his will and purpose concerning the enemy, and the proper course for his servants to take. The prayer of the psalmist shows Jehovah’s purpose: “So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. ... let them be put to shame, and perish: that men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Most High over all the earth.”—Ps. 83: 15-18.

<p><span class="font7">Tins cannot be properly construed as meaning that the servant of the Lord cannot speak the kingdom message in the street. God’s people are not permitted to attract attention to themselves to advertise themselves, as do Satan’s agents. The work of God’s servant is to be done with modesty and consistently, and always for the purpose of attracting attention to Jehovah and his kingdom, and never for attracting attention to creatures. Jehovah’s witnesses must advertise the King and the kingdom and not individuals. This is the very thing they do by giving proclamation to the kingdom message by means of sound equipment, thus calling attention of people to the great Jehovah God and his King and telling them how they may learn the only way to life and happiness. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The faithful remnant, who are Jehovah’s witnesses, are rejoicing in their suffering that they are counted worthy to be servants of Jehovah and are counted as the heavenly class. Together with them the “other sheep”, the earthly class, also rejoice. The heavenly class and the earthly class are rejoicing together. It is that class who today declare themselves for God and his kingdom that suffer affliction at the hand of Satan and his agents. But Jehovah loves them and shows his mercy toward them. While the enemy Satan brings upon the nations woe after woe, God comforts his people with knowledge of the fact that he has them in mind, and that those enduring affliction for righteousness’ sake and for his name’s sake shall receive his everlasting favor. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In fulfillment of this prophecy the lesser and dependent parts of the Catholic organization, whether far from the mother organization or near thereto, would have reason to howl and lament over the destruction of the Catholic Hierarchy, the modern Tyre. The Hierarchy is not at all joyous in Jehovah, although hypocritically and falsely claiming to represent God. It is joyous in its own merchandise and profits in the gay markets dealing in humankind. To the smaller ones of the Catholic organization the prophet, in substance, says: ‘Have you anything to exult in now, seeing that modern Tyre, the Hierarchy, and its allies and dupes are in a wrecked and spoiled condition?

<p><span class="font7">The unwitting manslayer who fled to the city of refuge must first be given aid freely, but his conditioned protection depended upon closely abiding in the city and being obedient to its rules and engaged in some activity there so as not to be a burden upon the city’s other inhabitants. The apostle announced the same rule (2 Thess. 3: 8-12): All must work, otherwise they should not eat. The manslayer contributed to the good of the city. He must stick close within the city bounds, that is, God’s organization, until the high priest’s death, meaning the completion of the priestly work of the church before their resurrection change. One thus fleeing to the city of refuge was not an official member of it, but received protection, aid and comfort from the city while complying with its rules.

King Saul died the enemy of God because he had feared man and had become unfaithful to God and had fallen away entirely to the Devil. Witchcraft has been practiced from the time of Saul to the present day. Covenant-breakers of this day are exactly in a condition similar to Saul’s. Witches are those creatures who yield themselves as instruments for use by the Devil and his angels and permit themselves to be employed as mediums for communication between wicked spirits and men on earth. Witchcraft is of the Devil and is the fruit of rebellion. Satan the rebel invented witchcraft, and he and his wicked spiritual allies employ and practice it to deceive human creatures.

<p><span class="font7">Satan and his wicked associates, that joined him in the rebellion originally, constitute the powers, principalities and invisible rulers of this wicked world which operate in darkness as man’s enemies. Those in the organization of Almighty God war upon that devilish rule and power, and therefore must tell the truth concerning religion, which makes war upon it because religion is the chief instrument by which people are deceived. In that warfare, however, God’s faithful servants do not use weapons to injure any human creatures in their bodies. The weapons of their warfare are just one. That one is the “sword of the spirit, which is the word of God”. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">That was not a threat, but a friendly warning. He was not abashed because he was in the presence of high officials, nor did he act arrogantly or unreasonably. It was but fair for him to tell the court that the responsibility for final judgment upon him rested with them. To punish Jeremiah would be fighting against God, and the members of the court must be responsible to God for their acts. The mere killing of Jeremiah would not end the matter. He left no doubt as to whom he would obey, and told the court that if he were put to death they would bring innocent blood upon themselves, the city and the inhabitants thereof.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">As ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.—Matt. 25:40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The sheep class publicly manifest their support of God’s remnant, and thus they take their stand on the side of God and his kingdom, joining the remnant and becoming their companions in service. They hear the approval of the Lord Jesus to them in these words: “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” Thus the Lord shows that the class or company first appearing in his purpose is brought forth last in the execution of his purposes; supporting the words of Jesus that ‘the first shall be last and the last first’. (19:30) The Lord here definitely identifies these people of good will as his “other sheep”, who become the companions of the sheep first selected, and thus all act together as companions in the service of Jehovah, his King and his kingdom.

<p><span class="font7">All the cruel, Godless and vicious efforts to suppress the message of the Lord cannot succeed in stopping it, nor can these nations of “Christendom” and her “great men” escape drinking the cup, because Jehovah says: ‘They shall drink, be moved, and go mad.’ They are very mad now. Jehovah says they shall drink ‘because of the sword that I will send among them’. This shows that the “wine of this fury” is equivalent to (1) the “sword of the spirit, which is the Word of God”, expressing the furious message of Jehovah; and (2) the destructive sword of execution wielded by Christ Jesus at the battle of Armageddon. The ‘wine in the cup’ and the “sword” both picture what is God’s will before and at Armageddon. His will shall be accomplished.

The honor of wrecking the systems or religious organizations is given to Christ Jesus. The work now being done by Christ’s faithful followers in declaring the judgments of Jehovah against “Christendom” is very exasperating and humiliating to religionists; but there is far more to follow, not of work by the witnesses, but destructive work by Christ Jesus. When the uncovering of religious frauds is completed and the witness work done, then will follow the execution of Jehovah’s judgment, “his act, his strange act.” W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">10/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Scriptures lay down the unchangeable rule that everyone made a member of the church of God faithfully follows in Jesus’ footsteps, and therefore must do as Jesus does. “For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” (1 Pet. 2: 21) Jesus says: “Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.” (John 18: 37) All such must obey his commandments or else suffer destruction. (Acts 3: 23) To lay claim to the high office of representative on earth of Jesus Christ, and then to take the course exactly opposite to what Jesus took, is wholly inconsistent and shows that the claims of the Catholic organization are false. Jesus and his apostles went about “from house to house” preaching to the people. All true followers of Christ have ever pursued the same coui’se. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/37</span></p>

(Acts 14: 22) The apostle exclaimed therefore: “We glory in tribulation.” Knowing that tribulation and suffering is a condition precedent to entering into the kingdom he further said: “Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church.” The true and faithful will not now confuse so-called “happiness” with the “joy of the Lord”. When one knows and appreciates he is suffering indignities and punishment at enemy hands because the witness of the Lord is faithfully and truly guarding, protecting and advancing the kingdom interests, that gives him real joy, an inherent delight in doing God’s will that he may have God’s approval and thereby a part in proving Satan a liar and Jehovah always right. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W12/15/37</span></p>

The witnesses of Jehovah do not go about pleading with others to come and join some organization. They do not plead with and importune the people to do anything. With calm dignity and with fearlessness they declare unto the people the message of Jehovah God and point out, to those who desire to have life, that God has provided the way of safety and life through Christ Jesus and his kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses make clear to the people that the message is not that of any man, but is God’s message, given as a witness to the nations and to the people, and that when this message is delivered, as commanded, the witnesses have discharged their responsibility; thereafter the responsibility rests on those who heard.

To the unfaithful ones, the “evil servant”, Jehovah says: “Where is my fear? saith the Lord of hosts unto you, 0 priests, that despise my name.” (1: 6) The commandment or charge to the antitypical priests needed to be heeded and applied unto the cleansing of God’s sanctuary and thereafter. The test upon the “sons of Levi” began with the beginning of judgment in 1918. The motive or heart condition of such there began to be tested. It was the time for those who had made a covenant to do God’s will to cease giving honor to men and to cease raising their oto “lightning rods”, inviting others to give honor to them.

Those of the “evil servant” do not fear God; otherwise they would not assault those whom they know God has given a place in his service. One who fears the Lord fears to disobey his commandments, but that person does not fear any creature nor any of the Devil’s crowd. Everything against God and his kingdom we should avoid, and what God hates we should hate, because it is against God and his kingdom. Any person who attempts to cause division in the ranks of God’s organization, whether he claims to be in the truth or not, because he is a disturber he should be avoided.

<p><span class="font7">This strongly says that those Jehovah selects for his service should see to it that they are men of discernment, activity and ability, and that they should be the most efficient in what work is assigned to them, and should do it carefully and earnestly, as unto the Lord himself. This has been a truth hard for many to learn properly. Those of the great multitude prove themselves “men of activity” and ability, faithful and dependable in the King’s service, and thus before the throne they “serve him day and night in his temple”.

<p><span class="font7">Making an image and bowing down to that is attributing to that image, or what it represents, protection and salvation, and such is an insult to Jehovah. Salvation of man is possible only by the means which Jehovah has provided through Christ Jesus, and there is no other way. In the face of the plain commandments of God the religionists make images and bow down before them. They hang up a flag and command that men shall salute that, and thus attribute salvation to what it represents. One who has covenanted to do God’s will must obey God’s law. To disobey it means an insult to Jehovah and a loss by the creature of everything. Each one for himself must determine whether he will obey God and remain true to him or will compromise by obeying Satan’s organization. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all the inhabitants of the earth.—Jer. 25:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah thus manifests himself as being on the side of his faithful people, the temple company, wherein he resides and rests by his spirit. His roar shall be against his enemies, and not against his own people, but shall be through them. That will be the time of his triumph, and “he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes”, a shout of joy and vindication. Grapetreaders make wine, which is of good cheer. But, on the occasion of treading, Jehovah by Christ Jesus treads out the blood of Satan’s “vine of the earth”. Such is the time of destruction to the enemy, and the time of vindication and joy to the Lord. The treading begins at “Christendom”, but does not stop until it embraces or takes in all the enemy, in “the great winepress of the wrath of God”. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1/37</span></p>

There is no other means of getting life. Thus God shows to those who seek him the abundant provision he has made for them. Seeing this, the faithful remnant must appreciate not only their privilege but their great obligation to lift up a standard for the people and point them to the granaries and barns of Jehovah, which are packed full of an endless supply of spiritual food. The famine is now upon Satan’s government of this world; it will continue with ever-increasing soreness, ending in the battle of the great day of God Almighty.

Religion, which originated'with the Devil, makes fanatics of men. Strict obedience to God’s commandments keeps men sane. Religionists often become insane. Do not Christ’s faithful followers on earth engage in conflict with human creatures who are religionists? No. The apostle’s words at Ephesians 6: 12 show that this is not their conflict. Human creatures are employed as instruments of the Devil and the wicked angels, and used by them to war against Christ’s followers. Many of these visible ones do so ignorantly.

The great multitude therefore are witnesses for Jehovah, but they do not bear the official name, for the reason that they are not of the anointed house of Jehovah.

Now the remnant, as faithful antitypieal sons of Levi whom the great Refiner at the temple has purified, turn others in the right way by proclaiming the plain truths of God’s Word in their presence and hearing, and thus they show those who will form the “great multitude” how they may escape God’s wrath and find refuge in his organization and under his protection.

The clergy also “rob God”. Because Jehovah is “slow to anger” and affords the wicked full opportunity to carry forward his wickedness, many become very bold and convince themselves that they can with impunity continue in their wrongful course. For many years Jehovah has permitted Satan to carry on his wicked work, and probably Satan has for centuries considered himself immune to punishment. His servants are in a like condition.

The only weapon God’s faithful representatives on earth are commanded to use, and must use, is “the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God”. How can one properly use that weapon unless he familiarizes himself first with the weapon ? He must study God’s Word, then be diligent to obey what it says.

The great multitude do not now find rest in Satan’s organization, which rules the earth. They are not to be contented with the present wicked rule. They must advocate God’s kingdom and be diligent in doing so, and by doing so they ‘lay up for themselves treasures in heaven’, and are not to think that treasures of earthly things now acquired and held will be preserved in Armageddon. It is quite probable that the enemy may strip them of everything earthly just before Armageddon.

Even today there are those who think that they are following Christ Jesus and who are “ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth”. (2 Tim. 3:7) Those who truly love the Lord will appreciate and do appreciate the unfolding of prophecy and will see their duty and will joyfully undertake the performance thereof.

Will not the circulation of wicked reports against God’s organization and his servants shake some of the Lord’s people ? If they can be shaken, yes; but those who really love God cannot be shaken.

Out of the many who have covenanted to be God’s people as followers of Christ Jesus there has come only a remnant, and it is made manifest with the beginning of the temple judgment. What was God’s purpose in making of Israel only “one” nation without adulteration or heathen mixture?

Before Joseph revealed himself to the ten half brothers they had to show and did show their desire to do good unto Benjamin. This foretold that Jehovah would first prove the people of good will and cause them to show that they had gotten rid of the religious spirit of the world, that of persecution of Christ’s followers, and this they must do before he reveals to them the way to life. Facts now well known show that the Jonadab class have first shown kind consideration for Jehovah’s witnesses and then later the Lord revealed himself to them and made known his provisions for them and pointed them to the way to life everlasting.

The survivors will be few, compared with the number slain, and they shall not defile themselves by providing a burial for the wicked. Jehovah’s express will is that the Devil’s crowd shall be further and completely reproached by not having decent and honorable burial. The dead bodies shall be left exposed to putrefaction and be devoured by carrion birds and beasts in retaliation for mankind’s terrible violation of the “everlasting covenant”, which forbids willful slaughter of animals for selfish gain or pleasure.

<p><span class="font7">This applies to the unfaithful priestly class of spiritual Israel, who suffer for want of spiritual nourishment and sustenance. Because of their selfishness they cannot receive and feed upon the blessings of truth that the Lord provides as spiritual food for his own. The unfaithful take offense at the same and, having no sustaining spiritual food, they die spiritually. The judgment of God would bring upon them a disgraceful death and dishonorable burial. The one assigned to drag refuse out of the temple must take it through the dung gate and dump it into the incinerator of Gehenna, thus foretelling the fate of the “evil servant” class.

Thus the Lord has made the work of the “faithful servant” class, whom Joseph pictured, to prosper. He has committed into their hands all his goods. They pray for prosperity and receive it, as God had promised. (Ps. 118:25) Joseph maintained his integrity toward God. The remnant, the members of the body of Christ, who continue faithful, will maintain their integrity towards Jehovah, and, doing so, they are certain to have a part in the vindication of his holy name.

Instead of being disturbed in mind and permitting ourselves to become incensed at others, we must keep in mind the admonition to God’s people: “Let us watch and be sober. But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love.” (1 Thess. 5:6,8) Knowing we are surrounded everywhere by enemies, and therefore all in great danger, God’s devoted people should trust him implicitly and obey his commandments.

His “other sheep”, or great multitude, hear the testimony of Jehovah’s witnesses, and they join in the service and say: 'Come, all you of good will who love God and his King; come and receive the blessings of life everlasting upon the earth. ’ This shows their companionship in service. It is only the class pictured by John, namely, the spiritual remnant in the temple, that see the groat multitude (Rev. 7:9), and those who do not see are certainly not of the temple.

Here he tells Jeremiah to notify the people that it is the command of Jehovah of hosts that the nations drink and be drunken and fall, never to rise again. God now commands that the rulers and their supporters be told that fatal drunkenness is their lot, and soon they will find themselves in that drunken condition, from which they will not revive.

They love God, and hence they fear him and not man. They discern that this is the day of the Lord’s judgment and that all nations are gathered before him. They have received and appreciated the commandments of the Lord to go forth and give warning to the peoples of “Christendom” before the beginning of God’s “strange act”, and it is their love for God that moves them into action. In going forth to serve they are not arrogant, but they are bold, that is, fearless.

At all times Jesus stressed the magnitude and supreme importance of the kingdom. He proclaimed the truth, and declared that all who are of the truth must and will do likewise. (John 18:37) That is the criterion by which every man may determine whether he is of the truth or not. If he is not with enthusiasm supporting the cause of Jesus Christ and following in his footsteps, he is not of the truth. Jesus died for the kingdom in obedience to his Father’s will.

That is not the course to be taken by the Christian. The true Christian would not do bodily injury to any man.

While the faithful followers of Christ now on earth continue to suffer from increasing indignities and cruel assaults upon them by religious representatives of the Devil, Jehovah graciously unfolds to his faithful witnesses the meaning of his prophecies, showing that long ago he had his faithful ones in mind.

Jehovah has no alliance with wrongdoers, and does not approve any who do ally themselves with wrongdoers. (Ps. 94:20) The ungodly organization that legislates laws, and causes them to be enforced, which bring reproach upon God’s name and punish his witnesses for telling the truth, is thus framing mischief by legislation, and God declares that his true children can have no partnership with that gang. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/37</span></p>

Prophecy in fulfillment and being understood proves to be their spiritual nourishing and profitable to those who love God. When the people of good will see these things, then no longer are the old “harlot” and her allies able to keep those who love and serve Jehovah from eating and filling sufficiently. When they hear and act upon the truth, they immediately wash up; they ‘wash their robes and make them white in the blood of the Lamb ’. Thus they identify themselves as servants of Jehovah God.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath, the daughter</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of Potipherah, priest of On. — Gen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The name Pharaoh gave to Joseph means &quot;savior of the world” or &quot;food of the living”. Likewise, all power in heaven and earth was given to Christ Jesus, the Greater Joseph. He is made a &quot;higher power” with Jehovah, and to whom every soul must render full obedience or else suffer destruction; and this particularly applies to the remnant. He is ‘the Savior of the world’ and “the bread of life”. Jehovah selects for Christ Jesus a bride and sends him to the temple fully authorized and empowered to gather unto himself and take his bride. The remnant of this bridal company is yet on earth, the resurrection of those that died faithful having proceeded them. All of these, like Joseph’s wife, are of priestly connection, being God’s &quot;royal priesthood”.-l Pet. 2: 9,10. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/81</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.—Mal. 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The remnant o'f Jehovah’s witnesses must keep their lips continually, and at all times must be ready to speak when opportunity offers and tell the truth concerning God and his kingdom. They must speak boldly the truth of God’s Word and against the perversion thereof. This they accomplish by spreading the knowledge of the truth abroad in printed form; which they are now doing. The priestly class must obey God’s law and must make it known to others who will hear, because Jehovah sends them forth-as his messengers to declare his Word and his name. Christ Jesus is the great Messenger of Jehovah, who prepared the way before him and straightway appeared at the temple. For this reason he spoke of Jehovah as &quot;Him that sent me”. Christ Jesus at the temple now sends forth the remnant. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/87</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">is a Jew, saying, We will go with you; for we have heard that God is with you.—Zech. 8:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They lay hold of the Lord and declare their heart devotion is to God and Christ Jesus. They are not ashamed to publicly declare themselves on the side of Christ and Jehovah. They delight to be associated with the remnant in bearing testimony to Jehovah’s name and kingdom and in bearing the reproaches that fall on all who show zeal and devotion to God. The remnant take the lead; the Jonadabs or great multitude, pictured by “ten men”, joyfully join them and follow in the right way. They bring their offerings for the service, that is, they give all their praise and devotion, and give their time and energy and money to further the cause of the kingdom to the praise of Jehovah and his King. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Publicly, and from house to house, . . . I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.—Acts 20:-20,27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Christ Jesus suffered for telling the truth. The apostles, especially Paul, suffered great indignities. Why should Jehovah’s witnesses expect to obey the Lord in this day without being subjected to like unrighteous persecution? The duty of Jehovah’s witnesses is to obey him. He will take care of the result. Religionists will continue to persecute the Lord’s witnesses. But when his “strange work” is done, then he will execute his “strange act”, and that will be the end of religionists. Jehovah’s witnesses are therefore privileged to choose to avoid suffering now and be destroyed by Jehovah, or to be faithful to God at this time, suffer persecution at enemy hands, and receive God’s everlasting blessing. ‘The fear of man leadeth into a snare.’ W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/37</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">We do not war after the flesh: (for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds').—2 Cor. 10: 3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the Word of God, the sword of the spirit, which is now being wielded with telling effect against the stronghold of the Roman Catholic organization. That stronghold is entrenched lies behind which the workers of iniquity hide. It is God’s Word that sweeps away that hiding place of lies and opens the doorway for honest persons to see how they may take their stand on God’s side and find a place of sure habitation. The purpose of Jehovah’s witnesses’ having part in this fight is to declare his name and purpose, that the people may be warned. For this reason the witnesses engage in this warfare with real joy, because their work, if faithfully done, results in good to those who love righteousness and results to the honor and vindication of Jehovah’s name.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. . . . And the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.—Gen. 44:2,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Like the cup in Benjamin’s sack, put there at Joseph’s direction in order that a test might be placed upon his brethren, so the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses as lawbreakers has been permitted to come upon them as a test upon the witnesses and upon all those of good will, Jonadabs. It is the cup which Jehovah has poured for his witnesses, that they might be charged with crime and appear as lawbreakers and dangerous to the ruling powers of the world, that this test might be put upon men. This furnishes opportunity to prove their integrity toward Him. These experiences have served as a real test to the Jonadabs, and they have shown their willingness to be the companions of Jehovah’s witnesses, who have been branded as criminals.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">But ye answered not; therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.—Jer. 7:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By his manner of dealing with the unfaithful people at Jerusalem Jehovah makes known his fixed rule that covenant-breakers shall certainly suffer punishment at his hands. All the wicked works mentioned by the Lord at the mouth of his prophet, and, furthermore, the wicked works of the Israelites done up to the time that Shiloh fell, have been done and are now being done by the practitioners of so-called “Christian” religion and by the people, and particularly the clergy, who use the name of Jehovah and his King for selfish and wrongful purposes. It is certain therefore that what befell Shiloh is but a sample of what shall befall “Christendom” in the very near future. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">They will deliver you up to the councils, . . . when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak; for it shall be given you.—Matt. 10:17,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No doubt Jehovah is permitting the present conditions to exist in order that the truth may be brought to the attention of courts as well as the people. Therefore Jehovah’s witnesses should always bring before the court the fact that the work they are carrying on by going from house to house to preach the gospel is the sounding of a warning and is being done in obedience to God’s commandment, and that everyone must decide for himself whether he will obey man or will obey Almighty God. To attempt to silence the witnesses of Jehovah will not alleviate in the slightest the suffering that is coming upon humanity, but, on the contrary, puts those who do hinder in a position where they are certain to suffer destruction unless they repent.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Flight shall perish from the shepherds, and escaping from the principal of the flock.—Jer. 25:35,</span><span class="font7"> margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “principal of the flock” will find no way of escape. Religious practitioners, who have embraced so-called “Christian” religion for personal gain, and who have used the same and their positions in the organization to oppress the people, will be caught in the same dragnet that will destroy the clergy. After the destruction of the clergy, the “shepherds”, then the Godless “principal of the flock” will continue to fight against all on the side of Jehovah, and therefore they shall receive due recompense from the Lord. Their end is destruction. Jeremiah 50:29 says: “Let none thereof escape.” All the “goat” class, whether of the clergy or small practitioners in their flocks, shall suffer complete destruction according to the Lord’s decree. That decree is written and is certain to be executed. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/31</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.—Prov. 13:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Evil companionships corrupt good morals” (A.E.V.); “vicious intercourse corrupts virtuous habits” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Diag.').</span><span class="font7"> (1 Cor. 15: 33) Fools are those who say by their course of conduct, “There is no God”; and to go along with them leads to disaster. There are but two organizations: the one righteous, which is God’s, and the other wicked, which is Satan’s. One who has been joined to God’s organization, and who then forsakes that organization, automatically joins Satan’s organization. No one can serve both God and Satan. Since the religionists and the “evil servant” class do not serve God, although operating in the name of God and Christ, it clearly appears that they are of the Devil ’s organization. There can be no middle ground. One is either for God or against him. W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/31</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">For this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. — John 18:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah God sent him to earth as his special representative, and the message which he delivered was the message from Almighty God. The Devil, the deceiver and murderer, for centuries had slandered the name of Jehovah God, mocked him and defied him and challenged him to put on earth any man who would remain true to God when the Devil put him to the test. After giving the Devil four thousand years to carry on unhindered his wicked work Jehovah sent his beloved Son Jesus to earth to prove the Devil a liar and to be the vindicator of Jehovah’s name. In carrying out God’s will it was of first importance that Jesus proclaim the truth. Every person refusing to hear the message of Jesus is not of the truth, but is under the Devil’s control. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It has always been and always will be that men must work. (2 Thess. 3:10) If a man would not work, neither should he eat. The idler is an abomination in God’s sight and is classed as a waster. (Prov. 19:15; 31: 27) In behalf of the great multitude and their future life, the Lord provides that they must not be idle, but must serve him continually. “Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify God.” (1 Cor. 6:19,20) The requirement of the great multitude is just, reasonable, and “not grievous”.

God’s announced purpose is to wipe out the enemy soon; but before doing so the warning must be sounded even that the enemy may hear and that people of good will may be informed as to their only means of protection. God has co</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font7">anded that this work of proclaiming the truth must be done. He has assigned that task to the remnant and their companions. It is the battle of Jehovah, and those who love God and who are now on earth will take great delight in engaging in this battle by declaring the truth. Their part is to sing Jehovah’s praises and make known his name and kingdom. All the remnant and people of good will toward God will now prove their love for God by boldly and fearlessly obeying his commandments in proclaiming his message of truth.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. — Eph. 6:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To have faith, one must fully believe in and trust Jehovah God and his Word and follow and obey God’s commandments, as Jesus does. To have faith, one must have a knowledge of God’s Word, and an understanding mind, and then confidently rely upon his Word and refuse to be disturbed or turned aside by any teaching or theory of man. Having engaged in the fight under the command of the Lord, these must remain true, firm, and faithful unto death. The faithful know that, regardless of what the enemy may do against them, no harm can come to those who abide in the Lord and remain faithfully and joyfully in his service to the last. Against such the darts of the wicked are harmless, because they cannot pierce the breastplate of righteousness, that is, a pure and unselfish heart.

<p><span class="font7">Quite fittingly the prophecy against Sheshach is the last part of Jeremiah’s prophecy against all of the worldly organization. The last part of the battle of Armageddon will be the destruction of Satan’s angelic host under Gog. It will be great punishment to the Devil to stand by and see all his power taken away from him by the Lord Jesus Christ. Then in complete disgrace Satan himself will be taken away by the Lord Jesus Christ and completely shorn of all power and cast into the bottomless pit. (Rev. 20: 2, 3) Thus the Lord shows the beginning and the ending of the battle of God Almighty, which ends in complete victory at the hands of the King of kings, Christ Jesus, and to the honor and vindication of Jehovah’s name. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/37</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Those who really love God and trust him implicitly will not be even disturbed by what He reveals to them as shortly to fall upon the nations, nor will they be deterred in performance of assigned duty. The faithful will continue to feed upon “the meat in due season’’ which he provides for them. They will diligently and prayerfully study what God makes known to them. They will dwell together in peace with and show love for one another by watching for one another’s interest and endeavoring to render help to their brethren, including Jonadabs; not financial help, but help that enables one to stand firmly, to get an understanding and appreciation of God’s provision for those that love him, and to diligently engage in his service.

<p><span class="font7">Jeremiah was informed that he would have to fight. Today, Jehovah’s witnesses know they must fight, and therefore God has commanded them, saying: “Arise . . . against her in battle.” (Obad. 1) At the same time Jehovah gives assurance to his faithful ones that they shall not be overwhelmed by the enemy, because they are led by Christ Jesus, the victorious Warrior, and are fully backed up by the Most High. Let the Catholic Hierarchy and their cohorts and religious supporters do what they will in opposition to Jehovah’s work now being performed by his faithful servants. In due time God will see to it that the enemy shall suffer complete defeat. Therefore he says to his servants: “Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.” W </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/37</span></p><img src="yb1938_E_files/yb1938_E-4.png" alt="" style="width:142pt;height:43pt;">

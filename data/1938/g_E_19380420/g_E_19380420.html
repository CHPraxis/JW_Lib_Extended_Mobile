<p><span class="font1">The Supreme Court Speaks</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">«TT </span><span class="font8">IS our duty to enforce the ordinance,'’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font8">This lias been the holy claim of police officials and the judges while engaged in process of jailing Jehovah’s witnesses. Occasionally the ordinance would prove defective, or not applicable to their nefarious purposes, but promptly a new one would be enacted specially designed to prohibit and censor the spread of the truth. Thus the ‘<sup>1</sup> sacred obligation” of enforcing and upholding the ordinance could continue, and the official platter would look clean on the outside, regardless of its putridity within.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On January 28, 1936, the city of Griffin, Georgia, incubated and hatched an ordinance specifically designed to hamstring, censor and prohibit the preaching of the gospel at the homes of the people. It provided that no literature of any kind could be distributed in the city without written permission from the City Manager, -This, it was imagined, would completely prevent Christians from carrying the life-giving message of truth to the people. On March 28, 1938, just two years and two months from its birth, this ordinance so conceived in malice and shapen .in lawlessness received its death sentence from the highest court of the land. Along with it a large number of kindred gag laws maliciously designed for the same evil purpose will die and be consigned to the limbo of bad laws unwept, unhonored and unsung.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Can’t Muzzle Christians</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses challenged the ordinance. They declined to submit their Godgiven mission to the whim, notion and fancy of a city manager. Continuing their work of visiting the people many of the witnesses were assaulted, arrested, jailed and brutally treated, They fought the battle through the courts. The Recorder’s Court, the Superior Court, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">APRIL 20, 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Georgia, all agreed that the ordinance was good law and should be upheld. Finally a test ease, that of Alma Lovell us. The City of Griffin, was docketed in the United States Supreme Court. It-was argued on February 4, 1938, and on March 28 the Court rendered its decision reversing the decision of the Georgia court and declaring the Griffin ordinance invalid on its face as an infringement of freedom of the press. “Whatever the motive which induced its adoption, its character is such that it strikes at the very foundation of the freedom of the press by subjecting it to license and censorship,” is the characterization given to the unholy legislation, by Chief Justice Hughes in the opinion of the Court. Other salient portions of the opinion follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The ordinance in its broad sweep prohibits the distribution of 'circulars, handbooks, advertising, or literature of any kind<sup>1</sup>. . . ■ The ordinance is not limited to ‘literature’ that Is obscene or offensive to public morals or that advocates unlawful conduct. There is no suggestion that the pamphlet and the magazine distributed in the instant case were of that character. The ordinance embraces ‘literature’ in the widest sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The ordinance is comprehensive with respect to the method of distribution. It covers every sort of circulation ‘either by hand or otherwise’. There is thus no restriction in its application with respect to time or place. It is not limited to ways which might be regarded as inconsistent with the maintenance of public order, or as involving disorderly conduct, the molestation of the inhabitants, or the misuse or littering of the streets. The ordinance prohibits the distribution of literature of any kind at any time, at any place, and in any manner without a permit from the City Manager.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“We think that the ordinance is invalid on its face. Whatever the motive which induced its adoption, its character is such that it strikes at the very foundation of the freedom of the press by subjecting it to license and censorship. . . . Legislation of the type of the ordinance in question would restore the system of Ecense and censorship in its baldest form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;The liberty of the press is not confined to newspapers and periodicals. It necessarily embraces pamphlets and leaflets. These indeed have been historic weapons in the defense of liberty, as the pamphlets of Thomas Paine and others in our own history abundantly attest. The press in its historic connotation comprehends every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;The ordinance cannot be saved because it relates to distribution and not to publication. ‘Liberty of circulating is as essential to that freedom as liberty of publishing; indeed, without the circulation, the publication would be of little value’. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Applying the terms of this opinion to the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font8">deduces the following: Visiting the people and leaving with them literature concerning Bible teachings comes within that fundamental right termed “liberty of the press’’. Liberty of the press goes beyond the publishing of informative matter and opinion and includes the circulation thereof. No municipality has the right to exact a license to engage in such work. It cannot be prohibited by law. Liberty of the press means the right to publish and circulate printed matter without any previous restraints thereon. The Griffin ordinance is invalid because it imposes a license requirement for distribution of literature in the city. Hundreds of other ordinances enacted in similar form to restrict freedom of the press are not worth the price of a good breeze to blow them to Gehenna. In plain, everyday language the Court states that Christians have the right to freely distribute Biblical literature unhampered by legislative restrictions. A void ordinance is no ordinance, and therefore thousands of Christians in the darkened areas of these United States have been unlawfully arrested and imprisoned. Instead of Jehovah’s witnesses’ being disorderly, the police, prosecutors and judges are the ones guilty of breaking the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">No Interest in Freedom of Worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In presenting the case to the Court it was contended in behalf of the appellant (Alma Lovell) that the ordinance unduly restricted and denied freedom of worship. The Georgia court ruled that;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'' “A man’s religious belief Cannot be accepted as </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">justification for an overt act made criminal by the laws of the city.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Attorneys for the appellant contended that this construction constituted a denial of re? ligious liberty; that the ordinance as so construed became, supreme; that freedom of conscience and worship could be suppressed and prohibited by law; and that such law could thus be found to be in conformity with the fundamental law of the land. The Supreme Court made no comment on this argument but rejected all the claims as to restraint upon freedom of worship on the grounds that the court had no jurisdiction. It was further argued that the appellant performed her Christian missionary work in obedience to the law of God, which was superior to any law made by man. This contention was likewise rejected. The Court also appears to consider that the United States is not a Christian nation, because it rejected the contention that in accordance with a previous decision it should not commit any acts infringing on Christian activities. This attitude, coupled with the Court’s rulings in two cases involving conscientious objections to flag saluting, indicates that this high judicial body has little regard for the fundamental right of freedom of worship, freedom of conscience or freedom of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catholic Action—And Then Where?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nevertheless the Court has, through its declaration of freedom of the press, given a knock-out blow to the tyrannical, faseistical, Catholic-Action, Jesuitical groups ruling in many portions of this country. What now will Lam-the-law'-IIague and his henchmen do? 'Their pious claims of duty to. law must now be consigned to the garbage department. Press dispatches show their intention to defy the law and flaunt the courts. A Jersey City police captain, speaking with reference to this decision, states, “We are enforcing the Jersey City ordinance—not the Constitution. ’ ’ Bergen county (N.J,) officials are reported to have stated their intention to enforce their illegal ordinances regardless of the Supreme Court ruling. In other words, these lawless tycoons holding offices of public trust will jail people law or no law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses will watch with intense interest the next frantic efforts on the part of religious racketeers to suppress tho truth without losing outward respectability. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Console^; Hon’s</span><span class="font8"> guess is that they are going to have; a tough job. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;. .:</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Glands and Their Functions</span></h1>
<p><span class="font18">SEX attraction is a very real law of the creature, placed there by the great Giver of life, who said, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and [fill] the earth.’<sup>9</sup> This gift, like all other gifts, has been abused. The remarkable findings of biologists, especially Dr. Stemach, of Vienna, in respect to this subject are amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">For instance, change of sex is governed by male and female hormones. Through experimentation male guinea pigs have been changed and suckle the young. A woman eighty years of age had her cycle renewed. Lower forms of life have been developed in water without any</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">tale <sup>4</sup> seed’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">It has been proved that women have one male hormone every twenty-eight days, and this fact has puzzled scientists. The law of sex attraction—sex sensing—is a natural trait in human creatures, purposed to provide for the propagation of his kind, and operates in divers manners in lower creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The Scriptures say simply, “In the beginning God created . . . .’’In His infinite wisdom the Creator simply states the facts, and no lengthy discourse on geology or physiology is presented to baffle the simple mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Today the marvelous human organism is being studied, analyzed and subjected to test as never before. The reverential mind can only say, “Oh, Jehovah, how marvelous are thy works; in wisdom thou hast made them all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Glands play no small part in the functioning of the human mechanism. The average physician gives little heed to their importance, and laymen have little or no conception of the overwhelming part played by glandular functioning. ..... ■' ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">While there is life in the body of man (or beast) the glands furnish the necessary chemicals for energy and heat and provide materials for repair and growth. When glands fail in their function the body dies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Here are some of the things they regulate: the nutrition from our food and where it goes; the shape and size of every part and organ of our bodies; the shape and color of the body as a whole; the kind of hair, skin, fat, and muscles ; and the amount and distribution of the hair on our bodies. They govern the disposition and even the sound of the voice. From these ductless glands come secretions directly discharged into the blood stream. Endocrinol-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">APRIL20, 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">ogists can test the blood and determine the condition of every gland in the body. “The life is in the blood.<sup>99</sup></span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Chemicals of Great Potency</span></h2>
<p><span class="font18">These secretions are natural chemicals of great potency, capable of causing drastic change in the organism, according to the balance or unbalance of the chain of glands as a whole. They are sometimes called “Endocrine glands”, meaning ‘I separate within’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The life process of each cell depends upon intricate chemical reactions and inter-reactions, the final products of which are constantly discharged into the blood stream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">There are ten important glands, and these will be briefly discussed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The Pineal, situated in the center of the brain and in conjunction with the thymus, which is in the chest below the thyroid, keeps a child from developing prematurely into an adult. The secretion from the pineal restrains and regulates the sex glands and keeps them from developing into maturity before the rest of the body is ready to fulfill the function of procreation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">When this gland, the pineal, undergoes a change/at puberty, and shrinks, the child becomes an adult. If through disease or tumors this gland involutes too soon, sex instincts become abnormal, production and distribution of lime are interfered with, or malformations of bones take place. This latter result is because the pineal is closely connected with other glands, producing lime. With this improper development reasoning and mental growth are retarded, resulting in crime on the part of some in the adolescent age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">- ’ ' ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ ■ J &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ ■ ■ ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, J -</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Thymus arid Thyroid <sub>x</sub></span></h2>
<p><span class="font18">The Thymus, the gland of childhood, correlates with the pineal and others in a special influence before puberty. But at maturity its influence is lessened, otherwise childish traits and characteristics of mind and body persist, even af;er maturity, resulting in “big babies”. Infantilism today is defined as a disease. Such adults have luxuriant hair, baby face, milky white:skin and teeth, and are childish and temperamental. This gland, as already intimated, distributes and fixes lime in the bones of the-body. If the farmer has difficulty in getting hard-shelled eggs from hens, let him feed them the dried thymus gland of cattle and note the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The Thyroid gland, nature’s own battery which furnishes energy. From this comes the spark that ignites the fuel, nutrition, which in turn starts the machinery. It lies in the neck, on either side of the windpipe or esophagus, and is one of the most important glands governing one’s existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Its influence controls the processes and functions of the various parts of the body in a remarkable way, bringing joy or sorrow, ease or disease, activity or lassitude, assisting or hindering proper living, according to its condition or balance. It affects body and mind alike, for weal or woe. The secretion from this gland provides the energy which gives impetus to the autonomic nervous system, which in turn operates without the control or effort of the individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Though functioning as a battery, it does not keep our machine operating. Overrun it and you will have too rich a mixture to feed your human machine. Carbon will develop and cause trouble. Parts will become overheated and soon wear out. Then your efficiency goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">You need a normally functioning thyroid to have a well-balanced machine. Proper and efficient development of the sex glands and the stimulus to mental and physical growth which they in turn provide depend upon the thyroid’s functional perfection. Underactivity results in lifeless skin and hair, imperfect teeth, dwarfism, slow mentality, stupidity, lack of energy, and this in turn causes marked mental and physical deficiency.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Premature Exhaustion</span></h2>
<p><span class="font18">Many who base their faith on feelings and not the Word of God are severely tried on this score. They have worked hard or have dissipated and used up the battery without recharging and providing fuel to run the human machine. Many overtax their energies and lose balance. Nature demands repayment. Rest, food, as well as exercise of mind and body, are necessary to proper functioning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Students who work hard to put themselves through college and who are also active mentally often suffer from severe breakdowns from which it is hard to recover. Their'batteries are run down and it sometimes takes years to get them recharged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Likewise mental workers who have also worked hard physically, with few exceptions, find that when they reach forty-five or fifty</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">6</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">their powers of accomplishment begin to wane. A change is taking place in the functioning of the glands and it is wise to recognize this fact and adjust one’s manner of living to meet nature’s laws. Gland foods are often administered at this time by physicians to strengthen and rejuvenate the system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Younger people should observe this change and respect the older, recognizing that age often has the benefit of experience and a consequent wisdom, though not manifesting as much activity. This fact tends to keep society balanced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">An overaetive thyroid is conducive to hypersensitiveness to real or imaginary criticism. The afflicted are nervous, laugh or weep with equal readiness and often exaggerate. The heart beat is rapid and they often develop goiter. In children the mind is apparently keen and sensitive and eyes dispose to bulge. The carburetor nature has presided to control and regulate the activity of the thyroid is called the pituitary gland, of which more later.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Parathyroids and Adrenals</span></h2>
<p><span class="font18">Parathyroids. These are four little glands situated on the surface of each lobe of the thyroid gland. They have an important work to do, absorbing, secreting and distributing lime salts throughout the body. Vegetable juices, nature’s own chemicals, give these glands food to work with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The lack of these elements brings dire consequences. Disturbance of the nervous system and digestive processes, muscular weakness and defective teeth and bones are the result. God has given man every green herb for food. Food is not merely for stuffing one’s stomach or tickling one’s palate. Nature’s own fuel is often most potent when found in concentrated form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Adrenal glands. These sit like cocked hats atop the kidneys. Now, you strong men and women, with vitality, courage and endurance, are you not a little prone at times to despise the weak? Doubtless you have fine adrenals, a great asset. But lions and tigers have larger ones and also greater strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">These glands pour their secretion into the blood, basic elements contributing to successful and happy living. They give physical strength and endurance to finish the task of the day without fatigue. They give zest in recreation. They control blood pressure and the supply of iron to the blood, which in turn carries oxygen to the tissue cells. Without</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">oxygen one could not live. It takes oxidation to absorb nutrition, produce energy and build new cells, as well as to burn up the waste poisons which are produced in our bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The adrenals also control the circulation of the blood and keep it flowing at proper pressure, carrying it to the various organs and cells. When a sudden demand for strength is made these glands send adrenalin ]&gt;ouring into the blood stream in order that one may rise to the occasion. Thus is provided strength for a reasonable amount of work without fatigue and a reserve for emergency demands. These wonderful glands prepare secretions for fuel to build our bodies, provide energy and heat and destroy the poisons in the body. These secretions are so potent that an injection of the fluid will revive the apparently dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When the Zest Goes Out of Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When these glands fail, zest goes out of living. Too often it is the willing horse, getting the most to do, that meets this fate. Fine and sensitive natures are usually keener in conscience, respond quickly to the call to service, and arc more painstaking and efficient in work. Many useful, fruitful and active lives have apparently ended disappointingly from failure of the adrenal glands. Be of good cheer, “ [Christ’s] strength is made perfect in weakness.” “Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit,” saith Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God trieth the heart (affections) and the reins (Hebrew, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">kclahyoth,</span><span class="font8"> kidneys), that is, the use you arc making of your physical strength. Often a certain unbalance is seen in the affairs of life. The phlegmatic type let the thoroughbred type do the racing and fail to provide the compensating care the more delicate type requires. Then there is likely to lie a breakdown. Often the smiling, fat and fair, taking life easy, are the favorites, and the real workers are left to be misunderstood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before leaving consideration of the adrenals, note the result of overactivity: high blood pressure and overstrain of glands, bringing on apoplexy and paralysis. When overactive the whole personality and temperament changes. Women become course and hairy, of the type that hold their own and succeed in business and that men like to depend on to help out on the job. The men make good, high-pressure salesmen when these glands are overactive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Good adrenals produce cheerful workers and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">APRIL 20, 1938 </span><span class="font8">athletes. The prize-fighter, the heroes of war, the dictators, the driving bosses, all have abnormal adrenal gland action—like lions and tigers. The unenlightened think them to be supermen, and they themselves encourage the idea. Adrenals, not brains, are the explanation. Such persons are likely to become totally unsympathetic, brutal and even cruel, oblivious to the fact that they arc driving their fellow men to exhaustion and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;Support the Weak”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The opposite type, of low adrenal action, need understanding, care and sympathy. Their resistance is low and they lack ability to keep up with the crowd. They suffer from low blood-pressure, weakness and depression. They are subject to real and imaginary fears and are inclined to be hesitant and nervous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They often complain of chilliness in the extremities and are easily exhausted, hence incapable of sustained effort. Sleep does little to renew their vital force. There are various causes for this condition. In the stress of life today, with its intensive training and activity, many give out in these vital parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Scriptures tell us to “support the weak and comfort the faint-hearted”. Such persons of low adrenal action should be treated with love and reason. To mentally and otherwise support this type is one of the surest ways of helping them build back reserve energy when they have had a breakdown. Thought is a vital force in controlling our glands. Sustaining, encouraging thoughts reduce tension and relax the nerves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Pituitary</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Pituitary is another of the glands. It is situated in the brain at the base and has two lobes, the anterior and the posterior. This is the carburetor already referred to, and which controls and regulates activity, thought and concentration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One who lacks normal pituitary balance thinks superficially and without good judgment, as a rule. These glands are of vital importance. The removal of the anterior lobe means death. Injury to the gland by shock or otherwise hinders concentration, affects memory and loosens one’s hold on life and facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The oversecrction of this gland in youth increases bony structure, and hence, if it persists, abnormal stature results. This is what makes giants. Here is a key for synthesists, who are trying to fathom the facts pertaining</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">to man. It is admitted that many of the rising generation are unusually tall. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Only the preceding generation has been educated en masse and it is admitted the highschool boy and girl of today have to pass tests as difficult as were applied to college graduates of two generations ago. The marked activity and use of the pituitary in parents and children may account for greater height. An abnormal condition of this gland results in deposits in the spine, curvature, and clubbed hands and feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here “evolutionists” might consider a reason for the “mutations” they cannot explain, such as six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, etc. A strange malformation of the frame can result from abnormal secretion from this lobe. Various mental and brain disturbances affecting the whole chain of glands and unbalancing the whole human machine may occur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These glands are affected by alcohol. Who has not seen deformed children, mentally weak, one or both of whose parents were found to be liquor-drinkers. Often the children are conceived under its influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The posterior lobe of the pituitary plays an unusual part in the ductless chain. The secretion it emits to the stream of life contains a blood-pressure-raising substance which cdn contract smooth muscles. It plays a most important part in the peristaltic movement of the bowels; for it stimulates the muscular coat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It controls sugar also, and thus works in co-ordination with the hepatic gland of the liver. If the lobe over-secretes there is sugar in the urine; if it under-secretes an excessive desire for sugar and starches occurs. Those so afflicted are the fleshy, phlegmatic type, slow thinkers, easy-going, subject to constipation. Nothing worries them, and they are generally disposed to “let George do it”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Right thinking is a powerful factor of control when the glands are maladjusted. On the other hand, calm reasoning and power of concentration are the effect of properly balanced and exercised pituitary glands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Pancreas and Gonads</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Pancreas. This gland is one that vitally affects health and happiness. Its secretion regulates the output of glycogen from the liver, produced in, nature’s laboratory from the starches and sugars one eats. Certain cells are specialized to send hormones to the liver. This function failing, the liver gives too much sugar to the blood, and diabetes develops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The chain of endocrine glands must be uniformly adjusted and functioning properly to ensure good health. They are closely allied and interdependent. The pancreatic gland also acts as a brake on the overactivity of the adrenals and thyroids.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Active mental workers have a marked tendency to diabetes. The electric energy in the human machine is used at too rapid a rate by this type, throwing a greater strain upon the organism. An automobile operated at high speed persistently will wear out relatively much quicker than if operated more moderately. Active mental workers use more energy than most manual laborers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are two outstanding types among human creatures, and each has its own sphere of action to fill. The so-called “white-collar” type has by no means the easiest row to hoe. They continually fight fatigue as age advances, and not infrequently succumb to heart failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Gonads. Last, but not least, are the sex glands, called “gonads”, from the Greek word meaning “seeds”. They are the prostate in the male and the ovary in the female. These are the life-giving glands wherein are contained the vital force of the race, the specific germinal plasm from original man, passed on from generation to generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Each of these glands manufactures two kinds of cells, the reproductive cells and the interstitial cells. The reproductive cells send their secretions out of the body to fulfill the purpose of procreation. The interstitial cells’ secretion is poured into the blood stream to stimulate and revitalize all other glands, as well as the organs of the body. (Mark this well and compare with the observations on the thyroid.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These interstitial secretions are varied in their functions and may produce either an orderly or a disorderly sex-life. They influence both the mental and the physical state of the individual. This is but the reaction of the glands performing their functions, either according to a divinely ordered law of nature or in a disordered and injurious manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Man is fallen, imperfect and prone to err, at best. So much of man’s conduct is the result of physical conditions that he is frequently to be pitied rather than blamed when he errs. Many are derelicts because of perverted glandular functions. If the money spent in punishing such unfortunates were spent in adjusting their glandular systems much crime might be prevented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Powerful Humans Are Highly Sexed</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is well known that artists, scientists, people of esthetic and spiritual temperament and those who exercise the higher faculties of the mind are highly sexed. Sex-power is .an advantage if rightly understood and used in conjunction with a well-balanced mind. It may be diverted into channels enabling the individual to accomplish greater things than he would otherwise be capable of doing. This is sometimes called “sublimation”. Here lies the reward of one who makes himself “a eunuch for the sake of the kingdom of heaven”. Increased physical power and mental perception result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A born eunuch is a weakling, of imperfect development. A man-made eunuch according to the flesh never develops properly. A eunuch for the kingdom of heaven (living a celibate life) is neither weak nor unnatural, but Capable, with God’s help, of excluding the distractions of sex and devoting time, thought and strength to the service of the Kingdom. The bachelor who decides to live a celibate life and does so in an honest and upright manner will have more abundant mental and physical strength according to his particular type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Abuse or inordinate indulgence of the sexual function is extremely weakening, mentally as well as physically, and millions today leave themselves open to demon attack on this account. The asylums have more patients than ever before, due to the use, by both sexes, of liquor, tobacco and drugs. These things act on the gonads, stimulate the sexual imagination and induce licentiousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The flood of fictitious literature, moving pictures and advertisements filled with sexsuggestion stimulate the sexual imagination of millions. Many writers are habitual drug addicts. Also, wherever one goes one hears talk on sex. Ignorance on this subject does much damage. Too much prudery in a past generation, too much immodesty and licentiousness in the present. The misplaced emphasis on sex causes many to take the step of marriage with wholly false conceptions of its purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An honest analysis of sex-life, usually termed “love”, is but the beginning of a completely new viewpoint, one which will in due time triumph over every false conception, as surely as God’s kingdom shall be established on earth and bring life, health, peace, prosperity and happiness to all the willing and obedient.—Contributed.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>. Cleaning</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font8"> CLEAN mouth has long been recognized as essential to health, and upon this premise the various tooth-cleansing agents are offered, in the form of powders, pastes and mouth washes, fifty-seven varieties, all of them expensive, and for this reason beyond the reach of those who need them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Much of the terrible condition of our teeth has been caused by eating such articles as white-flour products, white sugar and canned foods; these refined, sterilized and devitalized articles of diet have been robbed of their lifegiving salts. They no longer nourish as intended, but, instead, impose a destructive influence on the various organs, including the teeth. These foods produce harmful residues, which accumulate and clog the system and prevent the circulation from carrying nourishment through the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The natives of the South Sea islands subsist on natural foods and have the most nearly perfect teeth to be found anywhere on earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Magnesium sulphate, commonly known as “Epsom salts”, is a splendid solvent for that stringy, sticky substance in the saliva called “mucin”. It is this mucin that binds or cements particles of food and calcium together to form tartar or calculus on the teeth. When this is dissolved the particles lose their hold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, if large deposits have already formed, they should be removed by a dentist, after which the daily use of Epsom salts will keep the teeth in good condition. Epsom salts also neutralizes acids formed by fermenting food between the teeth, and which acid is also responsible for decay of the teeth. Some might object to the taste, but this is not so noticeable, except when it is swallowed. Those who have artificial dentures will find this a great help in keeping them clean.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>“Cumulative Poison”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dr. B. M. Le Hunt Cooper, of London, states that he has so many eases of aluminum poisoning that he hardly knows which to discuss. He refers to headache, pyorrhea, </span><span class="font8">sore throat, sore mouth, rheumatism, neuritis, bowel conditions, indigestion, ulcers, skin affections, etc., all of which have been greatly relieved by eliminating the use of aluminum wares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Large doses of aluminum compounds are often fatal. Small quantities may be taken daily with little or no effect, but as aluminum is a cumulative poison, sooner or later indigestion, constipation, Bright’s disease, or diabetes may develop as a result of its continued use, due to its solubility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Aluminum is a soft metal, and is easily corroded and pitted under certain conditions. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span class="font8">example, when vegetables are cooked in aluminum and allowed to stand for some time, the utensil often becomes badly pitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When vegetables are cooked with soda and salt it will sometimes happen that holes are eaten completely through the aluminum pans in which the food is prepared. Corned beef corrodes most aluminum utensils. Boiled, pressed, or cast aluminum all corrode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Various kinds of food which may lodge in such cavities cannot be thoroughly washed out. The food particles then decay. Hence aluminum pans may be full of the most deadly bacteria known to science. Take a look at used aluminum ware through a small magnifying glass and you will see craters. It is impossible to wash or scour out all the various foods which lodge in these cavities.-—-Sydney (Australia) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Aluminum Foil for Wrapping Food</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ A story catches the eye, written bj<sup>r</sup> a financial writer for the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram. </span><span class="font8">It boasts of the $5,000,000 aluminum foil industry, used for wrapping all kinds of foods. The said writer finds the aluminum foil industry a very profitable one, flourishing in the midst of a depression. For some reason he did not mention anything about the $1,148,200 suit for damages brought by Blue Moon Products, a cheese company, because the aluminum foil spoiled the cheese. Wonder if that writer was hired to boost the sale of aluminum foil, and was instructed not to say anything about the million-dollar suit. Horrors! But such things happen every day. In the eyes of Big Business the suppression of truth that hurts their pocketbooks is one of the most important fields that can engage the attention of writers. And it is astonishing how much truth a writer can fail to sec if it is to his interest financially not to see it.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>“The Proof of the Pudding”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ For some time back I read much about aluminum’s being poison, but would not believe it, because I have much heavy aluminum ware that I have kept bright and pretty. I said I would never throw my nice things away; the ones who talked about it might be mistaken, as no one is infallible. At Christmas time I made a plum pudding and put it in an earthenware basin, with waxed paper and cloth over it. There was a little surplus; I put it in an aluminum basin and boiled it at the same time as the big one. Both puddings were treated exactly alike. When I took the puddings up the basin in which the little pudding was cooked was as black as coal; the pudding cooked in it was as bitter as gall, and we could not eat it. I thought the big one would be the same, but to my surprise it was delicious. Friends said they never tasted anything better. What you have said about aluminum as a cooking utensil is absolutely right, I will never use another bit of it for cooking, as long as I live.—Mrs. L. Grimwade, Florida.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">[Some ten or twelve years ago the editor chanced to call at a home where they had been subscribers for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Aye</span><span class="font7"> for two years. During those two years, because the subject was new, and important, each issue had contained at least one paragraph pointing out the danger of using this metal in conjunction with food. After a pleasant interview the lady said, “Do you know, I have almost made up my mind to discontinue the use of aluminum cooking utensils.” The truth on the subject had rapped at her door 52 times and she was still sound asleep. You can take the truth on any subject to the people, and take it a hundred times, but until their mental conditions are just right it will never make a dent. But that is no excuse for failure to present the truth. Present it anyway, every way you reasonably can, and let others do with it what they will. The presentation is the thing. ‘Thou canst not tell which will prosper, whether this or that,’ on any subject whatever. —led.]</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>The Boeing Flying Boats</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">THE six 42-ton flying boats of the Boeing type, for use on the route between New York and England, are each somewhat larger than the boat in which Christopher Columbus came to America. These boats will make the crossing in 22 to 28 hours, depending upon the route chosen. They carry 40 passengers and three tons of cargo. They may eventually be flown automatically and landed safely in weather which prevents the occupants from seeing anything outside. Experimentally this has already been done by army planes.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>The Rights of Humanity</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Who is there who thinks that either capi-. tai or labor has the right to put old springs and nuts in the blower section of a plane, or pieces of cloth in the gasoline feedline, or rags in the gasoline tank, so that when a plane goes up with its cargo of human life there is a fair chance that some fellow men will meet death because the plane does not function as intended? That happened at the Northrop plant of the Douglas Aircraft Corporation. Who did it? And why?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>The Hop to Hawaii</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The 2,570-mile hop from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, of eighteen long-range tombing planes, in 20 hours 12 minutes was quite a record, and was probably intended to show any bellicose warriors in the Far East how easy Uncle Sam could find his way across the Pacific if he had to do so.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Fast Hop Across Atlantic</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Hopping across the Atlantic is so common nowadays that it has almost ceased to be news. But Paul Codos made a fast flight from Paris to Buenos Aires in 52 hours 50 minutes, which is good time for a lone aviator. On his return trip he made the hop from Natal, Brazil, to Dakar, West Africa, in 11 hours IS minutes.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>Fast Time Across the Pacific</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The China Clipper, on November 19, 1937, made the 2,460 miles from Honolulu to Alameda, California, in 14 hours 35 minutes, or approximately 170 miles an hour. The usual time is 18 hours, but in this instance the ship had a brisk tail wind to help it along.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>Uncle Sam’s Monopoly of Helium</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Uncle Sam forbade the export of helium gas (of which it has a monopoly) until the United States Government could come into control of privately owned helium properties in Kansas and Colorado. It is well known that the Germans will not try to fly any more zeppelins with hydrogen gas. The cause of the destruction of the Hindenburg at Lakehurst was the valving of the inflammable gas to enable the ship to settle. Hydrogen, when it is mixed with ordinary air, is explosive. The Hindenburg was destroyed by the hydrogen which it itself released into the atmosphere as it landed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">An Ever-present Modern Danger</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ An ever-present modem danger is that in the privacy of one’s own home a man and his entire family may be killed by an airplane coming through the roof. And it means the death of all in the plane, also. That has happened repeatedly, and, in an instance at Ostend, Belgium, included five members of the former royal German family of Hesse.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Did He Divide Up?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ There is no question that John Weston, art student, received hot a pumpkin pie that his mother baked for him in Minnesota; for here is a picture of the stewardess handing it to him when the plane arrived in Newark, N. J., but the thing that all the boys will want to know is whether John did the right thing, and divided it up, as he should.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>Passed over Four Cyclones</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The Russians flying between Moscow and . San Jacinto, California, sailed at a height of 16,000 feet and passed over four cyclones &quot;&quot;&nbsp;when near the North Pole. They had food sufficient for six weeks. Each slept about two and a half hours, in short naps. The fliers think regular landings should be made at distances of about 4,000 miles.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Thirty-Hour Service to Berlin</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Experiments indicate that the Lufthansa’s German seaplanes will be able to operate between New York and Berlin in thirty hours. The route is via Lisbon and the Azores. British planes are flying repeatedly between Ireland and Newfoundland in about 16 hours.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>The Gentle Art of Purchasing</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">THAT was clever work on the part of the Pan American and British Imperial Airways to buy up all copies of the Official Gazette of the Portuguese Government in which were published the details of the ironclad contract that no American commercial planes, except American Airways may land in Portuguese waters for fifteen years. Now some who want to open air routes to Europe find themselves blocked because they have nowhere to land en route, and they cannot even find or procure copies of the Gazette that shows the terms of the contract.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>Skimming Off the Cream</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦It is not only the Big Business crowd that knows how to figure. The knowledge of the multiplication table is widely spread; and hence it is worth noting that the assistant attorney general of the United States has called attention to the fact that the increases in iron and steel prices, effective December 1, 1936, and March 1, 1937—three months— were three times as great as necessary to cover the increased wages paid to steel workers and at least twice the amount necessary to cover the increases in the cost of both labor and raw material during that period. Thus wh^n the Government accuses the sixty richest families of trying to skim the cream off recovery, it ..has a solid basis for its accusation.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>Had Part in Killing Their Fellow Men</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The Government indicted the Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation, Curtiss Aeroplane and Motors Company, Curtiss-Wright ■ Airplane Company and four individuals for conspiracy to smuggle arms and munitions into .Bolivia during its war with Paraguay over the Gran Chaco. It seems good to have some of the International Murderers on the carpet, even though they do get out of it in the end.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>The Largest Surplus Assets</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The corporation with the largest surplus assets is the Pennsylvania Railroad System, with a total of $906,228,000; the next in size .is the Ford Motor Company, with $602,266,' 000; and the third is the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, with $491,093,000.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Destroy Food and Help the Banker</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Make sure to destroy plenty of food and thus help the banker! The way it works is like this: The banker loans $5,000 to a farmer at a time when wheat is selling at $1 a bushel, and at that price the farmty can pay it back and pay interest on it. But God is good now the same as in apostolic times when He “gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness” (Acts 14:17), and this worries both the wheat grower and the banker, -If too many farmers raise too much wheat, the price goes down and the banker cannot get his money. He does not wish to turn farmer, because the work is too hard. All he wants is money, and this he can get only if instead of God’s giving rain from heaven the Devil will send cyclones, grasshoppers and politicians to destroy the food that God gave. Of course, the banker reasons, God may have intended that surplus food for the starving Chinese, Hindus and millions of others, but He forgot that I have a financial interest in this matter and I just must have the interest on my money. And so, everybody should turn in and fight against God by destroying plenty of food that the orphans of Ethiopia and Spain have no money to purchase, and take his stand firmly on the side of the Devil, the grasshopper, the politicians and the banker, so that prices may be kept uniform now and evermore, and the interest may continue to flow until nobody but the money crowd has a red cent left on God’s green footstool. Glovy be to Morgan, Federal Reserve, Roosevelt, Mussolini, Hitler and Franco until Armageddon. So mote it wuz!</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Caucasians spread their civilizations rapidly. One of their attainments is cancer. This has finally reached the Eskimos. The first case among these primitive people was found in the year 1937. How they came to get it is anybody’s guess.

<h4><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>Make Use of the Schools</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ There is no sense on earth in locking out children while their parents are still at work, sending them back to toyless, bookless, ill-lit or congested “homes” or throwing them upon the streets or up^n the lanes and highroads, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">dodge traffic, to pick up bad habits and become public nuisances simply because their formal teaching hours are over. Too often we </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">do </span><span class="font8">that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There stand the schools. There should be accommodation in them, rooms properly warmed and lit for play; there should be’ libraries and small rooms for reading and drawing; there should be cheap, simple refreshments, good music, radio entertainment, and So forth, available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Moreover, the modern school should be available as an organized communal home to which the children’s parents should also be able to come for at least one or two hours in the evening to know what is happening to their youngsters, to keep in touch with them and to share the influences of the place so that the home will not lag behind and be a drag upon the school work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A school should be planned, and could be planned, to serve all these ends, and staffed sufficiently to serve these ends. It should be open all the year round—and particularly during the holidays, when formal teaching is </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font8">suspense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For it is becoming plain to most of us nowadays that a publicly owned school is either the living nucleus of a new social order, a center in the crystallization of a new civilization, or it is a half-living and rather unmeaning excrescence upon our social muddle. As it is, we have had to pay for these schools, and pay pretty heavily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But first a word of tribute to Gary, Indiana, because it was in Gary, Indiana, that these new ideas of what a communal school should • and can do were first brought in sight of practical reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thirty years ago some bright creative minds in Gary realized that their schools were “locking out” the children for everything except the classroom hours, and they made a fuss about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They started out upon exactly these ideas I have stated above, and particularly upon the idea of the school as being not merely </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">machine for teaching to read, write and </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">count, </span><span class="font8">but </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">social center, and they produced </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a new &quot;• </span><span class="font8">type of school and schoolhouse open to the children </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">its owners, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">community, </span><span class="font8">throughout most of the day and year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Gary plan type of school has spread from. town to town and from state to state. Now, under the bold and intelligent regime of La Guardia and Moses, people are settling down firmly to Garyize New York city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Manifestly there is an urgent demand for a quite heroic effort of scholastic rearmament if our community is not to fall hopelessly be- -hind its English-speaking kindred across the Atlantic in social solidarity and mental and '—' physical development.—H, G.

<p><span class="font14">Q</span><span class="font8">UESTION; All sane persons desire to live in happiness. Is it possible for one to gain life everlasting by believing on and practicing religion and by faithfully following religious precepts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer; No, such is an impossibility. Life everlasting is a gift of Jehovah through Jesus Christ our Lord and Redeemer. (Romans -r»' 6:23) There is no other name given under heaven whereby men must be saved, and hence no other way to gain life everlasting. (Acts 4:12; John 17:3) “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) There are many other corroborative Scriptural texts proving beyond all doubt that God’s means of providing life through Jesus Christ is the only way tfi get life everlasting. The Scriptures also definitely and clearly show that no one can gain the blessings of life everlasting by believing on and practicing religion and by following its precepts faithfully. (Galatians 1:13,14; Acts 26:4,5) Some religionists and religiops systems claim to employ the Bible, the Word of God, but not one religion in existence recognizes and teaches what is essential to salvation, because they do not teach the people that which tlie Bible contains. The so-called “church”' or religious organiza-* tions tell the people of their organization that ajl that is necessary is for them to have faith and support some church organization and in due time they shall be saved. Such a claim is wholly false and works great injury to the pehsbn who is induced tp believe it. Faithfully following the precepts of a religious system, therefore, is of no value, but works great injury to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Word of God, without qualification or contra di ctiori, shows that all men are born im-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">APRlL 20,1938 </span><span class="font8">perfect and as sinners and that none are by nature entitled to everlasting life. All such sinners would perish for ever except for the fact that God has made provision for the salvation of man, and that provision is by arid through the sacrifice of Christ Jesus. Jesus by His own lifeblood purchased the human race, and God grants to Him the privilege of administering life everlasting to the obedient ones of the human race. It is essential, therefore, to those who desire to be saved to -first believe that Jehovah is the great and almighty God and that Christ Jesus is the Savior of ■men; that Christ Jesus by His shed blood has bought the human race and that those who obey God’s commandments may receive life by and through Christ Jesus. (Hebrews 11:6) Then the one thus consecrating himself must be obedient to God’s law as set forth in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some<sup>1</sup> religionists say this in substance; ‘If I do-what I deem to be right, and live a clean life, I am sure I will be saved.’ That conclusion is based entirely upon the opinion of man and has no support in the Word of God and finds no support anywhere else. In the Bible it is plainly written; “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” (John 3; 36J That scripture, therefore, means that only those who believe on and obey Christ Jesus shall see life, and those who fail or refuse to thus believe and serve the Lord shall never get out from under the condemnation that came upon man by inheritance through the sin of Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Faith in God and Christ Jesus is absolutely essential to even start in the way of life, and then that faith or belief must be maintained by obedience and full devotion to God and, to His kingdom. Religion, being a product of the Devil, is a snare into which the people are led and which makes them ready for destruction. The »faet that one is sincerely obeying the forms and practices and ceremonies of religion will not add one thing whatsoever to his. good. Only God’s Word, the Bible, contains the guide that points man to life everlasting.</span></p>

Some of this is expended in feeding Jehovah’s witnesses in various institutions where they are incarcerated for loving God and their fellow men. At Trenton a number of unemployed men took temporary possession of the Assembly chamber and resolved that they would wait until what they styled the “sissy legislators’’ should return and do something for them.</span></p>

Men and women were killed in groups of six, clubs, machetes, bayonets and daggers with three prongs being used. Though the soldiers that did the killing were kept intoxicated, several were shot rather than continue the work of butchery. The slain were piled interspersed with cordwood, and the whole saturated with kerosene and burned.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>Who Will Get Immortality?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font8">E HAVE had occasion to think over the evil effects of the well-known Judge Rutherford's propaganda, listening, as a matter of duty for our office, to his presumptuous lessons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Surely his work is carried on in a most able and deceitful manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">His lectures are short, hut are often repeated by many stations during the day; one of these-is broadcast at the end of the Italian program of the Italian daily </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">L’ltalia,</span><span class="font8"> of San Francisco, at Station KROW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It follows, therefore, that our countrymen, emaining seated after hearing the Italian ^program, will hear, even though only mechanically, the blatterings of one who with little modesty permits the title of Judge to precede his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of the arguments on which this selfstyled apostle of Christ preaches is the immortality of the soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Rutherford has the impudence to say that man does not have an immortal soul, and that immortality is reserved “for Christ Jesus and his 144,000 associates in the Kingdom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Aside from the point that Rutherford relies upon the fact that many will not bother to look up the scriptures he quotes, and which he quotes out of reason and not in harmony with his assertions, it is more than evident to every thinking person that if the soul were not immortal, or that immortality were reserved for only a few, God would be unjust, and that His promises would be nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We know and hold for an incontrovertible faet that immortality is the prize for all the good and faithful servants of God<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark134">1</a></sup>; for these, herefore, is reserved eternal life. The evil ones, those who do not care to do the will of God, kill their own souls, that is, they extinguish the flame of love which binds them to God. Only in this manner is the soul mortal. But their souls, though dead to the union with God, live on in the darkness of the eternity of the damned, that is, deprived of the joy of con- -templating God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Rutherford in this as well as in other questions claims the right to interpret the Holy Scriptures because of the pride of being superior to others, and certainly not because he has received a particular gift from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He is especially hostile toward the Catholics and the Catholic Church. It is natural that thinking himself a “teacher” he should oppose her, who is the only Teacher by divine mission, and who is upheld and comforted in that mission by virtue of the revelations of the Saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Rutherford’s followers, whom he calls “Jehovah’s witnesses” and not followers of Jesus Christ, at best are only “poor devils” who deafen the ears even of those unwilling to listen, that they may create confusion, doubt and desperation. We do not know but what, with this end in view, they are really “devils”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our readers would do well to change stations immediately following the “Italia” program, and if they wish to have clarity and preciseness on certain Gospel Scriptures, let them turn not to the “Watch Tower”, but obtain and read “The Creed of the Apostles”, by the Benedictine Father Richard Felix (Conception Abbey, Conception, Mo.) in which book the learned monk answers one by one the unreasonable and evil teachings of Judge Rutherford,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And above all, let them burn all books, booklets and fliers which “Jehovah’s witnesses” leave at their doors.—Editorial, translated from </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">L’Unione,</span><span class="font8"> the official Italian Catholic newspaper for the archdiocese of San Francisco, for Friday, November 26,1937.</span></p>

Instead he was sold to a raiser of turkeys. He learned his duties in a very short time, but seemed to think he had been demoted, acting gloomy and miserable. Moreover, the sheep dogs in the neighborhood of northern California where this happend seemed also to think be had been demoted, for thereafter they would have nothing to do with him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Some of their ideas may be new to us. Some may seem dangerous. Nevertheless, believing in freedom of speech for others as well as for ourselves, we must not attempt to abuse or silence them. Believing in freedom of speech, Americans practice tolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is well to remember that some of the most sincere patriots have been abused by the intolerant of their own day. George Washington, as a British subject, holding ideas of liberty for the American colonies, was abused as a traitor. The abolitionists were denounced as fools and crooks.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Our own history teaches us that great and good changes, marking advances in our civilization, have frequently resulted from ideas which, because they were new and different, were rejected by the intolerant.

<h4><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>Pinchot on Personal Government</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ In a letter to Congress on Mr. Roosevelt’s proposals to install himself as dictator, and in which letter he shows that Benito Mussolini has repudiated every promise he made to the Italian people, Amos R. E. Pinchot says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Personal government never works anywhere. We know that from what is going on in Europe and in Russia. It may begin benevolently, but it ends by treating people like animals. It punishes without trial. It makes the people poorer. It works them for small pay and lowers the Standard of life. It keeps them in anxiety and discomfort. It makes them afraid to talk aloud. Personal government, no matter who controls it or what it is called, becomes brutal, stupid, and, except in war, exceedingly inefficient. It is highly contagious. And, if it once gets started here, it will no doubt run its course and prove as destructive as in other nations—probably more so; for America is the land of extremes.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark143"></a>Seizure of the Fact-finding Commissions</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ President Roosevelt’s government reorganization program, in which he proposes the presi dential control of the investigational and fact-finding commissions, such as the Interstate Commerce Commission, Federal Trade Commission, Federal Power Commission, Federal Communications Commission, and Securities and Exchange Commission, is one more step, and a long one, tn the Hitlerizing of the United States which will be deplored by all true Americans. These commissions have hitherto been carefully guarded by</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Congress from just such proposed presidential usurpation. It is a strange thing to see one’ country being destroyed before one’s eyes. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Why the President Laughed</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The charge is made that when Franklin D, Roosevelt, at the time of his second inaugural, stood up to take the oath of office administered by the chief justice, he laughed. And when one reflects on what he intended to do to the chief justice, and the .Supreme Court, and the Constitution, it is no wonder that he laughed. It is difficult to understand a man like Roosevelt. His words to the contrary notwithstanding, he is obviously, but perhaps unconsciously, undemocratic. '</span></p>

He enlisted in the army of the Spanish Republic as a teacher, and, as he made no confession of previous military training, was made a letter carrier, that is, given a place of trust. At the first opportunity, having been sent with dispatches to the front, he deserted to Franco’s army of Moors and betrayers of his country. The Chicago </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Herald and Examiner</span><span class="font8"> contains a -half column of the usual bleating from Rome, explaining that when Don Antonia made his pledge of allegiance to the Government it meant no more than any other oath made by any other member of the Hierarchy; that is, it meant nothing at all, not a thing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Sunday-school teacher gets a strong delusion</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ TheBritishGovern-ment sent the Hood, greatest of battleships, to Bilbao, to insure safe conduct for fourshipsbearing food to starving people, and when it arrived on the scene it merely told the ships it could guarantee their safety only to within three miles of the Spanish shore. This was what Franco and the pope wanted, but the British did not need to go to all the expense of sending the Hood; they might as well have sent a rowboat. It is well known that British Big Business wishes Franco and the pope to win the war.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>Non-Intervention in Spain</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The Principal Dangers of the World solemnly agreed to neutrality in the “civil war” raging in Spain. The war broke out in July, 1936. It took several months for Italy to put her 80,000 or so troops in Franco’s lines, and Germany had to have the same length of time to put in half as many. Also, it takes time to bring in ammunition and all kinds of military supplies. At length it was announced that March 1 no more troops or supplies could be brought in. But something must have been delayed somewhere; for it was then announced that it would be two weeks longer before the international police would be on the job. That is efficiency for you: eight months to give a bandit ample time to rob a bank and then wait tw'o weeks longer to make sure he would get far enough away that nothing could be done.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark150"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark151"></a>Foe of Spanish Republic</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Because of sinister pressure brought to * jar upon American olitieians, the American Republic is getting to be more and more an active foe of the Spanish Republic, being, in that respect, in a position parallel to that of Great Britain. With the full knowledge of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">the American Government a spy ring was operated in New York city, tipping off the victors in the war against the women and children of Guernica, as to when munitions would sail from Mexico to Spain. The object, of course, was to cause the seizure of the munition ships, so that no help could be obtained by the Spanish Republie, but all help would go to the army of the pope. The head spy was Juan Francisco de Cardenas, former secretary of the Spanish embassy at Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Enlisted on Wrong Side</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ According to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">L ’Osservatore Romano,</span><span class="font8"> it seems that the majority of the priests of Spain enlisted in the wrong army ; it says 80 percent of them have been killed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Joseph Ernest van Rocy, better known as Cardinal van Hoey, archbishop of Malines, is a clever politician. Perceiving that “The Peacock” (a pet name for Leon Degrelle, would-be Fascist leader) was losing popularity, and being desirous to kick Hitler in the ribs, to make him more amenable to Catholic Action, and being further desirous to remove some of the taints from the Hierarchy which have recently clustered about it in Germany, Spain and Ethiopia, he ordered all Catholics in Belgium to vote against Degrelle and for Van Zeeland. The result was that Van Zeeland received 275,840 votes and Degrelle only 69,242, and although it, was apparently a Fascist defeat, it was acclaimed as a Catholic victory. Now when the “church” gets the right leader in Belgium, watch it swing the vote as far the other way.</span></p>

After seeing what hell has been made in this world, only a money-mad theologian would want the Devil to operate one still worse in another world.

<h4><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark158"></a>When Everybody Kept Still</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">♦ When Finland paid her debt to the United States there was great enthusiasm in Washington and in all the big newspaper offices throughout America. Same enthusiasm when Hungary offered to pay something. Same enthusiasm when Britain and France and almost all other European countries welched and spent their money for munitions instead of paying their holiest debts. But when the Spanish Republic offered to pay $30,000,000 of debts contracted before the Franco rebellion and to settle claim for damage to American property caused by that same Franco, everybody was as silent as the grave. It looks so bad, don'teher-know, for a so-called “Red” country to be honest and a so-called “white” country to be dishonest. And it offends the Hierarchy’s sensibilities, too.</span></p>

I have lived in West Africa and know the natives use big words (gotten out of some dictionary) and not always the right ones. At one time I lived in the end house on government land, near a lane where natives passed, and often heard conversations that I knew were gotten up to entertain me. I remember, on one occasion, two men were coming along, talking very peaceably with each other, but when they got within my hearing the big one said to the little one, “Yes, I know you would like to assassinate me.” It was altogether comical, for it was evident on the face of it that the little man could not do away with the big one even if he so desired. It was merely theatrical.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Illustrative of the uncivilized and indecent practices of Fascism (Catholic Action) are the orders of Italian authorities in Harrar, Ethiopia, that no one may buy wheat or bread save Italians, and that no one may do business in foreign- goods unless these are of Italian or German manufacture. Considerable numbers of German military men are gathering in Ethiopia, leading to the suspicion that invasions of Kenya or other British possessions may be contemplated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Haile Selassie, emperor of a realm that no longer exists, but still, in theory, the head of the government of Ethiopia, which country is a member of the League of Nations, wrote a note to the League declaring his continued faith in that august body. That is probably as grim a joke as any monarch ever expressed. It is too bad for his reputation, though, that he did not tell what he believed.</span></p>

Ten nations have given de jure recognition of Italy’s claim of sovereignty, eleven more have given </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">de facto </span><span class="font8">recognition of the same, and six more have given envoys’ credentials to the king of Italy as also the emperor of Ethiopia. All the rest will follow suit, sooner or later. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

Chinese restaurants in the United States are urging the boycott of all Japanese goods.

<p><span class="font8">“I looked into Presbyterianism, only to retreat shudderingly from a belief in a merciless God, who had long foreordained most of the helpless human race to eternal hell. To preach such a doctrine to intelligent heathen would only raise in their minds doubts of my sanity, if they did not believe I was lying,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Then I dipped into Baptist doctrines, but found so many sects therein warring over the merits of cold water initiation and the method and time of using it that I became disgusted with such trivialities; and the question of close communion or not only impressed ma that some were very stingy and exclusive witt their bit of bread and wine, and others a little&quot; -'' less so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Methodism struck me as thunder and lightning religion—all profession and noise. You struck it or it struck you, like a spasm— and so&quot; you ‘experienced’ religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The Congregationalists deterred me with their starchiness and self-conscious true goodness and their desire for only high-toned affiliates. Unitarianism seemed all doubt, doubting even itself. A number of other Protestant sects based on some novelty or eccentricity—like Quakerism—I found not worth serious study by the non-Christi an.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“But on one point this mass of Protestant dissension cordially agreed, and that was in a united hatred of Catholicism, the older form of religion, and Catholicism returned with interest this animosity. It haughtily declared itself the only true church, outside of which there was no salvation—for Protestants especially; that its chief prelate was the personal representative of God on earth; and that he was infallible. Here was religious unity, pov er and authority with a vengeance. But, in'-' chorus, my Protestant friends besought mo not to touch Catholicism, declaring it was worse than heathenism—in which I agreed.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“I think I can clean your hat up all right,” said Jane. “Come along, now. Buddy and Sally are ’way ahead of us. Hurry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Can’t hurry,” replied Bunny. “The wind blows me back. Look!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bunny held out both arms, and rose on tiptoe. A sudden gust toppled her over backward and she sat down in the very puddle from which she had rescued her hat a moment before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Such a look of surprise spread over her my round face that Jane could do nothing at laugh at her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">;i;r “Don’t laugh,” begged the little girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I’m sorry, dear. Come. We’ll go back home and get some dry clothes on. We can catch up to Sally and Buddy later on.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“All right,” agreed Bunny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ten minutes later they were running down _the road toward the woods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I don’t like the wind,” Bunny said. “It’s a bad wind. I wish there weren’t any.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just then they spied Buddy and Sally. They were kneeling down beside a little pond in the ... woods under the willow trees. Soft green leaves were just coming out on the twigs. The grass was thick and sweet, and dotted with pretty spring flowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Buddy had made a paper boat and was watching it sail about on the'water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“What makes it go?” Bunny asked her brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The wind. You know that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Of </span><span class="font8">course,” Bunny said, quickly. She ’ipped her fingers into the water and laughed j the boat tumbled about on the waves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' “How do big boats go?” She asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“With steam,” answered Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Yes, but there was a time when people didn’t know about steam,” said Jane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">...... “How did boats go then?” asked Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It was the wind that made the ships go,” explained Sally. “People ran big pieces of cloth up on high poles. They, called this cloth sails. When the wind would blow against the sails, it would make the ship go.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Suppose there wasn’t any wind.” said Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">APRIL 20, 1S3B</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Then they couldn’t go, unless they used paddles and rowed across the water.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Look, Bunny,” Buddy cried. “I put in another boat. Let’s have a race.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Oooo, yes! That’s fun!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“All right. You take the blue one and I’ll take the white one. Now, let’s put them both over there a”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Like this? What will we do now?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Nothing. The wind will blow them, and we’ll see which one gets to that big stone first.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Here comes the wind,” called Bunny. “It’s—oh! oh!—”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A terrible splash in the middle of the pond sank one boat and sent the other scooting against the clump of rushes at one end. In the center of the pond floated Bunny’s hat, upside down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Now look!” said Buddy. “You’d better take that thing and sit on it. I’ll have to make another boat.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The boat-building didn’t take long, and very soon two little paper boats were sailing gently across the shining water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bunny’s boat dipped up and down a time or two, then went right to the big rock. But Buddy’s boat sailed into the eddy below the willow root that stuck above the water, Here it turned round and round, and didn’t get any place at all. Bunny giggled and declared, “I won the, race, Buddy; I won the race.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Guess you did,” Buddy answered. “Let’s do something else. Let’s pretend—”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Look!” cried Sally. “What a funny place for a nest! ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There, attached to the rushes in the water, was a bird’s nest. It bobbed and swayed about like a broken cradle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“That’s a coot’s nest,” said Jane. “They always build like that. This nest is from last year. But there are some coots here this year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Where?” asked the other three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Down here a little way, where the pond widens out.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“How do you know if they are coots?” asked Sally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“One way is to watch them skim across the water, showing a flash of white, and making the water splash about them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Let’s go and look at them,” said Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Not today. It is time to go home, now.”</span></p>

Keens, by his publish-<sup>1</sup> ers, The C. W. Daniel Company, Ltd., 40 Great Russell street, W.C. 1, London, England, has produced a little book of 48 pages on “Some Biological and Biochemical Aspects of the Aetiology of Cancer”, a book that every physician ought to read. In his little book, the title of which is </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Death in the Pot,</span><span class="font8"> he establishes a connection between cancer and allied diseases and inorganic chemical substances, aluminum in particular, and tracks down these diseases to the very food one eats and the water he drinks. He points out that much of the vegetable produce is rendered poisonous through treatment with sprays, artificial manures and soil dressings with a high content of aluminum and other chemical substances; the water draining through the land is similarly affected. Examination of diseased plants reveals growths that correspond to cancer in human creatures. Chemical fertilizers first rendered aluminum soluble for plant intake in 1842. Cancer deaths in Britain were then 173 per million inhabitants. Aluminum cooking utensils were first made in 1887; by that time the cancer deaths per million were 615. In 1927, in Britain, £883,000 worth of aluminum was used for the manufacture of cooking utensils, and the cancer deaths had risen to 1,376 per million inhabitants. In 1936 this figure had increased to 1,563. Note the steady increase every five years from 1842 to 1932. The steadily rising figures are 173, 274, 306, 327, 367, 403, 429, 488, 534, 615, 690, 785, 846, 915, 1,019, 1,192, 1,229, 1,376, 1,510. The book has an aluminum cover.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">In the United States vaccination is required by law in only ten states, and six states leave it optional with local authorities whether or not they shall require vaccination. Most of the states do not seek to make vaccination a requirement. And yet out of a total of approximately a million and a quarter fatalities annually from all causes only about twenty to thirty fatalities annually are attributed to smallpox.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Australia is in close proximity to India and other countries where virulent smallpox is endemic and widespread. Australia is noted as one of the least vaccinated countries of the world and it is also noted for its freedom from smallpox.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Official statistics for India show approximately ten times as many vaccinations as in England, there being an average of from 57 per thousand living persons to 85 per thou sand living persons vaccinated in India iri-recent years, to compare with an average of six to seven per thousand living persons vaccinated in England. On the other hand, the fatalities from smallpox in India in recent years have ranged anywhere from 37,000 to 103,000, whereas in England there are practically no fatalities from the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mexico has a stringent law providing for vaccination and revaccination, and yet during the period 1922-1930 a total of more than 96,000 fatalities from smallpox were officially recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Italy has a stringent vaccination law providing for vaccination and revaccination, and yet during the years 1919 and 1920 approximately 30,000 fatalities from smallpox were officially recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the Philippine Islands, with a population of approximately ten million persons, more than twenty-four million vaccinations were carried out during the ten-year period 1911 to 1920 and during that time there were more than 75,000 fatalities from smallpo officially recorded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So far as mortality statistics are concerned, there appears to be no relation whatever between vaccination laws in the respective countries and the presence or absence of smallpox, but it is significant to note that the fatalities from smallpox have declined along with improved sanitary and general living conditions and that wherever sanitary and general living conditions remain backward, as in parts of India, smallpox continues to remain virulent and endemic.—Citizens’ Medical Reference Bureau.</span></p>

All the world knows that both men are very ambitious.

Outwardly the two are great friends, but as each is ruled by an ambition mutually overlapping, their friendship is rather that of those who for a time agree in the face of common enemies, but have no care the one for the other.

Those who know the truth and are made stewards of the message, of Jehovah to the men of good will, and to the nations, seek, as faithful stewards, to do His will in declaring His message, and this brings them under the notice of the politicians. In Germany Jehovah’s witnesses arc ruthlessly treated, even unto death in some cases. In other countries where such ruthlessness does not yet obtain, the religipus politicians arc taking notice, and some of these have shown the same cruel spirit as is in action in Germany. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Because of this relationship to the kingdom of heaven, as Judge Rutherford has shown, the witnesses of- Jehovah must speak of and witness against some of the acts of the politicians and executives: they cannot avoid this ■ and be faithful to their trust. In </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font8"> (Book Two, page 104) it is shown that the British Empire is an integral part of the two-horned beast of Revelation 13. What happens to it must therefore be of great interest to all who seek for the truth, and especially to those who have the responsibility of being witnesses for God. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By its present rulers the empire is said to be stronger now than ever it was for defense against attacks in war, but because of fear still greater war strength is energetically being made. Actually, the term British ‘ ‘ empire ’ ’ is only a convenient word to express the unity </span><span class="font7">which </span><span class="font8">exists between Britain and the associated dominions, now called ‘'nations”, namely, Canada, South Africa, Australia, and other parts of the earth more or less under the . control of London. Undoubtedly this combination is a mighty power in all those things which cause men to speak of power. But the empire has what may be called a physical weakness: it is, spread over the face of the earth, and the associated nations, and India and the colonies, are separated by the oeea<sup>r </sup>Britain’s rulers have much reason for ren bering this, and its enemies know it as we Britain does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From Britain in the northwest of Em to India, the Far East and Australia, the p sage through the Mediterranean, the Sui canal, and the Red sea, has become an essential, and so much so as to be called a life line. Barred from that passage Britain would be rendered almost impotent t it would not be able to give ready help, nor get the imports upon</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">which it so much depends. But this is that which Italy with other help could effect, and this, as well as the avoidance of a general war, with its destruction to all engaged in it, is what the politicians in London seek to prevent; hence the readiness to confer with Mussolini.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The present situation is causing violent speeches by politicians, as may be expected. The various party leaders praise or blame the party in power, and do not hesitate to blame persons as well as policies. But politicians speak for their party and for their audiences, and their words must be judged accordingly. Each of the three political parties in Britain professes earnest regard for and determination to uphold the freedom of democracy. Hitler professes to believe that this cry of liberty for the people is humbug, and he knows that there is a high-placed clique who are pro-Hitler; and of the same mind are some who favor Fascism. Undoubtedly the god of the nations, the Devil, is working hard to get the peoples under the control of a few men whom he can use in his war against Jehovah’s King Jesus, now set in His place of authority and power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Priests and People in Ireland</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In his book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Priests and People </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland,</span><span class="font8"> J. F. McCarthy, an Irish Roman Catholic lawyer of ability, made the following state* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'• ment:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A new power—or, rather, an old power in a new environment—has been gathering force in Ireland during the later decades of the 19th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This new power, this rising sun, is the sacerdotal organization of the Roman Catholic Church, the church to which I myself and the majority of Irishmen belong. Our priests, monks, and nuns now possess an effective organization in Ireland which outnumbers the services of our national and local governments combined. They constitute an unmarried and anti-marriage league, apart from the people, and working for objects which do not tend to enhance the common weal. The press and . the platform, the newspapers and the orators, the . merchants, the professional men, the civil servants, ■ from the clerk to the judge on the bench, from the ’ sergeant of police to the highest government offi-; cial—for all of them the power of the priest is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">one unspeakable, unmentionable thing. They find * it to their immediate interest to either flatter or re-l main silent as they watch the growth and con-| solidation of the priests’ power. This power also </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">t APRIL 20, 1238</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">terrifies the enfeebled minds of the credulous, the invalid, and the aged, with the result that the savings of penurious thrift, the inheritance of parental industry, the competence of respectability, are all alike captured and garnered into the sacerdotal treasury. This power is an alien organization whose interests are not the interests of us, the Roman Catholic laity of Ireland. I am a Catholic; I am an Irishman; I have a right to speak. I condemn the policy to which our priests have committed themselves. It is not a policy of forbearance, but of religions intolerance and bigotry (page De Valera) which is bound to develop into religious persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Still Some Law in Ireland</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is still some law in Ireland. At Gee-sala, in the Irish Free State, a Miss Stokes was awarded £75 damages and costs against Peter McDonagh, a farmer, for organizing a mob, kidnaping the young woman, dragging her across the country against her will, taking her before the “Reverend Father” Munnelly and compelling her to get down on her knees and promise that she would never see again a certain man whom she had met in the presence of her own sister, and with no hint whatever in the evidence that she had done anything wrong whatever. On the witness stand McDonagh testified that he had nothing against the girl, but that he had kidnaped her at the command of the “Reverend Father” Farrell, of Geesala, and, “You usually do what the priest asks you to do, whether it is right or wrong.” Of course, “Reverend Father” Farrell and “Reverend Father” Munnelly (which latter gent threatened this helpless young woman that if she did not make the promise demanded she would be in her coffin —at least so the girl testified) go scot free. It will be a great world when these crooks and murderers that “can do no wrong” get control, for a brief time, of the entire world. But what will then happen to Jehovah’s witnesses is as nothing to what will immediately thereafter happen to these wicked men. It is some satisfaction that even in the Irish Free State there is still some respect for law, and some fearless judges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Somme War Harvest 20 Years After</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The bodies of 768 British soldiers were found on the battlefields of France last year —679 on the Somme. In 189 cases the bodies were identified. In the same period the French official search parties found and reburied the bodies of 231 French and 483 German soliders.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom of the Press</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Herr Hitler, not content with having the German press under his control, wants to extend his power over the press of other countries, especially over that of Brit</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ain. He wants to stop criticism of his acts, and of the German policies, by making sueh criticisms a diplomatic matter. But he wants something he will not get. Mr. Ormsby-Gore, secretary for the colonies, says of this, “The idea of government control of the Press is repulsive to British tradition.” The King-Hall News letter, usually well informed, says of this, “The German chancellor complained about the British Press, in an interview with the British ambassador, and [I believe] also indicated that ‘colonies’ was not a subject on which compromise was possible. Incredible as it may seem to Anglo-Saxon minds, there are <sub>#</sub> people in responsible positions in Germany who imagine that a British Government would, or could, try to monkey about with the freedom of the press.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gambling in Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The author of a recently published book, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Problem of Gambling,</span><span class="font8"> computes the gross turnover of gambling in Britain at £350,000,000 per year, and says that about nine million persons participate in football pools. The gambling spirit is pervading all classes, the wealthy lose their money in horse racing, those with less to spare lose it in dog racing, in football pools, and in gaming machines, and other forms of gambling. It is said that 80 percent of the first offenders charged with petty embezzlement or the wrong use of money are tempted through gambling losses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vatican Represented at Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For the first time in history the Vatican has a representative at the Court of St. James whose wages will be paid by the United States Government. The Vatican representative is Joseph P. Kennedy, born in Ireland, married in the presence of Cardinal O’Connell, and taught in a parochial school. His wife also was educated in a parochial school. Three of his nine children are graduates of convents. It is felt that the Vatican made a big hit in insisting that Mr. Kennedy, close friend and adviser to President Roosevelt, be appointed U. S. minister to Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scotland’s Black Spots</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font8"> recently published book, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Scotland at the Crossroads,</span><span class="font8"> gives an account of some of Scotland’s black spots. Glasgow figures reveal a severe situation: its poor-relief burden is the heaviest in the kingdom. In 1936 one in every seven of the whole population was in receipt of public assistance in one form or another. In March last year the numbers in Scotland who were getting poor-relief were as high as 337,915.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> Bar </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Breaks Out</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“When war breaks out you submit the fate of nations to the stupidity of second-class brains. You hand it all over, the future of everything, to little people. You deify them, and make them demigods. You, the Press, and I, the premier, all of us, conspire to magnify and glorify. The nation must have confidence, you see. Then, when it is all over, you realize what the whole world should realize: that really the idols were all a lot of little people who quarreled, and were usually wrong.”— David Lloyd George, in an interview in southern Morocco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lying All the Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Mussolini is still leading us up the garden path. Not a word he says can we believe, and he will cheat Mr. Chamberlain yet. I think Mr. Chamberlain has a subconscious sympathy with Fascist governments in other parts of the world. I think he is that sort of man. Mussolini has been lying all the time. That is Fascism, which believes in lying as a deliberate instrument of safe policy.”—Herbert Morrison, British M.P., in an address at Crewe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Domestic Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Domestic service is not now considered the almost necessary opening in life for your girls: there is something more attractive to them in the many occupations which the lighter trades of recent years have developed. Nor will they submit to the slavery conditions which were, and are yet, demanded by some households. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span><span class="font8"> says that about 25,000 housewives have found it impossible to obtain a domestic servant in Great Britain. Last year the number of foreign servants working in this country was doubled. Most foreign girls who have entered domestic service in this country during the past few years are Austrians and Germans.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark207"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark208"></a>Boating Scene—Cover Design for This Number</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE </span><span class="font8">cover illustrates one of the many forms that floating vessels have taken in the course of the centuries. Designed primarily to carry man and his wares across streams and lakes, they also came to serve the purpose of traveling long distances with a minimum of effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first boat mentioned in the Scriptures is the ark. Not only did Jehovah direct Noah in building it, but He must have preserved it in the swirling waters that swept the earth from pole to equator in the flood. Probably there were boats of a kind in existence before that time, but if such was the case they were of a type that could not withstand the tremendous currents that undoubtedly were a feature of the great deluge. Noah's ark must have seemed a monstrosity to the people of that time, who made fun of Noah’s warning and perished because of their wickedness and unbelief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The next ark mentioned in Scripture, and also designed to float, was the diminutive boat which Jochebed fashioned of bulrushes to save her goodly son from the fate to which all the baby boys were assigned by the cruel Pharaoh .of the oppression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The way of a ship in the midst of the sea was as great a mystery to the writer of Proverbs as was the way of a man with a maid. (Proverbs 30:18,19) The first mystery has been solved by now, but the second phenomenon still remains as much as ever a mystery. But this piece is about boats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The ancients considered their ships quite as gallant as do moderns their graceful yachts,. (Isaiah 33; 21) When Jonah wanted to escape from carrying out an unpleasant job (unpleasant to him), he took ship for Tarshish, and seemed quite comfortable even in the midst of an exceptionally severe storm. The ship must have been well built and of ample proportions. (Jonah 1:3) King Solomon had a navy of ships, which served as a sort of “merchant marine” for Israel, bringing costly wares from distant lands.-l Kings 9:26-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus made use of ships in His day to go from place to place, and on one occasion talked to a large number of people from a boat and rewarded the owners for the loan of it with a large draught of fishes.—Luke 5: 3-11.</span></p>

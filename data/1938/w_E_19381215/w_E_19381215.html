<p><span class="font6">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT JESUS was'made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall live on earth forever.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark11"></a>SALVATION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah.&quot;—Ps. 3:8, American Revised Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH has made provision for the salvation of human souls. It necessarily follows that there is no other means of salvation. No one could deny that Jehovah has the power to ultimately save every creature, but there is not the slightest bit of Scriptural evidence that he will do so. Jehovah does not force salvation upon any creature against his will, but, on the contrary, every human creature that obtains salvation must ask for it and fully agree to the terms which Jehovah has made for his salvation, and must perform those terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">* The provision which Jehovah has made for the salvation of man, and which provision he has made known through his Word, is by and through Christ Jesus, and therefore he has caused to be written in his Word concerning Christ Jesus: “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12) Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s executive officer and the one to carry out and who does carry out Jehovah’s purpose. For that purpose God has committed into the hands of Christ Jesus all power in heaven and in earth.—Matt. 28:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>8</sup> Although Jehovah has made provision for the salvation of human souls, the salvation of such is not his primary purpose. The purpose of Jehovah is the vindication of his name. The salvation of imperfect human creatures is incidental to the vindication of his name. The primary purpose of God he will carry out, because he has so declared, and likewise he will carry out the secondary purpose toward those who conform themselves to his fixed rules. God is no respecter of persons, and each and every one who receives salvation must perform the rules as fixed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">RANSOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Is the theory or doctrine frequently advanced, to wit, that the ransom sacrifice furnished by the death of the man Jesus guarantees that all human creatures shall ultimately receive the benefit thereof, is that the correct Scriptural conclusion or not? The conclusion is not supported by any Scripture, and is therefore unreasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">•Does the ransom sacrifice furnished by Jesus require or guarantee the awakening out of death and the giving of an opportunity for salvation to all those human creatures who have spurned or opposed the kingdom of God and who have then died? and must they be brought back from the grave during the thousand-year reign of Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>8</sup> Does the ransom sacrifice guarantee the awakening of Adam out of death and the granting to him of a trial for everlasting life? The answer to both of these questions must be in the negative. If the Scriptures fully support the answer, then we may know that the answer is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">’ To ransom or redeem means “to purchase one under disability and to relieve such a one from that disability, and to regain possession by the one who does the purchasing”. As to Adam, God created him perfect and informed him what he must do and what he must not do. Adam was permitted to intelligently make his choice to obey God and remain alive, or to join the rebel Satan and receive the consequence of death. Adam chose the latter. “Adam was not deceived.” (1 Tim. 2:14) He had full information from God as to the penalty for the violation of God’s law. He was justly sentenced to death. To purchase, ransom, or redeem Adam and give him another trial would mean to give him a second chance; which is both unreasonable and unscriptural. For God to permit Jesus to ransom or redeem Adam and to put him on trial for life would also mean to give Adam a second chance; and in either instance God would be denying the justice of his own act or judgment in sentencing Adam to death. God does not change. —Mal. 3:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">•As to Adam’s offspring, the situation is entirely different. All of his offspring were born imperfect and sinners, and such condition came upon them without their knowledge or consent. They were born under condemnation, and, being thus in bondage because of inherited sin, they had no possible way of helping themselves and relieving themselves of that disability. Within a short time each individual must go into destruction, because no imperfect thing can be granted life everlasting. They were subject, however, to purchase, to be ransomed or redeemed by another, if God should make a provision for them to that end. God has made all necessary provision for their purchasing and redemption and has fixed the rules to be met</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">by each individual in order that he might be relieved from the bondage of sin and have the opportunity for salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">• It was the disobedience of Adam the perfect that brought death upon all of his offspring. God’s provision is that the willing obedience of the perfect Man unto death would furnish the price to purchase, ransom, or redeem sinful men made so by inheritance, and to carry out His purpose God sent his beloved Son to earth and made him in the form or likeness of sinful men that he might possess the necessary qualifications to purchase Adam’s offspring by his own lifeblood. (Heb. 2:9) Jesus was made a human creature of flesh and blood, dwelt amongst men, and was put to death.—John 1:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>10</sup> Adam by reason of willful sin forfeited all right to life. The perfect Adam was endowed by Jehovah with perfect life and the right thereto and was given power to transmit perfect life to his offspring, but by reason of Adam’s sin and his sentence to death all of Adam’s offspring lost the right to life and must in due time perish. Consistently God did have mercy upon Adam’s offspring, and He unselfishly arranged for such offspring to have an opportunity for salvation, and this is what God did, to wit: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.” (John 3:16-21) This Scriptural proof lays down the well-defined rule that the conditions precedent are required to be met by all who would be saved by receiving the benefit of the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus, and that which is here emphasized is that the creature must believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Believe what? That the Almighty God is Jehovah and that he sent Jesus to ransom or redeem man and that Jesus died that by his lifeblood he might become the purchaser and therefore the owner of mankind. Suppose a man is not pleased to believe these important truths. Does the ransom sacrifice inure to his benefit automatically ? Certainly not, because the foregoing recorded words of God are, “He that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.” No man is compelled to believe, but God affords those who desire to live the opportunity to believe and obey.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>11</sup> When the man Jesus died on the tree as though he was a sinner, his lifeblood there given up was the price which God required as the purchase price for sinful man. God then raised Christ Jesus out of death, not as a man, but as a spirit creature. Jesus had not forfeited his right to human life by dying upon the tree as though he was a sinner. When raised from the dead and exalted to heaven, he returned the right to human life and presented to Jehovah the value of that perfect human life as the price for the right to life and all rights incident thereto which man had lost. Jesus then and there became the owner of mankind and was clothed by Jehovah with full power and authority to give everlasting life to everyone of the race who complies with the divine rules. Certainly that does not mean that he would give life to anyone of Adam’s race or offspring that would not willingly comply with the divine rules. Every person is born imperfect, and therefore a sinner, and for that reason under condemnation, and sueh condemnation would in due time mean destruction. There is just one way to get from under that condemnation, and that is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as above stated in the scripture. This is fully supported by the following scripture, to wit: “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” (John 3:36) The conclusion stated in brief, then, is that all men by inheritance are under condemnation and that condemnation abides upon all who do not avail themselves of the opportunity to comply with the divinely fixed rules.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSECRATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>12</sup> No man can receive the benefit of the ransom sacrifice unless he desires and asks for it and then complies with the rules, and this he docs by making an unconditional consecration to do the will of God, which means he must obey the commandments of the Lord. God informs man that His gift to man is life everlasting administered by and through Christ Jesus. (Rom. 6:23) It is also written that Jesus Christ is “the Everlasting Father” (Isa. 9:6), which means that he is the giver of life everlasting to those who receive that gift. It is impossible for anyone to receive a gift unless that one is willing to receive it. If a man really desires a thing, he has sufficient interest therein to ask for it; and a complete illustration thereof is found in the following Scriptural account, to wit: Joseph, who was made the ruler of Egypt, was a type of Christ Jesus. Joseph had in his possession and under his control all the breadstuff of the land, and without that food the people must die by reason of the famine in the land. Those who knew this and desired to live approached Joseph and asked him to purchase them; as it is written: “Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh; and give us seed, that we may live and not die, that the land be not desolate.” (Gen.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">47:19) To this Joseph replied to the people, “Bbhold, I have bought you this day.” (Vs. 23) Likewise Jesus Christ has furnished the purchase price for all of Adam’s offspring, and in his hand he holds the power to grant them life, and without him no man could live, but ultimately must perish. The foregoing picture concerning Joseph was written for the purpose of illustrating this point. The picture shows men, therefore, coming to Jesus and in effect saying to him, ‘We believe that you are the Savior of men, and we ask you to buy us and give us the bread of life that we may live.’ Joseph did not buy everyone in Egypt ■whether he wanted to be bought or not. Likewise Jesus does not buy everyone whether he wishes to be bought or not, but he buys those who come to him and ask to be bought. It is therefore specifically written concerning those who are received by him and begotten of the spirit, “Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price.”—1 Cor. 6:19, 20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>13</sup> “Consecration” means to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as the Savior of men, and the unconditional and voluntary agreement to do and to perform the •will or commandments of God and of his beloved Son, who executes Jehovah’s purpose. “Sanctification” not only means to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as the Son of God, but also means to set oneself to the task of serving the Lord as his willing servant. Having thus agreed to do the Lord’s will, then the man must perform that agreement faithfully. That much is required of everyone who becomes a member of the body of Christ or royal house and who will get life everlasting as a spirit creature and who will be associated with Christ Jesus in his kingdom. Consecration, sanctification and obedience, therefore, are required of everyone who receives fully the benefit of the ransom sacrifice. Concerning those who shall share with Christ Jesus in his kingdom, it is written: “God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth.” (2 Thess. 2:13) This rule requires that everyone who becomes a member of the royal house in heaven not only must believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the Savior of man, but must prove that belief by completely setting himself to the task of doing God’s will and therefore following faithfully the lead of Jesus Christ, who always is in full obedience to and in harmony with the truth.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>14</sup> The divine requirement, made so by the fixed and unchangeable rules of the Lord, is that, when one learns of and believes that Christ Jesus is the Savior of men, if he would receive the benefit of the ransom sacrifice he must turn away from the wickedness of this world, seek the Lord, ask for and take advantage of the benefit of the ransom sacrifice. This is God’s provided means of salvation, and there is no other way that salvation can be received.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>18</sup> The same rule of faith, consecration and sanctification applied to the men of old named specifically at the eleventh chapter of Hebrews. All of them had and exercised faith in God and believed his promise that in the far-distant future he would set up a righteous government for the benefit of human creatures. Believing such, they set themselves fully to the task of rendering obedience unto God, and by their faithful course of action they ‘declared plainly that they were seeking the kingdom’. Because of the course of action taken by them they were subjected to all manner of persecution at the hands of God’s enemy; but they were firm and steadfast, refusing to be shaken away from their devotion to Jehovah. They died in faith and faithful to the Lord. When the time comes that they are brought forth from the grave, they will quickly and joyfully accept and receive the full benefit of the ransom sacrifice.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">GREAT MULTITUDE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>18</sup> The same rule of the Lord God likewise requires that all those who will compose the “great multitude” (Rev. 7: 9-17) must believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, that he is the Savior of obedient men, that by his own precious blood he furnished the price for the purchase of men and all their rights as men, including the right to perfect life, and then they must prove that belief by consecrating themselves to do what God’s Word requires and must set themselves to the task of faithfully performing the will of God as agreed upon. The Jonadabs now must have this information and follow it. They must learn that consecration and sanctification are required of each one who shall become a part of the great multitude and live on earth and carry into effect the divine mandate to multiply and fill the earth with a righteous people.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>17</sup> Everyone who receives the benefit of the ransom sacrifice and who obtains salvation must therefore perform the conditions precedent as named by the Scriptures: to believe, have faith, make a consecration, and set himself to the task of full obedience to the will of God and then faithfully carry out his agreement. Such must become the voluntary servants of the Lord. The requirements, therefore, of those who shall have a heavenly inheritance and those who shall be on the earth are likewise similar and require full obedience to the Lord. Note these words of Christ Jesus: “And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.” (Mark 10: 44, 45) While this text was addressed specifically to those whose hopes are heavenly, the same rule applies to those who get life on earth and shows that the ransom inures to the benefit, not of everyone, but to those who comply with the rules. The text, therefore, means that Jesus Christ is the Ransomer for as many as ask and seek and comply with the divine rules governing salvation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SNARE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>18</sup> Since the fall of man religion has been practiced by men. For centuries there have been, and there still are, numerous religions practiced by men, and the purpose announced by religionists is that such is for the saving of souls. The people are led to believe that salvation may be had by embracing some one of such religions. The fear of disaster to them and of the loss of life and all other blessings and of being sent to a place of conscious torture has put fear into the minds of men, and they have been induced to embrace and practice some kind of religion, believing that by so doing they may obtain salvation. All religions are the invention of the Devil, who puts fear into the mind of men and who induces people to embrace and practice religion; and, so doing, being induced by fear, they are led into the enemy’s snare and are kept away from God. Jehovah chose the people of Israel as for himself and led them out of Egypt, and he took them on a long journey to the land of Canaan. The people who resided in the land of Canaan before the coming of Israel practiced the Devil religion, and against such religion Jehovah specifically warned the Israelites. God commanded the Israelites to drive out those practitioners of religion and to destroy them, and that they should make no alliance with such people. The instruction that God gave through Moses to the Israelites was specifically for the benefit of all those who agree to do the will of Jehovah God after the coming of Christ Jesus and the providing of the ransom price. The instruction of Jehovah concerning such religionists Moses gave to Israel in these words: “And when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them. And thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.&quot;</span><span class="font7"> (Deut. 7:2,16) Here Jehovah specifically told the Israelites that religion would serve to ensnare or entrap them in the Devil’s trap. Graven images used by the Canaanites, and images like which are now used by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy religionists, also constitute a snare to the people, as God so declared in his Word: “The graven images of their gods shall ye bum with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.” (Vs. 25) The Lord specifically warned them against the snares of the Devil which he set for them by the means of religion. The Israelites broke their covenant with Jehovah, embraced and practiced the Devil religion, and they were quickly ensnared: “And an angel of the Lord came up from Gil gal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you. And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this? Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.”—Judg. 2:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>19</sup> The religion of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is truly a snare and a racket. By means of the Catholic religion millions have fallen into the Devil’s snare. The Catholic religion constitutes the greatest snare of all religions, because it is claimed to find support in the Scriptures and that the Catholic Hierarchy represents the Lord God, whereas the doctrines of that system are the precepts of men contrary to the Word of God. The Catholic religionists cause credulous people to draw near to God with their mouths, and that without any heart devotion to God or his Word of truth. “Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men.” (Isa. 29:13) They are thus ensnared and kept blind to God’s gracious purpose. That religion is a racket because millions of credulous persons are because of fear induced to give over their material substance to Catholic priests who falsely claim to be able to bring salvation to them and to their loved ones. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy claim that their chief mission is “the saving of souls” from purgatory or eternal torment, whereas they do exactly the contrary. No man can save a soul, because salvation is of Jehovah, whereas the Hierarchy teaches and practices that which is an abomination in the sight of God and which he declares is abominable. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy have taken out of the Scriptures a few texts here and there and associated such Scriptural texts with their own false teachings of men, and, using these and by putting the people in fear, they thereby ensnare millions of persons and cause them to fall away and be turned against God. Jehovah describes the true state and attitude of these religious leaders by causing them to utter the following words: “For we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood we have hid ourselves.” (Isa. 28:15) The mere fact that a man is sincere in his devotion to his religion, and believes that by following religious instructions given to him by his clergyman or priest he will be saved, is no evidence whatsoever that he is even approaching salvation, but, on the contrary, such person is being led directly into the Devil’s snare. Why are religion and religious practices detrimental to men? Because religion is based upon a false conception of God and of his provision for man, and because religion is the invention of Satan, God’s enemy, and intended by the enemy to mock God and to destroy men. It is a fraud and is deceptive because operated and carried on in the name of God and Christ, when in fact it is exactly opposed to Jehovah and his kingdom. It leads men into destruction. For these reasons the Lord Jesus says that Satan is a liar and murderer. That which is false cannot possibly sanctify one and enable such a one to walk in the paths of righteousness. All doctrines invented or promulgated by man that in any manner contradict the Word of God are false doctrines. The Catholic organization and its priests have no power whatsoever to save souls, and making the people believe that they possess such power is not only a falsehood but an abomination in God’s sight. The Catholic Hierarchy falsely claim to represent God and Christ. If they did represent God and Christ, then they would obey God’s commandments and teach his Word; but, on the contrary, like the Pharisees of old, they have made the Word of God of none effect by means of their tradition, exactly as Jesus told the Jewish clergy that they had done.—Matt. 15:1-9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW SANCTIFIED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>20</sup> When Jesus was about to be taken away and put to death he prayed to Jehovah in behalf of his faithful disciples, and, among other things, he said in that prayer: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” (John 17:17) Such is God’s means of sanctification. There is no other way of sanctification. Therefore the teaching of the doctrines of men accomplishes anything but sanctification. It is not possible for a man to walk in the way of righteousness without having a righteous guide. A perfect guide is necessary for man, because man is imperfect. Man cannot be properly guided by anything that is false. To be properly guided he must choose the way of truth and then follow in that way. When a man consecrates himself to God, he then truly says, as it is written: “I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.” (Ps. 119: 30) The true guide for man is the Word of God. “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” (Ps. 119:105) Having chosen the way of the truth, the man seeking salvation must continue to pray, as it is written: “Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.” (Ps. 25:5) Those who devote themselves to God have their pathway marked out for them in the proper way; as it is written: “All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.” (Ps. 25:10) When one walks in the way which God has marked out for obedient man, he is walking in the way of salvation. “For the word of the Lord is right; and all his works are done in truth.” (Ps. 33:4) The truth of God never fails. “For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever. Praise ye the Lord:” (Ps. 117: 2) What is the truth? Certainly not the opinions of man, when man is so imperfect and unable to save himself. Jesus answered the question when he said God’s Word is truth. (John 17:17) “Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.” (Ps. 119:142) The law of God is always true. Consequently the man who seeks the way to salvation must be governed by God’s law, and not by the teachings of men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>21</sup> That all men came into the world as sinners, being imperfect by reason of Adam’s sin, is made certain by the Scriptures. “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” (Rom. 5:12) All such are born iu sin and shapen in iniquity, and unwillingly so. “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.” (Ps. 51:5) All, therefore, are born in bondage to sin, which is certain to result in their destruction if they continue therein. How is it possible for anyone to get free ? Certainly not by following error and practicing religion. The fact that Jesus died to provide a redemptive price for the benefit of sinners does not automatically release men from the effects of sin. Something must be done by the creature before he can receive the benefit of the ransom sacrifice. One may say, “I believe in the Lord Jesus”; but that of itself is not sufficient. How, then, can he get free and walk in the way of salvation? Jesus gave the answer: “Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">continue</span><span class="font7"> in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the truth</span><span class="font7"> shall make you free.” (John 8:31,32) One who believes on the Lord must then study God’s Word of truth and deport himself according to that truth. The Bible, which contains God’s Word of truth, is provided for the benefit of men now on earth, and those who would receive salvation must study it and find out what is the will of God concerning them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>22</sup> The precious promises that guide men are contained in the Bible, but the Roman Catholic Hierarchy insist upon their teaching that the ordinary people whom they call “the children of the Catholic Church” should not have the Bible and should not attempt even to read it except by the guidance of the priest, but that the people should take what the priest teaches and obey the doctrines of the Catholic Church. What possibly could be the motive to so teach sincere people ? Manifestly to keep them in subjection to the Catholic organization that the Catholic Hierarchy might use their so-called “children of the church” to support them and to enable them to carry on their racket. That religious organization well knows that, when a sincere and honest person learns what is true in God’s Word concerning salvation, such sincere person will quickly abandon the Catholic organization and strive to follow in the way of the Lord, because he sees plainly that salvation cannot come from any creature or organization, but that all salvation is from Jehovah. The Catholic system of religion, therefore, is a deadly enemy of the people. Instead of taking the Word of God and instructing the people with it, the priests of the Catholic organization harangue the people and insist on their keeping away from the Bible. What, then, should the sincere Catholics or others do instead of obeying the priest and receiving his approval? The Scriptures answer: “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun profane and vain babblings; for they will increase unto more ungodliness.” (2 Tim. 2:15,16) No class of men have any authority to set up a system of religion and teach contrary to the Word of God and to induce people to believe that such a system of religion is a means of salvation. The one who is saved must devote himself to God and study God’s Word that he may receive God’s approval, and while so doing, as the foregoing scripture states, he must “shun . . . vain babblings”. Surely the repeating over and over again of some words addressed to a creature, or even to the Creator for that matter, is vain, and such, according to the Scriptures, is vain babbling and ‘increases unto more ungodliness’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>23</sup> A striking example of “vain babblings” is this one invented by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, namely, the credulous people are taught to pray by repeating over and over again words to this effect: “Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for me. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for me”; and with each utterance they are taught to fumble a string of beads called “the rosary”. Such a religious practice is entirely contrary to God’s Word and could not possibly receive God’s approval, but, on the contrary, he says that to him it is an abomination. The credulous Catholic child so praying thinks he is praying to a woman. For more than 1500 years sincere Catholic persons have been thus doing, addressing their prayer to Mary, the mother of Jesus. Did she ever hear the prayers of any such? and does she hear those prayers now and answer them? Certainly not; because she died more than eighteen hundred years ago and could not possibly be awakened out of death until the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple, in 1918. (1 Thess. 4:13-16; 2 Tim. 4:1) To be sure, Mary, the mother of Jesus, was devoted to Jehovah; but she was a human creature born imperfect and required the benefit of the ransom sacrifice for her salvation, and her resurrection must wait until Christ Jesus appeared and began his reign, as the Scriptures plainly so state. Surely, then, the prayers to Mary during the fifteen hundred years past have been entirely in vain and the poor people have been induced by the preachers to act in this erroneous way. Furthermore, God never authorized anyone aside from Jesus and himself to receive and answer prayers. There is no scripture that warrants one’s praying to Mary. To his disciples Jesus taught that they must pray to “thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do; for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking”. (Matt. 6:6,7) Seeing that the constant repetition even unto God is in vain, then certainly it is vain to repeat time and again words addressed to any creature, including Mary. As to the proper way to pray, Jesus gave this instruction: “After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in. heaven.” (Matt. 6:6-9) Does Jesus or Jehovah in any manner instruct men to pray to creatures or in the name of any creature aside from the name of the Lord Jesus? Certainly not, but, on the contrary, Jesus instructs as follows: “And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.” (John 14:13,14) Contrary to the instructions of Jehovah and Christ Jesus, the clergy turn the minds of the people away from God and to the creature, which causes them to worship and serve creatures rather than Jehovah ; as it is written: “Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.” (Rom. 1:25) Such is an abomination in the sight of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>24</sup> It may well be said that honest and sincere persons who by reason of the influence of the Catholic Hierarchy have been denied the Bible and kept in ignorance of the proper course to take are therefore not to be severely blamed because of their ignorance and their vain prayers and vain repetition; but when the truth is brought to the attention of such persons, then their responsibility is greater and continues to increase according to their knowledge. Religious teachings, that is, teachings promulgated by religious organizations, cannot be a guide to salvation, but, on the contrary, lead men into the snare of the Devil, and only the Lord’s truth can rescue them therefrom ; and as they come to a knowledge of what is in his Word, they must continue to inform themselves and walk in the way of righteousness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>25</sup> But how about one who has been in bondage to the religious organizations and who is later informed of the truth of God’s Word and learns that the only means of salvation is from Jehovah by and through Christ Jesus and his kingdom and who then resists or shuns the truth and opposes the kingdom of God under Christ and continues to tenaciously hold fast to the religious organization? While continuing in such a way, is it possible for him to find salvation? Will the ransom sacrifice operate beneficially toward such a person ? If this person dies while still in opposition to God’s kingdom under Christ, do the Scriptures show that he will be awakened out of death and be given an opportunity for the salvation of life during the reign of Christ? The proper answer to these questions must have the full support of the Scriptures. Therefore let the Scriptures speak.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>28</sup> There are said to be many millions of persons on earth who are adherents to the Catholic organization and who support the Hierarchy. At the present time Christ Jesus is judging the nations of the earth and is gathering unto himself his “other sheep” that shall comprise the “great multitude”. (John 10:16) No doubt many of such sincere persons are in the denominations of the Catholic organization, and some in other religious organizations. The truth is preached within the hearing of such as a witness, and they hear and believe, and those who do sincerely believe hasten to abandon the religious organization and to seek and to serve the Lord Jesus Christ, the King. Seeing the truth and observing those who are serving the truth, such persons do good unto the followers of Christ. What is the promise and hope of such ? Such is showing goodness unto Christ Jesus by doing good to his servants. Jesus says to those who thus show their devotion to him: “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. .. . These shall go . . . into life eternal.” (Matt. 25:34,46) But there are many others in these religious organizations who also hear the message of the kingdom, and, instead of receiving it joyfully, they spurn that message and hold steadfastly with the Catholic Hierarchy and join with the Hierarchy in indulging in the cruel persecution of Jehovah’s faithful people who are serving God and Christ. If those persecutors of the Lord die while in that condition of opposition, shall they be awakened out of death and avail themselves of the benefit of the ransom sacrifice? Jesus answers, “These shall go away into everlasting [cutting off </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott)</span><span class="font7"> ].” Addressing himself to them he says: “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.” (Matt. 25:41) There would seem to be no reason or Scriptural authority for saying that such will be awakened out of death.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>27</sup> Is it Scriptural to hold that one must be begotten of the spirit before he can be everlastingly destroyed in the “second death”, from which there is no resurrection? (Rev. 20:14; 21:8) One who willfully rejects the Lord and his kingdom and persecutes those who advertise God’s kingdom is certainly sinning against the light, because it is the spirit of God that causes the light to shine out that men may see the way to salvation. Such, therefore, is sinning against the spirit of God. Jesus says: ‘He who speaketh against the holy spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in the world to come.’ (Matt. 12:32) “For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins.” (Heb. 10:26) While this scripture applies specifically to those once in line for the kingdom, yet it announces the rule that applies to all, in harmony with the words of Jesus that he addresses to the “goats”. (Matt. 25:41) Without a question of doubt there are many among the clergy who profess to be the servants of God and Christ who have the Bible and claim to teach it, and who see, from the evidence that the Lord has brought to their attention, that the kingdom is now here, and yet those men, moved by selfishness, spurn the kingdom and the kingdom message and persecute those who bring the message to the people. They also use all their power and influence to prevent the people from hearing the truth of and concerning the kingdom. Certainly they are not ignorant. Their opposing the kingdom of God is not because of ignorance, but they are doing so willfully. They are far better informed than the Pharisees of old, and of necessity the Lord’s announced rule as against the Pharisees applies with equal strength to those modern-day clergymen above described; and concerning such the Lord Jesus says: “But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of hell?” (Matt. 23:13,15, 33) For such willful, deliberate opposers of the kingdom, is there any further benefit to be received by them from the ransom sacrifice? The Scriptural answer is No. God caused to be written concerning such willful sinners these words: “He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace ?”-Heb. 10: 28, 29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>28</sup> Not only have such willful sinners indulged in religious teachings and practices contrary to God’s Word, by which they have led numerous ones into the Devil’s snare, but they have also willfully caused millions of others to be ensnared by the Devil by preventing them from hearing the truth. There is a great crowd of persons who willfully support the religious leaders and join with those leaders in the opposition to the kingdom of God under Christ. If they should die in that condition, is there hope for them in the resurrection period? If awakened in the reign of Christ, is there any reason why they would avail themselves of the ransom sacrifice and obey the divine law ? It does not appear that they would. The present is a time parallel to or likened to the time of the deluge, and like conditions now obtain, and concerning which Jesus says: “And as it was in the days of Nc/e, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that No'e entered into the ark, and the flood came, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed </span><span class="font7">them all. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded.” (Luke 17:26-28) God’s Word does not hold out any hope of salvation to those religious leaders who willingly oppose his kingdom and his King, nor does it hold out hope for the adherents of those religious systems who likewise willfully oppose the kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">RESPONSIBILITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2#</sup> The present-day situation intensifies the responsibility resting upon those of the remnant and their companions, who have been enlightened by the truth and have undertaken to serve God and his King. The people who have long been held in bondage to religious traditions are in danger of certain destruction. It is the will of God that they shall be warned. Therefore God says to his covenant people: “Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, . . . that I am God.” (Isa. 43:10,12) Go, therefore, and tell the truth to the people about the kingdom, regardless of opposition. “Warn them from me.” “If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way [of wickedness], that . . . man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.” (Ezek. 33:7,8) Proclaiming this gospel of the kingdom is for a witness to the people of earth, and those to whom this gospel has been committed must be diligent in obeying the commandment to preach this gospel now. (Matt. 24:14) It will not do to wait until after Armageddon to give the warning, because then it will be too late. The “strange work” of the Lord must be completed before Armageddon, and that “strange work” is to proclaim the truth against all forms of religion, which are an abomination in the sight of God, and is to make known to the people that all salvation is of Jehovah through Christ Jesus his King.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PURPOSE OF SALVATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>80</sup> Jehovah has provided for the salvation of men, not merely for their benefit, but for his own name’s sake. His great name is involved because the enemy has challenged him to find men who would prove faithful to him under the test. If God would force salvation upon men or provide for their automatic salvation through the benefit of the ransom sacrifice, that would not sustain his good name, but it would be merely an exhibition of his power. God could have so made Adam that he could not sin; but He did not do that. He gave Adam a choice of obedience and life or lawlessness and death. Adam chose the latter, and died, and must remain in that condition. Could Jehovah God put on the earth men who under the test would remain true and faithful to him? That is the issue. Satan declared God could not do so. God will prove beyond all doubt that he can do so. He makes provision for Christ Jesus to buy mankind, and he offers men salvation, provided they will accept and conform themselves to his rules, and those who do comply with the divine rules shall live, because by so doing they prove their integrity toward God and magnify his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>81</sup> Faithful men from Abel to John maintained their integrity toward God and thereby proved Satan a liar; yet those men cannot receive life everlasting until first Jehovah builds up his capital organization. (Ileb. 11:39,40) Now God has builded up Zion (Ps. 102:16), and those of Zion who have proved themselves faithful have maintained their integrity toward God and proved his supremacy, and that proves Satan is a liar. Now the Lord is gathering unto himself his “other sheep” that will comprise the “great multitude”, and all of such that prove faithful and maintain their integrity will be a vindication of Jehovah’s name. That does not mean that all who are Jonadabs will prove faithful, but all who are ultimately of the “great multitude” must be faithful and shall maintain their integrity toward God, and, so doing, they will prove Satan a liar. It is that faithful great multitude to whom God will commit the great privilege of fulfilling his mandate to “multiply and fill the earth” (Gen. 1:28), and those who then compose the righteous people of the earth will receive the benefit of salvation, and they also will be a vindication of Jehovah’s name. All this work Jehovah does through his beloved Son Christ Jesus, who is his Vindicator. Therefore, as it is written, “Salvation be-longeth to Jehovah,” and not to any other. The man Jesus proved his integrity toward God and proved Satan is a liar. Jesus was subjected to the greatest opposition and suffered the ignominious death upon the tree that he might have pre-eminence in all things, and particularly in maintaining his integrity towards Jehovah. (Col. 1:18) Because of his wholehearted and complete obedience even to the ignominious death God raised Jesus out of death and gave him “a name which is above every name” and provided that Christ Jesus shall be honored above all others and next to Jehovah: “that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” (Phil. 2:10,11) The salvation which Jehovah has provided for human creatures is for his own glory, as above stated in the scripture, and therefore for his own name’s sake.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>32</sup> The perfect life of Jesus furnished the purchase price for humankind, and all of the human race that avail themselves of the benefit of that purchase price by asking for it and by then continuing to walk according to the rules of the Lord in sanctification and full obedience shall receive God’s precious gift, which is life everlasting administered by and through Christ Jesus. (Rom. 6: 23) All of such shall confess the name of and joyfully submit to Christ Jesus the King, whom Jehovah has made the Ruler over the earth. All of such shall be to the glory of Almighty God, proving to all creatures God’s supremacy and that his name alone is Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>33</sup> To offset the marvelous provision Jehovah has made for the vindication of his name and the salvation of men the Devil invents and puts into operation religion, by which means the religious practitioners claim that salvation comes to man by being religious. Religion turns the people away from God and dishonors his name. Such is the Devil’s purpose in his futile attempt to carry out his wicked challenge to Jehovah. Religion is the means of putting fear into men’s mind, and by this means millions of human creatures are led into the snare of Satan. Being there, they do not ask for the benefit of the ransom sacrifice, and there is no Scripture proof or other reason why they should ever be resurrected and receive the benefit thereof. The religionists have induced the people to believe that there is a race between God and the Devil as to which may obtain the greater number of souls or persons. There is no such rival race. God permits the Devil to put forth every effort at his command to gain his end, and the Devil fails, and this will be completely made known at Armageddon. God provides through Christ Jesus salvation for those who believe God and Christ Jesus as the Redeemer and Savior of men. When the whole matter is finished, all the wicked will have perished for ever and all who trust in God and in Christ and joyfully obey shall receive salvation in its fullness. Then every creature that breathes will be praising Jehovah the Almighty One.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark13"></a>RELIGIONISM</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">D</span><span class="font7">URING the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem after the seventy years of desolation of the land, a delegation of men representing the city of Bethel came up to Jerusalem to offer public prayer to be seen of men and to inquire about their self-imposed fasts and days of weeping and mourning over bygone events of Jewish history. At the time the prophet Zechariah was encouraging the work on the temple rather than taking time off to weep and howl and afflict himself over past events, thereby blinding oneself to the present great issue and to the Lord’s commandments and requirements of service at his temple. Hence the occasion became one for the giving of the divine expression on so vital a matter. Zechariah reports: “Then came the word of the Lord of hosts unto me, saying, Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted ana mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years [of captivity in Babylon], did ye at all fast unto me, even to me!” (7:4,5) Since Jehovah raises the question, certainly then they had not indulged in these self-imposed arrangements of men to glorify God or to remove the reproach that had come on his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s prophet then tells these self-constituted sanctimonious dreaming idolaters that when they did eat and drink in their time of prosperity they did it, not to use their strength in the service of the Lord, but for their own selfish benefit: “And when ye used to eat, and when ye used to drink, was it not of your own accord ye did eat, and of your own accord ye did drink? Should ye not [have been doing] the things which Jehovah had proclaimed by the hand of the former prophets, while yet Jerusalem was inhabited and in peace, with her cities round about her, and the South and the Lowland were inhabited?” —7: 6, 7, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prior to A.D. 1916 and the death that year of a leading servant of the Lord God those in a covenant with Jehovah to do his will were in a prosperous condition for that time. Their great adversity and captivity to Satan’s organization came in 1917 and 1918, amid the World War. Thereafter the dreamers, who are opposers, wept and howled, and still weep and howl, because, as they say, ‘the last will and testament of a dead man was not strictly followed,’ they assuming that any man could put a restriction upon God’s work. Jehovah by his prophet says to them that instead of being sticklers for adhering to the words and opinions of a deceased man they should study the prophecies, which were aforetime written for the comfort and aid and instruction of God’s people, and that they should feed upon these words of the Lord and be diligent to obey his commandments. The Lord caused the prophet Isaiah to write concerning the same class, at chapter fifty-eight, verses four and five, saying: “Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high. Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?” To this prophecy </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> called attention and urged upon the lukewarm and the weeping ones to awaken and become obedient to the commandments of the Lord. But they continue to go on in their own way and give no heed to the Word of God.—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> 1929, pages 131,147.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now the time has come to preach the truth and the remnant must give the strictest heed to all the commandments of the Lord. (Acts 3:22,23) If they will avert the great calamity of going into captivity to Satan’s organization and therefore falling at the battle of Armageddon, they must follow closely the Word of God as set forth by his prophets and which Word was written for the special aid and comfort of the Lord’s temple class, of which Christ Jesus is the Head and Chief Corner Stone. It behooves every one of the temple class to now walk circumspectly and render full obedience unto the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s covenant people are commissioned to declare the judgments previously written in his Word and to render justice unto others. As stated at chapter seven, verses eight and' nine: “And the word of the Lord came unto Zechariah, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother.” Those who have agreed to do the will of God are admonished that they should not show partiality or exalt the name of man. (Ps. 50:20; Luke 16:15) Every member of the body of Christ should show mercy and compassion to his brethren and to all those consecrated to God. This is what the Lord God requires. (Mic. 6:8) To take selfish advantage of a brother in the Lord is a very reprehensible thing in God’s sight. Zechariah 7:10 continues, saying: “And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.” Evil sutmising and evil speaking against a brother is a manifestation of the spirit of the class known as the “man of sin” and is evil against God’s anointed ones, and the practice of such will land the perpetrator of the wrong into the “evil servant” class. (1 Thess. 5:15) Those men who came from the city of Bethel to the temple builders had been fasting, not to the glory of the Lord, but for selfish reasons; and the admonition is for those who are now on earth and who claim to be followers of Christ Jesus to devote themselves, not to fasting, but to joyful service to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Israelites were stiff-necked and refused to obey; and they suffered therefor. Their course of action and punishment are noted as “ensamples” for our benefit, that we may take the proper course. Concerning this chapter seven, verse eleven, says: “But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.” Not only is this the history of 2,500 years ago, but it exactly fits what “Christendom” and the “evil servant” class are doing and have been doing since 1922. Many who claim to be God’s children, instead of willingly putting their shoulder to the wheel with others in exalting the name of Jehovah, have opposed the kingdom work and continue to oppose it, and to do so with strong words and acts. Verse twelve says: “Yea, they made their, hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the Lord of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets; therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of hosts.” They have closed their ears to the truth and set their hearts against the kingdom work. The wrath of God came upon Israel for their disobedience; and that foreshadows that in the battle of the great day of God Almighty a like punishment shall come upon the opposers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Christendom” would not hear during what is known as the “Elijah period” of the work of Jehovah's people, down till A.D. 1918, and still persists in stubbornness; and the “evil servant” class now make an alliance with others of Satan’s organization just as Judas Iscariot did, and put themselves in opposition to God’s kingdom, and when they cry to God he will not hear their cries. Verse thirteen of the prophecy declares: “Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the Lord of hosts.” Likewise Proverbs 1:20, 23, 24, 27-29 warns: “Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets. Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; when your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me fiarly, but they shall not find me: for that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah scattered the Israelites with great trouble by permitting them to be overthrown; concerning which Zechariah 7:14 says: “But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not: thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned; for they laid the pleasant land desolate.” This is typical of the “man of sin” class. Those who have been returned from Satan’s organization Babylon, and been enlightened and called to the kingdom and given the privilege of temple work, and who then willfully become lukewarm and disobedient, how much greater will be their punishment! (Rev. 3:14-18; 1 Pet. 4:17 ; 2 Pet. 2:12,13) Outward show for selfish reasons and hypocrisy will receive a just recompense at the hands of the Lord. Those who joyfully obey will receive the approval of the Lord.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark15"></a>PRIVI</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH told his faithful prophet Ezekiel how hypocritical religionists had defiled his name, and what should be their fate, to wit: “In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds [in my temple], and their post by my post, and the wall between me and them; they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.” (Ezek. 43:8) Today worldly rulers have made God’s sacred temple to appear as a common thing. Politicians, Big Business, and the clergy have used the name of Almighty God for their own wicked and selfish purposes. In Germany, for example, even as elsewhere, they have set up a state religion in the name of Almighty God, and have told the people that such state religion must be practiced by them. They have suppressed the truth and God’s witnesses in the truth. The subservient clergy in such lands, together with their allies, have held forth politics and what is called “patriotism” as the obligation which God has laid upon his people. Many of those would-be leaders have adopted their own abominable creation, the League of Nations, as a substitute for the kingdom of Almighty God, and have set that abominable thing in God’s holy place. Such defiling will no longer be possible under God’s arrangement. (Ezek. 45:1-6) Because of these detestable acts committed by “Christendom” Jehovah consumes them in his anger. The words (at Ezekiel 43:8) “I </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">have consumed</span><span class="font7"> them in mine anger” are prophetic words of what Jehovah will do in his slaughter at Armageddon to these defilers, just as he did to the ancient kings of typical Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah now in his temple says to Ezekiel, and therefore to the class whom Ezekiel represents: “Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.” (Ezek. 43:9) These words constitute a warning to God’s remnant now, and to everyone who has made an agreement or covenant to do Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark17"></a>LEGES</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">In the land of “Christendom”, and within the so-called “church” systems, there are those who have made an implied covenant with God and who think to make themselves acceptable by self-righteousness, and yet at the same time they sympathize and affiliate with, obey and even fight for the ruling factors of Satan’s organization, who are like dead carcasses. These must be put away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The purposes of Jehovah are symbolized in this visionary temple described by Ezekiel’s record. “Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.” (Ezek. 43:10) This is a commandment of the Almighty God to his faithful remnant to make known to all “Christendom” his purposes. This message must go to the “prisoner” class, and to the self-righteous, that they may have an opportunity to discern the difference between the holy and the unclean, and between God’s organization and his works and, on the other hand, the works and organization of Satan the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A knowledge of their real condition should make prospective members of the “great multitude” ashamed, repentant and eager to join God’s servants in acknowledging, honoring and obeying “the higher powers”, namely, Jehovah, the Most High God, and his King of kings, Christ Jesus. “And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws thereof; and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.” (Ezek. 43:11) This command applies to God’s remnant now. Great is their privilege to execute it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain, the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.” (Ezek. 43:12) The profane and unclean must keep away from the temple ground. The house of Jehovah is high up: “the mountain of Jehovah’s house.” (Isa. 2:2,3, A.E.V.) Thus the temple proper as seen in Ezekiel’s vision is built upon the third platform, the topmost above the ground that is outside of the wall of the outer court. The entire enclosure is on the top of the great mountain seen in vision by Ezekiel. (Ezek. 40:2) This shows that Jehovah’s royal house or temple class surmounts the mountain of God’s organization and is the capitol of that organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Jehovah’s temple envisioned by Ezekiel there was an altar. In the fulfillment of that prophetic vision the Lord Jesus Christ is the great sacrificing Priest, and his service is all-sufficient for the atonement of sin. The Lord’s remnant on earth are shown the measurements of the altar, that they may have an appreciation of what sacrifices they may offer. (1 Pet. 2:5) Revelation 11:1 states: “And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.” “And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The cubit is a cubit and an handbreadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the altar. And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth one cubit. So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and upward shall be four horns. And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof. And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long, and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs [the steps thereof (fi’.V.)] shall look toward the east.” (Ezek. 43:13-17) The hearth of the altar is foursquare. In offering the sacrifice the high priest ascends the altar steps with his face westward toward the door of the temple, moving in the same direction as the sun moves across the sky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The altar here described is different from the “altar of wood” situated in the holy of the temple. (Ezek. 41:22) Primarily the altar here represents the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus. The Lord Jesus stated that his blood is the blood of the New Covenant; therefore the altar must represent sacrificial privileges in connection with the New Covenant, which must be validated at Mount Zion with the blood of Christ Jesus. The faithful followers of Christ Jesus, and therefore members of the royal priesthood, officiate at this altar by reason of the fact that they are ‘made able ministers of the new covenant’. (2 Cor. 3:6) Jehovah selects those of the royal priesthood, and with that man has no deciding power whatsoever. “And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed [house] of Zadok, which approach [are near (R.V.)] unto me, to minister unto me, saith the Lord God, a young bullock for a sin offering.” (Ezek. 43:19) The heavenly priesthood will not be of the ancient priestly order of the house of Aaron. The clergy of “Christendom” will be no part thereof. Not even Christ Jesus selects these places for himself. “So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee. As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.” (Heb. 5:5,6) Jehovah decides the entire matter. AU of the royal priesthood are selected by Jehovah, and these are with Christ Jesus, the High Priest, at the inauguration of the New Covenant, at his coming to the temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As Christ Jesus approached to the inauguration of the New Covenant he approached Jehovah God on the basis of the merit of his own human sacrifice (this being pictured in Ezekiel’s vision of the temple by “a young bullock for a sin offering”), which sacrifice was made in behalf of the obedient ones of mankind. The underpriests, that is, the members of the body of Christ, accompany him at the inauguration of the New Covenant. Verses 20 and 21 of the prophecy (Ezekiel 43) picture the application of his merit in behalf of those of mankind that believe and obey. The true and meritorious ‘blood sprinkling’ took place at the making of the New Covenant nineteen hundred years ago; as it is written: “And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.” —Heb. 12:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to Ezekiel 43:22, the offering of the kid is not made at the same time as that of the bullock, but on the second day of the temple service: “And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.” The “kid of the goats” represents the members of the body of Christ, the underpriesthood, and this illustration shows that the sacrifice of the body by the Lord is only secondary in significance at the inauguration of and carrying into effect of the New Covenant. The body members have part in it by reason of the fact that they are part of the priesthood, but the real value is in Christ Jesus himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the temple service the burnt offering determines the acceptableness of the sin offering: “When thou hast made an end of cleansing [the altar], thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish. And thou shalt offer them before [Jehovah], and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto [Jehovah], Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the flock, without blemish.” (Ezek. 43:23-25) The offering of the bullock as a sin offering is followed by the burnt offering, which is evidence of God’s acceptance of the sin offering. From Pentecost until now God has been accepting those who will finally constitute members of the body of Christ, and who are pictured by the sin offering of the “kid of the goats”, which was offered on each day for seven days. “Seven days shall they purge [make atonement for] the altar, and purify it; and they shall consecrate themselves.” (Ezek. 43:26) The closing hours of the 'seventh day* are now here and the purging or atoning work will soon end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The end of the period of sacrifice of Christ Jesus and his body members will mark the end of the “seven days”. “And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord God.” (Ezek. 43:27) The “eighth day&quot; is the day or time following the period of sacrifice; hence it marks the beginning of the day of fulfilling of the divine mandate to “fill the earth” by the “great multitude” under the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ. Then the people will be calling on the name of Jehovah “to serve him with one consent”, and the royal priesthood will be serving for the reconciliation of the people with God. The work of reconciliation will continue during the millennial or thousandyear reign, and at the conclusion thereof “I will accept you, saith the Lord God”. That will mark the time when Christ Jesus turns over the kingdom to Jehovah.—1 Cor. 15:24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PHONOGRAPH HAS HELPED WONDERFULLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just a line to saj how wonderfully the phonograph work has helped me to fulfill my obligations to the Lord. It is just as if you were working with me, doing the hardest part. The abundant joy of Jehovah’s organization, after the deep poverty Buffered at Satan’s hands, is more than one can express in words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With much love and many thanks to the brethren for the provision of the phonograph,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your sister in Jehovah’s service,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S PRAISE SUNG WITH PHONOGRAPH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With echoes of the great international convention in London still ringing in our hearts to help us on our way, we returned last week to our corner of the field here in Paris. It would be impossible to attempt to pen my gratitude to Jehovah for all the good things received at his hand during that wonderful congress, and I can but say that every item on the program was a fresh thrill, not forgetting the wide work of preparation and advertising which took place beforehand in which every one of us had opportunity of taking part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a pretty tough job here in this city, in view of the language difficulty, and also the dreadful ‘ concierge ’ custom, etc.; out we came back with fresh determination to press on in this glorious fight. In the past it has been thought that Paris, with its huge blocks of flats, would be difficult to work with the phonograph on first calls, but the big convention gave us a spurt and we have found a way. We are not free to use the doorstep method with the phonograph as in England, because of the necessary continual dodging of these ‘concierge’ persons (who do not even stop at manhandling us if they feel so inclined) ; but, by using a tiny folding machine which can be got right into the homes of people, Jehovah’s praises are being sung in spite of our sparse knowledge of French, and many interesting experiences are coming our way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Everyone here is talking about the probability of war in a few days, and all sorts of preparations are being made. People are standing in groups in the streets conversing in anxious tones, and some of the women are in tears because their menfolks have been called up. But we rejoice as the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">great</span><span class="font6"> war (Armageddon) approaches, and we thank our Father for our little part in his great organization, in every privilege of daily going in service to him. May we continue to stand shoulder to shoulder in that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A German Jew who had been in a concentration camp said warmly that he thought Jehovah’s witnesses were the most courageous people on earth. We are joyful to share with our brethren throughout the world in the difficulties and joys in whatever is in Store for us. In our Father’s strength we can accomplish all things. With love and greetings from</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN INTEGRITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We, your brethren assembled in convention at Detroit, desire to express our gratitude and joy to Jehovah for the privilege of being his witnesses. We are glad to be colaborers with you in exposing the enemies of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the talks on Saturday and Sunday [September 10,11], we are more determined than ever to maintain our integrity to Jehovah and his kingdom. We will, by the Lord’s grace, show this by out increased activity in the Lord’s work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We send you our Christian love. May Jehovah continue to bless you and direct you in this day of battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“WATCHTOWER” CAMPAIGN</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Four full months of 1939, January to April inclusive, have been set aside for the biggest, if not most important, yet of the campaigns to publish Jehovah’s kingdom. It is designated the “Watchtower” campaign because of the special offer made, agreeable to arrangements of the Society, to wit, a full year’s subscription for the magazine </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> together with the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font6"> or any other one desired of the bound book series ajd a copy of the new booklet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font6"> on a contribution of but $1.00. This will be the offer in every language in which </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> appears; hence this four-month campaign will be both international and world-wide.

<p><span class="font4">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare Ids purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God's kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall live on earth forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“FAITHFUL AND TRUE”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ‘‘Faithful and True” testimony period will occupy the entire month of December 1 to 31. A most unusual offer will make this period an outstanding one and should make it a record month for placing the message in cloth binding, to wit, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> Book One, Book Two, and Book Three, will together be offered to the public on a contribution of but 35c. All kingdom publishers familiar with this marvelous exposition of the entire prophecy of Ezekiel know that they set forth repeatedly God’s great purpose: ‘‘And they shall know that I am Jehovah.” As an alternative the publishers may place the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font4"> and the new booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font4"> on a 25c contribution. At the least, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font4"> should be placed, on 5c. This campaign will require much preparation, of self and other related matters. Begin getting ready now. All new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">subscribers not yet associated with a local company should get in touch with this office. Let all promptly report their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUND CARS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Should Jehovah’s witnesses procure a license to operate a sound car where the ordinance requires such license! Yes; this is on the same principle as obtaining a license to operate an automobile. It is not asking for a license or permit to preach the gospel. A license to operate a sound car is in no wise contrary to God’s law. Where a sound car is to be used in the streets application should first be made to the police department and no doubt a permit or license will be issued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PORTABLE PHONOGRAPH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society now manufactures and has to offer a light-weight phonograph, being 14 by 13 by 5} inches in size, and covered with brown cloth and having rounded corners. It weighs 9 pounds 13 ounces. With three phonograph discs it can be carried with tone arm in position and weighs 12 pounds 6 ounces. It can, however, accommodate ten discs. Volume of sound is strong, and the tone is of the best quality. As shipped out from our factory, the phonograph is timed properly, at 78 r.p.m., and should be checked from time to time. This model, including three discs, is offered on a contribution of $10.00; without the three discs, $8.00. Remittances should accompany orders. Also specify the particular discs wanted.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark7"></a>RIGHTEOUS WORLD</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For behold me! creating new heavens and a netv earth, and the former shall not be mentioned, neither shall they come into mind.&quot;—Isa. 65:17, Rotherham, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH purposed to have a world that is wholly righteous, and his purpose shall be accomplished. The “world” consists of the heavens, invisible to human eyes, and the earth, which is visible to human eyes. Everything in that righteous world must be righteous and do that which is right to the praise of Jehovah. The apostle, with full faith in God and moved by the spirit of the Almighty, wrote: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“We, </span><span class="font5">according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Pet. 3: 13) Such new world, in the Scriptures, is designated “the world to come” and that is a “world without end”. (Heb. 2:5; 6:5; Eph. 3:21) The new heavens consist of Christ Jesus, the Head and Lord thereof, together with the members of his royal house, and also the angels of heaven, all being righteous and fully loyal to God and faithful in their devotion to him. The new earth will consist of righteous men who in times of old proved their integrity toward God and whom the Lord shall “make princes in all the earth”, which princes shall rule in righteousness under the direction of the righteous Lord (Ps. 45: 16; Isa. 32: 1); and also of the human creatures known as the “great multitude”, their offspring, and others who shall be made righteous. Every creature that will dwell for ever in the new earth must be righteous, and the righteous will never die. (Matt. 25: 46) In this present day the Lord of heaven and earth is gathering unto himself his “other sheep”, otherwise known as “Jonadabs”, and who will form the “great multitude” (Rev. 7: 9-15), and they and their faithful offspring will be a part of the “new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness”. Today the Jonadabs should be very diligent to gain a knowledge and understanding of Jehovah’s purpose and the manner or way in which he </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">building the new earth. With knowledge, and having a pure motive, they shall learn wisdom and gain understanding: “Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding: for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. Length of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">days is in </span><span class="font5">her right hand; and in her left hand riches </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; and happy is every one that retaineth her.”—Prov. 3: 13-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* To obtain life everlasting in that “world to come” everyone must have a knowledge of God and of Christ and follow a course in harmony with such knowledge. “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.”—John 17: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> What is here published is particularly for the aid of the Lord’s “other sheep”, the Jonadabs, in their efforts to ‘seek righteousness and meekness’. It is also to encourage and brighten the hope of the remnant. Like David and Jonathan, the remnant and the Jonadabs are close companions, joined together in love, and lovers of righteousness, and what helps one is a joy to the others. A brief view of the marvelous things God has done and is doing in the ‘creating of the new heavens and a new earth’ will certainly be beneficial to both the remnant and the “other sheep”. Jehovah says: “I am the Lord, I change not.” (Mal. 3: 6) Likewise the rules of Jehovah concerning his creatures are unchangeable. All creation of Jehovah God is perfect. (Deut. 32: 4) The first world consisted of the perfect heavens and of perfect man, and over that Lucifer was made overlord. When Lucifer rebelled he became Satan the Devil, the opposer of God and deceiver of men and angels, and thereafter angels and men that have yielded to that wicked one have constituted the “present evil world” (Gal. 1:4), which evil world shall be destroyed that the way for the world of righteousness may be made clear. “But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.” (2 Pet. 3: 7) Out from that evil world God will save such of the human race as will form the great multitude. What rule of God is unchangeable and will apply to every member of the great multitude? What will be required of each individual composing that multitude?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OBEDIENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* That one word answers the question. God’s instruction to his creatures concerning obedience cannot be too strongly emphasized. The law of Almighty God, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">339</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">which is made plain, without an exception demands that every creature that is given life eternal in the heavens or in the earth shall learn obedience to the Most High. It is therefore necessary that every creature who would live everlastingly should have a knowledge of what God requires, and which necessary knowledge can be had by man only by a careful study of the Scriptures. The Scriptures were written long ago for the instruction, learning and admonition of those creatures on the earth near the complete end of the “present evil world”, and those Scriptures now God is making clear to those who diligently seek righteousness. The evil world shall end at Armageddon; and Armageddon is near. From the Scriptures it appears that God, in the execution of his purpose toward his creatures, requires that everyone who receives his approval must be obedient to his commandment. There is no exception to this rule made in behalf of any creature. In the Word of God the obedient ones are strongly contrasted with the disobedient ones, that is, the one class is set in opposition over against the other class to show the difference between them and the result to each, and the record thereof is made to aid those who would find the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Disobedience of God’s commandment by Lucifer led to his downfall and will end in his complete annihilation. All creatures who take the way of Satan in disobedience shall likewise suffer destruction. Adam, the perfect man, willfully and knowingly took Satan’s side and walked in Satan’s way, and died, and it appears that for him there cannot be a resurrection. (1 Tim. 2: 14; Ps. 145: 20; Prov. 10: 7) All of the offspring of Adam were conceived in sin and bom in iniquity or unrighteousness, which conditions resulted to them by inheritance due to Adam’s sin. (Rom. 5:12) The result is that all men of the evil world ‘lie in the wicked one’, Satan the Devil, the god or invisible ruler of the present evil world. (1 John 5: 19, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dia-glott)</span><span class="font5"> God has provided one way, and only one, whereby men can escape condemnation and destruction, and that way is by faith in and obedience to God’s law and following in the appointed way to life, which comes to man by faith in the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus: “Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” (Acts 4: 12) Those who do not exercise such faith and obedience do not get out from under the condemnation: “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.”—John 3: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MEN OF INTEGRITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Obedience means to have knowledge of the will of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font5">and then to diligently do his will. Following the fall of man God announced his purpose to bring forth a seed, the Messiah, who would redeem or purchase mankind and then set up a government of righteousness and who, as God’s active representative, would minister life to the obedient ones of the race. The Devil denied God’s ability to do so and declared that all men would curse God if he, the Devil, were permitted to tempt them. That challenge put at issue the supremacy of God, and the challenge was accepted and the Devil permitted to put forth his best endeavors to prove his challenge; and his failure to so prove will show the Devil a liar and God the almighty One. The man who believes that God is the Supreme One, that he can accomplish his purpose according to his will, begins to have faith. (Heb. 11: 6) Abel, the shepherd son of Adam, was the first man to exercise such faith in God, and he obeyed God, and because of his faith and faithfulness to God Satan caused Abel to be murdered. At the eleventh chapter of Hebrews appear the names of faithful men who had faith in God and in his ability to carry out his announced purpose and who were diligent to obey God’s commandments. By faith they saw a time in the far-distant future when God would send his righteous One and set up a government of righteousness. They desired to live under that righteous government, ruled by the righteous One. They looked for the new heavens as their governing power. (Heb. 11: 14-16) In order to afford those men the opportunity to prove their integrity, and thus prove Satan a liar, God permitted the Devil to heap upon such men all manner of persecution and affliction. They were scourged, beaten and imprisoned by the Devil’s agents: “Women received their dead raised to life again; and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment: they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the world was not worthy;) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.”—Heb. 11: 35-38.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> What resulted and will be-the final result to such faithful men ? They maintained their integrity toward God and received God’s approval. They were witnesses to the name and supremacy of Jehovah, and they sealed their testimony with their own blood. They died in faith and faithful, and the final judgment concerning them God entered of record long ago, and which judgment is in their favor. (Heb. 11: 13, 39) By the terms of that judgment they shall have a resurrection and be made visible rulers in the new earth, and their rule will be in righteousness and justice. (Ps. 45: 16; Isa. 32: 1) Under the most adverse circumstances those men remained faithful and continuously obeyed God’s commandments, and God has made proof of and recorded his unchangeable rule that the faithful, obedient ones, which have his approval, shall live. The course of those men blazed the way that must be followed by others who find the way to and receive life everlasting.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MAN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Then came into the world Jesus, “THE MAN,” the only great and righteous man that ever lived. He was made flesh in the form and likeness of sinful men, yet himself was perfect, “holy, harmless, [and] undefiled.” (Heb. 7: 26) He came to earth that he might carry out the purpose of Jehovah his Father. Jesus came to tell the truth, and he told it. (John 18: 37) He received commandment of his Father, and he obeyed strictly and fully all commandments of God. He came to do the will of Jehovah God, and he did it. (John 6: 38) The day that Jesus began to declare God’s purpose the Devil sought to bring about the destruction of Jesus. (Matt. 4: 3-10) For more than three years Jesus went about amongst the people from place to place, declaring unto them the goodness and the purpose of God to set up a righteous government, to destroy the wicked, and to give life to the faithful, obedient ones. During all that time Jesus was subjected to all manner of cruel persecution, suffered bodily pain and mental distress, and in all of these he was obedient; and of him it is written that he was “a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief”. Facing such cruel persecution Jesus faithfully carried out his Father’s commandments, and when he had done he said to Jehovah: “I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.” (John 17: 4) Jesus was perfect; he was kind and generous; he did no harm to anyone, but always did that which was good, and spoke words of grace toward those who had a hearing ear. Why, then, was he subjected to such great suffering? and why did God permit it? The Devil persecuted and tried to kill Jesus in order to sustain his own side of his wicked challenge made to Jehovah. God permitted the Devil to go the limit, that the Devil might prove himself a liar. Jesus maintained his integrity toward Jehovah at all times.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">•What good resulted to Jesus from such suffering? He learned obedience by the things that he suffered. It was necessary for him to be obedient to God’s commandment, regardless of all persecution and opposition, and such was necessary in order that he might maintain his integrity; and this he did, and concerning him it is written: “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.” (Heb. 5: 8, 9) Thus is God’s unchangeable rule again proved: that obedience is absolutely essential on the part of everyone that lives, and that God rewards the faithfully obedient ones. Such obedient ones do not seek the approval of men, but they do faithfully perform assigned duties as servants of Jehovah God. This Jesus did at all times. He sought only the approval of his Father, and Jehovah rewarded him above all other creatures of the universe. “And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should 1 v, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” (Phil. 2: 8-11) Jesus loved righteousness and hated lawlessness, and at all times he went straight forward in obedience to God’s law of righteousness: “Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness; therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”—Ps. 45: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR JEHOVAH’S NAME</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Majestically and mysteriously Jehovah moved to vindicate his name. His beloved Son, Christ Jesus, is his Vindicator and his Chief Witness. One title he now bears is “The Faithful and True Witness”. (Rev 3: 14) With Jesus Jehovah begins the creation of the new heavens and proceeds to the building of his capital organization; and to Christ Jesus, the Head thereof, he commits all power and supervision over his universal organization. The exalted Jesus is made the Head of that capital organization and is clothed with all power in heaven and earth. (Matt. 28: 18) God gave to Jesus twelve disciples, eleven of whom maintained their integrity even unto death and are made a part of the new heavens. They, like Christ Jesus, were true witnesses to the name of Jehovah, and it was necessary for them to prove their faithfulness and to maintain their integrity under severe test. Upon those faithful disciples the Devil heaped all manner of persecution because they told the truth. In obedience to God’s commandments they proclaimed the truth without compromise. The Devil’s agents, in order to turn men away from God, falsely claimed that Christ Jesus builds his church on Peter, a man, but Peter flatly denies such claim. Peter testified and recorded his testimony that Christ Jesus is the foundation stone, upon which He builds his organization. Peter and his associated apostles proclaimed the truth before the public, and when the religionists demanded to know by what authority those disciples did their good work, Peter answered them and said: “By the name of Jesus Christ . . . whom ye crucified, . . . This is the stone which was set at nought [by] you builders, which [has] become the head of the corner.” (Acts 4: 10, 11) The faithful disciples made it known that the true followers of Christ Jesus must and will obey God, and not man: “But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.” (Acts 4: ID) “We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5: 29) They magnified the necessity and importance of obedience to God, and they suffered great persecution at the hands of the enemy for so doing. Obedience to God always brings upon the obedient ones suffering and affliction heaped upon them by Satan and his agents, which affliction and suffering has afforded Satan the opportunity to endeavor to carry out his challenge and also affords the followers of Christ Jesus the opportunity of proving their integrity toward God. Faithfully obeying his commandments, and bearing testimony to the name of Jehovah amidst all manner of persecution even unto death, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">proves </span><span class="font5">that Satan is a liar, and is in vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Proceeding with the creation of the new heavens, God takes out from amongst men 144,000 redeemed men, who prove their integrity toward him, and such faithful men he makes a part of Zion, his capital organization. (Rev. 14: 1-4) The faithful apostles are the first ones added after Jesus. From the time of Pentecost until the coming of Christ Jesus in glory and power others are taken out from the world. Every one of those thus taken out, and who maintain their integrity, must suffer persecution and learn obedience in the face of all such suffering and persecution; as it is written of them: “For even hereunto were ye called; because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” (1 Pet. 2: 21) These faithful and obedient ones are selected from amongst men, taken out from the world and gathered to the Lord to be made witnesses to the name of Jehovah God. (Acts 15: 14) They must bear testimony to the truth of and concerning God and his kingdom. Jesus said of himself that he came into the world to bear witness unto the truth, and everyone that is of the truth, that is, that gives heed and obeys, hears his voice and follows in his steps. (John 18: 37) As Christ Jesus is the Chief and Foundation Stone of the capital organization, the new heavens, so all the members thereof, as “living stones”, are built up into that spiritual house that they may perform an acceptable </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">service </span><span class="font5">unto God and Christ. (1 Pet. 2: 3-8) All such must be made to conform to the Head, Christ Jesus. (Rom. 8: 29) All must suffer at the hands of the Devil, even as Jesus suffered, and all must learn obedience </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and be </span><span class="font5">obedient and faithful unto God and Christ under such conditions. (John 15: 19, 20) Christ Jesus is the great Prophet, foreshadowed by Moses, and he gives commandments in harmony with the will of his Father Jehovah, and every one of his followers called out of the world who fails or refuses to be fully obe</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">dient </span><span class="font5">to the commandments of the Lord must suffer destruction. (Acts 3: 23) Obedience is not discretionary, but is mandatory. This rule applies to all crea</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">tures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> The call of men and their selection for a place in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the new </span><span class="font5">heavens continues until the required number </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">complete. To Israel, the typical people of God, he </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">said: “If ye </span><span class="font5">will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">above </span><span class="font5">all people: for all the earth is mine. And ye shall </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">unto </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">me a </span><span class="font5">kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(Ex. 19: 5, 6) </span><span class="font5">Israel, the typical people of God, failed of keeping their covenant, because they were disobedient. Instead of obeying God’s commandments they turned to religion and followed the inventions of the Devil. A few individuals of that nation did obey, and to them was given the privilege of becoming a part of the new heavens. Those faithful individuals and others thereafter taken out from amongst men, and who prove their integrity toward God by faithful obedience, do become a peculiar treasure unto the Lord, and to such these words written in the Scriptures are addressed: “Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.” (1 Pet. 2:9) It is observed that these are called forth to show forth praises of Jehovah, and not the praises of any man, and all such must be obedient to the commandments of the Lord, and therefore must bear witness to the name of Jehovah and to his kingdom, and proclaim his name and sing his praises throughout the earth. (Isa. 43: 10-12) This they must do particularly just preceding the exercise of Jehovah’s supreme power at Armageddon.—Ex. 9: 16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">KING ENTHRONED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> The time arrived for Jehovah to place his King, Christ Jesus, upon the throne, that is to say, in the place to rule the world. Until the time for the coming of that great event Christ Jesus must wait and did wait until A.D. 1914, which was God’s due time to enthrone him and send him forth to rule. (Ps. 110:1, 2) He then enthroned, his rule began while the enemy, the Devil, still had access to heaven. Concerning the Lord it is written: “Thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry.” (Rev. 11: 17, 18) All nations under Satan were made angry by reason of Satan’s power and influence, and that anger began to be expressed by the nations, particularly of so-called “Christendom”, in the year 1914. Immediately following the enthronement of Christ Jesus there was a war in heaven between Christ and the Devil, concerning which it is written: “And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world; he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.” (Rev. 12: 7-9) There the old heavens were cleared out and came to a final end, and the newly created heavens came into power.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ZION BUILDED UP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Christ Jesus, having completed the work of preparing the way before Jehovah, straightway appeared at the temple of God (Mal. 3: 1); concerning which it is also written: “And the temple of God was opened in heaven.” (Rev. 11: 19) The temple of God consists of the faithful obedient ones who, as followers in the footsteps of Jesus, maintain their integrity and faithfulness even unto death and who are made a part of the new heavens. “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you ?” (1 Cor. 3: 16; 2 Cor. 6: 16) The appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ at the temple is the signal or time for the awakening to life of the faithful apostles and others who like those faithful apostles maintained their integrity and died faithful, having been witnesses to the name of Jehovah God and to his kingdom. (2 Tim. 4: 7, 8) The coming of Christ Jesus to the temple marks the beginning of judgment at the house of God. (1 Pet. 4: 17) That judgment is a searching test applied to all who have agreed to do the will of God, and the disobedient ones, being judged adversely, are put away and become the “evil servant”. (Matt. 24: 48-51) Those coming through the fiery test because of their faithful obedience receive the Lord’s approval and are brought into the temple and instructed and commissioned, and are qualified to offer unto God an “offering in righteousness”, which offering consists of their faithful testimony to Jehovah’s name and the singing of his praises and declaring his kingdom. (Mal. 3: 3; Heb. 13: 15) Those faithful creatures remaining on the earth and who receive a favorable judgment, are designated “the remnant of her [ God’s organization’s] seed”. (Rev. 12: 17) Such are commissioned and commanded to go out into the world and give testimonj- to the name of Jehovah and to tell the people of and concerning God’s kingdom as the only hope of mankind and which will vindicate his name. To those of the remnant the Lord gives this command: ‘This good news of the kingdom must be proclaimed as a witness before the final end of Satan’s organization.’ (Matt. 24: 14) Because these faithful men and women bear testimony in obedience to the Lord’s commandments the Devil and his agents attempt to destroy them. (Rev. 12: 17) To prove their integrity they must be obedient to God and to Christ and they must go forward and give testimony as commanded and do so without fear of man or devil, fearing only that they might fail of receiving the approval of God. Like the faithful apostles, they must obey God, and not men. (Matt. 10: 27, 28) It is to these faithful ones the promise is given (Rev. 2: 10), “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> The work of Jehovah and Christ Jesus progresses. The faithful followers of Christ Jesus who died having been raised out of death, and a sufficient number on the earth approved to make up the 144,000; these gathered unto the Lord, Zi’on, the capital organization of Jehovah, is builded up: “When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.” (Ps. 102: 16) All of Zion behold the glory of God, and they proclaim the praises of his name, and not the praises of crea</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">tures. </span><span class="font5">They do not sing the praises of men or any man, or themselves seek the honor of men, because they know that their privilege and duty is to show forth the praises of Jehovah God. (1 Pet. 2: 9) “In his temple doth every one speak of his glory.” (Ps. 29: 9) This the temple members do by obeying the Lord’s commandment to serve as his witnesses, to magnify his name and to inform the people that all who would find the way to life must faithfully serve God and Christ Jesus. Satan and his angels no more have access to the heavens, they having been cast down to the earth. And now Christ Jesus, the righteous overlord, in obedience to God’s will, has gathered unto himself his faithful ones, and the new heavens are created and complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY SOME FAIL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> Disobedience is iniquity or lawlessness. God’s unchangeable rule is that no creature shall live who is willfully disobedient or lawless. Jesus says that at the time of his coming there would be some in line for the kingdom who would be disobedient, and that such would form the “evil servant” class, and would be cut asunder. (Matt. 24: 48-51) Such are the lawless ones, the workers of iniquity, who fail or refuse to obey the commandments of the Lord and who follow their own selfish ways. Their place is with the hypocrites, and concerning them the Lord says: “The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”—Matt. 13: 41, 42.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> Saul, the king of Israel, who was willfully disobedient to God’s commandment, and was rejected by the Lord for that reason, was a type of the disobedient ones who in the latter days, claiming to be servants of God and of Christ, are disobedient and hence are hypocrites. Saul was a type or picture of such religionists who fail or refuse to obey God’s commandments. Religionists can never receive eternal life, because religionists are disobedient to God and follow the devices of Satan. At the first coming of Christ Jesus the leaders of “the Jews’ religion” had made the commandments of God of none effect by adopting the practice of religion and by teaching men that which had been taught by other men and handed down by tradition, and Jesus told them that they were of the Devil and followed the Devil’s will. (Matt. 15: 1-9; John 8: 43, 44) Jesus denounced their practices and told them that their end was destruction. (Matt. 23: 13-33) Today the end of the world is here. Christ Jesus has come the second time, and now the new heavens are created. He causes his witnesses to proclaim his truth of and concerning Jehovah and his kingdom in the presence and hearing of the religionists. These are afforded an opportunity to hear and to obey the Lord’s commandments. The present times are the last days of Satan’s world, and concerning these last days it is written: ‘In the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, blasphemers, disobedient to parents [that is, to Jehovah God and his organization].’ (2 Tim. 3: 1, 2) This exactly describes the condition that now exists amongst religionists, and particularly the leaders. To those who have been deceived into following these religious leaders, but who have a desire to know the way to life, the Lord’s Word of instruction is addressed, and he calls attention to the fact that the religious leaders have a form of godliness, and falsely claim to serve God, but they deny the power thereof, and the admonition to the honest ones is, “From such turn away.” (2 Tim. 3: 5) The religious leaders, particularly the Roman Catholic clergy, blasphemously claim to have and exercise power which belongs alone to God. Not only do they disobey God and the commandments he has given, but they viciously persecute Jehovah’s witnesses, who are faithful in declaring the Word of God, and thus they prove themselves to be instruments of the Devil and workers of iniquity. Their end is destruction at Armageddon. Sincere and honest persons who have been brought under the control of the Catholic organization, but who now desire to know the way to life and to live, must, when they hear the truth, be obedient to God’s commandments, and withdraw themselves from that religious organization and turn away from the clergy; and failing to do so, they will not find the way to life everlasting. This warning Jehovah’s witnesses must give and are giving to the people of the world. This is a part of the work of the Lord toward creating a “new earth”, which shall be to his praise.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“A NEW EARTH”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> “The earth is Jehovah’s, and the fulness thereof.” (Ps. 24: 1, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> The Devil and wicked men have corrupted the earth and made it a place of violence; and all such God declares he will destroy at Armageddon. The prophetic words of Jehovah now are concerning the earth: “Behold me! creating . . . a new earth.” (Isa. 65: 17, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> That does not mean that he is creating a new mundane sphere; but it means the visible part of God’s organization, which shall do his will on earth as in heaven. Zion is now builded up, and the creating of the new earth begins. Concerning this Jehovah says to Zion: “Sing, 0 barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child; for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith Jehovah. Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations; spare not; lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes. For thou shalt spread abroad on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.” —Isa. 54: 1-3, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’•The mandate of Jehovah is that the earth ‘shall be filled’ with righteous people. (Gen. 1: 28) That divine mandate shall be carried out to a completion. Concerning the carrying out of this purpose Christ Jesus, the Head of the capital organization, the new heavens, says: “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” (John 10: 16) The “other sheep” are those otherwise designated as “Jonadabs”, who will maintain their integrity toward God under the test and will form the “great multitude”, and such shall inhabit the earth for ever. They, together with their righteous offspring, shall “fill the earth”. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">November 1, 1938.) They also must conform fully to the rule of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">OBEDIENCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> That unchangeable rule of Jehovah is obedience and that the obedient shall live and receive his blessings, and that no others shall live. Full and complete obedience is required of the Jonadabs, the same as is required of the “remnant”. (Rom. 11: 5) The descendants of Jonadab were a faithful and obedient people and obedient to the commandments of their earthly parent. Although not in a covenant with God, they are spoken of by Jehovah with approval, and are shown to be typical of the faithful great multitude. The prophetic picture of that people is recorded at Jeremiah the thirty-fifth chapter, and the contrast is squarely drawn between the obedient Jonadabs and the unfaithful Israelites, and manifestly the purpose thereof is to show that the unfaithful, even though in a covenant with the Lord, shall suffer destruction, whereas other faithful ones shall receive God’s blessing. The covenant people, the Israelites, disobeyed God’s commandments, became religious, following Satan’s machinations and teachings, and have suffered destruction. The descendants of Jonadab faithfully obeyed the commandments of their earthly father, and their obedience brought forth words of approval from Jehovah, who instructed his prophet Jeremiah to say to them: “Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.” —Jer. 35: 19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Now the antitype of the descendants of Jonadab, and which antitypical people form the great multitude, are commanded to ‘separate themselves from worldly religionists and to flee to God and to Christ Jesus and there to find refuge under God’s organization’. (Josh. 20:1-6) To them God gives this commandment that they must be diligent to ‘seek righteousness and meekness’. (Zcph. 3: 1-3) They must stay within the bounds of that “city of refuge”, under God’s organization, until the anointed class has passed into the kingdom, and then they arc to be free. They must associate themselves with God’s anointed and have a part in declaring the message of God’s name and his kingdom, and thus identify themselves as for God and his kingdom. (Rev. 22: 17) Because they are the companions with the anointed and because they serve God and his King, they suffer persecution at the hands of the Devil and his religious agents, and through all such experiences they must maintain their integrity toward God. They must be wholly devoted to God and to his King, Christ Jesus, and they must openly support and advance the kingdom interests, and therefore they must be separate from the world over which Satan exercises power and influence. They must teach their children the truth and point them to the way of life through the kingdom of God. The promise to them is that, if obedient to Jehovah God and Christ his King, they shall receive and carry out the divine mandate to “multiply and fill the earth”. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> November 1, 1938.) The building of a new earth progresses.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REJOICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> Concerning Jehovah’s capital organization it is written: “Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. God is known in her palaces for a refuge.” (Ps. 48: 2, 3) Today God’s people have come to the end of the world, over which Satan is the overlord, and by God’s grace they are permitted to observe the fulfillment of divine prophecy, all of which was written for their comfort and hope. (Rom. 15: 4) They now see that God is progressing with his creating of the new earth, and this fills them with joy. To them the Lord Jehovah now says: “But joy ye and exult perpetually in what I am about to create, for behold me! creating Jerusalem an exultation, and her people a joy.”—Isa. 65: 18, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Jerusalem was the city where .God placed his name. In the antitypical, the new Jerusalem, God’s name shall forever be praised. Jerusalem is the name applied to Jehovah’s universal organization, and Zion is the name of his capital organization, which organization exercises ruling power over all by the will of God. Jerusalem, therefore, includes the great multitude, the “other sheep” gathered by the Lord Jesus, and which shall also participate in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jerusalem, therefore, is to be an exultation, and the people of God’s organization a joy. His organization shall be a joy to Jehovah because a vindication of his name, and therefore he says: “Therefore will I exult in Jerusalem, and joy in my people, and there shall be heard in her no more the sound of weeping or the sound of a cry.” (Isa. 65: 19, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> Within that part of Jerusalem (the universal organization) which is Zion there is now no more heard the sound of weeping or the sound of a cry. The faithful have the joy of the Lord, and well do they know that all things concerning them shall work together for their good, and they rejoice continually and delight to serve wheresoever they are put. They know that the Devil and his agents cannot destroy them, and cannot even kill them, except by God’s permission, and, if they continue faithful unto death, their resurrection to eternal life and glory will be instantaneous. (1 Cor. 15: 51, 52) They now have a vision of the new heavens and the new earth, and they rejoice, and their exultation shall be perpetual in the creation of God and because of the vindication of his name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WEEPING TO CEASE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> Death has caused great sorrow and weeping amongst humankind. “The wages of sin is death.” (Rom. 6: 23) Hence sin that was brought into the world by reason of Adam’s disobedience, and death as a result thereof, have been the cause of great sorrow and weeping. Millions have died as suckling babes, and their parents have suffered great sorrow by reason thereof. When the “new earth” is established and the faithful obedient ones who form the great multitude begin to marry and bring children into the world, will their offspring die as babes in arms ? Jehovah God, by his prophet, speaking of his perfect creation, says: “There shall be thenceforward no more a suckling of a few days, or an elder who fillcth not up his days; but a youth a hundred years old may die, yea a sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed.”—Isa. 65: 20, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> When men and women who form the great multitude proceed to carry out the divine mandate to marry and bring forth children and “fill the earth”, those men and women will be counted righteous in the sight of God by reason of their faith in God and in the shed blood of Christ Jesus, and their full devotion to God and his kingdom, and obedience to his law. Therefore their children will not be conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquity, although they must have the benefit of the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus and receive life at the hands of Christ Jesus, “the Everlasting Father.” Why should those children die as suckling babes in arms? What could be the purpose of their being born if they die as such infants? Does the prophecy of Isaiah 65: 20 above quoted apply to them? or what is the meaning thereof?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> This prophecy may now be applied in this manner: The number 100 is a multiple of 10 times 10, which would refer to completeness respecting earthly things. The faithful remnant, having maintained their integrity and received God’s approval, like the apostle Paul have received a favorable judgment at the hands of the Lord and may be said to have completely received everything they can receive while on the earth, and they know that the enemy cannot destroy them, and hence there is no sorrow in Zion when one of their number dies and passes on into glory. They are all properly said to be “youths” now within the Scriptural meaning of that word. If, however, any of such willingly becomes a sinner, he shall be accursed and die as such, and for him there would be no sorrow, for the reason that God has commanded that there shall be no weeping or sorrow for such.—Ezek. 24: 16, 17. See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font5"> Book One, page 332.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> But another meaning of this text appears to be both reasonable and in harmony with the Scriptures concerning the ‘filling of the earth’. God has now created new heavens and his creation of the new earth is progressing. Armageddon will clear the earth of all wickedness, and only those who are devoted to God and his kingdom under Christ will survive that terrible destruction. The great multitude now begin their praise of God and Christ Jesus before Armageddon comes, and they serve God and Christ, continuously singing their praises. (Rev. 7: 9, 10, 15) Following Armageddon the righteous great multitude will proceed to marry and multiply that they may carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth”. From that time forward babes shall be born. The parents will then know how to feed their children and to properly care for them, both in body and in mind, and to instruct them in the way of righteousness. The kingdom then in full operation, as it is written, ‘there nothing shall hurt nor destroy.’ (Isa. 11: 8, 9) There would then appear to be no cause for babies to be sick and pine away and die. If they die as suckling babes, the sting of death would still be extant and bring great sorrow on the parents. But this prophecy of Isaiah says: “There shall be thenceforward no more a suckling of a few days”; that is, the end of the babe a few days old shall not come. The baby shall continue to live and grow up. It shall grow to manhood or womanhood, strong and vigorous. If it is properly taught and gives heed tp the teaching, it will learn to love and to serve the King and Jehovah. At least, it will grow up until it reaches an age of individual responsibility, and, if it dies, its death will not be the result of inherited sin, but by reason of individual wrongdoing, and this is clearly declared by the prophet. (Jer. 31: 29, 30) That being true, there will be no babes that will die as such at any time. This truth should be and will be of great encouragement and comfort to those who are now Jonadabs and who look forward to the time that they may live during the millennial reign of Christ, and marry and bring forth children into the earth. This would suggest that Jonadabs should not be anxious to marry now, but with hope and confidence look forward to the time after Armageddon when they may have children with the assurance that they can rear such children without fear of the child’s dying as a child. There appears to be no reason or scripture supporting the conclusion that babies born during the millennial reign of Christ will die as babes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> But will such offspring of the great multitude die at all ? That question is answered by this prophecy in these words: ‘But a youth may die an hundred years did.’ That would not necessarily mean a hundred years of 365 days each year. Ten being a number symbolic of earthly completeness, and ten times ten being a hundred, that multiple of ten would be a symbol of earthly completeness in every respect. That being true, the scripture seems to mean that no offspring of the great multitude will die until that offspring has had an individual, full and complete opportunity to know and to obey the Lord and to prove integrity and devotion to God and to thus prove he is worthy of life; that when such person has received a full and complete opportunity to know the Lord and to serve him, and then willfully sins, that person will die accursed because proving himself entirely unworthy of life. Therefore this text further states: “Yea a sinner a hundred years old [that is, after having full and complete intelligent opportunity to prove worthy, and failing therein and being disobedient] shall be accursed.” One might live according to the terms of this text for 500 years or even a thousand years, and then prove disobedient and therefore unworthy of life. One dying as an accursed sinner will not be mourned by anyone on earth, not even by the parents of that person, because God has commanded they shall not be sorrowful or weep. To do so would be contrary to the commandment of God as stated in the propheey of Ezekiel 24: 16, 17. The accursed sinner is and will be an open enemy of God and Christ, the King, and therefore no righteous person would sorrow or weep because of the destruction of such willful and accursed one.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> “Jerusalem,” that is, Jehovah’s organization, which will include the righteous people of the earth after Armageddon, therefore, must be without sorrow. Judas Iscariot was a willful, deliberate sinner, and was accursed of God. No one who loves God and Christ Jesus will shed tears of sorrow because such as Judas Iscariot die. The Christian in the present time would not sorrow or weep because one dies who is a deliberate and intelligent opposer of God and his kingdom, because to do so would be a violation of God’s commandment. Jehovah says: “[I am] creating Jerusalem an exultation, and her people a joy.” (Vs. 18) The new heavens is already an exultation and a joy to all who love and serve God. The new earth will be a part of Jerusalem because a part of God’s organization and under the one great Shepherd, King and Ruler. It is not an “earthly phase of the kingdom”, as some erroneously say, but it is controlled by the kingdom, and hence a part of God’s organization. The new heavens and new earth will then rejoice and her people will be a joy for ever. They will be a joy to Jehovah because in complete vindication of his name. In harmony with this it is written: “And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.” (Rev. 21: 3, 4) It will not be necessary to wait until the end of the thousand-year reign of Christ for such a condition, because those who die during that period of time, as a result of their own willful wrongdoing, will not call forth tears to be shed by the living.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Therefore, then, from the time of the beginning of the operation of the “new earth” under the supervision and direction and rule of the new heavens ‘there shall be heard no more any sound of weeping or sound of a cry’. God will wipe away all tears by establishing his righteous rule in the earth, and his people will have no occasion to be sorrowful. The wicked things that existed in the “evil world”, which are against God and his kingdom, shall be forgotten and be completely put out of mind, because Jehovah says: “The former shall not be mentioned, neither shall they come up on the heart.” (Isa. 65: 17, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> The heavens and the earth will continue in endless joy. Thereafter when the accursed sinner shall die, the death of such will be a vindication of Jehovah’s name, which is a joy to all who live for ever.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> Thus is magnified the importance of obedience. God’s unchangeable rule, therefore, is, in substance: Knowingly and willfully disobey God’s commandments, and die; gladly obey God’s commandments, and live. “For the arms of the wicked shall be broken; but the Lord upholdeth the righteous.” (Ps. 37: 17) Every intelligent creature, both invisible and visible, it is therefore seen, must be put to the test to determine whether or not he will willingly from the heart obey God. Only the obedient, righteous ones are given life everlasting. The “great multitude” must be righteous and lovers of righteousness. Their offspring that live shall likewise be righteous and lovers of righteousness. In that “world to come”, which is a “world without end”, everything must be and shall be righteous, and that shall be a world “wherein dwelleth righteousness”. (2 Pet. 3: 13) Then everything that breathes shall honor and for ever praise Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark9"></a>HEAD STONE OF THE TEMPLE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH’S angel, referring to Zerubbabel the governor of the Jewish remnant from Babylon, declared: ‘‘And he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace, unto it. ’ ’—Zech. 4: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The head stone of Jehovah’s great spiritual temple </span><span class="font4">is </span><span class="font5">Christ Jesus. The prophecy positively declares it shall be brought forth. This took place at the final laying of the “head stone of the corner” at the com</span><span class="font4">ing </span><span class="font5">of Christ Jesus to the temple for judgment in A.D. 1918. (Ps. 118:22; Isa. 28:16) He was then presented by Jehovah as earth’s rightful King. The body members of Christ on earth are used to bring this information to the attention of others. The faithful witnesses bring the information “with thundering shouts” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.),</span><span class="font5"> and this really began in 1922, at the general convention of Jehovah’s witnesses, when the thousands, assembled together, discerned that the King had come to his temple, and rose and shouted, crying out: “Advertise the King and the kingdom”; and since then they have continued to shout fearlessly and with joy give the testimony .-Isa. 12:6; Zech. 9: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah gave grace and glory to the Stone, and his witnesses so declare, in the language of Psalm 45:2: “Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. ’ ’ Also Psalm 84:11: “ For the Lord God is a sun and shield: the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.” The faithful remnant admire the Stone as the fairest of all creation, being altogether lovely, the grandest ruler the world will ever have. They do not glorify man and give man credit, but because God has honored his beloved Son his witnesses cry out in honor to the Son: ‘ ‘ Beautiful! beautiful!” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> and say: “Blessed be he that cometh in the name of Jehovah: we have blessed you out of the house of Jehovah,” because you are the greatest of all builders. (Ps. 118:26, A.R.V.) Such is admiration of Jehovah’s workmanship done and provided for the vindication of his name; and hence credit is given to the Most High.—John 5:23; 2 Thess. 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah will use his anointed to accomplish his purposes regardless of all opposition, and his positive assurance thereof is stated by his prophet thus: ‘ ‘ The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, his hands shall also finish it; and thou [the Lord’s remnant on earth] shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you.” (Zech. 4:9) In the spring of 535 B.C. Zerubbabel laid the foundation of the temple in Jerusalem. (Ezra 3: 8-10) Sixteen years later Zerubbabel laid the foundation of the temple anew. (Hag. 2:18) Thus it was done successfully despite all opposition. Christ Jesus, the builder of the temple of Jehovah, uses his small number to represent him on the earth and to begin the “Elisha work” after his coming to the temple for judgment; and having begun it, he will finish it regardless of all opposition. (Phil. 1:6) He is no respecter of persons, but will permit those, and those only, to have a part in the temple building who are wholly devoted to. Jehovah and who are obedient to Jehovah’s great Prophet, Christ Jesus. In due time he will finish the work. (Ezra 5: 1, 2; 6: 14, 15) This work Christ Jesus does to vindicate Jehovah’s name, and in this the remnant will be in full unity with him.—John 17: 21-23; Eph. 4:12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the Philistine giant, Goliath, despised the smallness of the man David, who came to fight him (1 Sam. 17:22-51), even so Satan and all of his cohorts despise the smallness and the allied equipment of God’s organization on the earth. Satan and all of his crowd despise Jehovah’s organization, and many who think themselves to be in present truth, but who are of the “synagogue of Satan”, also oppose. (Rev. 3:9) These speak with contempt, despising the small remnant, who in fact are small in number and in physical and financial strength. They fail to take into account that not by wealth, or power or influence is the work done, but by the spirit of God. It pleases God to call the “despised” for his service.—1 Cor. 1:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shall these despisers see and rejoice? They shall see the result of the Lord’s work, but they will not rejoice. Zechariah 4:10 (A.E.V.) declares: “For who hath despised the day of small things? for these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel; these are the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth.” This text clearly means that the perfect eyes of the Lord shall see the temple progress to completion; hence those perfect eyes blaze with delight. Jehovah knows that he will have a small faithful class on earth that will maintain their integrity to him unto the completion of the temple and the vindication of his name, and this rejoices his heart and the heart of Christ Jesus. These seven eyes of the Lord run to and fro beholding the work in progress and seeing the accomplishment thereof. (Deut. 11:12; 2 Chron. 16:9; 1 Ki. 8:29) In the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version</span><span class="font5"> of the Bible the preposition “with” in the expression “the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">with</span><span class="font5"> those seven” is a supplied word; hence the text does not mean that Zerubbabel has both the plummet and also the seven eyes in his hand. The ‘seven eyes’ are Jehovah’s eyes or complete vision beholding the plummet in the hand of the great Builder, and it rejoices Him that his anointed will vindicate his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After receiving the explanation through the angel of the Lord concerning the vision of the candlestick with seven lamps and the olive trees beside it, the prophet Zechariah again asked the meaning of the “two olive trees” upon each side of the candlestick, and of the “two olive branches, which through the two golden pipes [emptied] the golden oil out of themselves”. (4:11,12) His repeating the inquiry shows the modern Zechariah class searching God’s Word in the light of the facts well known, desiring to understand the prophecy. The candlestick seems to represent the light-disseminating organization of Jehovah on earth, and this conclusion is supported by the words of Jesus, at Revelation 2:5: “ Repent, and do the first works; or else I . . . will remove thy candlestick.” This candlestick pictures those of the ‘wise virgin’ class having the oil in their vessels; and they put it into their lamps, when going out to “meet the Bridegroom”. (Matt. 25:7-9) As “trees of righteousness”, and living because “planted by the rivers of waters”, as described in the prophecies, these keep their lamps lighted and alive .and burning. (Isa. 61:3; Ps. 1:3) A miracle here appears in the vision of the candlestick; in this: The olive oil is generally obtained by crushing the fruit; but in this instance it is taken from the trunk of the tree. This is the way these “trees of righteousness” hold forth the fruit of the kingdom of God. They pipe the oil directly into the light-bearing organization and use it there to the honor of Jehovah and his King. Concerning this, Judges 9:9 says: “The olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophet Zechariah told the angel that he did not know the meaning thereof, and the angel answered: “These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.” (4:13,14) These are the two leading participants in the building of the temple back there, namely, Joshua the anointed high priest of Israel and Zerubbabel the governor of Judah, which show prophetically Christ Jesus in the position both as a sacrificing Priest and as the great Executive Officer of Jehovah God, and Builder of the temple. As such he ‘stands’ for Jehovah, the God of the whole earth. All of his anointed body members stand with him and enjoy great peace and consolation, because all have part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark11"></a>POLLU</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH is the husbandman, and Jerusalem stands for his “woman”. She was “married” to Jehovah and brought forth offspring unto him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He says to her: “Moreover, thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast born unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto [images of men] to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter?” (Ezek. 16: 20, 21) The unfaithful ones in “organized Christianity” have formed a perverted organization and used it to turn members of the true church away from Jehovah God, and to sacrifice them to the destructive influence of an organized system mislabeled “Christian” and to Satan, “the god of this world.” All the clergy, the leaders or “elective elders” who turn men away from God’s organization, come within the class here denounced by Jehovah. Pride, selfishness and ingratitude to God are the inducing cause of their falling. “And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and wast polluted in thy blood.”—Ezek. 16: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pollutions of “organized Christianity”, or “Christendom”, and the reproach that is brought upon God’s name, are too terrible to find adequate description in human phrase, hence the prophet says of her: “And it came to pass, after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto thee! saith the Lord God).” (Ezek. 16: 23) The clergy, leaders, “elective elders” and principal ones of the flock in “Christendom” have taken in every worldly movement, political and otherwise, and then labeled such with the name of Christ and God. These chief ones in “organized Christianity” have opened their arms to all manner of heathen religions and customs and practices in their buildings called “churches”, in order to satisfy their selfish desires to have popularity, power and influence. “Organized Christianity” has erected her places of worship at the most prominent points in the roadway, hung out her sign, and sat in the doorway to induce passers-by to enter, and thus has made her original body to be abhorred by honest people of good will and made herself an abomination in the sight of God. “That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place [ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(margin),</span><span class="font5"> a brothel house], and hast made thee an high place in every</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark13"></a>TIONS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">street. Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.” (Ezek. 16: 24,25) The leaders in “organized Christianity” have denounced immoral practices among men of the world, from the standpoint of the flesh, because such is an abhorrent thing before decent people. Jehovah chooses this abhorrent thing to illustrate the wicked course that “organized Christianity” has taken. It is bad enough for fallen men and women to indulge in immoral practices, but Jehovah denounces it as far worse for professed followers of Christ Jesus to indulge in illicit practices with the Devil’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Egypt is a symbol of the world, and pictures the commercial and military part of Satan’s organization; while Assyria pictures particularly the political elements of Satan’s organization, and Chaldea stands for the Devil’s religion in all of his organization. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy,</span><span class="font5"> Chapter VI.) Verses twenty-six to twenty-nine of the sixteenth chapter of Ezekiel’s prophecy say to the Jews, and with stronger force to “organized Christianity”: “Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours. . . . Thou hast played the [harlot] also with the Assyrians, . . . Thou hast, moreover, multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea [Babylon], and yet thou wast not satisfied.” The clergy and leaders and elective elders representatively stand for all of “organized Christianity”, and have made friendship, entered into relationship, with the commercial powers and with the politicians of the world that they might gain popularity and influence; and “organized Christianity” has thus opened her arms and received into illicit friendship and agreement all men of the heathen or Devil religions. Today “organized Christianity”, or “Christendom”, boasts that all religions are walking together hand in hand and without controversy. This is done under the pretense and false claim that it is establishing peace among men, but, in truth and in fact, it is prostituting the Word of God and the true worship of the IMost High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“As a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband!” (Ezek. 16:32) “Organized religion,” mislabeled “Christianity”, in the land called “Christendom”, gives rewards and prizes to entice and induce others of the world to come and join her organization and commune with her, she at the same time receiving no spiritual gain whatsoever therefrom. Heathen forms are adopted and practiced in the buildings called “Christian churches”, in order to gain popularity and to satisfy the selfish desires of the leaders thereof. This detestable practice in the church organizations called “Christian” Jehovah describes in this language: “They give gifts to all whores; but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom. And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms; and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee; therefore thou art contrary.” (Ezek. 16: 33, 34) Instead of letting God do the calling, and instead of telling the people God’s truth in order that they might with intelligence respond to his call, the unfaithful religious leaders have chased after the class of people that they wanted, with all manner of enticements to make of them proselytes. Thus not only have they compromised themselves thereby, but they have paid for the opportunity to do it. Thus Jehovah compares “organized Christianity” with a harlot that pays all manner of men to satisfy her beastly desires. Surely a worse description could not be imagined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah commanded Ezekiel to call to the attention of Jerusalem her abominable deeds and then to tell her of God’s judgment. The “faithful servant” class must perform this same work toward “Christendom”. “Wherefore, 0 harlot, hear the word of [Jehovah].” (Ezek. 16: 35) Jehovah then directs his prophet to say that because of her filthiness and whoredoms he would gather all those with whom she had taken pleasure, and the ones, that she has hated, and he would expose her wickedness before all such. “Behold, therefore, I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness. And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places; they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare. ... I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord God.”—Ezek. 16: 37, 39, 43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems clearly therefore to be the will of God that “Christendom” must be informed of her wickedness and reminded of God’s judgment written against her. And who shall do that work of serving notice except those whom God has called his witnesses in his name </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font5">is the “faithful servant” class that is commissioned to declare the day of the vengeance of our God. As Egypt and Assyria and other nations round about turned against Jerusalem, even so in modern times the other ruling powers will destroy the hypocritical religionists. “And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.” (Rev. 17: 16, 17) (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font5"> Book Two, page 108.)—Ezek. 23: 22-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The infidel, the agnostic, the atheist and the sarcastic put “Christianity” and all heathen religions in the same class, and therefore use the proverb: “As is the mother, so is her daughter.” In other words, ‘the mother was a harlot and the daughter is likewise. They are all bad, and all from the Devil.’ These do not discern the difference between “organized Christianity”, with its devilish practices, and the true teachings and practices of Christ Jesus and his faithful apostles. The infidel and the atheist and those in that class observe that “organized Christianity” is even worse than the acknowledged heathen religions, because in “Christendom” there is a greater degree of intelligence. Therefore they classify the teachings and the practices of even true followers of Jesus Christ with heathenism and “organized Christianity” so called, and they make war against the true as well as against the false. “Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.” (Ezek. 16: 43, 44) This is again a challenge to God and a claim that he cannot bring out from fallen human creatures any that will remain faithful and steadfast to God and to Christ; and this is proof that the challenge is from the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s prophet Ezekiel then compares the abominations of Samaria and Sodom to those of Jerusalem. “And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand; and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.” (Ezek. 16: 46) Judah was the fourth son, and Benjamin the twelfth son, of Jacob; hence the tribes of both Judah and Benjamin had elder brothers. Jerusalem, which was partly in Judah and partly in Benjamin, had an “elder sister” in Samaria, the capital city of the ten tribes of Israel. Samaria means “watch”. Looking east from Jerusalem, on the left hand thereof was the site of Samaria; while Sodom was on the right hand of Jerusalem, when facing to the east. Sodom was the “younger sister” city in that it was less than Jerusalem; the name Sodom is understood to mean a “place of lime, or burning, or arable field”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Samaria and Sodom were bad, but Jerusalem is declared as being much worse. Likewise, heathen religions are devilish and exceedingly bad and reproach God, but “organized Christianity”, under the influence and control of the Devil, is far worse and brings greater reproach upon the name of God; therefore the comparison. &quot;Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations; but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.” (Ezek. 16: 47) The wickedness of Samaria had been committed in the presence of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem, claiming to be more righteous than others, was more abominable in the sight of God. This shows that observation of wickedness and of the outcome thereof is no sure deterrent against indulging in wrongdoing.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark15"></a>ROYALTY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH declared his purpose to have a royal priesthood after the order of Melchizedek, who was both king of Salem (he “first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace”) and priest of the Most High God. (Gen. 14: 18; Heb. 7:1-25) Christ Jesus is the Head of this priestly order. (Heb. 3:1) He is the King of kings. (Rev. 1:5; 19:16; 17: 14) With him are associated one hundred and forty-four thousand underpriests. (Ps. 110:4; 1 Pet. 2: 9, 10; Rev. 14: 1-4) Ezekiel, when shown a vision of Jehovah’s royal house, was given instructions concerning the sendee of the priesthood. Those instructions, given by Jehovah to Ezekiel, set forth the purposes of the Most High God and “were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures [the writings] might have hope.” In that record the name </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Zadok</span><span class="font5"> means “Righteous One”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord God.” (Ezek. 44:15) The royal priesthood are divine sons of the RIGHTEOUS ONE JAH. The Aaronic priesthood was taken from the tribe of Levi. The high priesthood of Zadok dates from King David’s day. (2 Sam. 8:17; 15:24-36; 19:11; 20:25) The Zadok family was fittingly chosen because of faithfulness to God and his kingdom interests as represented by King David. This is proof that it is faithfulness to God in the performance of duty that brings his approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The family of Zadok was descended from God’s favored priest Phinehas (Numbers 25:1-13), but not through the unfaithful house of the high priest Eli, but through Amariah and Ahitub. (1 Chron. 6: 1-8, 50-53) “So Solomon thrust out Abiathar [descendant of Eli] from being priest unto [Jehovah] ; that he might fulfil the word of [Jehovah], which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.” (1 Ki. 2:27) “And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart, and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house: and he shall walk before mine Anointed [King] for ever. And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine [Eli’s] house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.”—1 Sam. 2: 35, 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Ezekiel’s day these priests, “Levites, the sons of Zadok,” were represented by the high priest Jehoza-dak, which name means “Jehovah is just” (1 Chron. 6:14, 15), and by his successor Joshua, meaning “Jehovah saves”. (Hag. 1:12; Zech. 3:1, 8, 9; 6: 11, 12) This same Joshua was the high priest who, together with Zerubbabel, built the prophetic temple at Jerusalem after the return of the Israelites from Babylon. These priests remained faithful to God, which is shown by the prophecies of Haggai, Zechariah and Ezekiel. Jehovah speaks with commendation and approval of Phinehas, in Numbers 25:11-13, because of his faithfulness. Eli’s priestly house pictures those who are unfaithful to their covenant with God and who join the Antichrist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1917 to 1918 a crucial test came upon the people of God, and out of that test came the “faithful and wise servant” class pictured by “the sons of Zadok that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me”. This strongly supports the conclusion that after God calls one to the kingdom and that call is accepted the called one must be put to a test in order to determine his faithfulness and must prove faithful under such test before being chosen and anointed to a place in the royal priesthood. The approved ones, says Jehovah, &quot;.shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood.” The fat and the blood were special parts of the sacrifice that belonged exclusively to Jehovah God, and which were offered to him by the priests. The life is in the blood, and Jehovah is the only source of life. “And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savour. All the fat is [Jehovah’s]. It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations, throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.” (Lev. 3: 16, 17) “For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar, to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.”—Lev. 17: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful priesthood of the sons of Zadok pictured or represented the faitlrful who were chosen to membership in the royal priesthood and made members of Jehovah’s royal house. “They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.” (Ezek. 44:16) There was no ark of the covenant nor mercy seat for the priests to come near in this temple which Ezekiel saw, and this for the reason that Jehovah is now at his temple. “The altar of wood” was there, which is called “the.table that is before Jehovah”. Jehovah’s anointed ones yet on the earth do now come near to this table before Jehovah in “the secret place of the Most High”, not because of their own perfections, but because of the righteousness and perfection of Christ Jesus, the Head of the royal priesthood. Jehovah’s confidence in this priesthood is shown by the fact that they “minister unto me [Jehovah], and they shall keep my charge”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is the class that has access to the inner court of the temple. Because the east gate is shut, they must enter at other gates: “And it shall come to pass, that, when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them whiles they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.” (Ezek. 44:17) Their garments identify them as members of the royal priesthood, “for the fine linen is the righteousness [righteous acts] of saints.” (Rev. 19:8) The remnant now on earth must have on fine linen garments, to wit, “the robe of righteousness, ’ ’ showing that they have Jehovah’s approval and are his witnesses. The fact that they wore no wool would indicate that these faithful ones do not shear the flock of God to provide comfort for themselves in God’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clothing required to be worn by the roynl priesthood indicates that their service is one of joy: “They shall have linen bonnets [tires] upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins [lest their nakedness appear (Rev. 3: 18; 16: 15)] ; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat.” (Ezek. 44: 18) The priest must have on nothing that “causeth sweat”. Sweat suggests drudgery, toil, such as the case of Adam. (Gen. 3: 17-19) Woolen garments cause sweat, and would therefore be improper. Adam’s “sweat” was the result of the curse, and concerning God’s organization, of which the remnant now form a part, it is written: “And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. And there shall be no more curse.”— Rev. 22:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The royal priesthood is instructed not to exhibit their royal garments to the people. “And when they go forth into the utter [outer] court, even into the utter [outer] court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font5">garments.” (Ezek. 44:19) This text cannot be construed to mean that the glorified saints in heaven will materialize in form or dress and exhibit them</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">selves </span><span class="font5">to the people on the earth. The text therefore must be limited in its application to Jehovah’s rem</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">nant </span><span class="font5">still on the earth who are before the people as</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses. These are not to exhibit themselves and parade themselves before the people by misusing things of their spiritual office for selfish and vain-glorious purposes. They are not to pose before the people in a sanctimonious manner as Jehovah’s witnesses in order to impress others with their own importance or to cause the people to look upon them with awe. Such a course would be entirely displeasing to Jehovah. Jehovah’s witnesses are his servants; and when they go before the people with his message in book form, or by other means of testifying, they are to give Jehovah all the glory and honor, and none to man. (Hag. 2: 11, 12) Nor is it proper for God’s chosen ones to sanctify those whom God does not elect. The royal priesthood is chosen by Jehovah, and not by any creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let Jehovah’s chosen servants take notice of this instruction, to wit: “Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only poll [shear] their heads.” (Ezek. 44:20) God gives the woman her hair for a head covering, and the woman is a picture of the church. (2 Cor. 11: 2) Whether the woman’s hair is rolled up in a knot on the top of her head or whether it is cropped is not material, but it is a shame to shave the head and then tie a white cloth over it and wear a black bonnet in order that others may see and say: “That is a real sanctimonious person.” Nor are the men to wear long hair in order that they might appear as unusually pious souls and cause the people thus to say. Paul understood Jehovah’s instructions concerning the priesthood when he wrote that the women should not shave their head, nor the men wear long locks. “Doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him? But if a woman have long- hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given her for a covering.”—1 Cor. 11: 3-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“They shall only poll their heads,” says Jehovah in his instructions to Ezekiel. To poll means to shear. There has been a lot of foolish talk concerning the women’s bobbing or cropping the hair, but there is no scripture against so doing. We should not be foolish in trying to make rules which the Scriptures do not warrant. The sum of Jehovah’s instructions to Ezekiel concerning the headdress of the priesthood is that they are to do nothing that would make them especially conspicuous or would call attention to the creature, but to do everything to call attention to the Creator. They are not to make themselves particularly conspicuous by dress or appearance or ultrapious expressions. It is improper for them to go about in a mournful manner or to appear as martyrs that they may impress others. Jehovah’s witnesses are happy, joyful and faithful servants of God, boldly giving the testimony of Jesus Christ and calling attention of the people to the Word and name of the Most High. Whether a certain class like them or do not like them, it is not material. God’s approval is the all-important thing.</span></p>

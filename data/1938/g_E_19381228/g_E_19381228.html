<p><span class="font10">Burma and the Burmese</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19381228_files/g_E_19381228-3.png" alt="" style="width:42pt;height:42pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">BURMA, the land of golden pagodas (temples) and perpetual spring, has always been counted as part of India, but from April, 1937, it was politically separated from India. The population totals about 15,000,000, and is a mixed one, consisting of well-to-do Europeans, Burmans, Indians of assorted castes and creeds, Chinese, Karens, Shans, Kachins, Chins, Palaungs, Arakanesc, Jews and Japanese, a regular Babel of castes, creeds and dialects. Such is the East!</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19381228_files/g_E_19381228-4.png" alt="" style="width:197pt;height:138pt;">
<p><span class="font4">Tough-lookmg god in Rangoon</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">The European is enjoying Edenic conditions ; hence it is hard to approach him. Generally speaking, he is snobbish. The Indian dreams of national independence and hates western control. Often we are told very insultingly, “We Indians do not need Christianity; we practice it. Go preach to the western nations!” Such acts as the conquest of Abyssinia, the war in Spain, etc., are often pitched against “Christendom”, and properly so. After the political, financial and ecclesiastical conspiracy against democracy as manifested at Munich, who could have any confidence in “Christendom’s” rulers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Buddhist Burmese are not lovers of reading. They are people for fun and frolic and feeding. Their festivals are full of enjoyment and feasting. One of such, the water festival, is an occasion when all Buddhist Burmans crowd the street in cars or on the sidewalks and throw water at one another. They seldom hesitate to give those other than Burmans a share of the dousing. For three days they rage wild in the streets as the waves did in Jonah's case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another very popular festival is the “light” festival. At this time paper lanterns are lighted around Buddhist homes, hung in rows and in various shapes and designs, which at night turns the whole town into a panorama. Huge paper balloons are sent up, too, and the belief is that the home whose balloon reaches the sky will enjoy prosperity during the e.nsuing year, the contrary being the case if it gets burnt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A great deal of dancing goes on by dancers possessed at the moment by “gnats”—spirits. But their greatest enjoyment at this feast is in being able to talk to their females in obscene language, without anyone’s taking offense; all of them love it so. One of the most sickening aspects of humanity is the glee with which it moves gutterward and drags its fellows along.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I was told that some time ago the deputy commissioner of a certain town, who ‘did not believe in people being possessed’, had the privilege, during the feast, of seeing his own wife, with whom he went to see the celebrations, possessed and dancing with the rest. It was indeed very humiliating to the Englishman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Burmese women are experts at witchcraft. Often when they fall seriously ill they, make a vow promising to marry the “gnat” if they get cured. This they are known to do. At certain times the spirits get possession of their bodies and the females behave just as with a human husband, even conversing and preparing food for the invisible hubby. The final end of all such victims is usually disastrous. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In every Buddhist home one sees an altar in which is placed a bronze statue of Buddha. Around the altar little saucer's of rice, fruit, etc., are placed as an offering to the spirits, lest they become annoyed and bring misfortune upon the household. Recently I was called to a rich Chinese home, to treat an old man. As I entered the drawing-room, I saw a-large table on which were a number of plates containing rice and fruits of different varieties. Quite thoughtlessly I said, ‘‘Since your breakfast is ready, I’ll ■wait.” “No/ no, come in,” said they. “This is only an offering.”</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19381228_files/g_E_19381228-5.png" alt="" style="width:199pt;height:339pt;">
<p><span class="font5">A maid of Burma</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">The Buddhist monks, Apongyis, dressed in yellow robes, and with heads shaved, every morning in numbers, and in single file, march along to the various Buddhist homes. At each home some eatables are put into the large bowls they carry with them. That’s all their work for the day. They are not supposed to eat after noon. You in America can see plainly that this is a racket, but we here can see that your religious rackets in America, though less crude, are more cruel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The older monks among them are greatly reverenced. They indulge in spiritism and fortune-telling and in selling charms. A friend who was staying at a Burmese home while out for a. shoot was told that the charm around the neck of his host was to protect him from murder. He even challenged hisApjest to shoot at him, so great a faith had he in it. My friend, of course, had brains enough not to comply with such a request, but in order to prove to the man how foolish he was, he asked him to hang the charm around the deck of a rooster, and it was done. He fired, and, the rooster was dead. Were they not amazed 1 Not only that, but very wroth with the old monk who had sold them the charm. When they next met, the monk cleverly appeased the anger by inducing him to believe that it was intended to protect him and none other; no, sir, not even his wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To this country belong the Kamalays (maidens) with the elongated necks, which are thus made by means of-rings, which are added around their necks year by year. It is a common thing to see little children </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">girls with “saiaes” (cigars) eight </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">inches’ </span><span class="font5">long and about an inch in diameter, made from special leaves and pith, with very little </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">tobacco </span><span class="font5">added, sticking </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">out of </span><span class="font5">their mouths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another widespread habit among the natives is to chew a leaf</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(betel leaf) on which they spread a little live lime, “cutch,” and bits of a certain nut. The result is that their mouths are stained a dark red on account of the “cutch”. This chewing naturally accumulates a lot of spittle, in their mouths, which they do not, swallow, but spit just wherever they are. One hardly finds a stairway or street pavement that does not bear red patches. It is nauseating, I assure you, but in time one has to get accustomed to all this. It helps one to bear it when he reflects </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">how </span><span class="font5">patiently Jesus bore with the fallen and degraded all about Him nineteen centuries ago. Passing by the streets, in the heart of the</span></p><img src="g_E_19381228_files/g_E_19381228-6.png" alt="" style="width:196pt;height:119pt;">
<p><span class="font5">A Buddhist god in Burma</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">town at eventide in dry weather, one sees numbers of Indian coolies sleeping upon the pavements. That is their bedroom and bed. It is most amazing how serme of them can subsist on four or five annas (about 9 cents) a day for food, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is very interesting to hear the many and peculiar ways English words are pronounced.</span></p><img src="g_E_19381228_files/g_E_19381228-7.png" alt="" style="width:196pt;height:303pt;">

<p><span class="font5">Shwe Dagon pagoda, Rangoon</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Rangoon it is interesting to hear the numerous street calls. For instance, if you heard “Ee-ee-oh&quot; or “Yap-bathool” you may know it is the man who buys empty bottles. Some are mere articulations &amp;nd not words of any language. Others sing as they call out, “Argiah,</span></p><img src="g_E_19381228_files/g_E_19381228-9.png" alt="" style="width:198pt;height:117pt;">
<p><span class="font5">Bridge over moat am} West Gate, Fort Diifferen, Mandalay</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">5</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Argiah, Halve’wallah,” which means, &quot;Is come, is come, the halva seller.” Halva is a kind of Indian sweet. Quite frequently beggars are seen going about singing pathetic songs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Burma has a very peculiar fruit, the durean. This fruit has a thick, thorny skin, and large seeds covered with a butter-like substance which is the only part that is eatable. Westerners who advise that the skins of all fruits should be eaten should come and have a bite of the durean skin, or skins of other tropical fruits, and I doubt if they would sing the same . song. Before it is peeled off it has an offensive odor, but once clean it tastes delicious. Animals relish it. It is wholesoma indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Rangoon, which is the largest city in Burma, forms its capital. Its population is slightly in excess of 400,000. Its chief attraction for tourists is the artificial riding woods between clear lakes and the Shwc Dagon pagoda. This pagoda is the largest Buddhist temple, and the whole of the outside is covered with gold leaf, which glitters in the sunlight, making it an unavoidable sight for travelers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mandalay, about 150,000, about 400 miles to the north of Rangoon, was the capital in the time of the Burmese kings. Tourists visit it to see the palace of the Burmese kings. It stands inside a fort which is again surrounded <sub>(</sub>by a moat. Another attraction is the Mingon bell, which is made of iron, and the base of which is about twelve feet in diameter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Burma is well provided with railways and motor roads. Railway fares are fairly high; so is the cost of petrol and lodging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The climate of Burma is not a favorable one. We have a spell of rainy weather from the end of May to October. When the monsoons are over the cold weather sets in and keeps on till February, after which the temperature gradually increases till the heat is almost unbearable in March and April. The heavy rain^ then come on again, and, though </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">hindrance, in many ways, are also a boon, as they help to overcome the intense heat. —Basil X. Tsatos, Burma. (See page 8.)</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Prison Life in Zamboanga</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The Zamboanga prison farm, ip the southern Philippine Islands, occupies 3,000 acres, and has between 1,000 and 2,000 prisoners and a few guards. There have been no escapes in four years. Several prisoners live with their families, and in some instances they have asked not to be released when their time was up. As in other U. S. prisons, there are movies,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">a library, a brass band, a stringed orchestra, athletics and night classes, with opportunities for learning something about various trades. Nevertheless, the chances are that if you were an inmate of Zamboanga you would wish to be elsewhere. Prison life is unnatural for either man or beast. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> of December 1, 1938.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>t</sub> .</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Efforts persist to bring the whole world into subjection to the foreign power now so boastful in every land. An amendment, the purpose of which is self-evident to every reader of this magazine, came before the Legislative Council of Malaya, containing the following familiar language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, promotes or attempts to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of the public, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description which may extend to two years, or with fine or with both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Singapore 8’unday Tribune inquires innocently why there should be any reason for enacting legislation to suppress offenses which do not exist. It does not see the real objective, which is to shut the mouths of those exposing religion for what it is, the meanest, most cowardly, dishonorable, despicable racket ever inaugurated or maintained in the earth.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>In the Building of Singapore</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">♦ In the building of the £20,000,000 base at * Singapore thirty-four miles of piles were* driven through mud to the solid strata, and six million cubic yards of hills were moved. The result is the strongest naval base in the world, with docks, sidings, fuel oil reservoirs, airdromes, roads and other ancillary features necessary to make Singapore the seventh seaport of the world. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Singapore Island is 26 miles long by 14 miles wide, and is connected with the Malay Peninsula by a causeway | of a mile long. The naval base on the island occupies six square miles, and has 4| miles of water frontage, 5,000 feet of wharf walls, and a drydock that can take care of a vessel 1,000 feet long, 130 feet wide, and drawing 35 feet of water. There have been 8,000,000 cubic yards of excavation, 5,000,000 cubic yards of dredging, and a placing of 1,000,000 cubic yards of concrete. The work has taken fifteen years, with two more to finish it in all its parts.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Objected to Being Flogged</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">Rawalpindi, India, Kiroo, I a night watchman, was arrested, /&quot; charged with theft. The constable ■SHo JJ had no evidence, so he tried by the usual third-degree methods to get a confession, whereupon Kiroo killed him, and the High Court justified him, as it was a clear ease of self-defense. Then the police got after him again. Kiroo was hung bead downward, flogged, caned and kicked and slapped, whereupon he had the police inspector, the head constable and two other constables brought into court for cruelty, and white men of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders corroborated his testimony. Seems that the best thing to do with this man Kiroo is to let him alone and respect his manliness and spunk. This Hitler stuff leaves a bad taste in the mouth.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Created Man to Take Him to Heaven</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">♦ A little paragraph in the Madras (India) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mail</span><span class="font5"> refers to a sermon by the “Right Reverend” H. Pakenham Walsh, at the local Anglican cathedral. Reverend Walsh explained that God created man so as to eventually make him perfect and take him to heavgn:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God placed powers of love, holiness and understanding in man so that man may know Him, love Him, serve Him and attain everlasting happiness with Him in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to that bright idea Lucifer was only doing the decent thing when he started off with Adam and Eve and inaugurated the campaign of lying, poverty, dishonor, disgrace, shame, murder, war, racketeering and religion now known as “civilization”. Man wants to get happiness by getting out of it at all costs. It is a wholly false story, but it is not a bad canvass.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>The Result of Fifteen Years’ Work</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Sir William Mitchell Ramsay, an unbeliever, set out on an extended trip to prove the Bible a fraud. After fifteen years of expedition through Bible lands to unearth evidence against the truthfulness of the Scriptures he wrote a book entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">St. Find the Traveler and Roman Citizen.</span><span class="font5"> At page 238 he said, “The narrative never makes a false step amid all the many details ; the New Testament is unique in vivid truthfulness. Luke is a safe guide.” —B. X. Tsatos. Burma.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>The Bayadere Nuns of India</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The League of Nations issued a report on the bayadere nuns of India. These women arc religious prostitutes. Sometimes called pagoda girls, or dancers, or nautch girls, their business is to look after certain features of the religious business as has been done from the days of Nimrod, and is still done. These prostitutes or “nuns” never marry, and their daughters follow in their mothers’ footsteps. The same report shows that girls often marry in .India at the age of 7 or less, and if and when their husbands die they become slaves of their husband’s folks, have the hardest and meanest tasks to perform, and receive but. one meal a day. Do the people need more religion? India has plenty of it.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Havoc Caused by Insects</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">♦ In an address to the Science Congress, Calcutta, Mohammed Afzai Hussain claimed that there are not less than 2,500,000 existing species of insects in India, and that a single one of these, the ox warble fly, causes an annual loss to the country’s hide industry of $5,625,000. Over a hundred million of the people suffer from malaria every year, and over a million die from its effects, or rather from the effects of the anopheles insects which cause it.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Amnesty for Indian Rebels</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The British Government has done wisely and well in granting amnesty to hundreds of men and women in Indian jails for years as agitators, also in withdrawing pending cases against such, and in granting freedom of action to some 200 political associations hitherto banned. It is hard to agitate successfully against, any government that show's such a democratic spirit—so opposite in every way to that shown by Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini and Franco.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ An Indjan subscriber in Bombay writes that some time back, at a public meeting, one of his comrades said that the white rulers of “Christendom” pray once a week upon their knees and the other six days prey upon the dark men, women and children of other lands whom they have enslaved for commercial purposes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Kingdom work which was once supervised in Burma by the Bombay, India, office has since the spring of 1938 been under the Australian office. India alone is a territory vast enough for the Indian office -to supervise; so, for the sake of convenience, the work will from now on be conducted from’the depot at Singapore, which is under the Australian office.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Even in Burma the Lord has men on His side. Some of them shared in the 1918 persecutions. During the past few years all the principal towns in Burma have been visited and much literature has been placed with the people. Thanks to Jehovah, we have had no interference from the enemy, excepting a lengthy article which appeared in three issues of the local Catholic paper, and some pulpit denunciations. The Hierarchy has many in official positions throughout Burma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On account of the assumed superiority of most Europeans out here, we get our best hearing with the Indians, and place much literature with the Tamils and Telugus, many of whom are Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the Burmese there are very few so-called “Christians”. The church-goers here are very afraid of their priests. They worship the priests more than the Creator, who alone is worthy of all praise and honor. They are slow in every respect. Recently a Church of England priest advised his flock not to listen to Jehovah’s witnesses, as they make much use of the “Old Testament”, which, he says, is now out of date and, besides, was written by imperfect and sinful men. Well, too had for this “holy” clergyman! He forgets that it was the “Old Testament'’’ that Christ called the “truth”. Another clergyman said that the Bible is a book no more inspired than a newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not long ago a great joke was played upon Roman Catholic people why own radios. They jumped for joy when it was announced that the death of Rutherford had occurred. “Aha!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">dead at last,” said some. Their joy did not last long; for on the following day the press account showed that it was Lord Rutherford, and not Judge Rutherford. What a joke!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another joke was played on a simple but staunch Roman Catholic. His son-in-law gave him a few </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font5"> booklets to distribute in church on Sunday, telling him that the booklets were specially written for Roman Catholics. He</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">did so, and got away with it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ When the Albanian princesses came to Boston, two of us from the Albanian unit of the Boston company of Jehovah’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">witnesses called at their hotel‘and presented them with a message of God’s kingdom. They received us very kindly. After brief customary greetings we asked to have our message read, to which request they readily gave consent, There were nine ,of us in audience, including the Albanian ambassador to the United States. The princesses and all present gave close attention as the following testimony was read in Albanian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">testimony</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As witnesses of Jehovah God it is our privilege and duty to testify concerning God's&quot; kingdom as we have opportunity and in the presence of any person. Having just begun a campaign of witnessing among the Albanian people of this section by means of discourses as well as literature, it ’seemed proper likewise to present a message to your R.H. on the occasion of your visit to Boston.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s kingdom or government with Christ as King is of the greatest importance. This government of righteousness is now about to be fully established and it is the only hope and the only solution to every problem that confronts the world today, be it economic, political, social, cultural, or whatever it be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The nations are in great distress at this time and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">conditions are growing worse, exactly in fulfillment of a prophetic statement uttered by Jesus concerning the present time; to wit: ‘Upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity, men’s hearts failing them for fear of what they see<sup>-</sup> coming upon them? What is more, we read in the Bible that Armageddon, the greatest war of all time, is rapidly approaching and at that time all the nations of the earth shall be supplanted by the kingdom of righteousness and peace of Jesus Christ. It shall endure forever and it will be for the common good. It will result in the complete vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The benefits and blessings of this kingdom will be so grand as to be indescribable ; and briefly they are as follows: Life everlasting with all the blessings incident thereto, such as health, happiness, prosperity, peace, joy and contentment. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord </span><span class="font5">has promised that even ‘those who are in<sup>;</sup> their graves will hear his voice and return therefrom’. These words are true; for they are not the words of any man. They are found in the Bible, the inspired Word of God,</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">In accordance with the Lord’s commandments this Kingdom message has been preached over all the earth as a warning to all people of good will, and upward of 250,000,000 books have been placed in the hands of the different peoples, translated in more than seventy languages, one of them the Albanian language. It has also been proclaimed through the radio for many years in many languages, in the Albanian language as well. We are g}ad to inform you that this message has also been proclaimed in Albania for many years and tens of thousands of books have been placed in the hands of the officials and the people of Albania for their enlightenment and comfort. However, at times, in certain parts of Albania this work is opposed and hindered, and the Roman Catholic clergy are baek of it because the Bible exposes religion as a means of the Devil to turn the people away from God and from a knowledge of his purpose. Therefore it is our desire that your R.H. use your influence that this witness work go on freely in that land. Do so, and we are confident that the Lord will remember it to your everlasting good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We shall be pleased to deliver to you, through the ambassador, some of our Bible literature so that you may have firsthand information as to the cause of the evil conditions existing today, as well as for the only remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When that part of the message that had to do with the opposition of our work by the IlierAchy was read the princesses looked at one another as to indicate that something very significant was called to their attention and as though to make a mental note, and so it was; for they later promised that they would take the matter up with their brother, King Zog.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the conclusion of our message the ambassador, Mr. Ko-nitza, turning to the princesses, reiterated by saying, “It is their wish that you use your influence that their preaching go on unmolested in Albania.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the same time he went on to say that “theirs is a ‘new’ faith, and they believe that the world [present world organization] will soon come to an end and after that Christ shall reign and then even the dead will be resurrected”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">We thought It very good indeed of the ambassador to comment as he did. incidentally, Mr. Konltza Is net at ail unfamiliar' with the Kingdom message, because a witness, prior to his coming into the truth years ago, knew him well In connection with Albania's cause for Independence, and had/on several occasions discussed the truth with him and had placed much of the literature with the present Albanian envoy. Owing to a rule of the palace, literature could npt be placed directly with the princesses, but it was suggested by the ambassador that it be forwarded through him, which we did the very next day* including the above testimony ►“-A.

<h5><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>If Your Name Were Maloney</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Suppose your naifte was Maloney, and you were a district attorney, and a Roman Catholic. and a good subject of the pope, and you did not know much about the American right of free speech, and you did not understand that the United States is a government of the people, and you thought the pope should be the real governor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And suppose WBBR broadcast a series of articles from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> entitled &quot;Jesuitized Germany”, and did broadcast one section thereof, and suppose it heated up the Jesuit brethren at Fordham University, and suppose those same brethren, by their spokesman, “Reverend Father” Cox, scorched the telephone wires to WBBR demanding an immediate copy of the script.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And then suppose you got on the wire and applied all the heat you could muster. And suppose you also demanded an immediate copy of the script. And suppose your demand eventually carne to a cool-headed American attorney who replied to your heated demand. And suppose you did not get the copy which you might have had if you had made your request like a gentleman, instead of like an Irish Catholic politician; And suppose it was indicated to you that you had been a little remiss in your politeness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And then suppose another section of the broadcast was put on the air, and your permission was not asked, and not needed. And suppose you knew that you had.no right and no power to interfere, because it was none of your business. And suppose WBBR sent word to “Reverend Father” Cox and his friends to listen in. And suppose the stage was all set for trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And suppose the editor of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> was all ready for a ride in the black wagon (either the Black Maria or the undertaker’s wagon) and you knew in your heart that you had tried to pull off a big bluff and could not get away with it, and suppose WBBR then made a monkey of you publicly over the air, and suppose everybody laughed at vou because you had barked up the wrong tree,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Wouldn’t It Make You Mad?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To make the above suppositions clear to the average reader, there now follows the introduction (written for WBBR by Judge Rutherford, by special request) to the broadcast of Part 2 of “Jesuitized Germany”;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“This station broadcasts strictly In the public Interest, public convenience and public necessity as the radio law provides. It does not Indulge In personalities nor permit its copy to be censored by individuals but tells the truth as God has commanded. &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“The present conditions that exist in Germany are so contrary to the fundamental principles Of America and so despicable in the eyes of honest men, and threats and activities of some to HitleHze America are such that this radio station deems it of great public interest, convenience and necessity to inform its audience of the facts. There is a studied effort in America, prosecuted now with vfgar by certain religionists and politicians, to control the American people as Germany Is now controlled, and the American people should be thoroughly warned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“The 'Consolation’ magazine Is devoted to the pubtl-cation of facts. Its representative regu^aety broadcasts from this station facts of importance. Last week Its representative broadcast concerning the ‘Jesuitized Ger* many', and then the fireworks began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“A phone call from someone who Identified himself as ‘Father Cox’ of the Fordham University, Informed the station that he had a,il the Jesuits of that college present to listen to the afore-mentioned broadcast and he demanded that a copy of the broadcast be sent him, and expressed himself in anger and declared his put' pose to file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;If the Jesuits wish to take the station before the Federal Communications Commission, that will be fine. We will welcome an opportunity to lay before the Federal Communications Commission, in the Interests of the public, the un-American conduct of the Jesuits and the Hierarchy to prevent the people from hearing the truth by radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Then came immediately another call from someone who Identified himself as Mr. Maloney, United States district attorney, who demanded the name of the one who broadcast the speech- He was told that a representative of ‘Consolation’ magazine was the person and that this station did not indulge In personalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“He then exploded angrily with the words: ‘It Is not customary for the district attorney's office to bicker for official information It demands-’ Asked If he was calling officially as the district attorney, he replied: ‘Certainly!' He then demanded a delivery Immediately of a transcript of the broadcast to hK office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“This station, knowing that the district attorney has nothing whatsoever to do with the radio, and also knowing that high public officials by law are the servants and not the bosses of the people, it seemed strange that such a high official would make that unusual demand- We concluded, therefore, it must be that someone else was misrepresenting that Important and distinguished public official. So It may be that it was not Mr. Maloney who called the station, but that someone used his name and his high office- Probably the Jesuits at the college induced someone to misrepresent Mr. Maloney,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Regardless of who it was, such an unusual demand and threat is In full keeping with the practice of Jesuits and others of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. They have bluffed almost every radio Station in the land and seemingly have been able to get away with it- They feel* their 'great importance’ and like to frighten the • people by threatening official action by government officials- This station does not like to be bluffed, not even by such distinguished officials as the district attorney.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Bluffing Is the extent to which the Hierarchy and the Jesuits may now go, since they have no authority to censor radio programs. The action of those Jesuits, however, is strong proof of what would take place in America if the Catholic Hlerarchy-Nazl-Jesuit combine got control of this country. This makes It doubly necessary to warn the American people, and hence our broadcast is much more than usual of public Interest* necessity and convenience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“Don’t you think the American people should hear the facts about Jesuitized Germany? We think so; and since this station is operated In the interests of the people, and to the honor of Jehovah God, and not to please some private religlo-political concern, we must go on telling the truth to the public. So now you will be pleased to listen again to the editor of ‘Consolation’.’<sup>1</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Mrs. Ethel Taranovieh, 34, housewife, New York city, had the odd misfortune to find a loaded revolver on the seat of a bus. As a lawabiding citizen she reported the matter to the first policeman and he took her to the station-house. There the highly intelligent Detective Tutt and Lieutenant Dallas placed Mrs. Taranovieh under arrest, put her in a patrol wagon, took her to headquarters, had her photographed, fingerprinted and locked up for the night. The next day the owner of the gun displayed a permit which he had held for twenty years; he is the owner of an apartment house. He got out of the bus and accidentally left the gun behind him. The magistrate was sorry the police were so stupid as to abuse a person who was trying to help them. If you were Mrs. Taranovieh and you found another gun, what would you do ? It is fortunate that not every policeman and detective is as stupid as the ones in this story. But there are far too many of them.</span></p>

When he refused they tore American flags from the wall, beat him with the flag staffs, kicked him in the groin, broke a ehair on his head, tore away his coat and shirt, scratched a swastika-on his back and chest, and left him unconscious with his skull fractured. This is a true picture of Fascism in practice. Think it over.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Rip van Winkle’s descendants must still be living in Peekskill. A judge there apparently had not heard about the decision of the Supreme Court that freedom of the press implies the right to distribute printed matter, and the governor of the state had to call the mayor of the city to Albany to tell him that Peekskill is-still in the United States. Two weeks later a postcard was delivered that was mailed in the city twenty-one years earlier and reached its destination by the somewhat leisurely speed of one block every seven years.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>As in a Glass, Darkly</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">♦ As in a glass, darkly, one can see a complete capsule picture of our somewhat scattered civilization from a certain point on the East River today. The point is the newly opened Wall Street seaplane ramp, where financial district men come in each morning in their private planes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Within five blocks of this point we find; (a) seaplanes, almost an end-product of modern technology; (b) kerosene lamps, still used in New York dwellings which have yet to reap the benefits of .electricity; (e) the financial center of the world, the Exchange, the SubTreasury; (d) clotheslines flapping between tenements shadowed by skyscrapers, (e) highspeed elevators, (f) toiletless apartments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Everybody admits that the great men of the world were foolish, in 1913, in spending some four billion dollars of the people’s money in getting ready to butcher their fellow men. But hold. In 1937 the same great men expended nearly three times as much for the same purpose. This raises a nice question in mathematics. If the smartest men in the world admit that in 24 years they have become three times as foolish as they were when they were plain idiots,. back in 1913, how many years will it be before the common people wake ujk to the fact that these so-called “higher powers” arc the representatives of the pevil and that the only hope ,of man is in the kingdom for which Jesus taught His disciples to pray?</span></p>

Fine business ; fine civilization. On the level, now, could you, down in your heart, blame the Creator if He blotted-out the whole works?

<p><span class="font5">♦ Suspecting that relief money was being spent for booze, and suspecting correctly, tl^e mayor of Woburn, Massachusetts, walked into the front door of t(jn booze joints in his city and found fifteen men and women, receiving relief from the city, who yet had plenty of money to drink intoxicating liquors at the city’s expense. They were dropped from the relief rolls, and many others will follow. Some of these men and women have children who have no shoes on their feet. The wonderful idea of handing out money by the shovelful is not so wonderful after all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Popularizing a Murderer</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a hard job to popularize a murderer, but it can be done, and is being done. It ought to be a wellpaying business, if the murderer happens to be the dictator of some 80,000,000 people. The German efficiency experts have taken more than 100,000 pictures of Hitler. In thousands of these he is shown with children, fondling them, smiling upon them. These postcards sell well and help maintain the delusion in Germany that they have something besides a mere gangster at the helm. In its December 6, 1937, issue </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font5"> had nine of these pictures. Joseph E. Bolden, a citizen of Pennsylvania, thought he knew why they were published, and wrote </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Accept my congratulations on the profound perception and keen insight registered on page 7, December 6 issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life.</span><span class="font5"> I refer to the third line of the second paragraph under the title “This is Jugend um Hitler”. Quote: “he (Hitler) is genuinely fond of children.” I am grateful that you put that in, because few people would believe it otherwise. In the next issue, to stop the mouths of whatever - carping critics may yet remain of your subscribers, it Would be an excellent idea to show equally lovely pictures of Hitler, the lover of Free Speech, consoling the bereft children of Nazi-murdered political opponents; Hitler the Tolerant, weeping bitter tears over the pitiful fate of the children of Jehovah’s witnesses in prison and concentration camp, *and dying daily from brutal treatment with other harmless minorities; Hitler the author of the Brotherhood of Man, bewailing the cruel destiny of Jewish children orphaned by storm troopers and crazed populace. By all means let us have more of these sublime records of Hitler the Bigot, Hitler the Fool, Hitler the Murderer, Hitler the Tyrant, Hitler the Madman, and we will rejoice in the glorious humanities of this new age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font5"> eame back crying that they had said at the outset that the photographs were propaganda pictures and they thought that made their position clear. But it did not satisfy Bolden, and he concluded the correspondence thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your letter of December 21 is a not too interesting example of reiteration; that is all. The editors of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font5"> must be very young and pubescent to believe that its headers are all simple-minded.

<p><span class="font5">♦ At Fast Palestine, Ohio, Mrs. Ralph W. Heck, 40 years of age, bad a pet dog that she thought was mad. It was probably nothing of the kind. But, anyway, the lady was encouraged to take the Pasteur treatment for hydrophobia. It killed her. She died, leaving her husband and three daughters. The physicians stated that the cause of death was “post vaccination paralysis”, but added that this should not deter others from taking the rabies treatment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ That was an interesting situation at Niles, Ohio, where, for over three weeks, 278 workers did not dare leave the Republic Steel plant, and the only way they could get food was to have an airplane fly overhead and drop the food in a net. The workers claimed that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">C.I.O. </span><span class="font5">men even tried to shoot down the plane.

<p><span class="font5">♦ The Nunn-Bush Shoe Company, Milwaukee, hap a sensible and practical plan of giving every employee a pay check once a week, no matter what the condition of business. All pay into a wage fund. Each has a drawing account. As business improves the drawing account is subject to improvement. As slack times come on the amount is reduced, but the worker always has something coming in. In three years in which the plan operated the annual income of the average worker rose from $1,008 to $1,385. Eleven hundred men and women are employed, and only one person was discharged in three years. New employees are taken on probation, and may be discharged in six months by a vote of the employees.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Now Congress is interested, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the people </span><span class="font5">of Iowa are interested, because an eUirnent-eitizen, with a good knowledge of the advantages to the public of pit Wie-owned utilities, is fbund to have received $24,000 in the last five years simply to keep his mouth shut and not tell the people of Fort Dodge and vicinity anything that ‘'may be regarded by the United Light and Power Co. as being inimical or against the interest or property of the said company or any </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5"> its subsidiaries”.

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>Catholic Action</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font5">HAT is known as “Catholic Action” is a world-wide movement originating in the mind of the present-day pope to further the interests of the political religions organization known as- the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Many persons do not understand exactly what “Catholic Action” means or what is its purpose. This magazine has heretofore called attention to the strangle-hold that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has on Australia. In defining “Catholic Action” a publication recently issued by the Legislative Committee of the Loyal ’Orange Institution of New Zealand has this to say: “‘Catholic Action’ is a movement inaugurated by Pope Pius XI directed to be extended to every country to advance the interests of the Roman Catholic Church, not as a Christian spiritual institution, hut-as a political organization to dominate governments, to control the making and administration of the law by securing the election to the legislature and local authorities of Romanists or non-Romanists who will favor that Church and by the appointment of Romanists to the principal offices in the Civil Service, in local bodies’ administration and in all public bodies. Further, business houses, factories, trade unions, sports bodies, etc., are all included in the ambit of this papal organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">short time ago the archbishop of Australia addressed the “Catholic Action Guild” at Sydney, and, amongst other things, he said with reference to New South Wales: “The public service today ^is ip the grip of the Roman Catholic Church. It is 63-pereent Roman Catholic. The applicants for positions are f)2-per-cent Catholic, and within the next five years it is the demand of the Holy Father that the civil service shall be 100-perecnt Roman Catholic.” Continuing his speech, the archbishop further stated that every department of the transportation, both road and rail, in each section is splendidly organized, that the Police </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEMBER 28, 1938 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and Postal departments have their particular attention in the organization; and then he gave the instruction that where a vacancy occurs the Catholic must be placed a step higher, and further said: “Care must be taken that no susp^ion can be raised as to the number of Catholics as against non-Cat holies.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one has ever denied the Catholics the right to preach their doctrines, but when that organization is turned from religious to political action wholly, then it is time for the people to awaken to the danger. For many years the Hierarchy have had their covetous eyes on the United States. That organization is fully determined to gain complete control of the political affairs of the United States of America. For several years the Watch Tower publications have been calling the people’s attention to the ambitious efforts of the Hierarchy to gtrin control of and rule America. Probably now, since the secular press is publishing daily as a matter of news the activities of the Hierarchy in conjunction wuth the leading politicians of America, such may have a tendency to open the eyes_of some people to the real danger. The Protestant clergy seem to have gone completely to sleep. They give no heed to the warning, and at least give their silent support to Catholic Action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the political administrative departments of the nation and of every state the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has placed its trusted agents and representatives. These men are first for the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and secondarily for whatsoever state or government they represent. In practically every metropolitan newspaper in America there are trusted agents of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy ■who keep the Hierarchy officials duly informed as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">what is going on and see to it that the publication of things derogatory to the Hierarchy is reduced to the minimum. There has never before been sueh an organized effort jjut forth by any people under the sun to get </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">control </span><span class="font5">of the entire earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' Fascists, Nazis and the Roman ' Catholic Hierarchy arc working together, the Hierarchy occupying the place of spiritual overlord and a kind of super-government over the others. This combine first grabbed Italy, then Germany. It carried on an unholy war ‘in destroying AbyssiiSa. For two years it has been prosecuting a revolution in Spain. And the efforts of such organization are ex. tended to every part of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two years ago I called attention to the peo-pie of Switzerland that the' Fascists, Nazis and Hierarchy combine would grab Switzerland. That statement so incensed the Hierarchy that they caused the police to announce the rule that no alien could make a speech hereafter in Switzerland unless -he first filed a copy of it with the Police Department. Now, on the 5th of November, 1938, the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> carries a double-column headline as follows: “Switzerland Is Ripe for Picking by Nazis.'&quot; zimongst other things, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post </span><span class="font5">says: “It is an 'open secret that'the Swiss army officers corps contains numerous Nazi sympathizers. They argue that Switzerland was once a part of Germany and that modern ■ conditions have deprived it of any economic reason for independent existence.” “It is rumored that there is an agreement between Hitler and Mussolini giving German-Switzerland to Hitler and the canton Tessin and the southern part of Graubuenden to Italy, making the Lake of Geneva the border between the tw'o Fascist nations. Switzerland is ripe for the picking and Berlin knows it. . . . There are enough Nazi spies and Nazi propagandists in Switzerland to create a temporary reign of terror whenever the signal is given. After that the same old program: intervention to defend the 130,000 Reich Germans living in Switzerland.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Catholic Action is stronger in Switzerland today than at any other time since the time of William Tell. The republic is completely doomed. This result has been brought about by Catholic Action in Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It appears' that America will not awaken to the danger until it is too late and a Fascist Hierarchy dictator will rule this nation. Such is the aim of Catholic Action, and many of the leading politicians of America are working hand in glove with the Hierarchy to accomplish this result. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

Uranus is only 1,782,000,000 miles from the sun, but this new star has itself a radius of approximately 2,000,000,000 miles. “What is man, that thou art mindful of him?”—Psalm 8:4.</span></p>

The Mediterranean is *luer than the Atlantic, for the same reason. The waters around the Poles are green because, less salty than those nearer the equator; hence the edges of the Gulf Stream are clearly discernible. The Yellow sea is yellow because of the sediment brought down by the Yellow river.

<p><span class="font5">♦ The proposed division of Palestine pleased nobody. The Jews were to get a national home in Palestine, but without Jerusalem, their ancient capital. They would be given a state the size of Delaware, and no more than ten to fifteen miles wide in many places, with Arabs on all their borders and 225,000 Arabs in their state itself. And the two largest Jewish commercial concerns, the potash works on the Dead sea and the power station at Tiberias, would be in Arabian lands entirely.-The suggestion has been made that this proposed division, entirely unacceptable to great numbers of Americans, is Solomon’s plan, without Solomon’s wisdom. The baby is actually being divided, but after it is divided nobody fcants it. The Jews and Arabs would both do better to get along together. They must do so sometime; why not now?</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ The murder by Arabs of James Leslie Starkey, noted archaeologist, near the ancient eity of Lachish, Palestine, brought into public view some very interesting facts. It establishes that the oldest alphabetical script was that used by the Israelites from the time of Moses; that the Phoenicians got their script from the Hebrews; that many of the most prominent Israelites mentioned in the Scriptures in the days of Jeremiah, and back to the days of King Saul, were well knowm in Lachish ; and that the so-called “Higher Criticism of the Bible” is left without a leg to stand on.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ American archaeologists definitely located the port of Ezion-Geber, mentioned in 1 Kings 9: 26-28, but in the centuries since. .Solomon and Hiram used it for a naval base the sands drifted in until it is now a half mile from the sea. Among other treasures recovered were even some of the ropes used to moor King Solomon’s ships. These were found well preserved, buried in the desert sands.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ The Syrian expedition of the University of Chicago, under the field direction of Dr. Calvin AV. McEwan, unearthed at Teij Tainat, in ■ North Syria, the remains of what is believed to be the porch of an ancient Hittite palace. The carving and general construction of the columns show that at that date (about 800 B.C.) men were remarkably skilled in architecture and sculpture and as far removed from the mythical monkey as men are today, or perhaps a bit farther.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>Jews Benefit Arabs in Palestine</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The Jews in Palestine own less than 10 percent of the land, but pay 60 percent of the taxes. Before the World War 20,000 Arabs emigrated from Palestine each year. Since the Jews have brought in agricultural and industrial development 250,000 Arabs have come into Palestine to share in the prosperity. The. growth of the Arab population of Palestine is greater than in any otbfer Arab country, but there is such jealousy of the Jews that the lives of the latter are in constant danger.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ The present Jerusalem, covering fifteen times the area of the ancient city, has 70,000 Jews, 23,000 Moslems and 21,000 Christians. It is a modern city of gardens, factories, schools, synagogues, hospitals and colleges.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>Great Religionists: Catherine de Medici</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">VENTS that occurred several hundred years ago possess an unreality that historians can hardly enliven. Perhaps the most unbelievable of these recorded events are the unspeakable horrors of the rack, the garrote, the torture tweezers, and the stake, as means to “convert to God and to the pope”. Among </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> readers are many who know something of the agonies of life. There are some who have helplessly witnessed a sufferer .with acute toothache; others have observed a loved one undergoing the racking labor pains; and more have yearned to give anodyne for a wounded comrade, to a brave woman contorted in the spasm of kidney col' ; or enduring the tearing of the internals from gallstone, or for the many terrible sufferings which through accident or peradventure afflict humanity. In order,,then, to bring the Inquisition accurately to mind, picture, .if possible, hundreds of years and millions of victims actually unnecessarily tortured by horrors worse than these sufferings; pitiable victims whose cries were muffled by the thick walls of the Inquisition chamber; crippled men, women over eighty years old, pothers large with child so that the torturing device must be increased to accommodate the swelling abdomen ; all these terrors were used to scourge the “heretic”, who was anyone with wealth or possessions coveted by the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the inhuman machines employed to “convert heretics” was the iron horse, whose backbone formed the blade of a knife; the naked victims were mounted astride, and, to assist the process of-slitting, weights on the legs pulled the agonized sufferer downward, bisecting his body from crotch to head. Thus this organization did its work. As foul as a buzzard’s breath, it was even worse than a vulture in this; that it slew as well as devoured its victims; and worse than a hawk in that even the falcon accords its prey the decency of a quick death; but the Inquisition tormented to death, then ravened upon the substance of the murdered 1 And even on top of this they added further crime: the name of Christ, who spent a part of His ministry healing the afflicted, was given and called upon this monster of robbery, rape- and murder I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this point it seems appropriate to introduce Catherine de Medici, one of the actors upon this stage of blood. Catherine de Medici, queen of Henry II of France, was born in Florence, Italy, in 1519. “She was the only daughter of Lorenzo de Mcdiei, Duke of Urbino, and the niece of Pope Clement VII.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">{Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font5"> Vol, 6, page 55) “She was the mother of four sons, of whom three became kings of France in her own lifetime. . . . Catherine was equally gifted with beauty and talents . . . When the death of [her husband] Henry II in 1559 made her mistress of herself, she plunged her children in a whirl of pleasures, partly to enervate them by dissipation, partly from a natural inclination toward prodigality; and in the midst of these extravagances cruel and bloody Tneasures were executed, the memofy of which still makes men shudder.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Ency. Americana, </span><span class="font5">same&quot; page) It was in the reign of her second son, Charles IX, that she maneuvered the Massacre of St. Bartholomew; but this was not the only one in the years of civil war which harrowed her thirty years’ sway; the Protestant Huguenots were slain also in the Vassy Massacre, which, according to- </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font5"> (Vol. Ill, page 443), “opened the first religious war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to properly place Catherine de Medici in the stream of history, a few of her contemporaries are named. Her rulership was more or less contemporary with the reign of Queen Elizabeth of England; her own daughter Elizabeth was married to Philip II of Spain after the death of his wife “Bloody Queen Mary”. Besides being inculcated with the villainous “principles” of Catholicism prevalent throughout most of Europe at the time, and ably led by her uncle, Pope Clement VII, she was a friend of the infamous Duke of Alva who ravaged Europe in the pope’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The full narration of the crimes of this woman can be but briefly hinted at in this sketch. But the words of n timer Jus authorities on the Massacre of St. Bartholomew’s Day will serve to place before the student’s mind the caliber of work that may always be expected from religionists. Catherine was an exponent of the brand of religion advocated by the Duke of Alva, who “stained his reputation as a general by new cruelties, his exe</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">cutioners shedding more blood than his soldiers” ; and of the pope who “presented f Alva[ with a consecrated hat and sword, a distinction previously conferred only on princes”, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Ency. Americana,</span><span class="font5"> Vol. I, page 458) “The Massacre of St. Bartholomew was her work.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Ency.</span><span class="font5"> dm. l</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19381228_files/g_E_19381228-23.png" alt="" style="width:198pt;height:242pt;">
<p><span class="font5">Why, Inki!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">This horrible slaughter was purposed to annihilate all Protestant opposition with which Catherine had been temporizing for some years. To accomplish her purpose she had thJ assistance of the Guises, the Catholie ducal house, and, of course, the “blessing” of the pope. “The idea of putting to death Coligny and a few Huguenot chiefs by sudden arrest and trial for treason had been pressed upon her again and again from Rome and Spain and by some of the ultra Catholics like Nevers, Montpensier, and Mo-luc. . . . The Duke of Guise was her instrument.” To carry out the plot her son the king must be made to act. On this the historian writes: “Seven witnesses who were in Paris at the time agreed that his mother [Catherine] and oldest brother, the Duke of Anjou, were the chief agents in persuading Charles IX to consent to the ugliest deed that stains the history of any modern European nation.” “Catherine afterwards claimed that the deed had been done for the glory of God and the honor of the churoin” (All quotations in this paragraph from Paul Van Dyke’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Catherine, de Medici,</span><span class="font5"> Vol. II, pages 83-88.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After a cabal with the Guises and the king and several Catholic prelates it was decided to wipe,out a!14he Huguenots of importance, most of whom were in Paris at the time. (August, 1572) The slaughter began with Admiral Coligny, who lay on a bed, wounded by a Catholie traitor. After his murder the Duke of Guise who bad been entrusted with the commission asked that his body be thrown </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEMBER®, 1938 </span><span class="font5">down for recognition. “ Tt is he, I know him,’ he said, and kicked him in the face, and mounted and rode off.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Catherine de Medici</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Lost Revolution,</span><span class="font5"> page 460)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Murder then went rampant. “It is impossible to draw an exact and ordered picture of those terrible hours when murder spread with the dawn from the palace through the slums of the city, until the corpses of the King’s wedding guests lay’ piled in front of his door and, as an observer wrote, 'blood ran down the gutters like water after a heavy rain.’ ” (Van Dyke’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Catherine de Medici, </span><span class="font5">Vol. II, page 89) Then the “mob of Paris rose and killed every living creature suspected of heresy upon whom they could lay their hands”. (Same, p. 90) “By the King’s orders the massacre was extended through the whole kingdom.,.. This horrible slaughter continued over 40 days; the victims are calculated at from 10,000 to 100,000. . . . At Rome the massacre was given out as a victory over a great Huguenot conspiracy against the King; it was for this reason that the Pope ordered the ‘Te Deum’ to be chanted and a medal struck commemorating the event.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font5"> Vol. 3, page 292)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Knowing the avarice of the Rome of that day and this day and every day, the Massacre of St. Bartholomew is more understandable in the light of the system which was then practiced by the Inquisitioners generally. On this the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia liritannica,</span><span class="font5"> Vol. 14, page 590, regarding the confiscation of the property of heretics, states: “From the point of view of its economic history the importance of the confiscation is supreme. ... In the kingdom of France there was a special official . . . whose duty it was to collect the personal property of heretics and to inco: porate their landed estates in the royal d main. . . . Soon the Papacy managed to gam a share of the spoils, even outside the states of the church, as is shown by the bulls ad </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">extirpanda</span><span class="font5"> of Innocent IV and Alexander IX [both popes], and henceforth the inquisitors had in varying proportions a direct interest in these spoliations. , .-. In . . . France, Italy and Germany, the property of those convicted of heresy was shared between the lay and ecclesiastical authorities. . . . Confiscation was indeed most profitable to the [Catholic] secular princes, and there is no doubt that the hope of considerable gain was what induced many princes to uphold the inquisitorial administration. . . . Any contract entered into with a heretic was void. , . . Posthumous trials were frequent . . . sentences were pronounced after death of 89 persons during a period of 115 years. But not only was their property confiscated and their heirs disinherited; they were subject to still further penalties. Frederick II [pope] extended to heresy the application of the Roman law disqualifying from holding office and even included under its operation the children and grandchildren of the guilty man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Net result, the Papacy was enriched; much of the great wealth and power it now uses to squelch freedom of speech and press and to prosecute wars of aggression was accumulated from the property of murdered innocents. Thus one of the chief motives of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew is made clear; a motive which historians have generally overlooked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now a few more commentaries about the notorious religionist. Catherine de Mediei. “She went, about crying ‘Peace’, where there was no peace.” “She deceived [the Huguenots] by fine words . . . while all the time she was weaving their destruction.” “About virtue she did not care at all.” (Edith SichePs </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Later </span><span class="font5">Years </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of Catherine de Medici,</span><span class="font5"> pages 426, 427) “ At her death France was in a state of complete dismemberment.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font5"> Vol. 6, page 55) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is but one reason to harrow our readers with a review of these events of past history: it is to point out the similarity of the ancient inquisitors and. the pope’s modern allies and to clarify the similar motives behind the depredations of the perpetual inquisition. A United Press dispatch of November 10, 1938, carried by the San Diego </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sun </span><span class="font5">has the headlines “Nazis Round Up Jews; Mobs Burn Temples”. Horrible Jewish per-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">22</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">secutions were described as retaliation for the shooting of a German embassy secretary in Paris. Such wholesale murder and attack is made to appear in its real dress by the headlines of the same paper on November 12, 1938 : “Jews Must Pay $406,000,000. Nazis Levy Fine as Reprisal for Killing.” Thus is made clear the motives of the pope’s present inquisition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a previous article it was remarked that Priest Patrick O’Brien stated that the Catholics afe ready prepared in America for 1940, and speaks of Roosevelt as the Catholics’ choice; Dr. E. Boyd Barrett, in his expose </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rome Stoops to Conquer,</span><span class="font5"> makes the aims of Catholic Action in America certain. An Associated Press dispatch carried by the Los Angeles </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> o f October 17, describing the Catholic Eucharistic Congress in New Orleans, states; “Tomorrow night at a reception in the , City Auditorium Postmaster General Farley, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">representing President Roosevelt—</span><span class="font5">will speak.” Is it not apparent that America is heading for Catholicism, Fascism and hence for a Papal dictatorship, or totalitarian rule, like Germany’s? Let Americans demember that when they subscribe to this order' of tyranny not only do they get Catholicism, but they get the inquisition and the end of all truth. Motto of Rome: Once the Inquisition always the Inquisition. The leopard never changes its spots! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is the third in a series of biographies comparing the ancient and the modern Inquisition. The previous sketches brought out the facts that: first, the present supporters and allies' of the pope, such as Tlitler^ Mussolini, and Franco, in their fiendish destruction of freedom and life, had their example and model in such Roman Catholic Inquisitioners as “Bloody Mary” and Torque mada; second, the ancient Catholic Inquisition, practiced ostensibly for the purpose of cleaning out heresy, was actually carried on to enrich the “Holy Office”, the Hierarchy and the pope;' ■ third, the Inquisition, such as the dispossessing of Jews and the torture and death of others in the Hierarchy-ridden countries of Germany and Italy </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">today,</span><span class="font5"> has for its purpose the same objective of robbery lastly, the Inquisition will never eease tftitil the Roman Catholic Hierarchy ceases. The motto of Rome is repeated: Once the Inquisition always the Inquisition. The leopard never changes its spots! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ President Roosevelt was in a fine humor when he addressed the Daughters of the American Revolution the other day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I thought of preaching on a text, but I won’t,” he said. “I will only give you the text and won’t preach on it.</span></p>

That annoys him and he wants to blow the .whistle, but alw'ays loses his nerve in fear that any power which is able to buffalo a big fat client might be able to run him clear out of town.

After expulsion from the allegedly Protestant Gold Coast colony, Mr. Brown was received without question into the allegedly Roman Catholic French colony of Dahomey. It is ' strange, but true, that agents of the Hierarchy in Protestant lands are often far more unreasonable than those in lands where the people, from long experience, know more about their methods. But they won't be able to get away with it much longer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Up in the extreme northeastern corner of the Belgian Congo, near the border line of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, is a village by the name of Dungu, in the tribe of the Zandes. A missionary returned from there after twenty years’ experience states that the present price, of good wives in Bungu is $4.50 each; that it is not unusual for a Zandes buck to size up a couple as to their health and good looks and to make a bargain with them for the first girl baby that is borne to them. Payments are 'made on installments, and if payments, are not made regularly as agreed the girl’s parents or brothers reclaim her.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ The Manchester </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font5"> is authority for the statement that though children in Spanish colonies in Africa must be fifteen before they may be recruited for certain kinds pf work, and the children in Portuguese and French colonies must be respectively fifteen and fourteen years of age, yet in Kenya, which is under British rule, they may be recruited at ten years ot age, and if the child for any reason breaks the contract which has been made for it (as by flight, for instance) it is liable to fine or imprisonment, as are also its parents. The age was formerly twelve.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ In one of the numerous insurrections occurring in Ethiopia, the Italian authorities sent their own native Eritrean troops to rout the invaders. The Ethiopians got word of the advance and moved their own camp several miles away during the night. When the Eritreans arrived at the former place they found it vacant and made their own camp there. Early in the morning Italian bombers appeared over them and bombed and machine-gunned them for two hours. Hundreds of the Eritrean troops were killed, and the others fled.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ One of the trees most useful to man Is the baobab, the trunk of which sometimes grows to 30 feet in diameter. As the wood is remarkably soft, natives of Africa sometimes hollow out the tree, which then makes a fine home. The tree produces a fruit from which is obtained a very cooling drink containing citrate of magnesia. The leaves, made into food by a pounding process, constitute a staple diet article in many places. Clothing material is obtained from the fibers of the bark. The wood is too soft to be formed into timber.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ The so-called “sausage tree” of Central Africa bears a fruit used for food, drink and clothing. The fruit may be eaten either raw or cooked; when the pulp is squeezed and fermented it makes a delicious drink; and the dried fibrous meat of the fruit makes excellent sandals, bath mats and carpets. What a wonderful place this earth is bound to be under its new King and Ruler!</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Student enrollment at German universities decreased 28 percent in five years of Nazi control. Of the professors 1,684 were dismissed as not being down to the Nazi standard. The present rector of the University of Berlin worked in a slaughterhouse for 37 years, a grimly ironical fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of the fact that Nazi schools are reported to be taking the place of Roman Catholic schools in Austria and 3,000 nun teachers in Germany have reputedly been replaced with Nazi instructors, Johan Bircher, professor of religion in Vienna College, expressed the opinion of his fellow priests to the number of four hundred, gathered together for the same purpose, when he issued Vhe statement :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no conflict between the principles of National Socialism and the Catholic Church. There is no reason why a good German Catholic priest cannot also be a good National Socialist.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The outstanding example of demoniac possession in our times is a man' named Hitler. The demons have possession of him and his, and are hurrying him and his to destruction. He cannot, if he would, stop them now. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The demons of fear, of force, of brutality, of faithlessness, of pride and mass insanity are shoving Hitler and- Germany to destruction.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark182"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark183"></a>The Sinking of the Panay</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">Sunday, December 12, 1937, the United States gunboat Panay, lying anchor in Nanking, realized that the city would soon be attacked by </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:line-through;"><sub>r</sub> w</span><span class="font5">z-J the Jap<sub>anese;</sub> and started to move, upstream with nearly all the Americans in the city on board. At 9:30 in the morning of that day a Japanese lieutenant and party of soldiers boarded the ship, getting full facts as to its nationality and destination. Four hours later the boat was bombed, machine-gunned and sunk. Three days later Japanese citizens in Tokyo halted Americans in the streets or called at their offices to express their regret at the hasty and needless destruction of life. The essential fact is that the Japanese government has no control over the Japanese army or navy, but the latter are amenable only to the emperor, supposed to be a direct descendant of one of the gods. It is manifest that the Japanese people, as a people, do not wish war with America. The Panay was convoying three Standard Oil tankers at the time- it was sunk.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark184"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark185"></a>Cut Off Her Own Hair</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Many striking things happened in Japan to show the innate politeness of the Japanese people, at the time of the Panay incident. One dramatic incident happened at the American embassy when a woman came in, expressing her regret and sympathy in a. trembling voice, and suddenly whipped out a pair of shears and cut off her hair, to show that she really meant what she said. It wtw a typically Japanese move, somewhat akin to the custom of hara-kiri, where a man who has been mortal Jy offended by a fellow citizen commits suicide by disemboweling himself on the man’s doorstep, to express his deep regret at the occurrence.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark186"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark187"></a>China’s Military Highway</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">♦ China’s great military highway, being built by a million laborers to connect western China with Soviet Russia, was probably started too late to accomplish its intended purpose of bringing China and Russia within two weeks of each other, by automobile truck. But the road will probably be completed in due course, and if no war supplies stream into China over it, it will nevertheless be of real value and importance in the better days that will follow the present evil ones.’</span></p>

The Japs in Korta put pressure on all Koreans to join in “patriotic” exercises at Shinto shrines. The Presbyterians, to their credit, flatly refused, and their schools were closed as a consequence. But Horace and other missionaries from the northern parts of the United States kept their schools open. They did it, so Horace says, by “making a slight inclination of the head and body” when the command was given to salute. Horace probably never read the story of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, and if he did he'thought it was only folklore and not worth remembering or imitating. His idea'seems to be, Why lose your job when you can keep the / good long green coming in by a judicious, medium-sized bending of your head and body $</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ It takes J,000 silkworms to make a pound of silk, and it is estimated to have taken 220,000,000,000 wmrms to produce the 73,000,000 pounds of raw’ silk which Japan exported in 1935. Three-fourths of this went to the United States. The silkworm eats fifty times its own weight in fresh mulberry leaves, but, after attaining full size (about three inches long), begins the weaving of its beautiful shroud which afterwards encases milady’s lovely form, or some of it.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark192"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark193"></a>Burning Up Japanese Boys</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">♦ War consists of burning up boys in their teens and early twenties, to get out of their bodies the last ounce of energy possible. In their operations in China the Japanese soldiers are being given energy tablets for this purpose, and in some instances the soldier inhales oxygen provided in small tubes and released into a rubber-silk bag. Mere murder machines are men whose minds are poisoned by propaganda, their blood by serums, and their lungs and nerves by this latest bedevilment.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">imwpjiEf &quot;NOW, I’ll pull you on the sled,” offered Bunny, as Buddy turned the sled around at the top of the JsM^hill. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I’m too heavy,” Buddy explained. “But we go easy on the snow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Not uphill, we don’t. Let’s ride down once more, then go into the house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“All right,” agreed Bunny. Quickly she sat down behind her brother and wound her chubby little arms around his neck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“No, Bunny. You sit in front of me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“&quot;But we go so fast I shut my eyes,” Bunny declared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Just the same, you must sit here where I can hold on to you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Oh, all right.” Bunny slipped into place and the sled started on its downward journey. Faster and faster it flew. Bpnny held her breath and shut her eyes.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19381228_files/g_E_19381228-25.png" alt="" style="width:45pt;height:45pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">All at once Buddy knew he couldn’t stop the sled in time. He was glad Bunny always shut her eyes. Pulling hard on the left rope and pushing with his right foot, he turned the sled sharply and guided it down over a small bank, turning over at last in a soft snow drift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not until the snow began tumbling all about her did Bunny know that this ride was any different from the others they’d taken that .day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Are </span><span class="font5">you hurt?” Buddy asked anxiously, crawling out of a hole into which he had fallen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But Bunny didn’t answer. She was stooping ■ever, peering into the hole from which her brother had crawled. “What is it?” she asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“AVhat is what?” asked Buddy, puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“That little round thing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Buddy followed the tip of Bunny’s tiny finger. There in a little hollow filled with dead leaves and grass, and slightly protected by an overhanging rock, lay a small furry thing. It was of a reddish-brown color with black and white stripes down its back. Just now it was huddled in a far corner of the hollow, rolling its soft brown eyes about in fright.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A chipmunk!” Buddy cried. “Bunny, it’s a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEMBER28, 1938 </span><span class="font5">chipmunk. We’ve come tumbling right through the roof of his winter home, and he doesn’t like it. Poor thing! he’s frightened half to death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“How do you know it’s a—a—one of those things?” Bunny wanted to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Because I’ve seen many of them during the summer. And ih the fall, too.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“What’s he doing here?” ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“This is where he’s staying while it is too cold to run about. Jane told me al] about chipmunks one day when we were out in the woods.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Tell me,” Bunny begged, eagerly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Well,” Buddy began proudly, “they gather things to eat in the fall—nuts and acorns and things. They carry them in little pockets in their cheeks, as squirrels do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Do they get tired?” Bunny interrupted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“How would I knew that? Anyway, they make a nice winter hofne under the ground. They have two rooms—one to sleep in and one to put food in.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Don’t they have a room to eat in ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;No, of course not. They make little tunnels from their rooms so they can go outside without anyone finding their home.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;I see a tunnel,” Bunny said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sticking out her little feet, she w<sup>r</sup>as just ready to slide down into the chipmunk’s bedroom when Buddy grabbed her. “I see it now,” he said. &quot;You don’t need to go down.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bunny looked disappointed. &quot;I want to find the room where he puts nuts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Maybe we can see it from up here,” said Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The room was not hard to find—simply another hollow, filled with the things a chipmunk likes and can store away. Shells here and there had been brushed into the leaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chipmunk, finding that no one was going to hurt him, had taken a step or twp forward and was gazing up at the two children, .a little curious about the uninvited guests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Finding some sturdy sticks and a few flat stones, Buddy set about to mend the broken hofise, piling on top of it what clods of frozen earth he could find, and leaving the tunnel free. Snow over it all soon hid from sight the little home down under the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I’m glad we fell over,” Bunny sighed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">British Comment</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By J. Hemery (London)</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark196"></a>The Political Situation</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">• The recent crisis in Europe, and which brought Britain to the verge of war with Germany, has let loose a multitude of voices. There is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">growing amount of criticism of the Munich agreement. Many of the critics are party politicians, sincere in their beliefs. They not only criticize the agreement which put Czechoslovakia into Hitler’s hands, but the policy of the Government which, they say, allowed the crisis to develop; they aver that had their party been in power the trouble could not have happened. Some who are merely party politicians, whether for or against the government, are seeking to make gain out' </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the crisis. The Communists, who are not numerous, but active and assertive, take the chance of pushing their theory and their war against capitalism. On the other hand, some energetic and influential members of Mr. Chamberlain’s own (Tory) party went so far as to engage a firm of publicity agents to boost Mr. Chamberlain, while the going was good. Naturally Mr. Chamberlain squashed the business as soon as he heard of it. But that the political situation in Britain is totally changed by reason of the recent events is admitted by all. British people will be compelled to a different manner of life: there will be less liberty for the individual, and more general restrictions </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">business and for the community. It is realized that as a nation it can no longer afford to wait to take action when a danger or a crisis arises, but must be prepared for aggression. The advocates of conscription for the army and navy are already making themselves heard; and there are the milder but very insistent cries for registration of the man (and woman) power of the people, and for some kind of regimentation. The premier has promised that conscription shall not come about during this present Parliament ; but it is “in the air”, and-the war clouds gather quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is now admitted that London was very badly prepared to resist an enemy air raid. About 100 anti-aircraft guns were hastily .got into position, but it has. been openly stated that (July 50 of these were fit to be called effective. Paris, which perhaps rightly was considered to be more exposed to air raids, had more than 500 such guns ready in position. It is also now admitted that there was much muddling in the hurried attempts to get the people fitted with gas masks. The. trenches and underground shelters dug in the parks are to remain; the shelters are to be better prepared than the hasty work allowed for, and there will be little outward sign of the upheavals made. It was a relief to the people to see the sandbags removed from the government offices and the public buildings, and there was a general settling down, with the heartfelt desire that normal life would be resumed. What has become of the gas masks is not easy to say: perhaps because of hope for the future, or because of having Little faith in the ability of the masks to give protection, many of them were destroyed or cast into the nearest dustbin. It was reported that in one section pf Paddington district no less than 173 masks were found in the refuse cans. Probably the Air Raid authorities will try to keep up precaution demonstrations so as to keep the people alive to the need, for the plain fact is that there is now no &quot;front line trench” as in the last war. The front line is the homes of the people, and to such a case has the world been brought by their break from &quot;the everlasting covenant”, which God established for the rule of mankind after the Flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The crisis and the Munich agreement have thrown the politics of a great part of Europe and of Britain into the melting pot. Germany stands where it did, but is greatly strength- &lt;&nbsp;ened both in material matters and in prestige; the others must adjust themselves to the facts, and Britain is greatly affected in its domestic life and foreign policy. Hitherto France has for a long time taken the position of being the dominant continental power, always expectant of Britain’s aid, and somewhat aggressive in the expectancy because of Britain’s need to have a friendly power on the south side of the English Channel. Now France has dropped to a lower place in national estimates; for Germany, at present backed by Italy, can assert herself in Central and Western European affairs. In consequence both Britain and France must review both their military and economic changed situation. It may reasonably be presumed that Germany will for a time be kept busy with the harvesting of the rich material resources into which its victory over</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">, <sub>;</sub> Czechoslovakia has opened the way. Already :this business is well attended to, for Germany’s need was great and the harvest ready for the - reaping. It is not likely that Germany will trouble the French Maginot line, at tremendous cost in men and material, while it has the much rtiore profitable occupation of gathering in riches from the central and southeastern countries of Europe and at no expense to itself.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark197"></a>Il Duce and His Empire</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• Although at the present II Duce is Hitler’s “very dear friend”, it by no means follows that he will allow Hitler to determine his course of action or to thwart his purposeful policy. No doubt Mussolini wants to maneuver Britain into such a position as will enable him to make a good bargain for himself at Britain’s cxpen'se; yet, with his newly gained empire to consider, he can hardly afford to get into an aggressive dispute with Britain, While it is true that the national interests of the British Empire and those of France would be very seriously threatened or impaired by the Mediterranean’s becoming impassable as a means of vital communication, it is also true that the same would affect Italy’s communications with Abyssinia. If the Mediterranean and Red seas were closed to Italy’s shipping, Abyssinia would certainly be lost to Italy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>Hong Kong and Japan</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• The unexpected fall of Canton to Japan, <sup>z </sup>only nine days after the Japs landed on the coast 150 miles from the city, and the eonse-quent control gained over southern China, is attributed by some French newspapers to a measure of complaisance on the part of the British. Perhaps they are not very far from the truth in this suggestion, and it may be that there is a measure of truth also in the constant suggestions that the British Government favors the B erl i h-Rome-J ap a nese-Fascist combination. The moves in the political world are in themselves no particular concern of Jehovah’s witnesses, of those who are true and faithful disciples of Christ; but as this is the day of Jehovah’s judgment of the nations, having placed His Son as King in His holy hill of Zion, according to His Word, in the second Psalm; and as this great King is now maneuvering the forces of evil that they may be</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">revealed in their opposition to God and to righteousness, these things are -watched with interest by the faithful witnesses to God and the establishment of His kingdom, and the destruction at Armageddon. And all the time there comes confirmation of the instructiongiven them from the Scriptures, and of the warning given to the nations, and particularly so in respect to the warning to the* world by Judge Rutherford in his speech so recently. Then and in London he warned all who would hear of the combined forces of totalitarian states and religion who by force and subtilty would make the attempt to put all the world under their control, and against God and His King.' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark199"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>Confirmation</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">• In his public speech in London on September 11 Judge Rutherford stated that the totalitarian monster prefigured by Goliath [See top of p. 18.], and already striding about Europe, would get Switzerland into its clutches. The Geneva correspondent of the Manchester Guardian, writing on October 23, reports the Swiss as being much disturbed by reason of a strong German hint (published in a German journal and supposedly “inspired”) which says in effect that Germany' is determined to have the economic hegemony of the continent, and that it will be to the hurt of Switzerland if that country does not go into the German economic orbit. The pincers which closed on Czechoslovakia will surely squeeze Switzerland.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>Tumult of Voices</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">• One commentator says of the many voices venting opinions about the crisis, its causes and its outcome, “Never before was there such an uproar of opinions. The infernal racket stuns reason. There has been nothing like it since Babel”; and in irony, and contempt of the actions of the politicians and their backers during the past twenty years, says, “Twenty years after the Last shot (of the great war) and the cheering, victory goes to the vanquished, After spending one million lives, and 8,000 millions sterling, what has one to show for it ? Free gas masks! That is all!” He adds, writing of Hitler and his spell over the German people, “We know all we need of his military power: the newsreels have shown ns these Wagnerian properties of his. What we never knew before this was the dread of war in the minds of his people. Now we know it is there, an unpremeditated outcome o£ the visit of Mr, Chamberlain, Hitler realized this, to his one great surprise. The repressed desire for peace, and.to be let alone, was freed in the German people. For once the multitude could shoiU loud for a reason which at other times has put Germans in concentration camps. The Germans were not like that in 1914.” He con-eludes: “Nationalism is an infectious disease of■the mind, sure to bring disaster , . . and its propagandists are morally no better than those engaged in an underhand traffic in drugs/'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These are plain words. Undoubtedly the German people do not now’ want war, however much in 1914 they were ready for the glory of conquest. Nor do the peoples of earth want war. It is ambitious men, whether moved by desire for power or wealth, that bring wars between the peoples, made helpless victims of their schemes. But the futility of the measures for peace, after the wickedness and devastation of war, and the root causes of wars are things which neither leaders nor the people will consider. That God has in His Word stated that all human creatures are born out of harmony with Him and His righteousness is something they will not accept. The world’s great “triumph”, the League of Nations, took no account of God, and consequently ignored the passions of men, except, to agree that disputes should be carried to it. As Judge Rutherford has so clearly stated, and so often reiterated the fact, those clergymen who proclaimed that the League was 'the expression on earth of the kingdom of heaven’ were traitors to their vows and to Jehovah God; for they led the- peoples to expect that sal- ■ vation from war, and peace and happiness, can be got through man’s own efforts, apart from the will of the Creator as expressed in His Word. Such clergymen -were like Esau: they sold their birthright for present gain, and nowq like Esau, they are outcasts from the covenant and must take their place with those whom they have called “pagans”.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark203"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark204"></a>Beating the Air</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• There cannot have been any time like the present when Paul’s words about ‘beating the air’ were so manifestly fulfilled. The writer above quoted speaks of the tumult of opinions. He writes of the political affairs, but there is a tumult of voices amongst the religionists, particularly noticeable amongst non-conformists. Rome stays put, except in its ever-pressing activity to further its interests; and they Church of England is statie: it set stuck, and has remained so. Non-conformity has to jus- -tify its existence, and at present it is beating the air rather energetically. They are concerned for themselves; for their structures are in danger of collapse, or of being overturned by the w’inds of the present troubles. There is no way of escape for them -. they started to run in the mad race of the modern critics, while making some show of retaining their evangelistic style, and now they have no mes- ' sage for the people who cry for light and assurance.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark205"></a>The Bishops</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• The Church of England has had a custom of holding a congress each year, but of late years the practice has been irregular. The congress has no authority, but it gives the clergy a chance of seeing an archbishop and some bishops, and of listening to selected speakers. At one recently held the crisis was much in the mind of the speakers. AV hat was said revealed that some of the leaders see very clearly that the existence of the churches is threatened by the rise of the totalitarian states. The totalitarian government does not allow freedom of worship of God any more than it allows freedom of action and expression to a trade or other union of workmen. In Germany a minister or'priest must both say “Heil Hitler” and take an oath of allegiance to him. He must “worship God” through Hitler. The totalitarian government demands obedience to the state as if it stood in the place of God, and in Germany the form of “Christianity” allowed places Hitler in the same relation as Christ; for as Christ Jesus expresses the will of God, so does Hitler express the will of the state. It is in this claim that the pope sees a competitor. Hitlerism and the Papacy make the same claim. Tn the meantime Hitler has made such a bold claim for supremacy as to excite the pope. The underground channels which exist are yet to be fully disclosed. Judge Rutherford has shown that the pope has been in concordance with Hitler, who is yet a member of the Roman Catholic Church; and he has also shown from the Scriptures that this totalitarian monster will have the support of religionists. Undoubtedly, the bishops will line up with the Papacy when their cuwis draws closer on.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HE South Sea islands are interesting and intriguing places. The people who live on these isolated bits of earth have few cares (or had, until the white man came along). There is an abundance of nourishing food available and a genial climate. Among the various fruit trees is the remarkable breadfruit tree, which alone would suffice to feed the natives. Another interesting feature of these unique islands is that there are few or no land animals on them, feathered creatures being generally the only occupants besides man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The islands of the South Sea, which is another term for the southern Pacific, are so numerous as to be practically numberless. As they lie. within the tropics, the inhabitants, a fine-looking race for the most part, have little need for clothing, and not a great deal of need for work, although many of them are industrious and active. Their moral standards, too, are generally high, and they are courteous and considerate in their dealings with one another and with strangers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the many groups of islands found in the southern Pacific may be mentioned the </span><span class="font0">iniilWiril1l'lrln|’in'lhHHI-lr1HMHIi'lntir1MI-lrltidi-|-|-itir1l-i-|r|tir1l<sup>,</sup>urintiHri’l-|Hti|-|-iriHHi-|-riMri-i-iriMriri-iriHMri i-i-ihmi-Ih x • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;►</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">26.000,000 in One Year!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the year 1938, amidst great opposition, Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the earth distributed more than 26,000,000 books and booklets containing the message of the Kingdom. A comprehensive report of how this was done is published in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1939 Year Book of Jehovah's witnesses.</span><span class="font5"> The work of bearing testimony to the name of Jehovah and His kingdom is the most interesting and thrilling work in progress today.

<p><span class="font5">Friendly islands, the Solgmon islajids, the New Hebrides, the Fiji islands, the Samoa islands, the Gilbert islands, the Society islands, the Marquesas and Paumotu islands, the Tubuai islands, and many other groups, too numerous to mention here. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many ofthese islands appear to be no more than immense coral reefs, while others are of volcanic origin, having been thrown up from the ocean by active volcanoes. It is believed that many that appear to be merely-coral reefs fiavg a volcanic foundation, or are the tops of mountains, submerged and covered with coral. Indeed, the entire system of the Pacific islands may be viewed as a series of mountain groups and ranges, partly submerged, though in many cases the mountains extend above the ocean level to a great height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of the vast number of these Pacific islands their total area is seemingly insignificant as compared with the vast oceanic ex* pause with which they arc surrounded. No other ocean has so large a number of islands as has the Pacific', and no other islands are quite so attractive and interesting. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Finis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The 1939 Calendar of Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">is attractive and full of thought. In rich color it symbolically portrays the opposing armies read}&quot; for battle. On one side a bloodthirsty monster leads a vicious mob, determined to rule or ruin. On the other side the righteous, fully trusting in God’s promise that the enemy shall not prevail, refuse to yield to the tota-i-tarian monstrosity butTuok to Zion, Jehovah’s theocratic government, for salvation. The picture will thrill you. Be sure to get your Calendar before they are all gone. Single copies 25c; five or more to one address, 20c each.</span></p>

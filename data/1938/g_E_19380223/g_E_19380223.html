<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Good Batteries and Switches</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">♦ Around midnight one night, so says </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">Brooklyn </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tablet</span><span class="font2"> (Catholic), the. cathedral at Patna City, India, lit up and an odor of incense came from it, as on another occasion, when a dead priest was supposed to be offering mass. If you have sufficient &quot;faith”, here is another &quot;saint” in the making; if you don’t, you can either reflect that India is a demonridden land or that it may be that this was just a case of good batteries and switches, to whoop up revenues when times are dull and Jehovah’s witnesses have been around with the truth,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Archbishop Knew Nothing”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ A </span><span class="font2">wag in Australia sent this magazine a copy of the Sydney (Australia) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span><span class="font2"> of June 3, 1937, containing an article which had as its headline the above caption. Then he was mean enough to put on the face of the clipping the words &quot;How true!” Probably, if he had gone on to read the clipping, he would have found that the newspaperman was merely trying to explain that it was not the archbishop’s fault that Reverend Jardine went to Monts, France, to marry the duke of Windsor,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Medal Business on the Blink</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">♦ The Catholic Information Society, Richmond, Va., seems to suspect that there is something decayed in Denmark when it says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">More and more cars on the road. More and more deaths on the highway. More and more St. Christopher medals in automobiles. (Then several hundred words of buncombe—and—) But to him who has no such faith a St. Christopher medal is of the exact same use as a four-leaf clover, a buok-eye or A rabbit’s foot—no Use at all except perhaps to reveal openly a silly superstition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Did Not Learn Anything Yet</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">♦ The statement of the New Jersey Annual Conference of the Methodist Church, that &quot;some league of nations is the only practicable program for saving civilization from destruction ”, reminds one of the statement of the little girl to her mother, &quot;God does not answer your prayers; because you have been praying Him to make me a gbod little girl, and He hasn’t done it yet.”</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font2">THE history of the popes as appearing in your newspapers in the past week will fool nobody. Aside from Roman Catholic communicants who do not know any better, all “Protestants”, atheists, agnostics and unbelievers will notice a great lack in that “history” (which they will know for pootfly-concealed propaganda to get sympathy for a supposedly sick pope). They may not know the actual details, but they have read enough and seen enough to smell a bad odor, the bad odor of dishonesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">They suspect, but do not actually know of the following fact: that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, of which the pope is head, is nothing more than a religio-political organization and that it is responsible for most of the European wars and blood-shedding since it came into being. They will credit at once the outstanding details in the following which should be included in any summary of Papa] personnel:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sil ver i us (536-538) was expelled from Rome on charge of having betrayed the city to the Goths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Gregory I (590-604), great-grandson of Pope Felix II, when Phocas murdered Emperor Maurice and ascended the throne, wrote Phocas: “The Almighty has chosen you and put you on the throne. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth leap for joy. ’ ’ How is that for cordiality to a murderer ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sabinianus (604-606) cornered breadstuffs during a famine and raised the price to an extortionate figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Honorius I (625-638), officially ‘ ‘ infallible ’ ■Jias been officially condemned as having taught heresy officially. How about an explanation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Theodorus I (642-649) originated the custom of dipping the pen in consecrated wine </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARYZ3,1938 </span><span class="font2">when signing the death warrant of heretics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Agatho (678-682), officially <sup>1</sup>'infallible’ officially condemned Honorius I as having taught heresy officially. Just tell which was “infallible”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sergius I (687-701) purchased his seat by pawning the ornaments of St. Peter. He was also accused of adultery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Constantine I (708-715) induced the Roman Emperor Justinian II to cut out the tongue and blind the eyes of the archbishop of Ravenna for the latter’s failure to obey the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Stephen III (768-772) put out the eyes of a lay pope whom he displaced on the Papal throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Paschall (817-824) tore out the tongues and eyes and then beheaded two venerable priests who had exposed his vices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Eugenius II (824-827) invented the inhuman ordeal by cold water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nicholas I (858-867) “tamed kings and tyrants, and ruled the wmrld like a sovereign; to the wicked and unconverted he was a terror”, says a Catholic historian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">John VIII (872-882) w'as first poisoned by a cardinal, and when the poison did not work he broke John’s head with a hammer. This was not John’s fault, but is an interesting commentary on the kind of people with whom he fissocititled</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Stephen VII (896-897) exhumed the body of Pope Formosus, an^ had it mutilated and thrown into the Tiber. He was himself strangled by a cardinal. Some more commentary on Papal history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Christopher (903-904) boldly deposed Leo V as soon as elected, and caused his death within forty days from the time he ascended the throne. He also was murdered by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">his </span><span class="font2">successor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sergius III (904-911), who murdered</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Christopher, had several children by his concubine Marosia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">John X (915-928) was murdered by Marusia. Some queen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Leo VI (928-929) also was murdered by Marosia. Some dame:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">John XI (931-935) was the son of Marosia by Pope Sergius III. One of the cardinals poisoned him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">John XII (956-964) was famous for rape, simony, mutilation and emasculation of rivals. He was murdered in the act of committing adultery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Benedict VI (972973) was poisoned by one of the cardinals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Boniface VII (984985), on account of licentiousness and cruelty, had to skip the town. He remained away eleven years, returned, put John XIV in prison and ascended the throne in his place. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font2">little irregular, eh?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Gregory V (996999) had the eyes of antipope John pierced, his nose cut off and his tongue tom out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">John XIX (10241033) tried to sell the</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">Roman primacy over the Eastern church for a pecuniary consideration. The deal fell through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Benedict IX (1033-1045) was elected pope “intercedente thesaurorum pecuniae” at 12 years of age, the popedom having been purchased for him by his wealthy parents. He abdicated to marry a girl of noble family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Gregory VI (1045-1046) bought the popedom from Benedict IX, In his reign, at a council in Lyons, the archbishop and 45 bishops confessed themselves guilty of buying and selling church offices—-simony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">- Gregory VII (1073-1085) established so-called “celibacy” in the priesthood, forcing married men to give up and disown wives and children, -</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Lucius II (1144-1145) wgs. stoned to death in the streets of Rome for maintaining intolerable conditions and trying to sustain them by force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Adrian IV (1154-1159) had Arnold of Brescia burned alive for preaching against papal corruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Alexander III (1159-1181) ordered a crusade against all '‘heretics”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Innocent III (1198-1216) instigated the fourth Crusade, which was directed against the Christians of the East. When the English barons forced King John to grant the act of Magna Charta, Innocent interfered, absolved John from his obligations to make the concessions he had made, and laid England under an interdict, passing sentence of excommunication upon all who should obey or try to enforce the act. He provided John with a large foreign army and set him to intimidating, robbing and murdering his own people (somewhat, as is now being done by Franco in Spain), but his crowning infamy was the merciless crusade he instigated against the Albigenses of southern France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Gregory IX (1227-1241) formally established the Inquisition, excommunicated kings aiid incited nations to revolt; organized a conspiracy to secure assassination of Frederick, emperor of Germany; plunged Germany and Italy into frightful war; organized crusade against Frederick’s successor, Conrad, and granted indulgences to all who would take up arms; offered indulgences, with pay, to whoever would murder Philip the Handsome of France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">John XXII (1316-1334) grew immensely wealthy by sale of indulgences; Burned more than 1,000 “heretics”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Urban VI (1378-1389) -in his conflict with his rival, Clement VII, flooded Europe with, gore, and tortured his captured enemies most fiendishly. Peasants, men and women, were slaughtered by wholesale. He personally superintended the torture and slow murder of many of his victims. He shut wolves in the cell of one cardinal, buried another to his neck in quicklime, and sewed others of the unfortunates in bags with serpents and east them into the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">John XXIII (1410- deposed 1415) was found guilty by the Council of Constance of murder and incest. His secretary described him as a monster of avarice, ambition, outrage and cruelty. He was a pirate, poisoned Pope Alexander V to get the papal chair, poisoned the physician he had employed to kill Alexander, extorted money by torture, poisoned King Ladislaus, outraged hundreds of nuns, and cruelly tortured the victims of his hate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Martin V (1417-1431) held a magnificent auto-da-fe; one of his victims was John Huss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He started a crusade against Hussites and followers of Jerome in Bohemia, He wrote to his legate in Germany, &quot;Strike with your sword, and when your arm cannot reach the guilty (Protestants), employ poison.*.’ To Wladyslaw of Poland, &quot;Turn your forces against Bohemia; burn, massacre, make deserts everywhere.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>t</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Alexander VI (1492-1503) had seven acknowledged bastards and many mistresses. Alexander tried to poison nine cardinals at one sitting; a stupid servant gave, him the wrong glass and he went out instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And that’s only a few. It is the big newspapers like yeurs that are trying to popularize the above shameless record in America. Even the backwoods journalism of 100 years ago would blush with shame to see their fat offspring thus abandon the clear call of freedom, honesty and courage. Your courage is gone; you have nothing left to live for but Rome’s brass check.—J. E, Bolden, Pennsylvania.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ The alleged &quot;Vicar of Christ&quot; is reported as saying to a friend something that indicates about how much use he has for the One he is supposed to represent. Indeed, i he seems to think that a woman is the one that runs His affairs and that she decides, and not Christ, just how he is to gain eternal life. The dispatch is by United Press from the pope’s summer home at Castel Gandolfo, and shows not the slightest knowledge of whose merit it is that makes eternal life for anybody. Here is what he is alleged to have said. Just consider it in the light of all the Scriptures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. •</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ Somebody wants to know why, when the pope’s legs got bad, he didn’t hike to Lourdes or some other miracle joint and get them fixed up. Now, what a mean crack that was! The one who wrote that should know that the pope would take no such chance at being found out. The remedies he desired rnqst were the success of the Spanish rebels, the Japanese conquest of China, and the suppression of the Kingdom ' message.

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Pioneering in Northern Alberta</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font2">WO Canadian pioneers and one company worker lately made a trip into the wild and woolly Canadian Northwest. We left Notikewin, Alberta, on January 23 and traveled seven days in. about zero weather to reach Fort Vermilion, on the eve of January 30. We spent one night in a warm house at Paddle Prairie during this two-hundred-mile trip. Two nights we slept in our tent-covered unheated rig, under the stars. We spent the other nights in shacks, sometimes a bit drafty, and occasionally a small heater could be used, but the heat did not last long after we were in our sleeping bags. We prepared most of our meals outside, and we were fortunate that the weather remained so mild until we reached the Fort. At north Fort ■ Vermilion we came across James Heber, a Beaver Indian, quite well educated, who had obtained a set of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font2"> in 1924 and also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font2"> and was deeply interested. We were surprised to find any literature, as we understood that Fort Vermilion had never been ■witnessed to, and this was true, with the exception of the couple of sets of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font2"> that were left there twelve years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Anglican and Catholic churches were the only kinds of religion that the people could <sub>t</sub> choose from, and we found some that were fed up with the hell-fire brand of religion and were glad to hear something that appealed to reason and was based on the Bible instead of creeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first night in the district we spent at the home of Louie Lambert. They were a nice family, treated us kindly, belonged to the Catholic church, and were mourning the loss of a son. We left </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Where Are the Dead?</span><span class="font2"> and other booklets for our accommodations for the night. They looked the books over that evening, and the next morning Harry Lambert, son of Louie Lambert, eagerly took four of the bound. books which my partner offered to him. This was January 31, and the Hierarchy’s agents soon heard we had arrived, and lost no time in spreading the ■warning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On February 10, when we called at Edward Lambert’s (brother to Harry) I got the following letter (sic);</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">North Paddle</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fort Vermilion, Alta. Isaac Wiens</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fort Vermilion, Alberta &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dear Sir:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I want you to pay my brother Edward the dollar I gave your partner Hiller for those five books. Why didn’t you tell me what the books were for. I’m a Roman Catholic and I don’t want to be anything else. I don’t want to read of your darn religion. And we want to see that you stop peddling that stuff. Everybody is throughing your books in the fire nobody is interested in you fellow’s storys. Were all Roman’s. So take your book’s away and send my dollar and as soon as posible. don’t fail No interesting stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Harry Lambert</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I replied;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dear Sir;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Bible says “Prove all things and hold fast that which is good.” The priests preach war and murder and the Bible says “Thou shalt not kill”. Read the books and then take them to Hay River and you will be able to get 25c each for them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Dear Hany:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are short of books, as we placed so many, and we often told Catholie people they were forbidden and they took them anyhow. We would take them back, but Mrs. Wiley in town wanted some and had no money when we called. Take some to her and to Hay Lakes and Hay River and you will be able to get 25c for them quite easily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I.F.W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The interesting sequel to this story is twofold. Edward Lambert and his wife refused to take any books or booklets when we called at' his house; but after writing this note we went to the neighbors, where wostopped for dinner. Edward Lambert came along by dogteam and was quite anxious to get some of the booklets. They had the four large books at Edward Lambert’s, which they intended to return to us. Edward Lambert’s wife could read, while Mr. Lambert was unable to do so. She had read something that appealed to her and she sent him to catch us. I also heard from a cousin of Harry Lambert’s that Harry had read the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Where</span><span class="font2"> Are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the Dead?</span><span class="font2"> and he thought the books were all right and would </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">probably keep them. Harry was out of the </span><span class="font2">district and had taken his father back to Hay River trading post, about one hundred miles fropx Fort Vermilion, and I regretted not be</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font2">able to see and talk to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was impossible for us to get all the trading posts, but in most cases we called on the families of the traders near or at Fort Vermilion and left the printed message with them. There are a few trappers settled around each post, but most of them would be on their trap lines and we would have been unable to see them. Most qf them will be able to get some of the 800 books and booklets which we left around the Fort, as practically all of them return to the Fort in summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As far as I could find out, very few, if any, of these books were destroyed. The Catholic system has been firmly entrenched here, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Fort </span><span class="font2">Vermilion was settled about a hundred years ago. Louie Lambert’s father came into the district some eighty years ago, as a Hudson Bay man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It seems that here, as in Spain and Mexico, wherever the Catholic system endeavors to get too strong a grip their position becomes weakened. The Catholic mission is paid by the government to educate the Indians and halfbreeds. Parents have told me that their children had been listed as Indian children, though they had no trace of Indian blood. The parents had already paid their fees to have their children attend the mission school, and this misrepresentation enabled the mission to collect double fees for each child. The children are poorly fed most of the time, getting no milk or butter, while the tables of the nuns and priests are full of cookies, pie, cake and the best of food. The children naturally become petty thieves and swipe cookies that are made for the nuns, and anything they can get their hands on. Visitors have been told not to leave anything in their coat pockets, or it will be stolen. Parents Sometimes bring jam, cookies and cheese, or foods of any kind, so their children will get sufficient food and variety. After </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> dinner of lard and bread and little else, the children are usually all turned outside, whether it is cold or rainy weather. Some children cry in vain to be let in out of the severe cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The prayers that are said morning, noon and night are so tiresome that some undernourished children have fainted during prayers, but the vain repetitions must go on,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The priest told Fred Pauls that his house had burned because he didn’t go to church, but all seven of the priests at the mission would be unable to explain why some of their largest buildings were twice destroyed by fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many children who attended the mission till fifteen years of age are hardly able to read or write. In the Indian village, Oliska, we were told there was only one boy who could read pretty well. The greater the ignorance, the better material for the superstitions of the Catholic church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Even though the children’s fees have belen paid (possibly twice paid), the children have to work for this and practically pay for it a third time. They chop and pile wood, clean th“-<sup>J</sup>mildings, do the dishes, and all the rest of the drudgery, so the nuns’ hands can remain the delicate useless appendages that they are, and to be used only for counting the marble-like decorations that hang around the necks of the black scarecrows that will land on Haman’s gallows shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On February </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">2 we</span><span class="font2"> held a meeting in Porter’s Hall at Fort Vermilion (of which Mr. Porter kindly gave us the use) ; and although we had been able to give but two days’ notice, we had thirty interested listeners at our Sunday night meeting. Two-thirds of those at the meeting were Catholics and they were open-minded and friendly and took some literature after the meeting, to the extent of five bound books and twenty booklets. Informal questions were varied and interesting. For example: &quot;If we read these books, and follow it to the best of our ability, shall we go through Armageddon or shall we die too when the Devil’s crowd is destroyed?” I quoted Psalm 145:20, and said, &quot;The Devil or his crowd might kill some of us as individuals when telling the truth, but many will get protection through Armageddon, and those whom the Devil destroys will get life during the Kingdom, when the wicked will get eternal destruction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some of the Catholics admitted that the priest had already been all around the local district warning the Catholics that they would go straight to &quot;hell” if they read Judge Rutherford’s books, and that they should burn them. Someone suggested that no one need be afraid of going to &quot;hell”, for if there were such a place it would be too crowded with preachers to have room for anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When we asked if they knew of anyone who had destroyed their books we could not find out one definite case where they knew the books had been burned. The Anglicans did not turn out to the meeting, as there was an Anglican Church service on at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Just before the meeting, a few hours, we were going to get a gramophone from some Catholic friends and we got a ride on a passing rig and asked the men if they had heard about the evening meeting at Porter’s Hall. One of them said in mournful tones, “I am the Anglican rectah 1 ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are only a few more than a dozen places in the main town of Fort Vermilion, with another half-dozen at Buttertown, which is a suburb of the Fort and is on the opposite or north side of the Peace river. Stony Point has eight or nine families and is seven or eight miles west from the Fort, and Lambert Point, about six miles east, accounts for another dozen families. There are about twenty families scattered along the forty-mile trail to Buffalo Head prairie, where we find eight more homes. There are another thirty families on the side trails between Oliska (the Indian village) and Buttertown or North Fort Vermilion. There are approximately a hundred families or homes and the population is between four and five hundred. We placed two hundred bound books and 600 booklets and numerous copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> [now </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation]</span><span class="font2"> and took one </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age [Consolation]</span><span class="font2"> subscription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The weather turned colder while we were up north and we were witnessing on days when it was 50 degrees or 60 degrees below zero. We did not suffer from the cold as much as one would expect, as we were fairly well clad for it. We did get an occasional frostbite or frozen nose or cheek, but these were contributions toward a worthy cause. On our return trip we slept out in cold shacks and made meals in little bluffs and in the bush when the temperature was 35° below. Bread was frozen hard as granite, but, it being previously sliced, we toasted it and ate it with frozen butter, honey or jam. We felt the Lord had well rewarded us for our efforts, in spite of all these and other inconveniences, and. after a couple of days’ rest at some kind friends at Notikewin we were ready to hit the trail even if it should lead us again two or three hundred miles from the edge of civilization.—Isaac F. Wiens, Canada.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ In Canada alone there are more than 50,000 known species of insects native to the country. Of that number, 3,000 are classified as destructive enemies. In addition to these enemies there are immigrants which have come to stay, such as the European corn borer,' the Hessian fly, the European spruce sawfly, and the Colorado potato beetle. Numerous scientists have expressed the fear that in the fight with insects man will be the loser and perish from the earth, Jehovah’s people know that is not correct, but it illustrates the severity of the conflict now on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">I</span><span class="font2">N THIS day of battle pioneers must be well equipped physically to withstand the onslaughts of the Devil and proclaim the message of God’s kingdom with the greatest efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The high cost of living for many pioneers in poor or belligerent territory prohibits eating the healthful food that would equip them properly for their arduous work. Located in a conservative territory where placements are not numerous, my husband and I have evolved a system of healthful eating on a minimum amount of money. It is possible to feed the two of us by spending no more than $1.40 a week. This is done, of course, with the aid of contributions of food for books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the hope that it may help others to keep in better condition for the strenuous days just ahead, I offer a few suggestions for dodging the high cost of living and yet eating bountifully of delicious and healthful food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The prohibitive price of meat makes it necessary to substitute other dishes that give the same (if not more) nutriment. They include a Mexican loaf made with dried Liiga beans, cheese and steamed peppers; peanut butter soup, corn chowder without potatoes, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">kidney bean casserole, baked onion soup with cheese, a baked vegetable loaf of dried peas and walnuts, a pimento cheese roast, a soybean loaf, varieties of omelets, a nut loaf with tomato sauce, Mexican rarebit, fish chowder without potatoes, cottage cheese roast, peanut butter loaf, Waverly rarebit with chopped raw peanuts, baked eggs Mexican and many kinds of baked fish dishes or fish salads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Proverbs 24:13 we are admonished, “Eat thou honey, because it is good.” Honey can be purchased in quantity at fifteen cents </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">pound and used as a natural sweetening for many foods. After soybeans have been boiled until they are tender, they are delicious steamed a few minutes with butter and honey. Other kinds of dried beans can be served very aconomiealiy this way. A whole squash that is baked with honey and butter is not only delicious, but inexpensive. Honey makes </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">nice dressing for fruit salads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many vegetables can be shredded raw with cabbage and mixed with, lemon, orange or pineapple juice to make a palatable salad to accompany 'the main protein dish. Vegetables are most delicious when steamed for fifteen </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 23,1938 &nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ . &nbsp;&nbsp;' </span><span class="font2">or twenty minutes in a covered saucepan over a slow fire. Onions and carrots make a savory combination, as will cabbage and peppers. Onions also combine well with peppers. Three vegetables can be steamed together with satisfactory results. In the steaming process without water more of the mineral value of vegetables is retained than in boiling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Baked stuffed potatoes or steamed potatoes we make the basis of one starch meal a day. ' With them we eat other vegetables and either the round rye loaf of bread made by Jewish bakers or the Swedish cracker bread spread generously with butter and honey. Three times a day we have either dried or fresh fruit, according to the season. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our breakfast foods we purchase very </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span class="font2">expensively at grain stores rather than at grocery establishments. Rolled oats, cracked wheat, cornmeal, and wheat that has been steamed and rolled, are delicious when flavored with butter, raisins or dates, honey or brown sugar, and eaten without milk. Whole brown rice also can be used, but it is a little more expensive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For purposes of economy as well as health we have eliminated pies, cake, hot biscuits, puddings, tea, coffee, cocoa and all kinds of fried foods. Our larder does not contain white flour, white sugar, cornstarch, mayonnaise, lard, baking powder, paprika, cinnamon, vinegar, cloves, salt, vanilla extract, pepper, mustard, cream of tartar, cayenne or allspice. Our meals take but little time to prepare, and the dishes are very easy to wash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The following are possible recipes for two or three persons:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Peanut Butter Soup.

<p><span class="font2">♦ Dr. Betts advises that those needing false teeth should avoid any of the rubbers containing aluminum particles. Some people can wear the so-called “Trong’s green”, or “gold dust”, and some can not. He therefore advises the use of what are called “parfait” plates.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">♦ Constantly bettering sanitation is slowing up the death rate. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company explains that if the 1900 mortality rate had been in operation in 1935 there would have been 1,975,761 deaths in the United States, but as it was there were only 1,207,359. Tuberculosis decreased much.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>Who Are the Quacks?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">W</span><span class="font2">HEN the aluminum interests realized their cooking utensils were under suspicion of causing disease they established and endowed the Mellon Institute of Pittsburgh apparently for the sole purpose of protecting their business. When our citizens inquire of the Federal Department of Agriculture if aluminum cooking ware is poisonous they are referred to the Mellon Institute for the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The same condition prevails in the medical field. When an epidemic occurs due to the injection of serums, vaccines or immunization fluids large amounts of money fall into the coffers of the medics much of which in turn is used to form a medical association so large it reaches into every community in our land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Several years ago Guiseppe Zangara, in Florida, took a pot-shot at Franklin D. Roosevelt. The bullet hit Mayor Cermak, of Chicago. Four of the most prominent physicians in the United States were in attendance. Of course, all these men were strictly orthodox medics, undoubtedly members of the medical association. When the mayor died official reports were made. One was that his death was due to colitis. Another’s was that he died from an abscessed lung. Another, from heart failure. The last stated that he died from the effects of a bullet wound. The state officials declared none of these were the cause of death. <sup>1</sup> They charged that a certain man killed him. He was found guilty and hanged for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As </span><span class="font2">another example </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font2">wish to relate </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">story of a boy who came for dental work. He had several teeth treated. By that I mean the nerves or pulp was removed and the canals properly filled. Shortly a small gathering appeared on his eyeball. He visited a physician who told </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">him </span><span class="font2">he had focal infection and would have to have his teeth X-rayed. This was done, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font2">fear of his going blind they were extracted. The disease disappeared. Within a few days, however, another abscess appeared on the same </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">eye. A </span><span class="font2">return trip to his physician disclosed, as his opinion, the cause of the infection must be his tonsils, so a tonsillectomy was performed. Again the disease disappeared. With-• in a short time another infection was located </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font2">the other eye. Again visiting his physician he was told he would have to bide his time until the systemic poison caused by the treated teeth and tonsil disease eliminated itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The boy was quite indignant. He had been subjected to about $200 medical expense with no relief. He came back to me and demanded that I pay his bills, still thinking the doctor was correct in his diagnosis. Examining his eye I noticed he was suffering from “granulated ’ * eyelids. I sent him to an eye specialist, who cured the disease, and he has had no further trouble. When the boy realized what the orthodox physician had done to him he felt a little chagrined and came in to pay his dental bill. Since that he has been sending all his friends here to have their teeth attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Still another example of medical quackery was shown recently when Bernarr Macfadden sent a perfectly healthy young man to 26 of the best physicians in New York city belonging to the medical association to determine what was wrong with him and what medical attention he needed. The boy returned with the advice that he had at least 26 diseases and as many kinds of prescribed medicines for their treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is nothing scientific about medicine; nothing positive except that when one, with or without disease, gets into the hands of most medics the patient is subjected to a large bill whether he can afford it or not. There are three classes of allopathic medics. Those who are doing their best to relieve suffering humanity, are honest, but unable to successfully cope with or cure disease. The second class treat disease properly and charge reasonable fees. Third, those who are highly educated and have been taught to use serums, vaccines and immunization preparations and collect large fees and know how to induce persons to have unnecessary medical service. These are termed “ethical”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The cults are many indeed, but a few of the outstanding are the osteopaths, naturopaths, chiropractors, etc. The naturopaths teach, believe and practice natural living: that life comes from food, as supplied by fruits, vegetables and grains; that fresh air, adequate sleep, pure water, exercise and proper living, which includes right thinking, is the key to health. The allopathic physician believes that health is maintained by injecting serums and immunization preparations into us, and putting vaccines into our blood as soon as we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">old enough to stand it, oh by the intake of medicines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of what are serums made? Twenty years ago the medics found that aluminum had exceptionally damaging effects to animals as well as persons wherever it was injected into the body. On account of this its employment was condemned. Now they have revived its use as a diphtheria-prevention serum. Thousands of units containing the “alum precipitated toxoid” are now sold by the New York Department of Health to various city health departments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That used for vaccine is a preparation produced from one of the most vile diseases known, called “cowpox”. The material is nothing more nor less than the pus oozing out of sores that are cultured on the stomach of an infected calf or cow. This is scraped, off and placed in human creatures, supposedly to prevent disease. Serums are made from cultures, ready for injecting, by most of our pharmaceutical houses. For instance, a person having a cold is given a little bucket in which he places his sputum or thick yellow mucus from the nose, This is taken into the laboratory and infiltrates made which are injected into the blood stream of the donor. In order , to immunize children or grown-ups incapable of supplying the necessary mucus for themselves as a “ cold’’-preventive measure, they have to secure this from others who can. This is usually gathered from old persons in poorhouses who have chronic catarrh. That with the strongest odor makes the best serum. They furnish the material by the bucketfuls regularly to the pharmaceutical houses, which is then made into the infiltrates, placed in glass tubes ready for use. Most serums are made from such or worse substances that we feel language is inadequate to describe. The latest </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to be </span><span class="font2">used is the venom of the most poisonous snakes, to counteract snakebite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is difficult to understand the workings of the minds of those belonging to the medical -association who bring themselves to the point where they believe such things are good substances to maintain health. Not only that, but they insist on having a monopoly of the healing art whereby they intend to force by law (as in the case in- some states already), the use of their services for such therapy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Dr. E. M. Purdue, editor.of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the American Association for Medico-Physical Research,</span><span class="font2"> states that when his colleagues call</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>12</span></h5>

<p><span class="font2">♦ In a little booklet entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Man, Know Thyself,</span><span class="font2"> by Dr. R. A. Logan, of Kingston, Jamaica, B.W.I., Dr. Logan says of various methods of poisoning the blood:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Users of various hair tonics, face creams, lip sticks, etc., are liable to be affected with kidney trouble, because the poisonous blood reaches the kidneys, which are like a coffee percolator. All these products are made with chemicals, some of which are injurious. Poison rhay result from the inhaling of certain substances, namely, chloroform, ether, nitrous oxide, and various other gases. The users of various narcotics, such as tobacco, cigarettes, opium, cocaine, etc., absorb poison from these and injure their systems. The venom from the stings of certain insects and bites of some animals is so poisonous that it absorbs rapidly and causes instantaneous death,</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Giving Good Money for Counterfeit Goods</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">OUNTERFEIT</span><span class="font2"> is the name of a book which sets forth in some detail the many ways in which manufacturers counterfeit good products and sell them at fancy prices. The book is by Arthur Kallet, co-author of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">100,000,000 Guinea Pigs.</span><span class="font2"> It may be had at some libraries and is worth having in your own, for future reference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From this entertaining and illuminating book many valuable facts may be learned. For instance, a blanket labeled “Part Wool” may have just a thread of wool running around the edge, or none at all. In the first instance the counterfeiting is “honest” (?); in the second, just plain dishonest; but the distinction will make little difference to the buyer. Unless the label tells the exact proportion of wool in the blanket, the chances are you are paying for something you don’t get.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One favorite method of counterfeiting is to claim that the thing you are buying contains a “costly ingredient”. The advertisement doesn’t say how costly the ingredient is, nor how much of this costly ingredient is used in each package. The author of the book states that probably the greatest experts in this field are the drug and cosmetic manufacturers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;When buying silk one </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font2"> gets absolutely pure silk, even when the product is definitely labeled “pure”. The Trade Commission permits 10 percent of weighting in pure silk, and any amount in silks that are not marked “pure”, but nevertheless represented as real silk. Often there is more tin in a few yards of so-called “silk” than there is in a tin can. There may be lead in it, for that matter, and somehow a leaden garment lacks romantic appeal, and may be injurious to health if worn next to the skin. Sometimes, not to say frequently, silks are weighted with water-soluble salts, and when washed lose all their glamour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Canned goods marked “fancy” are supposed to be of good quality, but even the best brands may be found “substandard”. Buying a cheaper grade often results in obtaining better value. This should be some comfort to those who cannot afford anything very “fancy”. (Incidentally, when buying canned goods, note how much water you are paying for. Note weight and size of cans, particularly when you are getting a “bargain”.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Guarantees” of the wares you buy are generally so worded that you are not likely to get your money back without difficulty, if you get it back at all, even if you are definitely “not satisfied”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As for soap. You may be carried away by the extravagant claims for soaps of various kinds, and pay a fancy price accordingly; but all a soap is for is to clean the skin, and when it does that without injuring the skin it is a good soap. “Sweetheart” soap, sold at 6c, is superior to Yardley’s, sold at 35c. The soap that is supposed to give you a skin ‘another loves to touch’ is actually poorer than many cheaper soaps. The soap that is supposed to make one B. 0. proof contains rosin, an undesirable ingredient in toilet soap, and it doesn’t destroy odors better than other soaps. The soap that ‘gives one a schoolgirl complexion’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">doesn't,</span><span class="font2"> but is a good soap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tooth pastes sell at fancy prices, but a dime’s worth of precipitated chalk will last longer and clean the teeth quite as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mouthwashes are in a class by themselves when it comes to claiming benefits to the user which are purely imaginary. Says the author, “You may have noticed that the Zonite bottle at 81 cents [or thereabouts] contains two ounces less than the Clorox bottle at 15 cents. But . . . Clorox is five times as strong </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font2">Zonite—that is, it can be diluted with five times as much water to give the same strength solution. . . . 15 cents’ worth of Clorox is equal to $4.45 worth of Zonite.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When you pay your money for those wonderful Crazy Water Crystals, you are paying a good deal more than is necessary; for you can get the same results at 1/25 of the price by means of Glauber’s salt, just another and cheaper name for the same thing. Use either with caution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Four out of five do not get pyorrhea, and that “famous” toothpaste would not help if they did. The safe cleaning fluid is not-safe, for it is carbon tetrachloride, which is poisonous when inhaled, but makes a fairly good cleanser if used with caution, and costs a whole lot less than the trade-marked article. Facial astringents, selling at fancy prices, do little more than can be dope by the use of ordinary witch-hazel. Some of them contain ingredients that are injurious to the skin.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Grade A bottles (of milk) could be put on Grade B bottles as well, with no increase in price ’ ’—and no great difference in food value. Frequently the two grades come from the same cans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Four Physical Culture Exercises</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font2">HE following exercises are good strengthbuilders and are performed in the bedroom before going to sleep (with the windows open, please!),</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(1) &quot;The Press Up.”—This exercise is reputed to be a favorite of Indian wrestlers who, it is said, can perform hundreds without a pause. Go ahead, and if you can do a dozen the first time, you’ll be hot stuff.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Take up the position by lying flat bn the stomach. Place the hands flat on the floor beside the shoulders with fingers facing straight forward. Now press yourself up to arms length slowly,- and repeat until the arms ache.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To obtain the maximum benefit from this exercise the body must be kept rigid and straight throughout. Find the number of press-ups you can do the first time; repeat for two nights, then increase by one alternately. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If persisted in, this exercise will make noticeable difference in your physique, especially the chest, back, arms and shoulders. It is a good idea to get your measurement down on paper so that you can make note of your improvements.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(2) Another exercise to go with the press-up, also a favorite of Indian wrestlers, is the Deep Knee Bend. This simple exercise will</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">14</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">do wonders to your legs—if performed properly, but not if done in the schoolboy style, ■ as quick as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Stand with the feet about nine inches apart; place hands on hips, and slowly finish standing on toes. Bend the legs until you are squatting. Now recover just as slowly, and repeat until your legs want to drop off,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">You can perform deep breathing exercises in time by breathing in (through the nose) as you go down, and out as you come up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is not necessary to stand on tiptoe in this exercise, but will increase the benefit on the calves if this is done.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(3) Another fine exercise is the Abdominal Raise. As the name suggests, this is an exercise for the stomach muscles, and it is begun by lying flat on the back on the floor with the arms lying behind the head parallel with the body. The exercise is to raise the body into a sitting position and finish by touching the toes, simply by the effort of the stomach muscles.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">At first you may experience difficulty in keeping the feet on the floor when raising the body; if so, place the feet under a heavy piece of furniture until the abdominals become stronger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After a time it will be necessary to make the exercise heavier. This can be done in two</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSOLATION </span><span class="font2">ways.'One is by holding under the back of the neck an object, preferably a bar, weighing a few pounds to commence with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The other way is to perform the exercise on an incline with the head lower than the feet, in this way the force of gravity can be used to gradually increase the power of the abdominal muscles.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(4) This exercise is for the lumbars, the muscles in the small of the back. These seldom get used under modern conditions. Amateur</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">gardeners often suffer from pains in this rpgion, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Take the position by lying on the stomach with the hands on the hips; now raise the legs and upper body off the floor together, so that the body is supported on the stomach only. Repeat several times, and gradually increase as in exercise 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The above four exercises between them include practically every muscle in the body, and if persisted in, lasting results will accrue. —By Ken Peacock, in London </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Daily</span><span class="font2"> Worker.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>The Trial of Jesus</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">I</span><span class="font2">F THE trial and death of Jesus, which “Christendom” commemorates every Easter, were to take place today, would the verdict be an acquittal?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ For nearly two thousand years the records of the trial have been reverently examined by succeeding generations of legal experts, and their unanimous opinion is that, apart from its religious significance, the Crucifixion is the most glaring example of judicial murder in legal history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All the recognized forms of legal procedure were abused and distorted to secure a conviction, and in a modern court of criminal appeal the sentence would undoubtedly be quashed on either of the following grounds:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. Jesus was actually acquitted by the only court competent to pronounce the death sentence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. The verdict was against the weight of the evidence.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Jesus had to undergo two trials—the one ecclesiastical, before Caiaphas the high priest, as head of the Sanhedrin; the other civil, before Pontius Pilate, the Roman proconsul. It was not the policy of Rome to strip conquered nations of all their power. She was especially tolerant in matters of religion, and in the case of the Sanhedrin, the ancient ecclesiastical tribunal of the Jews, only death sentences were subject to retrial and confirmation by the Roman governor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rome was not worried about Jesus. It was at the instance of the ecclesiastical authorities that He was arrested, tried, and condemned before a whisper of the proceedings reached Pilate’s ears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY S3,1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The arrest of Jesus took place at midnight, and the first illegality in the proceedings arose in the immediate summoning of the Sanhedrin to try the case forthwith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Jewish law expressly forbade a court to meet by night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Before the Sanhedrin no attempt was made to formulate a charge. It was insinuated that Jesus was at the head of a revolutionary movement, but no attempt was made to support it by evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The proceedings quickly degenerated into a third-degree examination. When Jesus refused to answer the carefully framed leading questions of the high priest a jailer clenched hia fist and struck Him on the mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Court hangers-on were forced into the witness-box, but they could neither agree nor tell a consistent story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Balked in his cross-examination, Caiaphas, in the double role of prosecutor and judge, played his last card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He placed Jesus on oath, and, confronting Him with theatrical solemnity, exclaimed, “I adjure Thee by the Living God that Thou tell us whether Thou be Christ, the Son of God. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Simply and solemnly Jesus answered, “I am.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Caiaphas had attained his end. “What need we of witnesses?” he cried. “Behold now ye have heard His blasphemy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With no regular charge, no regular <sup>1</sup> evidence, and no opportunity for the accused to bring rebutting evidence, the sentence of death was passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But Roman law demanded the confirmation of the sentence by the governor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">15</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Early in t5e morning an attempt was made to regularize the illegality of the midnight trial by a second meeting of the Sanhedrin, but no attempt was made to review the earlier proceedings, and Jesus was hustled by His accusers to Pilate’s judgment seat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>:</sup> Pilate at once demanded details of the charge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The prosecution tried to wriggle out of it by the specious answer:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“If He were not a criminal we would not have brought Him before you. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This attempt to burke the issue nettled Pilate. He answered warmly, “If I am not to hear the case, neither will I convict nor pass sentence. If you regard it as ah ecclesiastical ease, try it yourselves; but if you do you may only impose the penalty which the law allows. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The cold, keen Roman was making them feel the weight of Rome’s heel, and the cynicism with which he extorted from them the complaint, “It is not lawful for us to put any man to death,” was thinly veiled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Forced to conform to the rules of legal procedure the prosecution extemporized the foL<sup>1 </sup>lowing tiiree charges;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. That Jesus was perverting the nation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. That He had incited people not to pay tribute to Rome.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. That He claimed to be a rival king to the Rpman emperor.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">• In these three charges there was not even </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">hint of the blasphemy of which the ecclesiastical court had convicted Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The charge of inciting against the payment of tribute at once fell to the ground. Had not Jesus said only a day or two before, “Render unto Casar the things that are Ceesar’s”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pilate came to the point at once and confined his examination strictly, to the charges of sedition and pretension to kingship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Art Thou a king then?” he asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">* ‘ My kingdom is not of this world, ’ * answered.. Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The prosecution brought no evidence to the contrary. The simple, straightforward answer convinced Pilate of Jesus’ innocence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ Here was an amiable enthusiast from whom Rome had nothing to fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">- So he stopped the trial and pronounced His acquittal, “I find in Him no fault at all.” . That was a verdict of “Not guilty” by the highest court in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">16</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Roman justice now demanded that Pilate . should free Him and protect Him if necessary from the malice of the prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Why did that not happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When Pilate delivered his verdict the wrath of Jesus’ accusers knew no bounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pilate &quot;was frightened and fiugtered. He wanted to get rid of both the case and Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It flashed on him that because Jesus was a Galilean he could shift the responsibility by transferring him to his place of domicile and to the jurisdiction of Herod, ruler of Galilee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Before Herod there was no pretense at a formal trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The suggestion that Jesus was a candidate for his throne appeared so ridiculous that Herod dismissed it with contempt and sent Jesus back to Pilate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Pilate was In a quandary. He did not want to quarrel with the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">lie wanted tranquillity in his province, and he attempted a compromise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Once again he declared his belief in Jesus’ innocence, and tried to find a way out of his difficulty by offering to scourge Jesus as a sop to the rage of the mob, and then to release Him as a vindication of Roman justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This maneuver failed. He tried another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was the Roman custom at the time of the Passover to allow the people of Jerusalem to select a convicted criminal for release. Confident of their choice he offered them the alternatives of the'acquitted Jesus and Barabbas, a bandit and murderer. “Now which will you ' have,” he demanded, “Jesus or Barabbas?” And the ringing cry came from ten thousand throats, ‘ ‘ Barabbas I ” To Pilate, who honestly wanted to see justice done, the choice was a staggering blow. lie had failed to realize that he was appealing to a packed jury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“What then shall I do'with Jesus?” he asked, in the hope that the answer would be, “Free Him also.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But quick as an echo came the demand, “Crucify Him.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then a strange thing happened. Calling for a basin of water, Pilate washed his hands before them all and said, “I am innocent from the blood of this just person; sec you to it. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The gesture was futile, even if it meant that for the second time Pilate was pronouncing a * verdict of “Not guilty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It came too late. Mob law had triumphed over the might and majesty of Rome.,—Landon Riiiy ELcprfuw.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Your Questions Answered</span></h4><img src="g_E_19380223_files/g_E_19380223-4.png" alt="" style="width:89pt;height:41pt;">
<p><span class="font7">Q</span><span class="font2">UESTION: Recently Pope Pius XI said to one of his cardinals: “I am certain that this formidable upheaval will see the Church emerging more resplendent and better adapted to modem needs.” Do the prophetic Scriptures support such conclusion? and what will be the outcome for the Hierarchy and for the world in the upheaval mentioned?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Answer: That prognostication of Pope Pius XI is entirely unsupported by the Scriptures. It is a sample expression of boastful “worldly wisdom”, and concerning it the Bible says: “Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?”—1 Corinthians 1:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy attempts to make the people believe that the Catholic Church organization is in harmony with the Bible, when in truth and in fact it is exactly contrary to the Bible and God 7 organization. The Roman Catholic Church takes the lead in the religions of the world and for doctrines has substituted the traditions of men for the Word of God, which is the Bible. God foretold through the Bible the present-day upheaval in the world, which upheaval has been on the increase since the World War and will continue until the final climax. The Scriptures show that shortly after 1914 Satan, the invisible ruler of this wicked world, was cast out from heaven and down to the earth, and .since then Satan has been compelled to confine his operations to the things of the earth. (Revelation 12:1-9) Every thoughtful person will agree that since the end of the World War the woes upon the peoples and nations have continued to increase in severity and today the nations are in a worse condition than ever before; and the Bible plainly states the reason in these words, to wit: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you; having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” (Rev. 12:12) Satan well knows that the issue of supremacy between hims^f . and Jehovah God must be settled soon, and in his desperation Satan is endeavoring to' plunge all the nations into destruction. in order that thereby he niay seemingly support his boastful challenge that all men will turn against God. Satan is certain to be defeated, and all who support the Devil will go into destruction at the battle of Armageddon, which is the great and final conflict between the Devil and the Lord. The Roman Catholic organization is now desperately trying to bring all the nations and people into that religious organization, which religious organization is the Devil’s chief instrument on earth used to turn the people away from Jehovah God and His kingdom under Christ Jesus. Therefore the outcome for the Roman Catholic organization ris certain and complete destruction. That religious organization will be the first to go down in the great time of trouble. (Revelation 17:16,17) Then will follow the destruction of every part of Satan’s, organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Roman Catholic religious organization has made lies its refuge and by means of fraud and deceit has carried on and is carrying on the greatest racket of all time. It boastfully claims that ‘the gates of hell shall never prevail against the Roman Catholic Church but the prophetic Word of Jehovah God says concerning that instrument of Satan, the Roman Catholic religious organization, the following, to wit: “Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves. Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.”—Isaiah 28: 15,17,18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “modern needs” of all'who desire righteousness as the: kingdom of God under Christ Jesus, and the Roman Catholic. Hierarchy is against that kingdom. Therefore, instead of the Roman.Catholic Church <sup>J</sup>s ‘emerging from this formidable'upheaval more resplendent’, it will never emerge at all, but is </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">gm n</span><span class="font2">g down to stay, for the reason that its end come. All who hold to and support that religious organization or system will likewise suffer destruction, which<sup>1</sup> destruction will be far greater than anything'that has ever be-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">fallen the world, and condern'ing which Jesus uttered these prophetic words: “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. ’ '—Matt, 24: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Who will emerge from the great upheaval or tribulation and survive? Only those who take their stand now fully on the side of God and His kingdom under Christ and seek righteousness. The majority of people are on the side of the religionists, and are therefore against God’s kingdom. The extent of the great slaughter in that time of trouble is described in the Scriptures in these words: “And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.’’—-Jeremiah 25:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the religious organizations the clergymen are the “shepherds” and so designate themselves, and the politicians and others who use religion as a cloak are the principal ones of the religious flock, and concerning whom it is written: “Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.” (Jeremiah 25:34) Let no honest person deceive himself or be deceived by the boastful claims of the pope or any of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Their words are vain. The Bible is the real and perfect guide for all who desire righteousness.—Ps, 119:105.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>The Hierarchy’s Racket in Jamaica</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">A</span><span class="font2">S A subscriber for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> magazine and as one having escaped the tentacles of the Roman Catholic racket, I feel certain that these few comments of mine will be appreciated by yourself and those of the “great multitude” class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am now 35 years of age and, up to approximately two years ago, was a Roman Catholic. I was born a Catholic and subject to very strict Catholic training from my childhood days. I was taught in my earlier days by the sisters of the “Convent of Mercy”, the sisters of the “Convent of the Immaculate Conception”—both institutions situated in the city of Kingston—and later by the Jesuit priests of St. George’s College, Klinchester Park, Kingston.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">My grandaunt has been a prisoner in the “Convent of Mercy” for, I presume, over forty years. She is between the ages of 80 and 90 and still alive. My sister, the one whom I follow, entered this convent a few years ago, but, owing to a delicate constitution, had to discontinue her course. My aunt on my mother’s side has been the sacristan at the Cathedral in the city of Kingston for a number of years and stili holds that position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It will be seen, therefore, that my being delivered from the “modem Philistines<sup>!</sup>’ has been due to the loving-kindness of the great Jehovah, to whom I bow in deep, sincere thanksgiving. By His grace it has been possible for me to break away from that institution, which has succeeded in counterfeiting the church of Christ by a form of godliness and display of charity,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The doctrine which drove me practically to desperation was that of “eternal torment”, and when they rolled out this “sw<sup>r</sup>eet morsel” at their yearly missions one hardly knew whether he was standing on his head or on his feet. When the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Where Are the Dead?</span><span class="font2"> got into my hands I ravenously devoured its contents and felt like one emerging from a dreadful nightmare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are many more things that I would like to say, but I shall not encroach further on your valuable time. Please, however, permit me to relieve myself of some of the pressure within in remarking that I fully endorse the sentiments that Roman Catholicism is the greatest lying, thieving, murdering, whoring institution that the Devil ever blew breath into. It is only an institution having the Devil as its father that could have perpetrated such a deception on decent, honest people. I certainly long for the day when every church, convent, presbytery, monastery and repository for the sahutf “holy junk” will be destroyed anc^Jjwr Satanic influence for ever removed, and God’s kingdom of righteousness, established for the blessing of suffering humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This also serves as authority to use this letter and my name if you should consider this worthy of publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">fief ore closing, I would also like to state that I can confirm whatever has been written in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> [now </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation]</span><span class="font2"> relative to the teachings of Roman Catholicism. Whatever was cited as their teachings is exactly what was taught to me, and there is not a priest or a nun who could refute what has been said. I endorse most heartily what the priest Hogan said relative to the priests and nuns as being the most deliberate lot of liars. Of course, there are a few prisoners among this class.—Ronald Feurtado.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ John J. O’Connor, United States Congressman from the 16th New York district, believes in using common sense. Ridiculing the “patriotism” of some people who have much to say about what others should think and say and do, he made the whole House of Representatives laugh when he said of these busybodies :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">They devise means of interfering with the liberty of speech, with the liberty of action of the people of America. They are irresponsible to everybody. For instance, they want everybody jailed for at least five years who does not raise his hat when the American Sag goes down the avenue. They would require that every member of Congress, in order to qualify, first recite the first two stanzas of The Star-Spangled Banner.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The action of Mayor Gold is unconstitutional. Under our law every man is ipnocent until he is proved guilty; he does not have to prove his innocence, the state has to prove his guilt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Want to Be a News-Reel Photographer? </span><span class="font2">♦ Maybe you are a young man and want to earn a living. There are such. You might want to be a news-reel photographer, but according to Westbrook Pegler this kind of work is union-controlled and to get into the union you must lay down an even $1,000 tribute money. As a course for a red-blooded American to follow, Mr, Pegler thinks it “a hell of a way to spread employment and get the idle back to work”, but there are other jobs, union-controlled also, where a man can buy the right to work for an initiation fee of only $250.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ A spiritist physician of Edmonton, Alberta, ignorant entirely of the Bible account of Mary Magdalene, out of whom the Lord cast seven demons, bore unconscious and unintended tribute to the truth of the Bible in the concluding sentence of the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">My theory is that a person may step out of his body. Sometimes the owner of the body goes to the third plane outside the earth, but usually simply goes to sleep, and another entity then takes possession of and works in that body. I have seen as many as five entities use the same body in a single night.</span></p>

Of this amount one must pay $2 per week in taxes, and the balance must suffice for all the needs of his family in the two rooms and kitchen, without bath, that constitute his home. Colonel Knox says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The status of the German worker, once free, highly intelligent, well paid and a self-jespeeting member of society, is now that of a miserably-paid wage serf of the government.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ British babies are still frightened by gas masks on their mamas and'papas, and least of all are they desirous to wear them themselves, but the work of civilizing them still goes on, and 500,000 gas masks are being turned out every week. These are kept stored in nitrogen (to protect the rubber) in thirteen centers scattered over Britain, so that, when the party starts, nobody will be late for the dance. Everybody will have on his mask.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>Government Opening of Private Mail</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ Government opening of private ’ mail, done on a large scale in Britain, has proved to be a great agency for crime detection and prevention. Letters are opened, their contents photographed, and the mail then sent on to its destination so cleverly that the opening cannot be detected. Occasionally, however, there is a slip. In such a letter one secret service letter-opener accidentally left his record and signature.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Terrible Storms in the Shetlands</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ The winter ’36- ’37 saw more than thirty terrible storms in the Shetland islands (whence the Shetland ponies) off the northern coast of Scotland. Gales 70 to 90 miles an hour drove stones and wreckage from the beaches over roads and fields; many homes were destroyed, and roads in some places were so badly damaged that they had to be closed. It was the worst winter within living memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Kissing a Crime in Ireland</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">♦ At Dundalk^ county Louth, Ireland, in October, 193.7, a young man was fined £3 7s. 6d. for kissing his sweetheart in public, and she was sentenced to thirty days in prison if she ever returns from Scotland to the place where she was kissed. Seems as though, if she has no more sense than to return to such a crazy place, it might be as well to send her up for life.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ The world’s largest hospital is in South London, having capacity for 42,000 patients. The maintenance costs of the “L.C.C. ”, so-called, amounts to £5,490,000, and is rising every year.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>Death Duties Work Quite Well</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ The British government, as a result of two deaths in quick succession, came into posses--sion of the Gordon estates in the Highlands of Scotland, comprising six villages, 449 farms and 140 square miles of land. It is not now quite as important as it once was to be bom into something or other. The death duties seem to work quite well.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>No More War Insurance</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ Three hundred British companies that formerly issued war insurance have agreed not to issue any more war risk insurance, for the reason that airplanes have reached such a development that there is now no basis by which war hazards may be estimated. Men’s hearts are surely failing them for fear.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>Known Drug Addicts in Britain</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ The known drug addicts in Britain are but 313 men and 303 women. Of this total of 616 addicts 137 are doctors, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">X</span><span class="font2"> are dentists, 5 are pharmacists, and 2 are vererinarians. It is considered quite remarkable that 24 percent of the known drug addicts of Britain are in the medical and allied, professions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ Pupils in England’s schools are said to be taking to American slang like a duek to the water. Persons who still wear silk hats and hoop skirts grieve about the matter, but Everybody else likes it; and, anyway, who can stop them!</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>Sapieha Climbed Down</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ Archbishop Sapieha, of Cracow, Poland, was not going to have King Carol, of Ku-mania, put a wreath on Pilsudski’s silver coffin while it was in the Roman Catholic cathedral there, first, because King Carol is not a Roman Catholic, and, second, because his r eputation is as bad as that of some of the Roman Catholic priests of Germany, So, on a date, he had Pilsudski’s body moved to a tower in the Wawel castle. It caused such a row that four days later Mr. Sapieha had to hide in his cellar, and did not dare go out of the house. The Poles, mad as hops, took it up with the pope. That gent advised Mr. Sapieha to apologize while the apologizing was good, but Sapieha wrote to the president of Poland that he would do no such thing. As soon as he had said that, everybody familiar with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy knew he would apologize within a few days, and he did, and the Polish, IJjet, in extraordinary session, accepted his apology. That is all, Helen.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>Greek Catholic Dismay in Yugoslavia</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ As they see Yugoslavia coming under control of the Roman Hierarchy, the leaders of the Greek Catholic church of that country are filled with alarm. They cannot understand why an institution with only 35 percent of the inhabitants professing allegiance to it should be given such great predominance over their own institution, which has 45 percent of the inhabitants. The bishop of Ochrida, referring to the reported poisoning of the Greek patriarch, is mentioned by the New York </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tim es</span><span class="font2"> as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We know Rome murdered our late king, our national temporal leader, and is now trying to kill our spiritual leader.</span></p>

As the guards retreated they shot and killed 12 prisoners, and on their arrival at the surface shut off all - water and light. The deadly thirst, always in-■'sufferable in a salt mine, ended the mutiny. What a terrible occurencc in a terrible land!</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>Triple Censorship in Rumania</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ For four years there has been a military censorship on all the Watch Tower literature circulated in Rumania, The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon </span><span class="font2">booklet recently came up for examination. The new military judge acting as censor did not know what </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">do with it, and referred it to a synod of the local clergy for an opinion. This synod, instead of returning the book to .. the military censpr, as would have been their duty, sent it to a higher board of examiners with charges against the publishers and circulators of this Bible message. The Rumanian office, reporting the matter to the Watch Tower office, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Praise Jehovah our God that the opportunity is given so that a’ testimony be made to these regarding Armageddon, that they may have no excuse. We request that this be brought to Judge Rutherford’s attention and send our hearty greetings to him. We stand shoulder to shoulder with him in this battle. Do not slacken. Be brave, because our victory is sure. Jehovah has so promised.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>The Old Dentist of Banyalouka</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ One of the world’s strangest dentists is an old man in Banyalodka, Bosnia, Croatia, 'Yugoslavia, Europe. His customers are peasants who worked for some years in France or America, got rich enough to have their teeth filled, and then returned to their native land, lured on by homesickness. After being home a while, plowing with wooden plows, carting their stuff around in old wooden carts, and trying to live in a place where it is necessary that one member of the family spend most of his or her time carrying water, they finally remember about those gold fillings, Then they go to the old dentist, he knocks out their perfectly good teeth and gives them a percentage of the profit derived from the sale of the gold. And if that isn’t a way to make a living, name one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ In violation of treaties Austria increased her armed forces from 30,000 to atjout 200,000, when the private armies arc taken into consideration. Nobody in Europe pays any attention to treaties any more, and, no nation dares disband its:armies and further congest the labor markets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.

<p><span class="font2">♦ Many governments have been overturned by direct attack; most constitutions have been relegated to the scrap heap by open revolt. The modern system of destruction of constitutions is by. flank attack, by insidious propaganda, by claiming that the steps to a dictatorship are done in the interest of the people. That seems to be the European modern way of establishing such systems of government on the continent. Mussolini did it that way. Hitler did it that way. Labor and the radicals were promised socialism; the farmers, the end of interest slavery; the little merchants, the dissolution of trusts, economic security; the bigger merchants, the end of socialism and the destruction of trade unions, and everybody was promised the elimination of the Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He divided labor against itself* and set the great unions warring one against the other. He promised one this and another that. These insidious promises fanned the conflict. His plan was to create such turmoil that in the minds of the German people would arise this thought: If industrial peace can be obtained only by a dictator, then let us have a dictator. —Judge D.

<p><span class="font2">♦ Life in Nazi Germany must be a perpetual delight to the collector of extraordinary human phenomena. The other day the dispatches told us that Dr. Rutherford’s International Bible Students, who believe that “millions now living will never die’’, are regarded as a Red menace. And now we learn that a group of German Christians is at work purging the Bible of Semitism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This ought to be one of the most monumental tasks ever faced by even German scholars to whom monumental exercises in scholarship are as easy as rolling off a log. But metaphysical theses, erudite researches into early Chaldean verb forms, investigations of the laws of sound transmission from language to language and endless observation of molecular bombardment ought to pale to insignificance compared to the scholarship required to purge of Semitism the book recording early history of the Hebrews.—Baltimore </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sun.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>Become a Nazi and Steal Officially</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ Many politicians enter political life in the hope of being well paid for doing nothing, and, additionally, stealing liberally as a reward for supplying patriotism for the consumption of others. However, it is done more crudely elsewhere, and politicians, if they really wish to get somewhere financially, should become Nazis, That bunch of highwaymen were mean enough to intercept the Nobel peace prize, awarded to Von Ossietzky, German peace writer, and although he is free from the concentration camp where he was confined three years, he is still kept secluded by the Nazi police.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>Felt He Must Say Something</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ The Nazi “judge” who sent 42 of Jehovah 's witnesses to prison in Berlin felt that he must say something, and so he said that he “was not punishing them because of their religious convictions, but because they belonged to an organization whose tenets were similar to Communism. Though they sought to hide their aims under the mantle of religion they tried to undermine the foundations of the State. Therefore their doctrines must constitute anarchy”. The press associations sent this to far-off New Zealand to do what they could to aid in persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses at the Antipodes.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>Brave Bast Prussian Police</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ The East Prussian police made a great find. In their arduous tasks of snooping into every home they finally found a quantity of literature of Jehovah’s witnesses, used to comfort and bless the people of God by helping them to understand the Bible in this, the evil day. That was enough. The brave strong-arm squad rushed the “guilty” man off to prison for five years. At Stettin thirteen of Jehovah’s witnesses were arrested and ten of them were given sentences of imprisonment from two to eight months as barbarically as if they had been caught in Jersey City, Hoboken or any other city under the control of Frank Hague.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ The German Freedom Party has issued and circulated widely in Germany and abroad manifestoes bearing a Czechoslovakian date line, calling attention to the fact that war is the only idea the Nazis have brought to light and that it is the remorseless consequence of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">dictatorship. In the twentieth one it says, reproaching the Hitler regime:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Look at Abyssinia, Spain and China. Why are our sons being killed in Spain? Why are our guns firing on Spaniards! Why are our bomb# destroying Spanish towns and Spanish fives!

<p><span class="font2">♦ In the two last years of the German Republic 18,128 new farms were created </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font2">Germany; in 1935-1936 of the Hitler </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">regime </span><span class="font2">only 7,213 new farms were made. In 19341935 the Nazi government delivered more than three times as much land into the possession of airdromes as into the hands of the peasants. Iron is so scarce that even needles and nails are hard to obtain; wood is so precious that even the gathering of brushwood in the forests has been forbidden. The deportation of workers, and especially of the unemployed, to barracks in some out of the way place, where they must work as high as 78 hours a week, is common. These reports are from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Deutschland-Berichte,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Prague, </span><span class="font2">Czechoslovakia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Voelkischer Beobachter</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Tells the Truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">♦ The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Voelkischer Beobachter</span><span class="font2"> of Berlin, organ of the National Socialist Party, has said enough things on other subjects that are not true, so it is all right to commend it for once when it tells the truth about the Hierarchy in America, as it does in the following: </span><span class="font1">However, this church is not considered as having the same national value as others. It does not embrace groups in which the spirit of the American Constitution originated, hut rather immigrants of the last few decades. Hence Americans proud of their nation dislike and distrust it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ Getting a taste of their own medicine, such as they have elsewhere been delighted to have served to Jehovah’s witnesses, the Berlin Confessional Synod distributed thousands of copies of a declaration throughout the city, in which they said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Never before, since the Protestant Church has existed in Germany, have hundreds and hundreds of pastors and laymen—the sum totals now around a thousand—been sent to prison for defending the freedom of the gospel and the independence of the church.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">When Mussolini visited Berlin he traveled in a specially built train, armor-plated and bullet-proof. When he traveled by automobile guards were stationed every sixty feet on both sides of the road. All housetops along the route were occupied by police. House owners were compelled to deliver their front door keys to the police.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ Franklin D. Roosevelt, ignoring minorities, even when they actually number many millions of his fellow citizens, had the following to say, March 2,1030, as to how Fascism could be brought about in the United States. He seemed to have in mind the very course he has himself pursued; _</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Were it possible to find “master minds” so unselfish, so -willing to decide unhesitatingly against their own personal interests or private prejudices; men almost God-like in their ability to hold the scales of justice with an even hand, such a Government (at Washington) might be to the interest of the country, but there are none such on our political horizon, and we cannot expect a complete reversal of all the teachings of history.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The moment a numerical superiority by either States or voters in this country proceeds to ignore the needs and desires of the minority, and, for their own selfish purposes or advancement, hamper or oppress that minority, or debar them in any way from equal privileges and equal rights —that moment will mark the failure of $ur Constitutional system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To bring about government by oligarchy, masquerading as democracy, it is fundamentally essential that practically all authority and control be centralized in our National Government.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ In the United States it is not lese majesty to got up on your hind legs and tell the truth about anybody. It is not a bad idea, either; for it keeps people from being too excessively proud of their hypocrisy. Pegler, hammering the Roosevelts on the income tax corn, has this to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mr. Roosevelt’s son James draws $10,000 a year as secretary'to his father, another son does very well in Mr. Hearst’s radio department, which is beholden to the President's political radio board for its licenses, and the other day, of all the interior decorators in the United States, the one best equipped for the newly created task of traveling around the world to lovely-up our embassies was discovered in Mrs. Irene De Bruyn Robbins, of Buenos Aires, the widow of Mr. Roosevelt’s<sup>1</sup> cousin. The job pays $6,500 a year-plus expenses of course—and it will take at least a thousand smallfry income tax returns to meet the expense. But a mandate is </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">mandate after all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">When you add up all recently enacted and proposed legislation, what do you gett You get a government gf the United States entirely made over, and made over on a plan that can only be justified by the astonishingly unique personality of one man who, to say the least, can’t live forever. Without the vibrant genius of Franklin Roosevelt, the remarkable governmental machine that is being built and planned around him would be the most dangerous on earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">A man may have no intention of committing burglary, but if he is found with burglar’s tools he cannot complain if he himself is brought under suspicion. The president does not help allay the suspicion of dictatorship when he refers to a ‘three-horse team’ which he would make pull together, giving us to understand that he would crack the whip over all three branches of government,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ Back from Matanuska valley, G. E. Turner, a subscriber now in Oregon, thinks the U.S.A, good enough for him henceforth, though he does admit the trip up was wonderful and during the 100 days of the Alaskan summer the Matanuska is a good place. There was snow on the foothills June 7 on his arrival, and new snows on September 20 when he left. In the meantime grasses grow luxuriantly; and that included lettuce and spinach. There is a large water content in all Alaska-grown products, and the best meats and vegetables are imported from the States. In the Matanuska all the big shots arc generals, colonels and lieutenant colonels, and the subscriber thinks the Matanuska settlement is essentially an army base against the day of a Japanese-American war.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Great Plains Land Reclamation Theories </span><span class="font2">♦ The Great Plains Reclamation theories seem good. Storage pools would be built on every stream, for regulating the flow in periods of flood and drought. This certainly seems like a much more sensible plan than attempting to control waters that have become mountainous in height. It is calculated that an expenditure of a billion a year for ten years vrould be a. justifiable one for this purpose and would greatly benefit the entire country.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ The Government’s Rural Resettler specialist, Dr. Alexander, was to have delivered an anti-Southcrn speech at Des Moines. The Government canceled it and announced that it was not given. Then Dr. Alexander proceeded to Des Moines and gave the speech, anyway, and it went out on the radio. The official status of the case now is that the officially undelivered speech was delivered unofficially and the Department of Agriculture is in the choice position of denying that something was done which was done in person and by radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Administration Still Trying to Sell Itself </span><span class="font2">♦ The Administration at Washington is still busy trying to sell itself to the people. This is probably natural enough, because Farley and his crew want to hold their jobs. The ministers of the Presbyterian church were addressed by the Educational Division of the Social Security board at Washington and urged to help advertise. Franked envelopes enclosed the propaganda.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ The wisdom at Washington goes round and round and round, like Ambrose in the Vatican gardens.

<h5><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark158"></a>“Pure Unadulterated Rot”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ Every war that Americans have fought or may fight in the future outside their own continental boundaries hasbcenor will be a racket, a mean, cruel, yes, filthy racket. By racket I mean something that appears to be one thing to the crowd, but in reality, to a few favored insiders, is something entirely different. During our participation in the World War our soldiers, even those from California, thought they were fighting to defend their homes, to make the world safe for democracy; were fighting a war to end wars. Rot—pure unadulterated rot.—Major General Smedley D. Butler, United States Marine Corps.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>What Sickened Butler</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ The ones that know the most about war are the ones that have the least use for it. General Smedley D. Butler, who described the conscription act of 1917 as the National Kidnaping Act, says;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I visited Government hospitals and saw thousands of sick and maimed human creatures and those who had gone insane, and I thought of such slogans as “We won the war”. We! The only winners were a few overstaffed birds in Wall Street that never fought anything in their fat lives. And it also occurred to me that the words “Thou shalt not kill” meant just that. It didn’t seem right that a fellow should dutch a cross in one hand and a bayonet in the other. That’s what opened my eyes.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>The Industrial Mobilization Program</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ The so-called “Industrial Mobilization Program” of the War and Navy departments, if enacted into law, as it probably will be, would make the United States in time of war the utmost Fascist state imaginable. The dictator would have control over virtually all industry and commerce, fix all prices of basic commodities, close all security exchanges, commandeer all rail and w<sup>r</sup>ater traffic, and fix wage scales.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark163"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark164"></a>Odd Bonus Items</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ When the soldiers’ bonus was distributed, nearly $500,000 went to ex-veterans in San Quentin prison, California. It seems that when the bonus marchers to Washington were sent home the government merely loaned them the money; for 5,160 of them found, when they received their bonus, that the faros home had been deducted.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark165"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark166"></a>Fresh Proposals to Seize the U. S. A.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ Fresh proposals to seize the U.S.A, are contained in suggestions from California, echoed in Massachusetts, that the CCC be made a branch of the army; also that all persons on relief rolls bo enlisted in the army, and that all WPA projects be directed by the army. First steps in the destruction of any government of a free people is the swelling of the army to unwieldly size. After a bit the army takes the country, under one excuse or another, and martial law takes the place of constitutional government. America is on the way to Fascism (Catholic Action),</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ The people of the United States ate still paying pensions to the widow of Darius King and the daughter of John Hill, privates in the New York state militia in the War of 1812. But if inclined to get excited about this, please bear in mind that the people of the United States are pouring billions into the laps of Vanderbilts, Astors, Goulds and others that never did a stroke of honest work in their lives. The maintenance of the interest or usury system is not a whit more honorable or decent than the maintenance of a couple of old women connected by marriage with a war that ended 123 years ago.</span></p>

Great Britain has a defense budget for the current year of almost a billion dollars; the United States defense appropriations figure up at $1,131,365,200 (which is more than it used to take to govern the entire country); and Japan is working on a twelve-year armament plan that can be carried out only by raising more money in some way as yet unknown.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark175"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark176"></a>Mayor Hague Disregards the Constitution</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">To the Editor of New York </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Post:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sir—Through your columns Mayor Hague proclaims that he is a “God-fearing” man. This is a most astounding statement in view of his record of October, 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In that month, Jehovah’s witnesses held a three-day convention in Newark, during which the over 3,000 attending exercised their constitutional rights of worshiping God according to the dictates of their conscience. While engaged in this action, guaranteed by both the United States and New Jersey State Constitutions, about thirty-five were arrested in Jersey City and Hoboken, even though they were strictly within their rights and breaking no laws. Extreme and cruel jail sentences were meted out to them—up to sixty days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mayor Hague could have prevented this by </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">word, but did nothing. Here we have the spectacle of law-abiding Christian people persecuted for their Christian belief and obedience to God’s commands by one who now calls himself “God-fearing”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In any event, Mr. Hague succeeded in making the name of Jersey City a byword and a hissing and a stench in the nostrils of all decent, right-minded Americans. Let us hope that the day is not far off when the constitutional rights of American citizens in New Jersey may be fully restored to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">C. W. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Witherell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">[Udifor’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Note:</span><span class="font1"> The treatment afforded members of the religious sect referred to above is but typical of the complete disregard for civil rights shown by Mayor Hague and his subordinates. Labor has been denied the right of peaceful picketing. The right of public assembly has been denied to any group which could be labeled “Red.” On December 31, 1936, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font1"> stated editorially: “Picketing is legal in the rest of the United States but not in Jersey City, where it is illegal—as it is in Berlin, Munich, Vienna, Milan and Rome. . . .

<h5><a name="bookmark177"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>Harrison Democrats</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ Critics often make the claim that New Jersey is no part of the United States, because it holds the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution in such supreme contempt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 23, 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A word of explanation comes to hand. It is a poster entitled “Harrison Democrats”. It recommends four men for public office and gives their history. It states that Edward P. Carey, for the Town Council, First Ward, was educated in the Holy Cross School; Peter W. Eckert, for the Town Council, Second Ward, was educated in the Holy Cross School; William F. Taff, for the Town Council, Third Ward, was educated in the Holy Cross School; and Frank E. Rodgers, for the Town Council, Fourth Ward, was educated in the Holy Cross School. If there were more wards there would be more candidates with more educational items of great interest and importance to Jerseyites.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark179"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark180"></a>Heil Hitler Hague</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ Under the iron rule of Der Fuehrer Frank Hague, Fascist (Catholic Action) boss of Hudson county, New Jersey, his acting police chief in Jersey City, Mr. Walsh (guess Mr. Walsh’s “religion”), ordered his men to permit no picketing in the city, and told them he preferred the use of force to arrests. That’s nice, in Germany and Italy and New Jersey, isn’t it? Also, when a citizen went into a business place to call a lawyer on the telephone, police followed him and padlocked the place as a “rendesvouz for Communists”. How do you like Vatican rule, you Americans, if any, in Jersey City? You are on the straight highway to another Spain or another Mexico.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>Relief Conditions in New Jersey</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ New Jersey cities are virtually bankrupt. Two out of every five persons on relief are children under 16 years of age, and in numerous municipalities studies are being made of how little food can keep these 16-y ear-old children alive. Meantime, thousands of dollars are being worse than thrown away prosecuting and persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses for telling of the only way out.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark183"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>New Jersey Larger than Delaware</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ New Jersey is larger than Delaware, Nortl Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, all put together. Not in area; mercy no! Those nine states have 4,233,000 population. New Jersey has 4,288,000.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark187"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>No Mass, No Work</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ Looking confidently and cheerfully ahead to the time when the Roman Hierarchy will have everything in the United States sewed up tight for the Vatican, and nobody can get a job of any kind unless he can prove he has been to mass, Archbishop McNicholas, of Cincinnati, one of the most conspicuous and conceited ecclesiastical nuisances in the United States, has appointed 19 priests in his diocese to give special attention to this matter of distribution of jobs to worthy Catholics. The question of fitness for the job of any particular Catholic is of minor importance.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark189"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>Down in Moonshine Kentucky</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ Out in the moonshine regions of Kentucky lives a Baptist clergyman named Chris Whitt, The ‘‘Reverend” Chris preaches at the Baptist church regularly on Sundays, but on weekdays, in order to build up the family exchequer, he and his son operated a moonshine still. In the course of time a revenue man from the government observed that all was not well in the neighborhood of “Reverend” Chris Whitt and called upon the dominie to inquire about the still. Imagine the embarrassment of the “Reverend” Chris at this juncture! But the “holy” man was equal to the situation. In substance he said, “My dear sir, you do not mean to insinuate that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font2"> operate a still </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">V ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was the revenue officer’s turn to be embarrassed, and this gave Chris time to gather his wits. He indicated, still filled with righteous offense, that the still was owned by one Fred Mauk. This was 100-percent an imagination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mauk was arrested- and, through the active aid and false witness .of the aforesaid Chris Whitt,- was sentenced to the penitentiary for one year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In prison, one day, Mauk happened to hear the voice of Judge Rutherford. He liked the directness, the straightforwardness, the evi</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">dent </span><span class="font2">sincerity of ; the speaker. And, better still, he recognized his message as the Truth, with a capital letter. He obtained some of the Watch Tower publications, and not long thereafter was pardoned by the governor of Kentucky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Among those present at the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in the State Fair Grounds, Columbus, Ohio, was Fred Mauk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Conspiracy Against City of Terre Haute </span><span class="font2">♦ Conspiracy once existed against the proud city of Terre Haute. The city has a “patriotic” mayor and chief of police, and admits it. These brave men had one of the presidential candidates of the American people booked to speak in their city. It matters not the party of the candidate, but it chanced to be Earl Browder, nominee of the Communists. The mayor and chief of police, afraid they might learn something about Communism, locked him up for 26 hours, so he could not speak. Brave men! The D.A.R. lauded them, urging Fascism, as in Germany and Italy. Other like “patriots” were “Reverend Father” Edward L. Curran, editor of the Roman Catholic magazine </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light.</span><span class="font2"> Other “patriots” cited by one ' of the Hearst organs were:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">American Legion posts and officials, Veterans of Foreign Wars posts, Spanish-American War Veterans posts, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, and the Illinois State Society, Sons of the American Revolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Knights of the Double Cross were not named, but were among the most active in preventing freedom of speech in Terre Haute, thus pushing Fascism one step further. The conspiracy was found in an old document. It reads, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces,a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This highly inflammable and objectionable language, not to be tolerated, by either the mayor, Samuel Beecher, or the chief of police, James C. Yates, of the city of Terre Haute, is found in the Declaration of Independence, written by one Thomas Jefferson. Should, he ever have the presumption to come to Terre Haute and to utter such language he will be promptly thrown into jail by Mr. Beecher and Mr. Yates, and don’t you forget it, and the D.A.R. will rejoice in the vacancies above their necks, and all of Hearst’s “patriots” will commend them and commend themselves for such acts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">♦ On page 813 of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font2"> for September 22, 1937, I find an article disclosing the fact that birds and other animals have common sense as well as some men, at least that is my definition of the article. Let me relate some'of my experiences: I had a cat that I taught to say “mama”, before I would let it in the house, and it could say the word just as distinctly as any human.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Recently I had two small chicks, and taught ‘ them to obey me. I called them “Birdies”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">They soon learned the name and answered to it. I talked to them the same as I would to a human, and they did what I told them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One day they got in my neighbor’s lot. When I saw them I said, “Birdies, what are you doing over there?” They immediately flew over the fence and came direct to me. Later they got into another neighbor’s lot, and I asked them what they were doing in that lot, and stated that they should come home. They did as in the former instance. If they could not be seen and I would say, “Birdies, where are you?” they would come running.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Neighbors asked me to look after their lawn and one hen. It was a pet, but not taught to obey them. I soon had it trained to follow me. One day she was on her nest when I went there. As I passed I said, “So you are on your nest?” She left the nest and followed me. Then I said, “You had better get on that nest and lay an egg.” She went and obeyed. When I would say, “Birdie, you better go and get a drink,” she would also obey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At one time she wanted to set. I found her nest, broke it up, and covered the nest with old metal. This displeased her and she would not follow me as in the past; but after three days she got over the pouting spell and we were friends ever after.—L. Milliron, S. Dakota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This Grasshopper Came Home to Roost </span><span class="font2">♦ At Council Bluffs, Iowa, Walter Rude, a nine-year-old hoy, soaked a grasshopper in gasoline and set aim afire. The burning grass. hopper leaped on the boy, and burned him so badly he had to be sent to the hospital and kept alive only by an oxygen tube inserted in' his nose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark194"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark195"></a>Clever Political Work in Iowa</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ In Iowa City, Iowa, Attorney General Ed. O’Connor Catholic, ruled that a nun might not teach in a public school in ecclesiastical garb, because her clerical dress promoted sectarianism and violated the constitution, and the public funds paid to her were turned over to support the Roman Catholic sect. Now an alleged Protestant, Judge Harold Evans, has reversed the rule and awarded back wages to a nun deprived of her salary. It all looks like a political scheme.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark196"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark197"></a>A Testimony to the Power of God</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ What a testimony to the power of God is contained in a letter from Des Moines, Iowa, in which, accompanying a considerable order for literature, one of Jehovah’s witnesses said modestly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I am an invalid, not able to get out in the work, but in the last six years have placed close to one thousand books and booklets in my own home, to salesmen and callers. Satan has tried to kill me with one of his most deadly plagues (cancer), but Jehovah has not permitted him to do it</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark198"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark199"></a>The Grit of Florence Teter</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ Talk about grit! Sixty-eight years ago, when she was three years old, Florence Teter, Maple Hill, Kans., fell from a wagon, and since then has never walked. But she lives alone and does almost all her own work, traveling around the house in a wheel chair. In making a bed she uses a broom handle to straighten the covers. She sweeps, cooks and sews.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark200"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark201"></a>Grasshopper War of 1937</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">♦ The Nebraska grasshopper war of 1937 was one of the greatest of history, and fought more skillfully than any previous one. The grasshoppers were fed with sodium arsenite, mill feed and sawdust, with the United States Government supplying the ammunition and the farmers spreading it around by the bagful or the wagonload as circumstances made necessary. One dollar saves $50 in crops,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">if TXT</span><span class="font2">HERE have you been, Jane?” called </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">V V </span><span class="font2">Buddy, running down the road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;You’ll fall, Buddy! It rained on the snow last night and then froze.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;I think it’s pretty, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Yes, it is really beautiful. Everything, even the tiny bushes, is coated with sparkling iee. It all looks like part of a shining glass world, doesn’t it? Look, Buddy; on this bush are little jewels hanging—raindrops that froze, all in a row, just as they were ready to drip from the branches.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;I see them. But where have you been?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Coeoon hunting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;What’s that?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Don’t you know? Then there will be a fine surprise for you one of these days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;You said it was wrong to hunt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;It is, if you hunt to take life needlessly. But this is different.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;What are those fuzzy things?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Those are my cocoons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;How many do you have?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Only seven. It's a good thing I did my first cocoon hunting early this winter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Why do you say that?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;The winter has been hard and—”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;And that hurt them?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;No. But when snow is deep for days at a time, birds cannot get food so easily. They feed, then, on the inside part of cocoons—especially those high in the trees. For that reason, very few good ones are to be found by spring. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Jane! Look! What’s that?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Where, Buddy?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Over there beside the road. It’s moving.” &quot;How strange! It sort of flops about.” &quot;It’s a pigeon, Jane!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Let me see it. Why the poor little thing— its wings are coated with ice so it can’t fly. Here, well wrap it in my scarf and take it home. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A few minutes later Jane and Buddy entered the house, carrying the half-frozen pigeon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Put it right here, Jane, so it can get nice and warm.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Before Jane could stop him, Buddy had grabbed it and laid it on top of the stove,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jane screamed and picked the bird up quickly. &quot;Buddy! You’ll kill it!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Buddy’s lips began to quiver, all ready for crying. Jane took him in her arms. “I’m sorry, dear. You didn’t mean to hurt it. But, you see, it’s too hot here for our new pet. It must get warm slowly. Get me that shoe box you keep your marbles in.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Buddy ran eagerly for the box, wishing to make up to the pigeon for nearly roasting it. Almost at once he returned, carrying the box carefully.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“But we can’t put the little fellow on top of all those marbles,” said Jane. &quot;Suppose We take them out.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;All right, I’ll put them on the table.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Taking the box, Buddy started for the table, tripping over a chair and spilling the marbles as he went. They rolled in every direction. He picked them all up, crawling everywhere to get them, and laid them on the table; but they rolled off almost before he had turned his back. For a moment he thought about getting angry. Then he saw flow funny it really was and laughed instead. Jane laughed, too, and they both went to make a bed for the pigeon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>11</sup>1 think I’ll name him Jimmy,’’ said Buddy. “Is he a sp-sp-spec.ial kind of pigeon?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“I’m afraid not. Wouldn’t it be nice if he were a carrier pigeon?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;What’s that?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Pigeons that may be taken any distance from their homos but will fly straight back home again as spon as they are set free.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“What fun!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“It’s more than just fun. They are used to carry important messages. Once, many years ago, when your Uncle Walt helped to protect the forests of Idaho, he saved many thousands of trees from a terrible fire by sending carrier pigeons to a ranger station for help.” ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Are there lots of them flying around?” &quot;Not any longer. People have killed them off.” <sub>:</sub> .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Jane, is Jimmy better?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;Yes, He’ll be all right soon. Later we shall feed him, but just now I think we should go away and let him sleep. ”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark205"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark206"></a>Winter Crystal—Cover Design for This Number</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">A</span><span class="font2"> WINTER thaw may, if there be rain, result in that magnificent spectacle of ice-encrusted splendor of twig and branch, bush and tree. What a breath-taking wonder is that phenomenon of crystal glory in which all the landscape is bejeweled. The unparalleled beauty beggars description and frustrates all efforts at imitation. Yet one cannot blame an artist for desiring and essaying to capture some small hint of the magnificent scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ice crystals in winter, while a thing of beauty, may also prove a cause of considerable damage and trouble. Telephone lines are often so weighted with iee that the lines break. This was especially true in the past, when wires were not as strong as they now are made. It has been necessary, on some occasions when extensive damage was done, to send a message to the west coast of America by way of the south, instead of directly across the continent, all the northern lines, or nearly all, having been broken down by reason of ice which had formed on the wires over wide areas between the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains. Crews are still maintained in northern states to attend to repairs made necessary as a result of damage done by iee. Many wires, however, are now laid underground, thus obviating the necessity for this attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All the aspects and moods of nature are interesting and may yield aesthetic delight to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">observing. In the soul’s search and hunger for beauty there is a testimony to the essential godlikeness of man, however warped and marred it may often be. And in the search for the beautiful one goes quite as a matter of course to the works of the Divine Artist, who has been pleased to produce an endless variety of arrangements, colorings and effects in the course of nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The more rare effects are, appropriately, also the most striking and interesting, as </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">rule. Only occasionally does nature garb itself in that lavish display of luminous jewelry of which the artist has sought to convey some idea. Even the bushes along the brook are transformed into things of unwonted beauty as they glimmer softly against the deep blue of the winter night in the pale luster of the waning moon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Five minutes later umbrella and paper had disappeared. In their place was another notice:</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholic Fascism in Connecticut</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">HEN the early settlers of Connecticut established a haven where all might breathe freely the pure air of religious freedom they established a code of laws founded, as they sincerely believed, upon the Higher Law of Almighty God. In the edition of laws of 1672 we find the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“We have endeavored not only to ground our capital laws upon the word of God, but also all other laws upon the justice and equity held forth in that word, which is a most perfect rule.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Their descendants have teceived from those well-meaning forefathers an excellent inheritance in the guarantees of liberty of conscience, worship, speech and press declared in the fundamental law of the state. Little did those statesmen of the early day think, however, that in years to come it would be necessary for God-fearing people to apply to the highest court of the nation for a further declaration of the right to worship Almighty God in that state. Little did they think that in these later days the Word of God would be trampled upon by public officials, and that heavy fines and jail sentences would be imposed upon Christians for the “offense” of bringing the Kingdom message of Jehovah God to the people. They could not see that the same inquisitorial power which oppressed the peoples of Europe in medieval times would cross the waters and establish an inquisition in the Nutmeg State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And that is what has happened in this year 1938. The foreign power known as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which is oppressing the millions of Europe and Asia, has reached out its tentacles and hooked them onto the municipalities of this little New England state. It h_as placed its henchmen in key positions in the courts, prosecutor’s offices, and police departments, and has used them to suppress freedom of worship, freedom of conscience,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 16, 1933</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">freedom of speech and press, and freedom of assembly. I present to you some of the amazing facts concerning this modem method of attempting to stifle truth by /bse of the strong arm of the law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The city of Bristol is entitled to the dubious distinction of initiating the persecution. Early in December, 1937, one James P. Jennings, a Roman Catholic member of the city council of Bristol, in company with a Grand Knight of the Knights oj’ Columbus protested to the mayor of Bristol against Jehovah’s witnesses. Jennings proclaimed that the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Enemies </span><span class="font8">constituted an indecent attack upon the Catholic church”. The mayor responded with a declaration that no attack upon </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">religion</span><span class="font8"> would be permitted in Bristol. This was followed by a most vicious attack on </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Christianity</span><span class="font8"> conducted by the city authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It began with the summoning of three of Jehovah’s witnesses to the police station, where they were ordered by Police Captain Jeglinski to cease distribution of Bible publications in the city. A few weeks later eight of Jehovah’s witnesses were arrested and taken to the police station. The priestly source of their arrest was disclosed in the fact that while they Were detained in the police station the telephone frequently rang and the officers were heard to answer in these words, “Yes, Father, we have some of them here now.” All of this was without authority of law, and Jehovah’s witnesses responded with a campaign in which the facts were given to the people by means of a pamphlet entitled “Shall the Priests Rule Connecticut?” The priests then manifested their purpose to rule Connecticut by coercing and bulldozing the police department into wholesale arrests. The strong-arm squads sallied forth and haled sixty-seven publishers before the court, charging them with distributing offensive matter concerning the Catholic church. The arrests were made without regard</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">to law or order. People walking on the streets, sitting in their cars, or driving out of town were taken into custody. On that day the chief qualification for an arrest in Bristol was to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. They were brought to trial before Judge Joseph P. O’Connell, of the Bristol police court, likewise a good Roman Catholic. All the evidence needed for a conviction on the trial was testimony that defendant, was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, was arrested and had some Bible literature in his or her possession. There was no evidence of distribution. One girl under sixteen was ‘graciously released’, and the other sixty-six were convicted and each fined twenty dollars, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘ The inquisitioij spread throughout the state like an epidemic. One Thomas F. Lawler; priest, and chief beneficiary of “purgatory” racket in St. Mary’s Catholic church of New Britain, made public proclamation that the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font8"> was libelous and obscene and that Jehovah’s witnesses should be jailed for its distribution. Catholic pqliee, prosecutors and judges of New Britain then followed with a series of wholesale arrests aggregating over a hundred eases. New Haven, Meriden, Ridgefield, Simsbury, Southington, East Hampton, Hartford, Stratford, Bridgeport, Plainville, and other towns got the fever and joined the hue and cry against Christianity'. In the course of a few months three hundred Christian people have been subjected to arrests, abuse, ill-treatment, eonfiscatiori of property and farcical trials, in this widespread desperate attempt to censor and interdict the declarations of God’s Word against the religious pirates of today. One publisher was convicted for the ‘offense’ of sending a- letter to the police department of Hartford calling attention to the inherent rights of freedom to worship Almighty God. In Plainville five Christian women of unsullied reputation were convicted of' distributing immoral and obscene literature. The immoral and obscene literature consisted of some plain, truthful declarations concerning the Roman Catholic Inquisition of medieval times. The Catholic idea that any criticism of the “holy church” i's'immoral is readily accepted by the Irish judges of Connecticut. In Bridgeport a priest by the name of John J. McCarthy personally, caused the arrest of two of Jehovah’s witnesses for circulating the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font8"> The language in the book which the priest considered offensive was the following, found on page 193.1 quote t</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ . . . It must now be apparent, to all honest people of earth/who have any knowledge, that the' Roman Catholic organization is a religious political organization, indulging in a selfish work, which blasphemes, the na,me of Almighty God, falsely and fraudulently represents him, carries on a racket in the name of Christ, and is the great enemy of God and of the people. ...&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That is pretty - strong language. It covers a great deal of territory. If the Roman Catholic organization is not a religious political organization, is not blaspheming the name of Almighty God, is not carrying on a. racket in the name of Christ, and is not the great enemy of God and the people, it could make things uncomfortable for the author of the book. If the staterfients arc not true, the priests can have a gloriously happy time exposing its falsities. But the difficulty for them is that the statements arc true. The beskirted gents know they are true. They dare not face the challenge of the accusations. Therefore they bring the power of the law' to their aid, and in this land of the free and. the brave throw Christian men and women into jail for exposing their corruption. This same priest and his.satellites in Bridgeport brought pressure to bear upon city officials to eject Jehovah’s witnesses from' their leased hall, so that they would havi*no opportunity to meet and study the Bible. They didn’t succeed. City officials declined to submit to such alien, Hitleristic tactics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The wicked and malicious nature of the prosecutions is further demonstrated by the great variety of statutes used. Christians do not violate laws which are enacted for the protection of the people. Nevertheless, the ecclesiastical crowd, w'ith its political allies, in their overheated attempt to suppress the truth /have resorted to many law's to secure their ungodly end. Jehovah’s witnesses w<sup>r</sup>ere first charged with peddling books without a license. That didn’t work. Then they were charged with violation of Section 6194 of Connecticut Statutes, W'hieh provides that no person shall publish, exhibit, or distribute printed matter ' which is abusive, ’indecent or offensive concerning any person. It was claimed that such literature is very offensive to the priests. Undoubtedly it is. The exposure of a racket is always offensive to the racketeer. The scribes and Pharisees of Jesus’ day found His remarks very offensive and therefore crucified Him. The priests of Connecticut would crucify Jehovah’s witnesses today if they only had the power. It was further' claimed that the literature of Jehovah’s witnesses is immoral and obscene. Nothing further from the truth could be.alleged. Holding people up to contempt or ridicule on account of their religion or nationality was another false charge placed against Jehovah’s witnesses. Soliciting contributions to a charitable cause without a permit; disorderly conduct; trespass; and inciting to violence and riot, were likewise alleged against a peaceful and law-abiding group of people. Never in the history, of the state had there been such a feverish searching through the dry and dusty legal tomes for provisions to inflict punishments upon innocent people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another proof of the false and malicious nature of these charges is manifested in the unlawful discrimination practiced by the officials. When Jehovah’s witnesses charge the Roman Catholic Hierarchy with carrying on a racket and present proof of' its truth, tjjey are arrested, thrown into jail, prevented from presenting their proofs, and heavily fined. But when the Roman Catholic Hierarchy through its official publications circulates abusive, indecent and offensive untruths concerning Judge Rutherford and Jehovah’s witnesses, no action is taken by those sworn to uphold the majesty of the law. I cite the case of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Transcript,</span><span class="font8"> published by the bishop of Hartford, which in ifc issue of April 21, 1938, states as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HUT HERFORD JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Father Felix, director of ‘Defenders of the Faith’ has done some splendid work against America’s ace bigot, Judge Ruth- ' erford, says the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World,</span><span class="font8"> Everyone knows thp infamous practices of Judge Rutherford and his marauding band of Jehovah’s witnesses. All through the United States we can see and hear these apostles of hate hawking their anti-Catholic literature. ... The type of propaganda they hand out reeks with foul denunciations and falsehoods. ...” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Stratford, Connecticut, the police went forth and arrested five of Jehovah’s witnesses on the mere statement of a religionist that they, were distributing offensive literature. The attention of the chief of police was called to the fact that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Transcript</span><span class="font8"> containing the foregoing false, abusive, malicious and offensive statements was being circulated in Stratford, and would he kindly arrest the ones distributing such offensive literature. He declined to take any action. This conclusively proves that police departments are being used, as pontifical inquisitors in support of the unlawful purposes of the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The part played by the newspapers of Con-. necticut is such that it cannot be pointed to with pride. They have played up with screaming headlines the arrests and false charges against Jehovah’s witnesses. They have published articles holding them up to ridicule and have often violated Section 6194 with offensive statements concerning them. But when the tide of battle turns in favor of these Christian people the press is discreetly silent. When an honest state’s attorney of Hartford county declined to prosecute a hundred cases the press was silent, or put a few lines in an obscure corner where it would not be noticed. The attitude of the legal profession is almost as bad. The lawyers, in general, are so cowed, so timorous and so fearful of incurring the wrath of the state’s priestly rulers, that they are afraid to take eases involving even their own precious liberties. They would rather see people lose their hard-bought civic freedom than boldly fight the enemies of liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This iniquitous business has been well commented upon by </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The American Protestant</span><span class="font8"> of Washington, D. C,, in its issue of October, 1938, entitled “Hierarchy Persecutes Jehovah’s witnesses”, from which the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It is impossible to find words strong enough with which to condemn this persecution. Although </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The American Prot- . estant</span><span class="font8"> does not agree with Jehovah’s wit- . nesses in all their religious tenets, we most firmly maintain that they have a perfect right to hold and to teach, their religious belief. They are law-abiding citizens, and ; they are loyal Americans.' Their teachings contain nothing whatever that may be called subversive of public morals, nor . do their teachings infringe upon the rights of others. All this being true, the Consti- ■ tution of the United States guarantees them full religions liberty. Any attempt -on the part of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to .deprive them of this religious liberty is a flagrant and shameful viola- &gt;' tion of the Federal Constitution. More- ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">over, the attempt is despicable, vicious, and satanic. The persecutors arc themselves-the criminals; the persecuted ones are innocent. It is the damnable ‘Holy Office’ of the popish Inquisition over again!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“In every free country, the Church of Rome is more dangerous than a stray dog affected with hydrophobia. She insists upon freedom for herself, but she will allow freedom to none other. Her Dark-Age doctrines cannot stand to have the light of discussion thrown upon them; hence, she must maintain them by feeding ‘the faithful’ only that which she wants them to know. Anyone who darqs to challenge these doctrines must be silenced—not by arguments but by persecution ! As to our Federal Constitution, this so-called church professedly 'tolerates’ religious freedom until the time shall come when she will be strong enough to ditch this freedom without danger to herself! How long will the American people let. this hydrophobic dog run at large ? Ilas it come to this in the United Skates that anyone who dares to lift his voice against Rome must be arrested and threatened with fines or a jail sentence? We must show the Church of Rome her place, or else this country is doomed 1”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The facts here presented prove that the priests have ruled a large portion of Connecticut and intend to rule it all. ffheir unlawful rule does not continue without protest. Jehovah’s-witnesses instituted an action in the United States District Court of Connecticut to restrain the enforcement of Section 6194 of Connecticut Statutes on the grounds that said statute is invalid because it infringes upon freedom of worship, freedom of speech and freedom of press. The District Court upheld the validity of the statute. An appeal has been taken from this decision to the United States Supreme Court, and just a few days ago the defendant City of Bristol and its officials were cited to appear before the highest court of the land to show cause why they should not be restrained from enforcing this unjust law against those whose only ‘offense’ is to proclaim the Kingdom message of Jehovah God. The decision of this high court may be instrumental in educating the pontifical;inquisitors of Connecticut in the fundamental principles of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font8">seems to me sheer hypocrisy to justify any military activity by stressing any advantage other than preparedness for war. In the first place, the Army does! not make men; it simply develops the best that are available. Secondly, -any benefit or enjoyment the individual has from the physical training provided is certainly loaded and must be regarded in the same light as the enjoyment the pig has from the best of food he is given to prepare him for the butchery. Physical culture is not provided to keep the army occupied any more than the rifle practice is to enable them to compete in the local shooting competition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Armies are trained for the business of war; physical training is designed to develop the human material to its maximum strength. Parade, discipline is to mould all minds into one —the war machine. Whether right or wrong there are some physical benefits, but the moral effect is hard to find. True, discipline is good, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font8">but its effect in the army is felt only in the presence and within the control limits of officers. History provides some not too silent testimony to the rape, thieving and in some cases illegal killings by invading armies temporarily out of'control. The World War holds some stories of this kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The average .law-abiding citizen does- not want to fight until he, feels he must. The biggest wasters behind the line make the best front-liners. Writers on this subject of military discipline who speak of the moral effect may be thinking of religion. In training a recruit, and keeping him up to his peak after he is trained, religion plays an important part. It holds pride of place with rille practice. Rifle practice shows him how to use a rille, and religion shows him why. In the next stoush religion will again be asked to throw its weight on the side of the Devil and religion will again insult and defame the name of Almighty God by responding as usual.—Fred J. Bond, Australia.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The vivacious argument about the $400,000,000 investment of foreigners in Mexican^ oil properties has set a lot of us to thinking about foreign investjments in our own eoun-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">try. A recent estimate places the stake of I foreigners, chiefly British, in the United States at the enormous figure of more than eight bil-<sup>1</sup> lion dollars, or about $65 for every man, woman and child of our population. At 6 percent annual return (and some of these val-’ uable oil, mineral, real estate and utility properties return a much higher rate than that) it would mean that through this ownership we are shipping abroad about a half billion dollars of income a year which, to the man in the street, we ought easily to be able to keep at home. This half billion which we send abroad every year is more than the total ■ claimed value of all the foreign oil holdings in Mexico. With it we could build each year a quarter of a million $2,000 houses, which would help industry a lot and go a long way toward solving the housing problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We seem to be making little progress toward agreeing upon an equitable basis of wealth distribution among our own citizens, but both liberals and conservatives ought to have little difficulty on the subject of sharing our wealth with foreigners. Here is a matter about which even the most cautious of our antediluvian Congressmen can venture to paw the air without the slightest fear of fanning a dangerous backfire among the folks back home. Good and sufficient reasons for doing something about such a condition are quite obvious, but it becomes still more important when we realize that nearly all the countries to whom we are paying this immense annual tribute, chiefly Great Britain, are heavily in debt to us either through de* faulted bonds or unpaid war loans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Several years ago we passed a wise law that no money shall be lent to any country </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font8">that is in arrears on war debts. Why isn’t it just as reasonable to pass a law that no rent, interest or dividends from American securities or real estate shall be paid to any foreigner whose government is in debt to us in any way ? If any foreigner should deem such an arrangement unfair to individual investors, it could be arranged that such government could reimburse said investors and take credit on its debt to us for the amount so paid. Thus the amounts which corporations and fiscal agents have been sending abroad would then be paid into our own treasury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This simple and utterly rational device would, of course, leave the basic investments wholly undisturbed. A more drastic and equally rational method would be to go directly in for exercising the right of eminent domain as Mexico has done. In our case, however, there would be little question as to how much or in what way payment would be made. The answer is that we would pay off in credits upon the money owing us and, as we never expect to get the debts settled in any other way, we could afford to be quite generous in appraising the various values involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Absentee ownership is one of the most vicious of all the phases of capitalism. It is possible to put up a pretty strong defense for excessive profits in various industries, such as Standard Oil or Carnegie Steel, when a large part of those profits is spent in our own country on educational or philanthropic projects, such as medical research, universities, libraries, and so on. But what defense can we put up for foreign-controlled concerns, such as the Shell Oil Co., whose only interest in our country is to exploit it, and whose proceeds are shipped abroad and spent there? Tremendously valuable mineral deposits in California and other states are owned abroad. Our people receive low wages and pay high prices for the products of these deposits in order that certain foreign groups shall strut about in luxury. They'don’t even contribute in any substantial way to philanthropic projects in their own countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Those who agree with this line of reasoning would perhaps do well to write their representatives in Washington and stir them up about it. It is a practical timely question that does not rest upon any foreign or domestic ism, but upon simple everyday business principles with which all of us are thoroughly familiar.—Ellis O. Jones, California.</span></p>

Why not just conclude that at such a rate of increase the entire population, barring none, are infected? So why the trouble and expense of testing? Oh, yes, Maggie,—but for good reasons. You see, there must be sufficient propaganda and excitement to push the works. While the testings are to be made without charge, the “big stuff” comes heading in When the big show is on. You see, too, after the test, then comes the next step, that of the cock-sure specific treatment.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>“This Flag-Salutin’ Business”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">Having served in the army I give some pertinent facts regarding this y &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^salutin' business. The army is</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">a good school in'gome respects. The first day is spent learning the<sup>1</sup> rules and regulations. Superior officers answer questions readily. One </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">pf</span><span class="font8"> the first questions a new man asks is, “ When are we supposed to salute ?” The answer given to a new man is that he is not entitled to salute until he receives his uniform, but after that he is supposed to salute all officers who are in uniform, unless such arc wider cover, as in a public building, hospital, restaurant, canteen, schoolhouse, dance hall or railroad station, or when they are on fatigue or class instruction duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We were particularly instructed not to salute when it could not be returned. If a soldier saluted an officer ten times, that officer had to salute the soldier ten times; no matter hoW much they hated each other, they had to salute. It was not considered a personal act, but respect for the uniform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We were warned not to fight with each other, because it was the same as striking the flag. Profanity was not allowed, if it showed disrespect to the mother of another soldier. Soldiers were instructed not to salute army chaplains, Y.M.C.A. officers or other Gold Bricks, as such were called; although such wore the same uniforms, they were not regarded as entitled to respect due a soldier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The army performs a ritual at sundown, called a retreat. A sergeant removes the colors from a mast. As he holds the flag in his hand and stands at attention the soldiers salute; then the sergeant salutes. Thus (theoretically) the soldier salutes the flag and the flag, salutes the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Citizens or visitom were not expected to salute, as they did not come under military regulations even when on government property. We were told that, as soldiers, sworn subjects of the government, it was our duty to salute; citizens might do so if they wished, but it was not compulsory ; they were citizens, not subjects; our government is a government of the people, and we were soldiers of the government of the people; the flag was a symbol of the people’s government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The army recognized all natural-born citizens as Americans and never tried to judge</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 16, 1936</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">the contents of a man’s heart regarding his love for his country. They never tried to club patriotism into anybody. Everything had to be in accordance with the laws of the government. Never did I hear it mentioned that anybody was not patriotic because he did not look or act the part. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Boys under 18 could not join the service without consent of their parents. The army thus taught obedience to parents and respect for all citizens’ rights. The American Army has never had an uprising or revolt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now I One of the questions I, as an exsoldier, would like to have answered is, “How is a schoolteacher, a paid servant of the public, entrusted merely with the teaching of reading, writing, arithmetic, qualified to enforce military flag-saluting laws, within a public building, and out of uniform?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I always thought the Army, Navy and Marines the only authorities on such matters, and still think so. Have you ever seen a picture of Washington, Lincoln or Grant saluting anything? Experience has taught me that it is not the real soldiers that are the flag-wavers. America does not have to maintain a regiment of spies to watch the citizens, as is done in all the flag-waving countries^ and real Americans have small use for the school authorities who polish the seats of their pants on a swivel chair and want to wallop some baby when its mother is not looking.—Harold B. Wheeler, Illinois.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Belief in Any God”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ One proof that religion originated with the Devil is found in the fact that the word virtually means “belief in any god”. There being but the one God, Jehovah, who is thus brought down by religion to the lev&lt;fl of figments of the imagination, what else could religion be but Satan’s counterfeit of devotion to the only and true Source of all life and blessings!</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Nevertheless, the second morning I picked the highest point in town, on an elevation of about 7,000'feet, and put on the lectures. We played “Exposed” and the people asked for more; so we put on “Religion and Christianity”. After we had finished the commissioner of the district sent five armed men after me, telling me that I was wanted. When we had completed the series I went with them, hardly-being able to walk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They forced pne to walk three blocks to headquarters, and when I got there I was brought before the magistrate and his face showed he had murder in his heart. He was a Roman Catholic of the worst type and told me that no one in the history of the country • had ever dared to speak against the Roman Catholic Church such as the records had done. J let him talk, and when he had finished I warned him that he is responsible to the Lord and also that if he trespassed on my rights I would bring him before the mixed court at Bey rout. I told, him'that I was not a native, but an American citizen. When he realized his predicament he tried to get out of it the ' best way he could and turned me over to the governor, who was a Greek Catholic. He asked me the object of our mission, and 1 started to give him the testimony, stating the object of our organization, etc. The man seemed happy to hear the message and asked me if I had anything in print. Of course, I presented the books and booklets and was able, by the Lord's grace, to place twenty-seven bound books and booklets with him and several other officers. He said, “Go, and may God be with you.” But before I left he asked</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">12</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">me to go to. the clerk and give him a statement pertaining to- our work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I went to-the clerk’s office and he began asking me question after question. He accused me of attacking the Roman Catholic Church and I told him we do not attack anybody, but merely tell tl|e truth. And I went on to show him that the Catholic system claims to be the only authority on the Bible; that they claim the pope is its head and that he is infallible ; that beds the successor of Peter—all &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">of which is unsupported by the Bible. I told him that his church also teaches that when । a man is dead he is really not dead, and that is entirely contrary to the Bible teaching, which says: “His breath goeth forth, he re-turneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” Also, ’Bo with thy might , what thy bands find to do; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.’ Also, “The dead praise not* the Lord, neither any that ' go down into silence.” Further, the Bible teaches that Jehovah created the heavens and the earth in six creative days, and nowhere does the Bible mention that Jehovah created a place in the bowels of the earth and called it rtiell”, and there appointed Satan to keep the fires going, and further appointed the Roman Catholic priests or clergy to act as a brokerage house for Jehovah and thus re-eeive a commission every time they 'released’ * someone from “purgatory”. I filled a document of seventeen pages, exposing the entire Roman ■ Catholic system and proving that it is anti-God, anti-Kingdom and the greatest enemy of mankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This particular clerk, being a Mohammedan, was very much pleased when he learned that the Bible does not teach “the Trinity”, but »• that this doctrine yas manufactured by the Devil in the Dark Ages and taught by the Roman Catholic system and their hirelings ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We returned to Tripoli the following day, but visited many Mohammedan towns along the way. One was a large city called Tartdos, ’ which is seventy percent Mohammedan and thirty percent so-called “Christian”. It has a population of about 45,000 people, and when wc put on the records everybody seemed to come out as one man, and in the course of twenty minutes wo were able to leave sixty booklets and two bound books. In the other towns that we called on on our way back to ' Tripoli we found the people eager and glad</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">to hear the message, as the news had reached them ahead of us regarding this work that was being carried on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then the friends at Tripoli and the surrounding territory organized into units and invaded these towns like an army of locusts and carried on the message to the threshold of the Devil’s stronghold.. In one town we played four records. The priest listened very attentively and was the first one to contribute for literature and urged everybody else to take it. When we were ready to leave, he went along with us to the next town and stood there and listened. We worked until about ten o'clock at night. Regardless of how tired we were, we were glad to have the privilege of being among those who were carrying forth the message of Jehovah’s kingdom and thus bringing this good news to those who were hungering and thirsting after righteousness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">♦ Consolation</span><span class="font8"> readers from all parts of the country -are writing in for more information as to how they may hear WBBR, the Watchtower radio station in Brooklyn, New York.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">While W<sup>T</sup>BBR serves the world’s greatest metropolis, the Greater New York area, with its 12,000,000 people, unfortunately its service radius is limited. Operating on a frequency of 1300 kilocycles with 1000-watt power, the station is strictly “local” to the New York area. The transmitter, however, ideally situated on Staten Island, sends a good, clear signal far beyond the immediate “service radius”. Listeners report excellent reception all year round from up - state New York, Connecticut, most of New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, and Long Island. This takes in a radius of approximately a hundred miles from the transmitter. In the wintertime, when reception generally^ is more favorable, the 'program Mouning Worship, at 6:30 in the morning, is heard far out in the Great Lakes region of the middle west, north into Canada, and south to beyond the Mason and Dixon line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font8"> readers everywhere, no doubt, even where unable to hear “the voice from the Watchtower”, appreciate the work done by WBBR in advertising the kingdom of Jehovah as the only hope of the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">On page 169 of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font8"> the following words appear: “Many good people of England are beginning to see the great danger that now threatens the Commonwealth and that such danger is the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.” Those words are absolutely borne out by experiences on board the ships </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">cf </span><span class="font8">Britain that dock here. Although on the big liners the Catholic-Fascist spirit is pretty strong and is getting stronger every day, yet there is always mixed in with the rest a class of honest and order-loving persons who see the danger of coming dictatorship that threatens them and their loved ones, and are in dismay as they see their liberties going bit by bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Most of the liners of the Cunard White Star were covered in the recent </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font8"> campaign, from the mighty Queen Mary down, and there are indications that it caused quite a stir. Since few of these ships are in port over the week-end it meant that they must be worked in the evenings, and this was done. Of course, many were ashore at the time, but their cabin-mates will pass the message on to them, and there was sufficient literature left on most ships to give them a working knowledge of the Lord’s organization, at any rate. Later visits with the phonograph will tend to cement this new interest and feed the people of good will on the only thing worth while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Cunard liner Carinthia deserves special mention. Although the Catholic contingent aboard claim it is a Catholic ship and are highly indignant at the invasion of what they elaim is their own private property, yet the fact remains that there are 46 bound books and over 100 booklets on this ship alone, and its yet only the surface is scratched. Many copies of the recent “Ship” issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font8"> were also left, and this should cause some to think deeply. The “Enemies” and “Safety” records were run throughout and caused eon-</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">14 </span><span class="font8">sternation in the ranks of the enemy. After playing “EnemiesF to an appreciative group one fellow came up and said, “This ’ere’s a Catholic ship—you can’t play that there record on this ’ere ship!” The other’s just laughed at him, and several expressed their thanks and took literature. In the printing shop the same record was run and five books were- placed as a direct result. Many said* that what they had heard i^lly concurred with their own view of the matter—they thought Christianity was all right but the ones supposed to be running it were of no good. Of course, there was the usual element there that had no use for the Bible either, but not much time was wasted on these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The motor liners Georgie and Britannic are also coming alone fine, with a total of 30 books and 120 booklets between them, and a good sound attendance. On the latter ship the phonograph was run in the fo’c’stle to about twenty seamen who showed deep interest. I placed the machine on a little box that brought out the tone stronger, and with a loud needle the judge’s voice filled the messroom. The faces of the men showed how the truth struck home. They were mostly broke, but all accepted booklets gladly and one came up with some tea at the finish. In the stewards’ mess the phonograph was shouted down by a group of religionists, but I went from table to table with the literature and many took books that would otherwise never have bothered to look into the matter, only they became curious at the disturbance and wanted to know the reason for such uproar. His satanic majesty always overreaches himself in his efforts to stop the truth from spreading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The twin ships Monarch of Bermuda and Queen of Bermuda are the pride and delight of the Furness line, and justly so. Their sleek, gray hulls and white superstructure topped by three red and black funnels make them objects of beauty, and this is enhanced by their interiors. It is a sight worth seeing'to view these sister ships side by side at night at the same pier, their funnels thrown into bold relief by a<sup>j</sup> -battery of concealed floodlights. Each carrying a crew of around 440, there is intense interest on each, as their combined total of 57 books and 1S2 booklets will show. The “Enemies” record was played on the bridge of both these ships, to the great amazement of the navigating officers there. Several took books, though.—Erie Symondson, New York, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(To be continued)</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Chemistry of the Human Body</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The body of a man weighing 160 pounds is worth about $2. In weight and composition it corresponds roughly to that of a thousand eggs. It contains some thirty-five hundred cubic feet of gas, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, It contains fat enough to make eleven pounds of candles, and carbon enough to make about nine thousand lead pencils. It has phosphorus sufficient to make 800,000 matches, and sugar enough to make about sixty ordinary cubes. Of iron there is enough to make seven ten-penny nails. It has two pounds of limp, twenty teaspoonfuls of salt, and two doses of magnesia. Sixty-eight percent of the body is water; so when you look at a 160-pound man you are gazing on 109 pounds of water with 51 pounds of trimmings. [And, says the cartoonist, it is some satisfaction to know one is worth at least $2. The ^rouble is, try to get it.]</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>The Wonderful Human Heart</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The human heart is the most marvelous machine that imagination could conceive of. When it is turning over smoothly, one is barely aware that he has a heart in his breast. Only when it develops a knock does concern arise. Your heart has been beating 70-odd times a minute, 4,300 times an hour, 103,200 times a day, all the years of your life. Every hour of the day, for it never sleeps, it pumps 50 gallons of blood through a tireless little engine and a marvelous system of pipes. The only rest the heart ever gets is between beats. That is why set periods of rest for men and women are so essential to its well-being. Heart disease is the greatest of modern killers.— Edwin C. Hill, in &quot;Human Side of the News’*.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>The Drying of Lumber</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Lumber is now dried for market by dry- kiln methods in which temperature, humidity, ventilation and circulation of air are eon-trolled to a nicety. The water in fresh timber varies greatly. A thousand feet of freshly sawn Canadian yellow birch weighs about 4,700 pounds, of which about 2,000 pounds is water. When this wood is dried the 2,000 pounds of water is reduced to about 190 pounds. The Douglas fir contains only about 900 pounds of water per thousand feet.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>The Human Brain and Eye</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ In a single minute the human brain makes about a hundred connections, which corresponds to the performance of a telephone switchboard functioning with fourteen telephone operators and a supervisor. The telephone bill for the connections which a single normal human brain carries in the course of a year may be estimated at 6^ million Swiss francs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The human eye, with the precision of an intricate film apparatus, takes in a minute approximately 1,300 pictures, develops them, leads them to the nerve centers and stores them as evidence. In fifteen hours’ daily work one and one-half million pictures are taken. The raw material for a film to store such pictures would occupy about twenty kilometers of space and cost, in round numbers, 50,000 shillings. The operating expenses of such a precision apparatus as the eye would amount to about 20,000,000 shillings annually .-Translated from the German.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Searchlights for Exploring Skies</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The new searchlights for exploring the skies, prepared by the United States Army, throw a beam 12,000 yards. Each searchlight is approximately 2,000,000,000 candlepower. It seems as if the figures for everything, in these days, run into the billions. What a relief it will be when God’s kingdom is in full sway and the savings of the people need not be thrown away on such foolishness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Air Photographs for Forestry Purposes </span><span class="font8">♦ The modern forester sits in an office, measures the size and height of the timber in the area he intends to cut, lays out his logging units and cutting areas, and locates his logging roads, dam sites and camps all from air photographs, which, experience has shown, are as accurate as ground surveys and cost only a fraction as much.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Several serpents, notably the boa and Python, still have in the rear of their bodies several useless pieces of bone which are what is left of the lost hind legs, thus completely confirming the statement of Holy Writ that the serpent did not originally go upon its belly, but walked on legs as do other animals.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>Pedestrians Have Rights</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided that pedestrians have the same rights on highways without sidewalks as have the automobiles: also that a person walking along the right portion of a paved roadway is not required to turn and look for approaching traffic, or step off the highway to permit an automobile to pass. This is good law, but in practice it seems safest for the pedestrian to walk on the left side of the road, facing traffic, and step clear off the road to let the cars go by, provided he wants to live. Also, and this is important, examination of pedestrians killed in New York in 1936 and 1937 showed that 34 percent of them had been drinking more ' than was good for them and 38 percent gave evidence of some alcoholism.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">♦ At the toll of $1.25 for each ear, the new five-span bridge across the St. Lawrence river at the Thousand Islands is expected to pay for itself in fifteen years. The roadway is 150 feet above ’ the river. As the bridge is only 325 miles from New York city it can be crossed the day the car driver leaves the metropolis, .and is expected to be used by about 1,000,000 motor vehicles annually.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">♦ The new highway bridge over the Neches river at Port Arthur, Texas, rises from level shores to a height of 176 feet clearance above the water. Piers were sunk 90 to 105 feet below ocean level and are 32 feet in diameter. The superstructure, which rises to a height of 230 feet, is intended to withstand a wind velocity of 130 miles an hour.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<h6><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>Safety Reflecting Lighting System</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ It seems apparent that the new safety reflecting lighting system will come into general use. The reflectors, made of Incite, are an inch and a half ip diameter. Set on stanchions thirty inches high, eight feet to the right of the roadway, and spaced 100 feet apart, they pick up the light from the headlamps of an approaching car, deflect it upon the surface of the road, and illuminate it for </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">full mile ahead. After a month’s trial on the much-used road between Detroit and Lansing, its general acceptance seems certain.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>Slowpoke Drivers</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Pennsylvania police commissioner, P. W. Foote, is experimenting with loudspeakers for use on the 600 police patrol cars traversing Pennsylvania highways. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If we can develop a speaker that can be heard several yards down-the road, I’ll have the patrolmen break up these traffic jams caused by beetle drivers by barking to them to speed up or get off the highway. The trouble with pokey driving is it congests traffic on the main highways. Then cars are apt to start pulling out of line, with bead-on collisions as the result.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>Streetcars Gone for Ever</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Streetears are gone for ever in more than half of'the cities in the United States with population in excess of 10,000. In 1920 there were only twelve all-bus cities.' Most streetears are more comfortable and safer than most buses, but are more awkward in traffic, more difficult to board, and the rails are objectionable and expensive as well.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Attention; Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' Dear Judge:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">KTHS was one of the stations carrying ' your broadcast of September 11 and October 2. We are enclosing some of the representative comments on the October 2 broadcast for your use and inspection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now perhaps you will accept our frank eriti-cism of your radio work in a cooperative spirit. The writer belongs to no church. Members of ■his family belong to the Catholic, Methodist, and Christian churches. I have no interest in joining any particular church at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I believe it was Voltaire who said: “I may not believe one word you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say them.”’ ■ And in the interests of upholding free speech our. station carried your broadcasts. Naturally we were subjected to bitter pre-broadcast attacks by Catholics, and received several letters after the broadcasts,'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The facilities of KTHS are open to both sides of any controversy, and the Catholics . can have access to our microphone on equal terms to answer your charges. But, Judge, have you considered using what is known to be good business methods in advancing the welfare of your group ? By that T mean eon-centrate on the advantages of Jehovah’s witnesses and leave out the bitter attacks on any one articular church. We find it much easier to sell our advertising space by concentrating on what we have to offer and forget about ' knocking the competition. Truth will out, and the wrongs of the Catholic church or any - other group will sooner or later come to the foreground. The attempts to muzzle your broadcasts and meetings will create a question in the minds of many who may not be concerned one way or another now. They will&quot; ask: “Is the Catholic church afraid of the truth—if this is the truth?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The strenuous efforts made by Catholies</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 16, 1938 </span><span class="font8">on- certain stations to keep your broadcasts off are known to me personally, and naturally . I resent any group using such strong-arm tactics as boycotts, etc., to advance their wishes. None of them will answer your charges with their own broadcasts, I have found, and so I have little sympathy for their wish to have your broadcasts barred. On the other hand, I do think religious groups should confine their radio work to advancing their own organization or doctrine, and leave off attacks of other beliefs. While radio must always be a platform of free speech, I think religious arguments do not belong on a program of any individual group. Remember, that many arguments, while justified perhaps, involve so much confusion and ill will to become a nuisance, and stations arc reluctant to make arrangements for such features, regardless of the revenue involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I hope you can find a way to advance your organization’s work in a more amicable manner which I am sure will be full of results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Yours very truly,</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Your letter of the 17th addressed to the Watchtower has been handed to me. Thank you for writing frankly. Before answering your questions I must state a few facts plainly that you may know my position. You refer* to Jehovah’s witnesses as a group, in fact you say, “Have you considered using ,what is known to be good business methods in ad-■ vaneing the welfare of your group”. Please be assured, first, that Jehovah’s witnesses are not a religious group nor a religious organization, that they are Christians duly devoted to following in the footsteps of Jesus Christ; second, T am making no effort to advance the welfare of Jehovah’s witnesses or any other organization. That may sound* strange, but Jehovah’s witnesses are in no wise in competition with any organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Religion and Christianity are diametrically</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">opposed one to the other. Religion is a snare and a racket, and has'been for more than five thousand years, and this is proved by the Bible plainly. Religion is based upon the traditions of men, and not upon the Bible. Jesus made this clear in his words addressed to the clergy of the Jews who had fallen away from God’s Word and had become religionists. (See Matthew 15:1-9.) The apostle Paul was once a religionist, and while so persecuted Christians, and did it vigorously, and when he saw his error he became a Christian. (See Galatians 1:13-17 ; Acts 26: 4, 5.) I cite these facts merely to emphasize the difference between Christianity and religion. Religion is purely an invention of Satan, the great adversary of God, and, he uses it to mislead and blind men, and I have no doubt that there are many religionists who advocate their religion with sincerity yet are entirely blind to what it is doing for them, and for others. Christianity means a close adherence to the Word of Jehovah God as set forth in the Bible. It was Jesus Christ who took the lead in this, and therefore his followers are called Christians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We will both agree that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority is the controlling body of the Catholic organization, whereas the mass of Catholic people are known as the Catholic laity, or children of the church. It is. the Hierarchy of Authority that is responsible for the course the organization has taken. There are millions of honest and sincere Catholics who are in no wise responsible for the unrighteous course taken by the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We will also agree that the history of the ruling body of the Catholic organization has for centuries been guilty of oppression of the common people and the destruction of human liberty. The history of the persecution in Spain, Mexico, and other places emphasizes this fact. A brief outline of this, set out in the older editions of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica,</span><span class="font8"> clearly discloses that the chief purpose of the inquisition was to find an excuse to confiscate the property particularly of the Jews and other wealthy persons, and these men were declared to be heretics and many of them burned that their property might be confiscated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is further well known that the Catholic Hierarchy is in politics in every country. They have a large proportion of public officials at Washington. The same is true in England. It is true in practically every other country</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">18 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' </span><span class="font8">on earth. On this subject it would be enlightening to read a book written by E. Boyd Barrett, an ex-Catholie priest, who honestly exposes the Hierarchy in no uncertain terms and which the Catholic Hierarchy has never dared deny. With this preamble let me state . then the real purpose of Jehovah’s witnesses. They, recognize that God has promised to es-tablish-on this earth a government of righteousness under Christ Jesus as the invisible ruler, and faithful men of olden times whom the Scriptures declare shall be resurrected are to be the visible rulers, and all obedient persons under that righteous government shall / be granted everlasting life in peace and in happiness. Seeing that the Scriptures clearly teach this, and knowing that there is no other means of administering life, comfort and blessing to the human race except by and through that Kingdom, they become followers of Christ Jesus and proclaim the message that He pro- . claimed. It was He who urged IIis followers to always pray for the coming of that Kingdom. Now the Scriptures and the physical facts show that Christ is enthroned and the Kingdom is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In opposition to the Kingdom the Devil has brought forth the corporate state or totalitarian government ruled by visible and arbitrary men with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy as its spiritual overlord working hand in glove with such men as Mussolini and Hitler. The ambition of this, crowd is to rule the world. As I stated in London on September the 11th, this combine will get possesssion of England. Since then the facts show that it is already an almost accomplished thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is a determined effort on the part of the same crowd to grab control of America and rule it, change the Constitution or abolish it entirely, and take away all the liberties 'x of the people. The Roman Catholic Hier-?4#f archy, therefore, is in fact a political institution bent on taking away the liberties of the people and ruling arbitrarily. This operation they are carrying on under the cloak of religion because the people have been led to believe all these years that religion and Christianity are one and the same. In fact the Catholics call theirs the Christian religion and the Catholic Church the church. I have no objection to their calling it what they please ; my point is this: Putting aside the question of the differences between those who study the Bible, no institution has any right or privilege to operate under the pretext of being</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">consolation</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">the servants' of God and use that cloak to destroy the liberties of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A major portion of the public press of . America is aware of the facts herein stated, but they are afraid of the Catholic organization and afraid to tell the truth. The Catholic organization is afraid to come in the open and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">l </span><span class="font8">discuss these matters. I have openly challenged the Hierarchy for several years to deny wnat I have stated and do it publicly, and they refuse. And why I. Not because they have not many able men to represent them, men with much more natural ability than I possess, but those keen fellows well know that they have not a leg to stand on when it comes to answering the charge that they are in the game for political reasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Knowing the facts which I do and failing to speak of them, I would be a traitor to the America*! people and an unfaithful servant of the Lord. My purpose in calling attention to the derelictions of the Catholic organization is this-, that the people may get their eyes open to the fact that their liberties are ■ at stake, and not only that, but, following in the course that the Hiefarchy is leading them, they are headed for certain destruction. If the Catholic Hierarchy had real faith in their doctrines and the course they are pursuing, they would have no hesitancy in defending the same. The radio is a God-given means pf reaching the people, because no man ever invented the radio. The radio should be used to inform the people. For ten years past I have used on an average 240 radio stations a'year at least once every week to put forth publicly the plain teachings of Jesus and His ■ apostles. In the last two years I have particularly called attention to the fact that religion is a.snare and a racket and that the people are being deceived. I deem it my duty both to man and God to do this thing because ■ I know every interest of the human race is^ at stake and the fundamental principles of the American government which have been held dear to the American citizens so long are in jeopardy and it now seems a certainty that the people are going to lose their liberties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In my opinion, if the owners of radio stations in the United States really saw the issue they would open their stations for a free and fair discussion of'the questions at issue and let the American people decide for themselves whieh way they want to go. Jehovah’s wit-' nesses are not seeking members. They are seeking to tell the people the truth,, and they are </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 18,1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">doing it at great cost and expense to themselves because they believe that that is their duty and it is worth while that they should do it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One great error into which Americans have fallen in recent years is to measure everything by money. Radio stations are operated chiefly for the revenue. More than ten years ago before the Federal Radio Commission I contended that the radio should be opened as freely to the public for consideration of questions of public interest as the halls in which political meetings are held. I still believe so. Were it not for the desire for financial gain and for fear of losing the same, radio stations would give no heed to the bowlings of the Catholic clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And now, my dear Sir, please pardon my lengthy letter, but I must express my congratulations to you and my appreciation of the fact that your station has been open to the consideration of public questions and that the Catholics have the same access to it as anybody else. That is the only proper course. Speech should be free over the microphone. I mean by that, uneensored and unhindered and no one should be held responsible for what is said except the speaker himself. If there were more owners of radio stations like yourself no heed would be given to the bowlings of the Hierarchy and there would be a fair and open discussion of great questions that involve the rights of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Why not some promtnent radio station take the tead in suggesting to the Hierarchy that they select a man for a series of public discussions by radio to answer the charges that I have made, I taking the same amount of time? I am sure that this matter is far more serious than you have ever considered it. I make this prediction with absolute certainty that it Is going to come to pass unless there Is a marked awakening of the American people soon, to wit: That within a few years Fascism and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy together will absolutely control America, dictate Its policies, so amend the Constitution that it is worthless to the people, regiment the people and take away practically all their liberties, particularly liberty of speech, liberty of press, and liberty of worship, exactly as it has been done tn Germany, if the American people awaken too late to save themselves from this dlssater, It will not be because I have refrained from doing what Is within my feeble power to accomplish, namely, to give the warning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Be assured, my dear Sir, of my very best wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Yours sincerely,</span></p><img src="g_E_19381116_files/g_E_19381116-7.png" alt="" style="width:202pt;height:76pt;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Great Religionists; Thomas Torquemada </span><span class="font8">♦ That history repeats itself is a well-known axiom. In this section will be presented a series of biographies showing not only that it repeats itself, but that this repetition is enlightening for a proper understanding of modern events. The first actor to be considered is Thomas Torquemada, inquisitor-general of Spain in the reign of the patrons of Columbus, Ferdinand and Isabella. In his life, deeds and motives is found an instructive parallel of occurrences that is commended to the student of the present. The title of Torquemada may not be understood by all; so an explanatory description of the Spanish Inquisition, the institution which he supervised, is furnished. Since these facts will not be complimentary to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and in order to anticipate their hackneyed self-defense of <sup>if</sup>Lies”, the authorities have been carefully chosen; chief among these is the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia Britannica,</span><span class="font8"> usually regarded capable of defending its statements. Also considered are </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Spanish Inquisition,</span><span class="font8"> by Charles T. Gorham, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Jeivish Quarterly Review,</span><span class="font8"> 1901-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“For more than 300 years the [so-called] Christian religion in Spain was in practise the most elaborately and perfectly constructed engine of tyranny that the wit of man has ever devised. Every person who dared to think for himself in matters of faith must, have lain down to rest at night shivering with fear. There was about him a mystic power, secret, silent, awful, irresistible as the forces of nature, which might at any moment drag him from his home, demand an account of every aet, word and thought of all that he had done, and all that he had left undone and wrench his bones on the merciless rack till the required answer was given. Every thinker was a haunted man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“This terrible power was the Inquisition or Holy Office.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Spanish Inquisition,</span><span class="font8"> by Gorham, page 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“In 1233 . . . the Inquisition was formally inaugurated by Pope Gregory IX when a code for the regulation of proceedings against heresy was drawn up. It was made applicable to France, Germany, Italy and the -Spanish kingdom of Aragon but its birthplace was the City of the Seven' Hills.” (The present location of Vatican City)— </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Spanish Inquisition,</span><span class="font8"> Gorham, page 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Pope Sixtus IV, who was fully alive to i the financial advantages of the measure, issued a bull dated November 1, 1478, authorizing the appointment of three ecclesiastics charged with the detection and suppression of heresy and providing for their removal and replacement at the royal pleasure.”-—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Spanish Inquisition,</span><span class="font8"> page 6,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Regarding the tortures inflicted on opposers whether Protestant, Jew, or Moorish infidel, it is chronicled: “The cruelty was atrocious but the Inquisition in its greed to manufacture criminals and seize their property considered the need urgent. And it obtained the express authority of two popes, Innocent IV &quot;&nbsp;and Urban IV, to employ this means for the discovery of accomplices.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Neither youth nor age gave immunity from torture', instances being recorded of women of 78, 80 and 90 being subjected to this barbarity; . . . Even expectant^mothers were only allowed the privileges of being seated instead of being stretched on the rack, while enduring the extremely severe pain of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">garrote </span><span class="font8">—two sharp cords bound around each arm and two around each leg and twisted with a lever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Torture is a test of endurance but the experiences of the Inquisitors must have shown them that it was no test of truth.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Spanish Inquisition,</span><span class="font8"> pages 25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the gag and the censorship of word and publication which are employed by Hitler . and Mussolini today are compared to those practiced by the Holy Office, the kinship between the two appears stronger. Note the following excerpts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“As the Inquisition was expressly formed to carry on a warfare against liberty of thought in any form, it was natural enough that it should exercise a rigid supervision of all print- ■ ed matter.</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">’’-The Spanish Inquisition,</span><span class="font8"> page 83.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Speaking of the censorship and destruction of books which even went so far as to the examination of shipments of literature; note this statement: “The whole book trade passed through the Holy Office and prospered as might have been expected. Delays, robberies, losses, seizures, damage and vexations of every</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">kind suffered from an insane fear of books as the most dangerous of all explosives, and ■ from the delusion that Spain would be ruined by being informed of what the outer world was thinking and doing. So the outer world was kept at a safe distance and Spain did the work of ruin all by herself. The Inquisition was the cemetery of literature.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The, Spanish, Inquisition,</span><span class="font8"> page 87.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is but a brief survey of an institution which has had 700 years to ravage and gut the Catholic countries of the world and at this hour is also at work in America., With this background let us return to our “hero” Torquemada, who had the distinguished privilege of . superintending their depredations in Spain toward the close of the fifteenth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Torquemada (14201 4 9 8) <sup>-t</sup> e ar ly di splayed an attraction for the Dominican order ; and, as soon as allowed, he joined the Friars Preachers in their convent in Valladolid. ,. .

<p><span class="font8">een years that he was inquisitor-general it is said that he burned 10,220 persons, condemned 6,860 others to be burned in effigy.” (Which meant that their property would be confiscated.) “The sovereigns, too, saw the stream of money, which they had hoped for, diverted to the coffers of the Holy Office.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica</span><span class="font8"> (11th Edition), Vol. 27, pages 58, 59.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In substantiation of the fact that he was an especial persecutor of the Jews, and that he did so in order to enrich his office, in a way suggestive of Hitler and Mussolini, various authorities are quoted. (The horrible </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">aulo-da-fe</span><span class="font8"> referred to below was the practice of making a ceremony of the burning of the condemned victim, which was instituted by Torquemada.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“This is not the place to investigate all the motives that prompted Ferdinand and Isabella to issue their famous decrees for the expulsion of the Jews and the establishment of the Inquisition. These measures presented two sides of the same policy. Spain was to be purged of all Jews whether professing or not. Those who were ostensibly Jews were caught by the decree for their expulsion, and those who outwardly conformed to Christianity, the new Christians or Marra-tios, were caught in the net of the Inquisition, and the heavy cost of the king's conquest was met both by the direct confiscation of the Jews’ property, which they were forced to leave behind, and by the kings’ “third” of all; grant of such a third in favor of a famous monastery in Cordova is reproduced in facsimile at thb head of this article.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Jewish Quarterly Review, </span><span class="font8">Vol. 33, page 394, “Auto-da-fe and Jew.” “In 1485 and 1490 great </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">aulos</span><span class="font8"> were held at Toledo in each of which the effigies of more than 400 dead persons were burned. From the inquisitorial point of view this elaborate prosecution of the dead was not the senseless and cruel buffoonery' it appears. There was money in it. The rights and feelings of the victims of the Holy Office and their kindred were the last things to be considered or rather they were not considered at all.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Spanish Inquisition,</span><span class="font8"> page 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The sovereigns Isabella and Ferdinand issued a decree ordering every Jew either to embrace Christianity or leave the country, 4 months being given to make up their minds. But this was not enough for the InquisitorGeneral [Torquemada] who in the following month (April) issued orders -to forbid </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Chris</span><span class="font8">tians [Catholies] under severe penalties having any communication with the Jews or after the period of grace to supply them even with the necessaries of life. The former prohibition made it impossible for the unfortunate people to sell their goods, which hence fell to the Inquisition. The numbers of Jewish families driven out of the country by Tor-quemada is variously stated from Mariana’s 1,700,000 to the more probable 800,000 of later historians. The loss to Spain was enormous, and from this act of the Dominican the commercial decay of Spain dates.”—-</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica,</span><span class="font8"> Vol. 27, page 60.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Although Torquemada’s biographer says that he died “full of years and merit”, the following written by a non-Catholic states: “The name of Torquemada stands for all that is intolerant and narrow, despotic'and cruel. He was no real statesman or minister of the gospel, but a blind fanatic, who failed, to see that faith, which is a gift of God, cannot be imposed on any conscience by force.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica,</span><span class="font8"> Vol. 27, page 60.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The above final estimate of Torquemada fails to note that the motive behind the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In</span><span class="font8">quisition was not really to make converts, but to amass wealth, and this by means of murder and theft. Any sane organization would have known it would be impossible to convert to Catholicism by such practices; consequently the net result of enriching the Roman Catholic Hierarchy through stealing the substance and the heritages of those bereft and, those slain must, be considered the sole motive. Let the reader also remark the great similarity of this inquisitional purge as compared with the inquisitorial tactics of the pope’s present allies Hitler, Franco and Mussolini. Most noteworthy among the objectives of Hitler and Mussolini have been the humiliation and deprivation of the Jewish race; therefore those who have a difficulty in understanding the present attack on the Jews will receive a shocking eye-opener when it is recalled to mind that in Spain alone during the purge of the fifteenth century nearly a million Jews were expelled, dispossessed or killed and their property turned over to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy or to the Crown. Let sober-minded people throughout the world consider Torquemada, one of the greatest religionists of all times, as the ancestor and blood-brother in the Catholic faith of Hitler, Mussolini, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">22 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Franco. Forget not that popes have always been the spiritual overseers of this unspeakable villainy, masters who beamed down upon, blessed and condoned the work of their sons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Stated in other phrase, the leopard never changes its spots, nor the inquisition its methods. Nor has it ever ceased to function. No doubt when the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has been annihilated and its history chronicled truthfully and sanely, it will be found that the Inquisition has had a continuous and notable position in the annals of Catholic Action. No doubt also the chief present officers are the Jesuits, in the past expelled from many countries, but to this day secretly terrorizing every country on earth and reporting their malignities to that infamous department of Vatican headquarters of perpetual file name “Inquisition” or “Holy Office”. Its files will likely be found to contain a record of the majority of crimes ever committed, perhaps with a note of the official commendation accorded the perpetrator. A leopard never changes its spots; once an Inqulsitioner, always an In-quisitioner I</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is only one reason for dragging the foul history of Torquemada out of the oblivion in which it really should remain. It is to cast light on present world conditions by demonstrating that he was not only an earlier member of the same order but the model and instructor of the Inquisitioners in Germany, Italy, Spain, and other countries today. This is not a statement of conjecture. In proof, note that Mussolini has turned Catholic since making a political concordat with the pope; Hitler asked the pope’s permission before going into Austria, and was congratulated (according to a New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> account) on his triumphal entry into Czechoslovakia, by all the German bishops; as for Franco, contributions have been taken up from the Catholic population of many countries to aid in his murder of other Catholics </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">because the pope has decreed it so.</span><span class="font8"> No doubt these fiends arc congratulating themselves that they are exceeding the standard of Torquemada and other exponents of the heinous office. Seven hundred years is a long period of crime to cover adequately. In later issues, however, proof will be submitted in a similar manner of the depredations in other countries. Bear in mind that this work will never cease until the Hierarchy ceases!</span></p>

The cause of poltergeist is always the same: the vicious acts of demons bent on frightening or abusing mankind.

There is a general complaint of inefficiency, indolence and lack of interest of native laborers in their work, owing tq the fact that they do not get enough to eat.

It finally got so hot that even the natives could no longer bear the combination of intense heat and 100-pereent humidity. But there was and is gold, and where there is gold men wall find a way to go. The Carrier Corporation, Syracuse, N. Y., sent engineers, and for a year studied rock temperature, humidity, oxidation, heat from human bodies, frictional heat from machinery, and heat from explosives. Then they installed an air-conditioning apparatus with a cooling effect equaling 4,000,000 pounds of ice every twenty-four hours.

<p><span class="font8">♦ This is a queer country. Recently I have been attending “Prince of Peace” oratorical contests, where high-school students stand up in fine modern churches and condemn and . ridicule the flag-waving militaristic idea of patriotism.

<p><span class="font8">Pickpoeketry flourishes in Washington, D. C. Senator Borah, who makes it a business to mingle with ™ the common people, says it is the second - worst crime center in the United States. The Public Utility Commissions stand back of the Washington streetear lines in their boost of earfares'from four tokens for 30 cents to six tokens for 50 cents; and also in the provision that if one is very poor, and has but 25 cents, he may not have three tokens for that; for that would save the poor people $90,000 a year, if it were generally permitted. And so, to help the regular organized pickpocket brigade, one must either find 50 cents, and invest it in six tokens, whether he can afford the investment or not, or he may and must pay ten cents for a ride. The efficiency experts have it all figured out, to a cat’s eyebrow.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Recent investigations by a scientist prove that the reports of longevity in the Balkan countries are by no means exaggerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An article in &quot;Pester Lloyd”, published in Budapest, states that practically <sup>L</sup> all the reports emanate from southern Serbia, Bulgaria and northern Greece. It is estimated that there are 4,000 people living in the Balkan Peninsula aged 100 years or more and practically all of these are energetic and healthy, fully in control of their faculties, and walk about like young people of fifty or sixty. The work they perform each day is the same as they have done for the past sixty -years, and they still appear to be in the prime<sup>1 </sup>of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A scientist from Czechoslovakia examined 100 persons, each of whom was at least a centenarian. Although he admitted that he could not find the secret of their long life, some of his observations‘are interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The main diet of these people is yoghurt and vegetables such as peas and beans, the latter constituting a national dish in that part . of Europe. Meat is seldom eaten, and most of the old people never see it. Some were heavy smokers; others did not smoke at all. Some liked wanes and spirits; others were teetotalers. One advantage enjoyed by all was life ■ in the open air. The rush of modern life is unknown to them. Many have never seen a town, been on a. railway journey or used a telephone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Champion of these youngsters seems to be Bachtian Kozan, aged 130. He still works in the fields, walks for three or four hours each ’ day without showing signs of fatigue, never wears spectacles, has never been ill, and claims to never have had trouble with his teeth. He has been twice married and his eldest son died aged 105. His youngest son is 87 years old. Needless to say, he is unable to entertain all his descendants. His children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-greatgrandchildren have not been counted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If such longevity is possible under present conditions, when the earth is- imperfect and । unable to 'yield its increase’, why should it-be thought strange that, under the reign of Christ, when “the inhabitant shall not say,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">26</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am sick<sup>-</sup>’ (Isaiah 33:24), when the 'wilderness shall rejoice and blossom as the rose’ (Isaiah 35:1), and when the blessing of Jehovah shall be upon all people, everlasting life will be a possibility?

<p><span class="font16">O</span><span class="font8">VERHEAD flew two beautiful pigeons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Across the garden, over the houses, out across the town they flew, circling and wheeling. Jane and Sally watched them, outlined against the dull gray of the November sky, until they finally came to rest in Jane’s own back yard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“What pretty pigeons!” remarked Sally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“They are ours,” replied Jane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Yours?” Sally asked. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font8"> didn’t know you had got some new ones.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Didn’t I tell you? Do you remember the pigeon Buddy brought home last winter—the one that pecked at the door mornings until we brought breakfast? Buddy named the pigeon 'Jimmy’. Well, one day Jimmy laid some eggs. These are Jimmy’s babies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I’ll bet that was a surprise,” laughed Sally. BOHOhJ Just then Buddy came around house, sobbing as if his heart were breaking—deep, weeping sobs that seemed too large for his little body. On a leash at his side trotted the dog which he had taken for his own nearly four months ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>&lt;r</sup>Buddy<sub>t</sub> what’s wrong?” cried Jane, anxiously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The—police—they—oh, Jane,” and Buddy sat down on a step, drawing his little dog into his arms. The pup licked his master’s face and whined softly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“What about the police, Buddy?” asked Sally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“They’re going to kill my doggie.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Why should they kill him?” Jane asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Because—because he—” Choked with sobs, Buddy buried his face against the dog’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Please,* dear, try to tell me what is wrong. Perhaps I can help somehow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Buddy rubbed his sleeve across his face, and answered, “We were all playing together, Jaek, Joe, Clair, Squint, and I—and Comet.” At mention of his name, the dog wagged his tail, the long tail, wnth the beautiful bushy white tip, that had given him his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Buddy patted the pub’s head and went on, “Comet always plays with us and he never hurts anyone, except maybe when he grabs a stick too elose and touches our hands with his teeth. Everyone knows he didn’t mean it, and none of the fellows care.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Comet, hearing something about a stick, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER </span><span class="font8">16, 1933 had hurried off and found one, dropping it at Buddy’s feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Not now, Comet. After while—maybe— oh, Jane, it isn’t fair! Joe was teasing Comet. He knows the dog’s hind legs are tender since he had dis—dis—that sickness dogs get. But he kept grabbing his tail and touching his legs, until Comet couldn’t stand it any more and bit Joe on the leg.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“What did Joe do then?”. Jane asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“He ran home crying and Clair said, “Now you’ll get it, Buddy. I’m going to tell the police that your dog bit Joe. Then they’ll shoot your dog.’ And they will, Jane. They killed Ed’s dog because it bit a man who kicked it in the side.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A sudden movement at the corner of the house made them turn. There stood Joe, his dark olive skin lighter than usual, his dark eyes filled with tears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Joe,” Jane said, “don’t you like Comet?” “Oh, yes, he’s a nice dog,” replied Joe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Then why did you tease him? You’ve caused so much sorrow, Joe. Comet is a friendly little dog, but he’s going to be taken away from his master and shot. Buddy loves, his pet and will have many heartaches over losing him. All because you wanted to have some fun that wasn’t any fun for the dog.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Joe, wiping away a tear wnth the back of his hand, sobbed when Comet, wagging his tail expectantly, dropped his stick at Joe’s feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“You see, Joe,” Jane went on, “a boy may protect himself with his fists, yet people seem to think a dog should not protect himself with his teeth.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Come with me,” Joe said, suddenly, catching Buddy’s hand and pulling him along. Too surprised to say anything, Buddy followed—down the street, around the corner, down another street, and another, clear into the center of town. At last they stopped at the police station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With his little jaw set firmly, Joe faced the policeman at the desk and told his story. “So you see,” he ended, “it was all my fault and you just can’t shoot Comet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“In that ease,” the policeman ’said, “we may. let Comet off this time. But you must remember never to tease a dog again.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">• In common with all Europe Britain is kept on edge waiting for what Hitler may say. He seems able to keep silent at times, when he is waiting for help from his unseen aides. He acts, he says, according to the grace of God; but as he has set up a god of his own, and is a persecutor of those who take the Scriptures for their guide, and is particularly cruel towards Jehovah’s witnesses, persecuting them even unto death, it is certain that the unseen help he waits for and gets is from the enemy of God, the Devil, and through demons. Waiting for Hitler the whole course of world polities and its material affairs may be said to be in the balance. He seems practical enough to be called a realist, even though he is a visionary, and many think that he will not readily- plunge his newly built Germany into the ruin which a war with the nations would surely bring. That the distress of the Sudeten Germans in Czechoslovakia was magnified out of all proportion to reality, and that his agitation for them was but a means of raising a ^rouble which would give him a reason for action against the Czechs, was well understood, and at present there seems to be a hardening of feeling of condemnation in Britain because of the actions of the Nazi government. No doubt Hitler knew that he might have to stand alone if he decided to push his “offensive” against the Czechs to the limit. His friend Mussolini is as ambitious as he is, and if Italy had become the war ally of Germany there would have been a stiff price to be paid for the service. But Mussolini might have thought it more advantageous to him if Italy stood apart; for then Britain and France could have been blackmailed: Mussolini would want to know their price—or he would try to fix it, for his abstention from the Central European fight. These men consider the flesh and blood *of the men and women under their control' as merely material to be used in the interests of the state, that is, for the realization of tiie ambitions of these men who have the&quot; power to use them.</span></p></li></ul>

It is said that approximately one-half of the population of England and Wales make purchases at its stores, the majority as members who share in the profits. Thq Year Book of the Co-operative Wholesale Society says that without having exact information it is fair to say that the retail eo-operative trade has penetrated to a depth of possibly one-tenth of the retail trade of the whole country. Some figures taken from a recent publication reveal the extent of the business. The movement was started in Rochdale, Lancashire, in 1844. A few men decided to buy for themselves, and sell to themselves at a working profit. The net profit they purposed to divide among themselves. The scheme was successful: it caught on and grew quite rapidly among the northern towns and large </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">jfe </span><span class="font8">villages of England. In 1863 the many societies, independent of each other, decided to form a co-operative wholesale society, located in Manchester. The current Year Book states that there are 1,107 retail societies, varying in size, many with less than one thousand members but some with more than 100,000. The retail societies are not . bound to make their<sub>;</sub> purchases from the wholesale society, nor to limit their sales to members, but naturally the societies find their wholesale society profitable to them. The figures published are interesting and informative. It is said that the C.W.S. is the largest wheat buyer in the country. It deals with 62,000,000 gallons of milk a year. In the year 1935 tea to the value of £77,000,000 was supplied to the retail societies, and another £50,000,000 worth supplied to societies overseas. In the same year its . cocoa and chocolate factories produced 3,362,- </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">_ fa </span><span class="font8">000 pounds of cocoa and 2,150,000 pounds of chocolates. The total sales of the English society amounts to £100,000,000 a year; and if to fhis is added £30,000,000 on the retail sales it is seen that the public spend £130,000,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">on goods handled by their wholesale society. To this must be added the amount of goods purchased by the varipus societies from nonco-operative sources. It is stated that the banking business of the C.W.S. has a turnover of £600,000,000 a year, and does its business through four offices: it does not follow the system of the “big five” banks; which have branches in every town. Thus expense is saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The wages bill for the year 1935 amounted to £6,587,495. Some of the Labor politician* have looked with wishful eyes on the great numbers of members of these societies; for the majority are of those who earn their living in workshops and offices, and might be expected to have leanings towards the policies . of the Labor party. The Wholesale Society has its own newspaper, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reynolds News,</span><span class="font8"> a Sunday production. Formerly this was an outstanding radical paper, when radicalism was looked upon much as Communism is now. The paper was then a strong advocate of rcpubli-canism, but was never revolutionary except in its theories of government for the betterment of the people. The paper now serves to provide the usual Sunday reading for co-opera-tqrs, serves a purpose in advertising the movement, and is on the “Left” side in politics. As members of the societies have a total of ■ £30,000,000 to their credit in the banks of the societies, it is evident that eo-opcration has. provided a means of saving and a quickening of thrift.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>Factory Conditions</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">• The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Labour Research Journal</span><span class="font8"> for September, 1937, told of some bad conditions in factories. It said that the number of fatal industrial accidents was higher in 1937 than in any other year since 1921. If the number of fatal accidents a year had remained at the low level of five years ago 1,229 lives would have been saved since 1933. The number of industrial accidents in factories in 1937 was 192,539, to compare with 106,154 in 1932; The number of fatal accidents increased from 602 in 1932 to 1,003 in 1937. What? was the cause of the increase? The answer is given—“Partly ■ through using unskilled or partly trained per-^^T'sqns on processes or machines of which they had little knowledge. Also the speeding up of operations, and longer hours in many factories. In cotton weaving and spinning one accident in four was caused by cleaning machinery in motion and by picking. Young persons are the worst sufferers.” The ease of one factory was cited where 3 percent of the workers were young persons, yet 80 percent of the accidents occurred amongst these. Long hours are common: in cotton doubling, in hosiery factories and the machine-tool industry 55' hours per week is the rule. In the clothing trade 60 hours for young persons and 64 for women is the rule. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Research</span><span class="font8"> eom-</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>Jewish Spiritualist Society</span></h6>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">• A news paragraph says “the latest development in the psychic movement is the forma- ' tion of a Jewish Spiritualist Society. Though many individual Jews are interested in Spiritualism, there has not hitherto been an organized group of members of the race”. The Jews, whether known as such, or as Israelites, their older name, always had some amongst them who practiced necromancy, or professed communication with the dead. No true Israelite would do this; first, because he well knew that the dead are dead and that no communication with them is possible, and, further, because when some became unfaithful to their covenant with Jehovah and followed the devilish practices of the neighboring nations, Jehovah through Moses expressly condemned this thing, under penalty of death. Jews of today who keep themselves separate, from Gentiles, and who profess close obedience to the. law of God as given at Sinai, and to the enactments of the Books of Moses, are like the Gentiles who profess to be Christian but are followers of men: both are religionists, seduced by the great deceiver Satan, the enemy of God. Jew or Gentile who practices spiritism disobeys the command of Jehovah, and by sueh practice makes God a liar, is an accepter of the Devil’s lift as recorded at Genesis 3: 4, 5: in-this the Jew is a deliberate offender against the law given by Moses; and that which is called “Spiritualism”, but which is spiritism, by whomsoever practiced, is an abomination in the sight of God, and this is especially so when it is named “Christian Spiritualism”.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">• When Parliament passed a law forbidding any political party to adopt and use a uniform that should have anything of a military appearance a mortal blow was given to the Blackshirt movement led by Sir Oswald Mosley. But Mosley did not drop his purpose of trying to get a political following, nor his ' hope that someday he will be able to get control of the government of Britain. He hopes that he may get the re-birth of the British nation through their adoption of the National Socialist and Fascist creed—evidently a combination of the two creeds which have “regen-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">29</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">crated” Germany and Italy' The movement goes under the name of British Union, which gives no indie at ion of the purpose of the Union. Its journal is called </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Action,</span><span class="font8"> which is lively enough. Catholic Action and this British Fascist Action both work in the same way, using similar methods. One of the methods of increasing membership is that of taking an office in a country town, and from it sending letters to all the small traders in the town calling their attention to their danger through the enormous increase of trade done by the chain and rich capitalist stores. A meeting is arranged for these traders: private invitations are sent, “entirely in the interests of the traders.” But' at the meeting there is British Union literature, propaganda for the movement, and the urge to join the movement is made,, with the promise that under the rule of British Union the great capitalist stores shall not be permitted to monopolize the trade of any town, and the small trader will get his chance to live. British Union leader Mosley is connected with the class usually designated “Society”, flow much he represents the interests of some in the higher ranks of polities cannot lie known, but that there are some with the power of pulling political strings and who favor authoritative rule for Britain is well known. Mosley is shortly to marry a woman whose sister is said to be a close friend of Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The menace of a totalitarian government in Britain docs not aria# only from those who would like to have the people and the resources of the country under control in the interests of money and position. The three great nations in Europe which are now held in that form of government were brought to it by men who had neither money nor position, and in case Labor again came into power in Britain it. is very probable that there would be agitation in that party to drop the constitutional form of government and to make the state totalitarian. But beyond both these probabilities of purpose there is a sinister power, never at rest but always pursuing the one end, and that nothing less than that of bringing the whole world under control. The Papal Hierarchy in Rome, in its false claim to be the superior authority in the earth, has set itself at this time of the world's distress to the endeavor to gain its purpose quickly. It uses all channels, and will use any means to gain its ends. It will be the friend of any</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">form of .government if first its “spiritual” rule is acknowledged. The other interests it will ■ take care of itself. That it will have a very &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">considerable measure of success has been shown by Judge Rutherford’s books and lectures: the Scriptures quoted by him and interpreted in the light of facts leave no doubt that this system which for long centuries has sought the conquest of humanity will dominate the world situation for a short time—until God’s time is come; then the infuriated peoples will cast the system and all it represents to destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Two Speeches</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">» The week-end of September 9-11 recorded &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">two eventful speeches. One the speech of Hitler which set the world agog with the threat of war; the other, of far greater importance, the speech of Judge Rutherford, spoken in Lon- . don but carried abroad to the ends of the earth. The one was that of a man ambitious for his war schemes, and compassed about with armed forces; the other, by Judge Rutherford, who, as the messenger of Jehovah/called to the attention of all who will hear the Word <sup>/ </sup>of God and its voice to the peoples at this time. Hitler has told the world that it was ‘by the grace of God’ he was able to effect the conquest of Austria peacefully; but he &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">speaks with the armed forces of Germany as &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">his support, and his god is the god of war, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">according to his own designing. Judge Rutherford called upon Britain and the peoples in the great cities in America, Canada, Australia, and, in fact, all the world to fach this facts. Hitler and his armed forces and the possibilities of trouble and distress into which lie may throw the w;orld have been shown as factors in the world’s trouble. The speech indicated that though the political troubles of the world play their part, there is a more sin- </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">jf </span><span class="font8">ister cause of disaster to be feared, namely, religion, posing in the name of God, and pushed into prominence as the means of saving the world from its troubles, by the political-religious Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority. Judge Rutherford’s speech was to the glory of the Creator, and directed men of good Will into the place of safety at this time. The one by Hitler, anticipation of which filled the newspaper columns, cannot be for the betterment, of the conditions of any peoples, and must be in the interests of the Devil, the enemy of God and of righteousness. The week-end September 1.0-12 was certainly an eventful time.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark150"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark151"></a>Jehovah’s Bounty—Cover Design for This Number</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">TEHOVAH is bountiful. “[He] giveth us tl richly all things to enjoy.” (1 Timothy 6:17) It is man that would induce scarcity where Jehovah gives bountifully. The abundance of the produce of the earth is one of the mariy evidences of Jchovahfs deity and power. “For the invisible things, even his eternal power and deity, since the; creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived by the things which are made.”—Romans 1: 20, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s bounty has been his “witness” even in those times and places when and where the gospel had not yet been proclaimed. For, as the apostle Paul says, “He did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.”—Acts 14- 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The blessing of Moses upon the tribe of Joseph speaks eloquently of these natural bounties, though his words convey a deeper significance to those of whom it says, “Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for-our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">are come.” (1 Corinthians 10:11, A.B.V.) Also, “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures tve might have hope.” — Romans 15:4, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And this is the blessing wherewith' Moses the man of God blessed ., . . Joseph . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Blessed of Jehovah be his land, For the precious things of heaven, for the dew, And for the deep that coucheth beneath, And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, And for the precious things of the growth of the moons, And for the chief things &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">of the ancient mountains, And for the precious things of the everlasting hills, And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof.” .</span></p>

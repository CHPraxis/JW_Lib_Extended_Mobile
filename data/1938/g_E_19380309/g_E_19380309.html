<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ A </span><span class="font5">while ago one of the Japanese steamships took a great big flock of Catholic ecclesiastics to Manila. There were so many, and the god that the priests order down from heaven was in such demand, that it was, necessary to install three altars to keep from having things all gummed up. Saint Christopher is the Roman Catholic god that looks after transportation arrangements, but the canny Japanese were not taking any chances. In the chart room, to aid in the steering of the vessel, they had a little shrine in honor of one of the Yayorozu-Kami, their 8,000,000 deities. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">And </span><span class="font5">so, with a first-class Yayorozu-Kami in the chart room, and Saint Christopher on the other three sides of the vessel, it sailed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">seas all O.K.

And as there are already some 50,000 Communists in the whole United States, as shown by their vote, then they must already have procured, almost one-fourth of a convert each, and in a few generations or centuries they may get to be as strong as the Populists or Socialists who, at different times, have had as many as 2 or 3 or 5 or 6 members out of the 500 in the lower house of Congress.

<p><span class="font4">[Amon R. Pinchot, Esq., is one of the foremost attorneys of New York city.—Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">January 29, 1938. The Hon. Franklin D. Roosevelt, The White House, Washington, D, C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My deab Mr. President : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In February 1937, soon after you sent your Supreme Court bill to Congress, I heard from sources which seemed fairly reliable;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(a) that you had become convinced that, in order to carry into effect your program of reform, you would require an enormous increase in the powers of the presidency;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(b) that, after constitutional barriers had been removed by the passage of the Supreme Court bill, there would follow a senes of bills expanding your powers;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(c) that a bill reorganizing the executive branch of the government and lodging vast powers in your hands had, in fact, already been drafted by three men, chosen by you, and been presented in your behalf at an executive, that is to say closed, session of a special committee of Congress; and finally</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(d) that this bill was of such a revolutionary, and indeed incredible, nature that it was being kept from the public and from members of Congress outside of the special committee.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Inasmuch as it would seem that any bill of this kind, prepared for the President at the government’s expense, should be considered a public rather than a private document, I decided to secure a copy of the bill, but for many weeks all efforts were unsuccessful. Wherever I applied I was met either with the statement .. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the bill was unknown, or that it had not</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">£<sup>:</sup>: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been printed and was not yet ready for dis-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">tribuuon, or that the existing copies were be-j? ing carefully guarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The clerk of the Senate Committee on Government Organization told me that the typewritten copies, which had been made when the hill was presented, had disappeared, and that, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MARCH 9,1938 </span><span class="font5">so far as he knew, there was but one left, and that was in the Committee ’a safe. He said the bill had not been printed and that copies would not be available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A member of Congress from my state wrote: </span><span class="font4">. In regard to your request for a copy of the original Brownlow Reorganization Bill, I would say that it is impossible to get one of these. There were only a very few of them printed [he was in error here; none was printed] and as nearly as I can find out they were all gathered up and kept from general distribution. I tried to get. one several weeks ago for a friendly newspaper but was unable to do so ... It is absolutely impossible to get the original bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Democratic senator, whom I asked to help me in the matter, said that he had himself at' tempted to secure a copy of this bill, but had been unable to do so. Other sources, including an experienced Washington newspaper correspondent, proved equally unproductive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the course of time, however, I did obtain a copy of the bill. And, on reading it, found that its provisions were even more extraordinary than I had been led to suppose. Indeed, Mr. President, this bill strips Congress of the most important powers it now possesses, while, in effect, it transforms .the government into a dictatorship presided over by you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After eleven months in hiding, the bill was printed as an appendix to Senator Byrd’s minority report on the so-called Byrnes’ reorganization bill (S 2970). And on January 17, 1938, it was filed, and thereafter was briefly commented on in the press. But today, I believe that not one person in ten thousand -knows of the bill’s existence, and not one in a million has the slightest notion of its contents. For this reason, Mr. President, plus the faet that the question of executive reorganization is now before the country, I am Writing you this letter at this time.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>The Background of the Bill</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">May I go back a little, and remind you that, in the summer, fall, and early winter of 1935, you held a series of conferences with Mr, Brownlow of Washington, Professor Gulick of New York, and Professor Merriam of Chicago. And at these conferences you expressed your intention of reorganizing the executive branch of the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You then instructed these three men, known thereafter as the President’s Committee, to make an investigation and report a reorganization plan. You set aside $100,000 from government relief funds to pay their expenses. Whereupon your Committee made the investi-' gation and produced the report. And this report, covering seventy-two printed pages, and known as the Brownlow Report, you sent to Congress on January 12, 1937.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And you accompanied the report with a message signed by yourself, warmly approving it, and asking Congress to enact, as quickly as possible, the legislation required to carry its recommendations into effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In that message you said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Committee has now completed its work, and I. transmit to you its report, Administrative Management in the Government of the United States. I have examined this report carefully and thoughtfully, and am convinced that it is a great document of permanent importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• • ♦</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I endorse this program and feel confident that it will commend itself to you also with your knowl- -edge of government, and to the vast majority of the citizens of the country who want and believe in efficient self-government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In placing this program before you I realize that it will he said that I am recommending the increase of the powers of the Presidency. This is not true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What I am placing before you is not the request for more power, but for the tools of management and the authority to distribute the work so that the President can effectively discharge those powers which the Constitution now places upon him. :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So much, Mr. President, for the so-called Brownlow Report and your message, both of which were read in the Senate Chamber on January 12, 1937.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Four weeks later, that is to say on the morning of Tuesday, February 16, 1937,<sub>;</sub>Messrs. Brownlow, Gulick and Merriam appeared at an executive, that is to say closed, ..session of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the Special Joint Committee on Reorganization of Government Departments. And there, representing you, they submitted a bill covering some sixty-six typewritten pages, and entitled “The Reorganization Act of 1937.” This bill I will now somewhat fully discuss.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>The Bill</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. President, upon reading your bill, my first conclusion was that it must be a forgery. So far as I know, it is the most remarkable legislative proposal that has been made by any president. For, not by ■ inference or indirection, but in plain language, it authorizes you not merely to reorganize, but, by executive order, to abolish, or to change the name and functions of every agency and office in the entire executive branch of the government— without consulting Congress—including those agencies and offices which have been ereated-by Congress during the last 149 years to do the country’s business. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And, what is still more incredible, it permits you to abolish, or change the functions of, the office of President, despite the fact that the presidency is a constitutional office, whose functions are described and bounded by the Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moreover, the stenographic record of the executive session of February 16, 1937, proves that the bill was shown to you and discussed with you by Mr. Brownlow and his associates, before they presented it to the Special Joint Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Owing to the length of the bill, I will only quote the text of some of the more important provisions. The sections dealing with Civil Service, fiscal control, and those providing for two new departments, and a National Resources Board, are so long and so complicated that I can only touch on them briefly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, I will quote all of the section entitled “Power of. the President,” and most of the section on definitions, because these two sections show the scope and purpose of the bill, and the nature of the powers it places in your hands. And I would like to say&quot; at this point not only that these quoted passages are fairly quoted, but that there is nothing in the rest of the bill which in any way tends to modify or change the meaning of the parts quoted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since this bill was submitted by,your Committee of three, both houses of Congress have written bills of their own. And it is unlikely that your bill will either be passed or debated,.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">though a motion to substitute your bill for any of these bills is possible at any time. But your bill is nevertheless of profound importance. And it should be carefully studied by the people. For it is a detailed, authentic description . of the changes in American government you desired to make last February, and which, so far as the record shows, you still desire and intend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first paragraph in the bill is a statement of its purpose;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bill</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">To </span><span class="font4">provide for the reorganization of agencies of the Government by transfer, retransfer, regroup</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ing, </span><span class="font4">coordination, consolidation, segregation, and abolition, to extend the merit system, to reorganize the auditing and accounting functions of the Government, to establish the Departments of Social Welfare and Public Works and the National Resources Board, to change the name of the Department of the Interior, and for other purposes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">(I have underscored [italicized] the parts of this section to which I want to call attention.)</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Summary of Powers of the President</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Summing up the foregoing section, headed “Power of the President,” it authorizes you to reorganize, regroup, curtail, transfer, or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">wholly to abolish, or change the name and functions of</span><span class="font5"> each and every “agency” in the executive branch of the government. It per- 1 mits you to decide the method of appointment of all heads, officers, and employees of all reorganized agencies, which means that, if the bill were enacted, your appointments would require no confirmation by the Senate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It permits you to establish, without limit, new agencies to take over the functions of such agencies as you may abolish, or change in name and function, or transfer, in whole or in part. But it does not, in so many words, describe the meaning of the word “agency”, though the meaning seems plain enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Therefore, in order fully to grasp the' significance of the section entitled * ‘ Power of the President,” let us turn to the section headed ‘ ‘ General and Miscellaneous Provisions. ” This section (Section 501 of Title V) defines, the meaning of the important words used in the bill. And it makes abundantly clear the bill’s intention to strip Congress of power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">General and Miscellaneous Provisions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When used in this Act unless the context indicates otherwise:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(a) The term “agency” includes the President or any executive department, independent establishment, commission, legislative court, board, bureau, service, administration, authority, federally owned' and controlled corporation, agency, division, or activity of the United States, whether in the District of Columbia or in the field service, or any office, or part thereof, and shall include the municipal government of the District of Columbia, the Botanic Garden, Library of Congress, Library Buildings and Grounds, Government Printing Office, and the Smithsonian Institution; Provided, that the inclusion of the municipal government of the District of Columbia within the meaning of the term “agency” shall not be construed to authorize the abolition of the municipal government of the District of Columbia or the transfer of all the functions of such rmmicipal government to any other agency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the foregoing words is found the only</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">limitation to your power over federal agencies. For they protect the government of the Dis, trict of Columbia from annihilation by executive order. To this extent the statement that the bill allows you to abolish “every” agency * must be modified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the other hand, section 501 further strengthoils your power by providing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">i</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The term “functions’’ includes any rights, privileges, powers, duties, or functions, or any part thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus, Mr. President, if your biJi were passed, not only every agency, office, and fpne-lion—always excepting those of the fortunate District of Columbia^hut every right, privilege, power, or duty attaching thereto would be subject tQ abolition, alteration, nr transfer by your^plf, at your sole discretion, and without.reference to Congress.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In the P^t, various bills have empowered presidents to reorganize certain parts of the executive branch of the government, but always within well defined limit?. And no previous bill has sought to give or even suggested giving a president such unbounded power as is conferred </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">pu</span><span class="font5"> you by this act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Commenting on the 1932 reorganization bill, which authorized President Hoover to reorganize the departments, Senator Byrnes of South Carolina said, on August 16,1937:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Any executive' order issued under the act (of 1932) was required tp be submitted to the Congress and might he set ft3j.de by resolution pf either branch of the Congress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But no such provision is found in your Reorganization Act of 1937.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And if sueh a bill as yours were passed, you could exercise all the powera-^enumerated in the seotion entitled “Power of the President” and clarified in the section entitled ‘* General and Miscellaneous Provisions”—at will, with finality, and with no accountability to anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a word, the bill is so drawn that, through your power to abolish, or transfer, or change all fedora] agencies, their officers, and thejr functions, you can control the policies, decisions, and actions of these agencies. And especially, you can control the immensely important independent commissions and boards, which are primarily the instruments of Congress and not of the President.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As we all know, there are certain regulatory agencies in our government, some purely executive and others semi-judicial, upon whose policies and action depends, in large measure, the welfare of every section of the country. These agencies intimately affect the nation’s economic life, the life of every class of our people, of all consumers, of labor, of business, and agriculture. I have in mind such agencies as the Federal Reserve Board, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Federal Power Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Forest Service, the Federal Trade Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and others which I may refer to again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. President, any chief executive, armed with the powers granted in your bill, could shape with an iron hand the policies and decisions and action of all these agencies. For, if their policies, decisions, or action did not suit him, he could disestablish the agencies themselves, remove or discipline their officers, or change the functions of the agencies, as he pleased, in accordance with his own will, or his bias, or his political advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You may reply that, if these powers were misused, Congress could enact a law repealing your bill; and then pas? another reorganization bill limiting your authority. But sueh a repeal would be virtually impossible, For, your veto of the repealing act could only be overridden by a two-thirds vote of both houses. And any president with such money and job patronage as you possess, and fortified by the leverage on Congress which your reorganization bill provides, should have little difficulty in blocking any attempt at repeal by Congress.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Gives Executive Power to Annul Laws</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Now, while we are on this subject—namely the power over Congress^'our reorganization bill gives you—let me point out that the bill places in your hands what is, in effect, a new and unconstitutional authority to annul laws which Congress has passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. President, almost every important law relating to industry, or labor, or to finance, or agriculture has—indeed must have^an agency, an executive instrument, charged with carrying its purposes into effect. The antitrust laws have such an instrument in the Department of Justice, with the Federal Trade Commission acting both as a fact-finding and regulatory body. The so-called Guffey Coal Act has, as its enforcing* instrument, a commission without which the purposes of the act cannot be achieved. The Wagner Act sets up the Natkmal Labor Relations Board , as its executive arm for protecting labor’s right to bargain collectively, and for preventing unfair labor practices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would be interesting to know what would be the reaction of Mr. 'William Green, or Mr. John L, Lewis, to the fact that a president of the United States, who is known as the chain, pion of liberalism and labor, has sent to a closed session of a special congressional committee a bill empowering him, or, for that mat; ter, any other President, to render the Na, tional Labor Relations Act void by:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(a) abolishing the Labor Board;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(b) by transferring the Board’s functions and personnel to some other agency; and</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(e) by changing the Board’s functions and personnel.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. President, I repeat that the section of your bill headed “Power of the President,” which is quoted in full jn this letter, in effect enables the President to annul any law passed by Congress, provided the law requires for its enforcement an executive agency. Your bill js a reactionary bill, for it turns the national legislature into a mere debating society, which may effectuate its policies only when the President approves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a truism to say that, over a range of years, the attitude of the White House repeats edly changes from liberal to conservative, and from conservative to liberal. And recent events have shown that one can no more pre, diet the mind of the president than the mind of the king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If your bill were passed, it would place the laws relating to business, to consumers, and to agriculture in precisely the same state of uncertainty aa those relating to labor. For the executive commissions and boards charged with enforcing these laws would function or not function according to the will of one man namely the President.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">America’s most important and progressive policies—such as the policy of conservation of natural resources, the policy of preventing monopoly and encouraging competition, the policy of protecting wage earners and farmers, and other similar policies—did not spring into being over night. They developed through generations of public discussion, patient education, and unselfish work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They have been embodied in laws passed by the people’s representatives meeting in open</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MARCH 9, 1838 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ </span><span class="font5">debate in both houses of Congress, under the eyes of the people. This democratic method is the foundation of liberty and progress in every democracy in the world, And to protect this method against the encroachment of personal government behind closed doors is, especially at this time, the duty of all democratic nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To empower one man to nullify the laws which express our national policies, by abolishing or controlling thp agencies which enforce them, is at once a blow to progress and a denial of the democratic principle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At this point, Mr, President, let me remark that, so far as I know, informed persons agree that the executive branch needs reorganization. In the last few years the agencies, of government have multiplied so fast, and furiously, that our federal &quot;bureaucracy numbers nearly 900,000 people. And it is growing like a weed. In fact, these agencies, boards, commissions, authorities, corporations, et cetera, have become so numerous that they overlap, cancel each other’s efforts, and create endless confusion and expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And, what is worse, this overmanned bureaucracy will gradually become as corrupt as it is costly and inefficient. But this condition, however unfortunate, should not be made the excuse for clothing you with such powers as Mussolini used in setting up his corporate state, or as- Hitler seized in order to end the German republic, and reduce the Reichstag to g fiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And hepg, once ,more, I want to say and make it clear sunlight, that, in this letter, I am not diseipsing the various reorganization bills which have been presented by either hopee of Congress, though certain of these bills contain some of the dangerous provisions in your bill, I am discussing only your bid, written for you by Messrs. Brownlow, Gulick and Merriam, and presented in your behalf tn the Special Joint Committee op reorganization, at the executive session of February J6, 1937. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Who</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Responsible for ike Rill?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Did the draft of your bill, submitted on February 16, 1997, have your approval? On this point we will consult the record. At the executive session Mr. Brownlow testified that he had shown the bill to you. He also stated that the bill puts in legislative form the recommendations contained in the Brownlow Report on reorganization. That was the report which</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">you endorsed with such emphasis in your message of January 12, 1937.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When examined as to whether you approved the bill, Mr. Brownlow was non-committal. He said that he could not '‘undertake to speak for the President.” Further questioned by committee members, he said the bill was &quot;tentative” and offered as a basis of discussion. On the other hand, it was brought out that he and his colleagues took months to prepare it; that it was in the making back at the time when the Brownlow Report was being written; and that, in drawing the bill, he and Professors Gulick and Merriam were assisted by a skilled &quot;legislative draftsman.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. President, responsible men do not draft </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">bill providing for unparalleled changes in a nation’s government, and present it to a congressional committee, and then spend days on end defending its provisions, as did Mr. Brownlow, Professor Gulick and Professor Merriam, unless its contents has been well considered—and, what is more, authorized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And this should be especially true when a bill is written under instructions from the President himself, after conversations with him which extended through a summer. And, says Mr. Brownlow, &quot;these conversations were renewed in September, October, and December.” And Mr. Brownlow further says that, after the Brownlow Report was finished, and before he took your bill to the Joint Committee, additional conferences with you took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But, assuming that this first draft </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">was</span><span class="font5"> tentative, the same can hardly be said of the revised, or second, draft, dated February 22, 1937, which contains practically the same provisions as the first draft. And, for three men, appointed and paid by you, to have offered such a bill, not once but twice, without assurance that it had your approval, would not merely have been a breach of trust but a piece of reckless effrontery,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I know Professor Merriam. I am acquainted with Professor Gulick. And I am told that Mr. Brownlow is a responsible and intelligent person. I believe these three men incapable of presenting in youT behalf, even as a basis of discussion, a bill embodying such novel and astounding provisions, unless they were satisfied that they were acting with your full approval and consent. And, until an adequate explanation is forthcoming from you, your bill must be taken as expressing your views, and as a statement of the extent to which you</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">planned to break the authority of Congress and expand your own by reorganizing the government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Other Provisions of the Bill</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. President, in addition to the boards and commissions I have mentioned, your draft of the Executive Reorganization bill deals with many subjects. It gives you life and death, power over the ten federal departments, War, State, Labor, et cetera; over the Tariff Commission, the Court of Claims, the Communications Commission, and all other boards and commissions. It even presents you with the Library of Congress. This, like the rest, you can reorganize, abolish in whole or in part, or change in name and function, without leave of Congress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Likewise, it permits you to create any number of new ‘ ‘ receiving agencies, ’ ’ and to transfer existing agencies and their functions and appropriations to them. Under the bill you could, for instance, establish a new receiving agency headed, we will say, by your secretary, Mr. James Roosevelt, and transfer to his charge the army, or the navy, or the Federal Reserve, or the Communications Commission, or the National Labor Relations Board, or the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and those various other agencies which loan money and allocate the vast sums which are spent for public works and other forms of relief. Or, if you preferred, you could rid the government of any or all of these agencies by merely signing your name to a piece of paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the discussion of your bill at the February 16th hearing of the executive session, Congressman Cochran asked Mr. Brownlow, who was explaining the bill, the following question;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The power that you suggest he given to the President—that would enable him, if he so desired, to abolish, say the Federal Trade Commission,, the Tariff Commission, the Communications Commission, or any other independent agency that is now set up in the executive branch of the service, would it not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Brownlow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Well, he might.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Cochran: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;He could abolish the board and set up an individual. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As an example of how we may expect the administration to use its power of transfer, if your bill, or one like it, were enacted, let us take the case of the Forest Service, a very efficient agency which for years has been located in the Department of Agriculture, where the conservation policy is faithfully adhered to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Forest Service was organized by a great public servant, and the tradition he left behind him remains strong to this day. Yet, the Brownlow Report, which you so heartily endorse, recommends that government lands and natural resources, now in charge of the Forest Service, shall be transferred to the Department of the Interior, where a thoroughly bad tradition has prevailed, and where almost anyone, with a strong political pull, has been able to get about what he wants from the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It should be remembered that, long ago, President Theodore Roosevelt, with the consent of Congress, transferred the National Forests from the Interior Department to the Department of Agriculture, for the very reason that he could not trust the Interior Department to guard and administer them properly. Your bill now proposes to turn the National Forests back to the department where, like the oil resources, they were in constant jeopardy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>The Civil Service</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Again, your bill, while it provides for extending the civil service, at the same time abolishes the Civil Service Commission and places the service under the President’s control. It authorizes the President to exempt from civil service requirements large numbers of employees. And it permits his agents to appoint, without limit, whatever new employees may be needed, and exempt them from civil service requirements.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Federal Accounting</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Your bill deals with federal auditing and accounting. It abolishes the Comptroller General, who has served Congress as its watchdog over government spending. It does away with the pre-audit system, by which Congress keeps track of the expenditures </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font5"> they are made. So that the diversion of funds to purposes unauthorized by Congress may be prevented. Your bill scraps the pre-audit in favor of a post-audit, to be made </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font5"> the money is spent. In a word, the stable is locked after the horses are gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. President, such an arrangement takes ■ the nation’s purse strings from the hands of Congress, and places them in your hands. Again, should Congress vote an appropriation for some purpose not approved by the White House, the bill permits the President to remove or control the agency designated to spend the money. Thus, as already pointed out, it permits the President to block or defeat the intention of Congress.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>New Departments and</span><br><br><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>National Resources Board</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Your bill provides for two new government departments, which will certainly not tend toward economy. Nor will it reduce the number of federal employees, or the political power they give the White House, It provides for a National Resources Board, and this too will expand the federal personnel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This National Resources Board is a very far-reaching proposal. It may be described as one of the New Deal’s more grandiose legislative reveries. It is to be the central agency through which the federal government will plan the economic activities of states, counties, and cities, and regiment them through new swarms of federal agents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On November 14, 1937, Secretary Wallace stated that industry ought to be federally managed, and its volume and the character of its products regulated, very much as his ever normal granary plan proposes to regulate the quantity and character of crops on American farms. The National Resources Board is the embodiment of this thinking, and, apparently, of the thought of Assistant Attorney General Jackson, who announced, in his radio address of December 26, that the government should act as an “overseer of our industrial progress.’’</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">This Democracy?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. President, in brief summation, all the evidence shows that your draft of the reorganization bill was designed—and deliberately designed—to strip Congress of power and centralize control in the White House. If passed, it would unquestionably transform the government into a dictatorship. And I defy any competent person to read your bill without arriving at this conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems beyond belief that anyone could have expected Congress—even in its humble days before the court controversy started the rebellion in the upper House—to pass such a bill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If, under White House pressure, the elected representatives of the people were to enact this measure, renouncing their own power and giving it to you, they would be like condemned men who, on the eve of execution, are required . to dig their own graves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And yet, if your Court bill of February 5th had been enacted, as you and your advisors expected, your Executive Reorganization bill of February 16th would undoubtedly have been the next order of business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In your message of January 12, 1937, you told Congress and the .public that your plan involved “nothing revolutionary,” and no increase in your power. You said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In placing this program before you I realize that it will be said that I am recommending the increase of the powers of the presidency. This is not true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In that message you further stated that your objective was to preserve “that freedom of self-government which our forefathers fought to establish and hand down to Us.” And you said that your purpose was to give substance to the great dream of American democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. President, you ask very rightly for cooperation, and for confidence in the government. And all men and women of good will should work for that end. But how can there be confidence when the Chief Executive himself proposes to undermine the government and the principles of democracy on which it rests!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Will you not therefore, in the interest of the public, withdraw your recommendation for executive reorganization, and let the country concentrate on recovery ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sincerely yours,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">How Patriotic Are the Priests? </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued from page 11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">article was to discourage Polish people from joining other than Polish Catholic churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Neither my wife nor I speak Polish,.but when this article Was published I made an appeal to a Polish Catholic priest, Reverend Justyn, of 199 Clark street, Buffalo, N. Y., explaining my whole case and he informed me that the church has nothing to do with my affairs and cannot aid me. Subsequently I listened to Judge Rutherford’s lectures and accepted the Truth and serve it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In view of my experiences, I wonder just how patriotic are the priests of the Roman Catholic church.

<h5><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>*‘Freedom of Speech as an Axiom”</span></h5>
<div><img src="g_E_19380309_files/g_E_19380309-4.png" alt="" style="width:46pt;height:46pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">IF ONE is honest he has to hand it to the Catholic Hierarchy for continuously pretending to believe and practice in the United States what their own spokesmen in the Papal ehair have repeatedly denounced. Thus, the Hierarchy has denied over and over again the right of free speech, has denounced it as a colossal error, has done everything possible to prevent Judge Rutherford from telling the truth over the radio, and yet, the Hierarchy in the United States, in its letter to the Hierarchy in Spain, had the unmitigated gall to make use of the following sentence:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your words [recounting the alleged slaughter of priests in Spain] horrify us, who are wont to accept liberty of conscience and freedom of speech as an axiom.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19380309_files/g_E_19380309-5.png" alt="" style="width:198pt;height:253pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Let that soak in. The United States Hierarchy is horrified because the Spanish Republic did not encourage the free use of churches as arms depots and stations in which to incite sedition and insurrection, but in America it has to admit, despite its infamous attempt to choke the wind off Judge Rutherford, that “freedom of speech as an axiom” is maintained here. Probably a private note went along to the bishops explaining that, though such freedom of speech is an axiom here, it is an axiom in which the Hierarchy does not believe, and as soon as it feels strong enough to do so it intends to dispose for ever'of both the freedom and the axiom. Such is the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">No Freedom in Quebec</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ That the Roman Catholic Hierarchy certainly does </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">not</span><span class="font5"> believe in freedom of speech anywhere is abundantly proved by the statement of Cardinal Villeneuve at Quebec, November 1, 1937:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Paganism has many offers. Among them are freedom of speech, freedom to insult our traditions, our beliefs and our religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Notice how cleverly this is spliced together. The casual reader is led to believe that freedom of speech is necessarily opposed to the truth and what therefore the Roman Hierarchy holds as the essentials of civilization, namely, Catholic traditions, beliefs and religion, and therefore is in itself evil. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The prophets believed in freedom of speech, and were sawn asunder for it; Jesus believed in freedom of speech, and was put to death for it; the apostles did likewise, and eleven of the twelve are believed to have suffered martyrdom. The Roman Hierarchy hates freedom of speech because it fears the truth. Hence all its uproar against Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“For every wrongdoer hates the light, and does not come to the light, for fear his actions should be exposed and condemned. But he who does what is honest'and right comes to the light.”—John 3:20,21, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What Else Would He Do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Speaking in Jersey City the “Reverend Father” Matthew Toohey, of Newark, hailed Frank Hague, mayor of Jersey City, as “Public Enemy No. 1 of Communism” and in the same breath extolled Dictator Duplessis, of Quebec. What else would he do? All three of them belong to the gang that is bent on the destruction of human liberty and determined to bring all mankind under the iron heel of the Roman Hierarchy, whose rise was coincident with a rise of Europe’s Dark Ages.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>“Adults Please Sign”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">LAMAR, Colorado, is a city of ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,500 inhabitants, 72 of whom do</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">It&amp;r</span><span class="font5"> not use their own brains, but do as they are told by somebody who handed them a sheet of paper marked “Adults Please Sign”, Among those that signed were 6 Geisers, 5 Hassers, 4 each of the Gruenloh, Emick, Idler, Weis, Denning, Fox and Smith families, 3 Linenbergers, 3 Williams’ and 2 each of the McCall, O’Neil, Strain and Moran families, and there were 17 others trotting that Sunday in single harness besides the more or less single “Reverend Father” Benedict Pedrotti, who headed the list immediately under the words “Adults Please Sign”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another priest signed under Pedrotti, but thought better of it and erased his name. Probably it was he who also tried to erase the words “Adults Please Sign” but did not do a good job. The ones who signed would have cheerfully signed their own death warrant without reading it or knowing what it was all about. What they did sign was a protest against a Spanish program of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of which not one of them probably understood one word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The owner of the broadcasting station to whom the alleged protest was sent saw through the whole scheme and wrote a plain but kindly letter to Pedrotti reminding him that he himself is a Catholic, and a member of Pedrotti’s church, and a supporter of it. He reminded Pedrotti that the only businessman on his list of 72 had been refused time orr thi radio for exploiting a lottery scheme; that the station had never shown a profit during its existence; that the words “bitterness”, “prejudice,” “vehemently,” “decent Christians,” “creeds,” “decency,” “germ of dissension” and ‘‘honesty” were used in the accompanying protest a little too freely to make a hit; and especially that the very same programs about which the list of adult signers protested so strongly when given in Spanish had only </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">few weeks previous been given in English and. none of the alleged protesters said a word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mrs. George S. Williams, who purports to have written the protest, was the twelfth one to sign under “Reverend Father” Pedrotti, and her hubby, Dr. George Williams, was the last one on the “Adults Please Sign” list. One would think that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font5"> would have known</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MARCH 9, '-928</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">better than to let Pedrotti make a fool of him. But some doctors are not so wise. Some of them have no more sense than Pedrotti himself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">I HAVE just read your article on “Aluminum Poisoning” in the issue of September 26, 1936, and wish it could be read by every housewife in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I would like to give you some more facts that happened in my own home and caused us to throw out every piece of aluminumware in the place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the spring of 1935 I went to my dentist to have an abscessed tooth removed. In looking over my teeth the dentist informed me that I had pyorrhea and it wouldn't be long before I would have to lose all my teeth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font5">asked what caused such a condition, when I had always been very careful to keep .my teeth in good condition. He told me that no cure had ever been found, and could not give me any reason why people contracted the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About six months elapsed before I again went to the dentist to have a bridge swung in where the abscessed tooth had been removed, and when this was done I casually asked how my teeth and gums looked. The dentist said they were in good shape, but he had forgotten what he had told me on the previous visit. I then reminded him of the fact that I had a bad ease of pyorrhea at that time, which he remembered. He asked me what I had done, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">I promptly told him the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few days after my first visit I happened </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">get hold'of a copy of “Aluminum Poisoning”, and read it from cover to cover. Some of the simple tests to prove the effect of this poison in foods convinced me that many stomach ailments of both my wife and me were due entirely to the aluminum kitchen utensils which we were using. My wife certainly hated to part with all the expensive steam cookers and percolators, but we threw out the whole business and bought iron frying pans and enamelware.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We did not stop here, but threw out all the baking powders that contained aluminum sulphate and never again will any of these products ever enter our house. My wife and I have both long since recovered from stomach troubles, gas pains and many other distresses that we were subject to without knowing the cause. Today I have all my teeth and haven't had a toothache since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If a campaign of education could be brought to the attention of the users of aluminumware and cheap baking powders, the hospitals and the graveyards wouldn’t do so much business. Common sense should have people asking, “Why do we have more sickness today than ever before, in face of the fact that we have better hospitals, better-trained nurses and doctors, new inventions that are constantly being put out to eliminate disease?” The answer is simple: 95 percent of the kitchens today are equipped with aluminumware. Newspapers will not publish anything detrimental to aluminum, for fear of losing the fat sums they obtain from the advertising by the Aluminum Trust.—William E. Deane, Florida.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At dairy plants milk storage tanks are often made of aluminum.

<h5><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>Your Questions Answered</span></h5><img src="g_E_19380309_files/g_E_19380309-8.png" alt="" style="width:87pt;height:42pt;">
<p><span class="font12">Q</span><span class="font5">UESTION: Who are the greatest public enemies to be found among mankind ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Answer: The greatest public enemies are those who employ fraud and deceit and lead the credulous people into a trap which results to their great injury. Satan the Devil is the greatest of all enemies, and his greatest ally or instrument on the earth used to defraud the ignorant and do injury to the people is religion or religious systems. Therefore the specific answer to the question from the Bible is that the greatest pilblie enemy to be found amongst mankind is the religious organizations, embracing those who practice religion for selfish gain. Amongst the many fraudulent schemes employed by the Catholic religious organization to defraud the people is the one which they call “purgatory”. The clergy of that religious organization fraudulently claim to represent God on the earth, and thus appearing in a pious manner they gain the confidence of credulous persons and easily overreach them and thereby fraudulently and wrongfully induce such persons to believe that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font5"> their loved ones who have died are in “purgatory”, there undergoing conscious suffer-' ing. Then the clergy say to the bereaved credulous persons, “If you will contribute your financial support to our church, the priests thereof will pray for your beloved ones who </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">are in purgatory </span><span class="font5">and thereby shorten their term of punishment and relieve them of much suffering.” Such a claim not only is a monstrous lie, wholly unsupported by any truth, but is a gross defamation of God’s holy name. That lying claim concerning “purgatory” is equivalent to saying that God is in agreement with the clergymen and backing them up in their scheme to collect money from the poor credulous people upon the theory that they ean get their dead ones out of “purgatory”. Thus they make God a party to a great fraud. There is no such place as “purgatory”. The dead are not conscious anywhere, but arc in the grave, where there is no knowledge, wisdom or device, where they know not anything and are suffering nothing. (Ecclesiastes 9:5,10; Ps. 115:17) What, then, is the greatest injury resulting to the people from such a fraud? Such credulous persons are wrongfully induced to pjirt with their money upon a false representation made by clergymen who falsely claim to represent God; such persons are led to believe that their dead are in conscious suffering and that it is their duty to contribute money to help them; they are induced to ally themselves with and follow in the lead of clergymen of a devilish religious organization; and thus the people are kept blind to the kingdom of God, which kingdom is their only hope of salvation and life. This visible enemy of mankind, and which is the worst of such enemies, keeps the people in the dark, robs them of their substance, destroys their peace of mind and turns them away from God and into everlasting destruction. There could be no greater enemies.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>No Apologies, Mr. O’Neal</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">G</span><span class="font5">EORGIA’S City of La Grange again. Its mayor, R. S. O’Neal, is reported as being greatly incensed and full of wrath because </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> labeled him ’a Catholic’. He insists that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> apologize to him fqr placing him in that undesirable category.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is what </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> did say in its issue of August 11, 1937:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Bishop G. P. O’Hara, of Savannah, dedicated the new Catholic church here in Lagrange, a few months before arrests started here, Mayor O’Neal had a prominent part in the dedication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MARCH #, 1038</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This connects O’Neal with the Hierarchy, and reveals the source of our persecution. Thus the serpent’s trail leads to Vatican City-—as usual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our letter to O’Neal got the immediate, response of increased persecution; hence this letter made a hull’s-ej’e hit. It revealed the head inquisitor, O’Neal, as the tool of the Hierarchy. We were lacking that proof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It does not appear that Mr. O ’Neal is legally or ethically entitled to an apology. It was stated that he was connected with the Hierarchy and acted as a tool of the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a matter of widespread knowledge that the Hierarchy is the chief enemy of the truth and devotes much energy toward attempts at stopping the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses. The Hierarchy would prohibit entirely the circulation of Bible teachings if it could; and uses every agency, Catholic, Protestant or Jewish, that It can enlist for that unholy purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. O’Neal, as mayor of the City of La Grange, assisted that wicked organization greatly in carrying on a vicious persecution against Jehovah’s witnesses. Therefore, whether he realizes and admits it or not, he' was acting as a tool of the Hierarchy at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Counsel for Jehovah’s witnesses has now been informed by Mayor 0 ’Neal that if Jehovah’s witnesses do not violate the La Grange ordinance they will not be arrested. In view of the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses never violated any law in La Grange, this is a step forward in the policy of the La Grange officials.

<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">N </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> No. 473, November 3, 1937, page 26, see the item about the murder of Monaghan at the police headquarters in western Pennsylvania. Monaghan, a Uniontown hotel keeper, was killed by the district attorney, the assistant county detective and two Cossacks of the Pennsylvania State police. Quotation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two doctors are involved. They certified that the man came to his death from &quot;alcoholism and a weak heart”, but an investigation by honest medical men showed 13 fractures of ribs, nose and jaw, 2 hemorrhages caused by blows, 53 cuts and bruises, and blood on the ceiling and on every wall save one of the torture room, the passageway, the lavatory and the shower room. The men who committed the murder will probably be reproved, but gently, so as not to break their spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It occasionally happens that some very excellent persons who are subscribers for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> simply can not and do not believe that the world is in the condition in which it is. As Salter put it, such persons do not want to read the “blood-curdling stuff” which ’occasionally finds its way into these columns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Which is better, to face the facts, tell things just as they are, and lose a few subscribers, or try to change into sheep such swine, dogs, wolves, goats and other cattle as have been lured into the belief that they are sheep when they are not 7 This skit is submitted to Judge Rutherford for his approval or disapproval on that basis, and if you see it in print you will know that he thinks it right (by way of merely one example, on one subject only) to let the people of Pennsylvania know what kind of judges they have on the bench. So read what happened to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font5"> murderer, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">one </span><span class="font5">who “took the rap” in the case above mentioned :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SOMERSET, Deo. 21.-~Stacy Gunderman, former State trooper who was convicted of beating a 64-year-old hotel man to death during a third degree, got a Christmas present today. Supreme Court Justice George W. Maxey gave </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font4"> a parole —and his blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The young and husky Gunderman, sentenced to 364 days for second degree murder, was taken into Justice Maxey's courtroom at 10:30 a.m. He has 65 more days to serve. But it is the Yule season, and Justice Maxey made a speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Throughout your 15-month ordeal,” said Maxey, “you . . . Staoy Gunderman , . . have conducted yourself with condor, courage and dignity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I do not believe you have ever had any malice t in your makeup, and without malice, no man can V be a murderer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nothing is said above about the three other persons besides the two doctors; the case is closed until Armageddon. Monaghan is dead, and all the persons concerned know that the public will forget the whole matter overnight, being entirely interested only in the latest murders, occurring elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This magazine has little use for the Philadelphia </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Record,</span><span class="font5"> It refused to print an advertisement stating the simple facts about the WIP petition. Nevertheless some would say that it had considerable courage to publish the two following editorials Tn its issue of December 23, 1937.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY THE THIRD DEGREE CONTINUES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Justice George W. Maxey couldn’t have stood by Stacy Gunderman any more faithfully if he had been his lawyer instead of his judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gunderman, a former State trooper, beat an aged prisoner to death. He claimed he did it in self-defense, in spite of the fact that the medical evidence showed the victim had been struck almost innumerable times and that Gunderman, an athlete, should have been well able to defend himself without violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In spite of Justice Maxey’s attempts to save him, the jury convicted Gun demon. Maxey then gave him a ridiculously light sentence which made him eligible for almost immediate parole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now Maxey cuts this sentence still further by giving Gunderman his freedom as a Christmas present. In addition, he praised Gunderman’a “candor, courage and dignity.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you want to know why police brutality and the third degree continue to exist, ask Justice Maxey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JUSTICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On Memorial Day, 1937, Chicago police attacked a group of strikers demonstrating with their wives and children outside the Republic Steel plant. The police killed ten people and wounded many others in a scene of incredible brutality, of which a photographic record has been preserved in a film saved from suppression by the Lu Follette Civil Liberties Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">None of the police was punished, Nona of them was even brought to trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On December 21, 61 persons who took part in the demonstration, many of them victims of the police attack, one with his leg amputated as a result of injuries incurred in it, were found guilty and fined “for unlawful assembly.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The impunity with which the police killed, the apathy of the people, the indifference toward the crime, ths imposition of punishment upon the workers rather than upon their attackers, the fact that in 1937 one could dommit murder wholesale to break a strike and get away with it, these will forever stand as condemnation of the processes of justice in our time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Because </span><span class="font5">it is pertinent to the issue, take a moment to see </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> No. 471, issue of October 6, 1937, page 23, and see paragraphs </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nob.</span><span class="font5"> 1, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2, </span><span class="font5">5, 6 and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font5">on that page. Was it right to publish these facts? Do you want the truth, of would it suit you better to have things smoothed out and covered up? What is the answer? Surely no subscriber for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font5">should want this magazine to be less truthful </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">less courageous than the Philadelphia </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Record,</span><span class="font5"> which is afraid of Cardinal Dough</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">erty </span><span class="font5">and of Gimbel Brothers. Of whom is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> afraid? The great and good God and His Vindicator. Jehovah God is just, and He will not permit Maxey to go down to the grave </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">peace.'—1 Kings 2: 6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Democracy vs. §13,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Democracy may have skidded of late in Great Britain. But at least the world can thank British democracy for letting the cat out of the bag on its Cabinet's policies in Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why is the British Government preparing to grant Franco virtual recognition as a belligerent?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why has the British Government “played along” with the Fascists in Spain, sacrificed democracy, risked the whole British lifeline in the Mediterranean?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For tlic paltry sum of $13,000,000 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Don't believe us, if this strikes you as incredible. Foreign Minister Anthony Eden told the House of Commons precisely that on Monday. When Laboritcs denounced the proposed exchange of “trade agents” with Franco, a virtual recognition of his regime, Eden declared:</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19380309_files/g_E_19380309-9.png" alt="" style="width:199pt;height:247pt;">
<p><span class="font4">Bargain, day for Jolin Bull</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">British trade in the part of Spain controlled by Franco has been $10,000,000 in the first nine months of this year (about $13,000,000 for a full year).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is worth while taking the normal steps to protect that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And when Eden was confronted with the cry that members of the British Cabinet held big interests in Spanish orc fields, through the British firm of Keen, Guest, Nettlefolds, Eden merely replied:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For many months it has been common talk that the British Government was sacrificing the interests of the Empire to the commercial interests of its plutocrats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Repeatedly, we have heard that the Chamberlain Government, forced to choose between saving British prestige in the Mediterranean and saving the investments of British high finance in Spain, had chosen to sacrifice the nation's power in the Mediterranean and rescue (or hope to) the investments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was difficult for most Americans to credit this sort of talk. To us, Britain had become a champion of democracy. Even its conduct subsequent to the World War had not disillusioned us entirely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But now we learn, from the Foreign Minister himself, that the whole shifting, shilly-shallying, eroweating policy which has been thrust upon the British people is the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">quid pro quo</span><span class="font5"> for $13,000,000 worth of trade with Franco.— New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Kick Out of It </span><span class="font5">♦ The demons get a big kick out of deceiving gullible humans. One of those disreputable old birds persuaded a prominent English woman, Lady Florence Barrett, that he was her husband. ‘Now he lives in a house in the spirit world somewhat like the one in which he did live; he cats and drinks through the pores of his skin instead of through his mouth, and he wears clothes produced through thought.’ She published this drivel, never having been taught the truth that this is all the work of devils, intent on perpetuating the lie that death is not death, and incidentally getting malicious satisfaction out of their evil deceptions, They told the lady that after death “each works at his own trade”. Evidently a coal heaver is still a coal heaver, a plumber still a plumber, a gangster still a gangster, and a pope still a pope!</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>What’s This? What's This?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ What’s this in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Worker's Weekly, </span><span class="font5">Wellington, New Zealand? Sounds like lese majesty of Britain’s new king when it says: </span><span class="font4">This insignificant individual, of whom we previously knew practicaliy nothing, is being puffed up into a great and wise monarch. There have been only a few months to do this. Previously, we had understood that Edward the Eighth was the greatest, wisest and kindest man in the world. But now it seems that there was a slight mistake. Brother George is the wisest man in the world, and Edward is a jazz-loving, irresponsible pursuer of _ grass widows. The artificiality of all this must be plain to many people. Never has the British ruling class shown its hand so plainly.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>Lost His Pants in the Fight</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The loss of the black shirts took all the stuffing out of Mosley’s Fascist crowd in Great Britain, and the British people as ft whole, as they hear more and more of Fascist doings in Germany, Italy, Ethiopia, Spain and elsewhere, have less and less use for the whole outrageous humbug. In London it cost £3,000 to protect 3,000 drab-looking Fascists on parade. At Southampton the resistance was so great that Mosley could not speak at all; 20,000 Britishers in front of him chanted “We don’t want Mosley’’; and they didn’t. One enthusiast climbed to the top of the speaker’s truck, or started to, but the Mosleyites pulled him baek, pulling off his trousers in the operation. This hero business comes high, and there is nothing much worse for a hero than to have his pants pulled off in public. Imagine Hitler or Mussolini or Franco going around without any pants on! Shocking! This time Mosley was in luek that the good-natured crowd of Britishers did not reverse the tactics and send him to his hotel in his shorts. That would have been funny and would have served him right. As it was, the police had to act as his bodyguard, and he was mussed up some by the crowd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jardine a Spiritist</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The Reverend R. A. Jardine, who married the duke of Windsor and Mrs. Wallis Warfield, is an out-and-out spiritist. He claims that on at least three occasions the Lord Jesus appeared to him in person, the last occasion ordering him to perform the marriage which created so much attention. The Scriptures plainly show that Jesus since His ascension never appeared to Jardine or anybody else, nor will He ever so appear. Jardine was fooled by one of those old nephilim (fallen angels— demons) that have done so much evil in the world, from Noah’s day tillnow.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ In British areas of 50 or more workingclass homes where a third of the houses are overcrowded or unfit for human habitation cities are encouraged by the general government to co-operate in tearing down the slums and building new working-class homes. The new flats are built around large interior squares where the children can play on grass and among trees with no danger of being killed by traffic. Tremendous progress has been made. The rents are exceedingly reasonable, running from 87 cents per week for a bed-living room up to $4.65 per week for houses with three bedrooms, a parlor, kitchen and bath.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ A British financier who has given away somewhat more than $50,000,000 to causes that seemed to him worth while has been tormented almost beyond endurance by the receipt of 70,000 letters a year, from every corner of the earth, begging for money. Every one of these is marked ‘<sup>1</sup> Personal ” or “ Urgent ’ ’ or “ Important”, and though none of the requests are complied with, it takes six secretaries to handle the detail work involved.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ At Leeds, England, the band in the Huddersfield Sporting Club struck up “God Save the King” and four Irishmen from the Irish Free State accepted it as an invitation for a fight. By throwing bottles and glasses, and breaking up some tables, using the legs as clubs, they managed to send five men to the hospital, but their greatest achievement was to kill a woman, Mrs. Edith Watson, typical crybaby work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">WE got out of prison about three hours ago, in a pouring rain and sleet, and are glad indeed to be out, I can assure you, however, that I am not sorry that I was there. It is much worse than I thought, even though the bed and food were clean, Much to my surprise I found that almost fifty percent of those in the prison have not committed any great crime. One prison man said that only about ten'percent of the inmates are real criminals. If a man wants to live a year in a month, let him go to prison. Can you imagine in a civilized (?) country a young lad getting two years for stealing two bottles of milk? Another one got five years for stealing a bicycle. Last Sunday in the yard, where the prisoners spend one and two hours a day, were three kids, One was ten years of age, one twelve, and one thirteen. Crime: One threw a stone at a wild duck; another one stole a cake of maple sugar. At the same time in that yard was a man in for assaulting a girl </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">twelve, sentenced to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">year. It is his fourth offense. One prisoner </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">said </span><span class="font5">to me, ‘ ‘ That fellow ought to be hung. ’'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Most of the men that I talked to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ate </span><span class="font5">men with enough stamina to remain men no matter how unfairly they have been treated. “I live my life to please God, not the priest, the -------11 ” said a big, fine-looking man, in for a year for selling bootleg whiskey, now and then, with his groceries. He was anxious to get a Bible, as were also several others. Most of the guards are real men, and many say ‘‘Good night’<sup>1</sup> to each of the boys as they go away after locking them up at six o’clock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You might ask how witnessing for the Kingdom went. We had a Gideon Bible there, I showed one after another of the boys, as occasion offered, Leviticus 25; 8-13, about the year of jubilee, and the returning of everyone to his possessions, and then I went on from that and gave the Kingdom message. I noticed how opportunities were sent our way by the Lord, so that we might find the right ones. When I tried to pick them—the right ones—-I had poor success,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yesterday, our last day, the Lord graciously let me get a size-up of what was done by the Truth message. The leader of the boys in our part said: “When you and Brown came we were told that you two were Communists, and only two of us had any sympathy for you, for that reason. Today we are all on your side but one man, and he is ignorant. As you talked to us the boys began to say: ‘Why, those men believe in God, like we do!’ Even Vezina over there. I heard him tell the guard that he was turning ‘Jehovah’ himself.” I am to send </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">French Bible to them through this Vezina. He was the chief captain of the prisoners. However, three days before we left he had his job as captain taken from him, also some of his good time, because he swore, or so it was claimed by another prisoner. The loss of his position put him upstairs with us, whereas before he was in special quarters with other trusted prisoners who worked in the kitchen and all over the prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the things that impressed me was the way the men made the best of their fate. One or two lads were grand singers, and we got song after song—in French, of course— after wo were locked in our cells for the night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We got lots of fresh air at all times, also warmth when needed. The food was clean, but can you imagine how a human loathes thin oatmeal porridge (all he can eat) with white bread (a generous chunk) and tea without milk or sugar twice a day? In the morning we got extra, one good-sized sandwich of bread and butter. We could have molasses with the porridge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An old prisoner was allowed to pay for and have one pint of milk a day, butter and sugar. I'was allowed to buy a pound of raisins. Brown was refused butter and sugar. He could not eat the porridge the last week. At noon twice a week we had pea soup, good, but not enough; three times a week we had beef stew with vegetables in it. The cook was really a good cook. Wc had a tablespoon to eat with. On Sunday we had beans, and fish on Friday. The beans were good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What makes prison life so unbearable is the confinement, and the idleness, as well as the one-sided diet. If we had been with degraded men, that would have been worse still. Wc were given a place with men who had a respect for cleanliness of mind and body. We had with us two bank managers for a while. One spoke English, and wc had some good talks. lie told me he had read </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Millions Now Diving Will Never Die,</span><span class="font5"> by Judge Rutherford, and said •it was a wonderful book. He was from Gaspe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He speculated with money entrusted to him, and lost it, and had to go to jail for it,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font5">case came to my attention yesterday which is a sample of how they get^men into jail. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Four </span><span class="font5">young fellows, some of &quot;them married, all of them working, got drunk, and while in that condition stole a box of butter—about fifty pounds. They were caught and impris</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">oned. </span><span class="font5">The wife of one of them offered the grocer $25 for the butter if he would drop the charge. Parents of another one of them </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">did </span><span class="font5">the same, but the grocer refused. lie said they had done a wrong, and they must suffer the consequences. One man got two years in Vincent de Paul; one got six months in Quebec prison, and two got two months each. These three were all in our ward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the lads with us was a cowboy and had spent two years in a circus. He did stunts out in the yard. He told me some great stories about cowboy life. He was in for stealing babbitt metal from an old shed. Another man was a sealer, in for five months for $6 which his wife-stole. He was permitted to serve her sentence. I have addresses of many of these to send literature to when they get out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The men in the ward next to ours said their beads together before they were locked in every night. One man told me that those in. authority tried to institute this all over the prison. The priest told them about it on Sunday at mass. He warned them not to try to get out of it, as anyone caught not saying his “Hail Mary” would be put in the dungeon— a damp, dark place in the basement—with no furniture whatever, with bread and water for food. The governor himself came to see that everyone was taking part. At least one man had been committed to the dungeon. There was so much opposition to it, however, that it was dropped in one ward after another, until only one ward kept it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Sunday the Catholics, or those who had been Catholics at all, are compelled to attend mass. Anglican mass is conducted in the afternoon, which, one man told me, about four men attended. We were thankful we were not asked to go. We told them emphatipally that we were not Protestants. A young man told me: “We go to mass so as to keep in with our parents and those who are ruling over us here, but we don’t believe in it any more. I was with two </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">hundred </span><span class="font5">other prisoners in another jail, and everyone went to mass, but only four of them believed in the priest any more. We are wait-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ The Sisters Adorers of the Precious Blood and the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Ottawa borrowed $49,000 from the Sun Life Assurance Company^ guaranteeing payment in case of default. Then they defaulted and the insurance company tried to collect. The defense, brazenly made in court, was that the Adorers outfit could not legally make the guarantee which they made. The judge on the bench, Justice Latchford, was astounded at the defense, and said so. He thought the ten Commandments still have some weight. He probably did not know that the Hierarchy has had the effrontery to even change these.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ When the’American bison neared extinction the Canadian government bought the last herd of 700 and placed them on the Buffalo National Park of 200 square miles, near Wainwright, Alberta. This area contains food for 5,000, and it becomes necessary, for the welfare of the rest of the herd, to kill 2,000 every year. The buffalo meat is sold and the hides are used for coats for the Canadian Mounted Police. Before the butchering this yfear the herd had grown to over 6,000 head.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ July 7, 1937, Japanese troops at Lukou-ehiao, China, claimed to have missed one soldier and opened fire on the Chinese city of Wan ping because it refused Japanese right of search of the city between midnight and dawn. Ten days later Japan served notice on China not to make any military preparations of any kind. This is probably the first time in history that any country intending to make war on another country, but pretending to be at peace with such country, assumed to notify the country to be attacked to be sure to do nothing to defend its citizens. Japanese shrapnel used to kill Chinese was &quot;Made in America”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ One of the worst and meanest methods of conquering a country is to destroy its inhabitants by opium and other narcotics. As this is done in India, so it is now being done in North China, where Japanese, Koreans and Chinese sell opium, heroin and morphine without any serious interference. Addicts are increasing faster than they can be cured. When the Chinese officials make an attempt to cure an opium addict and he backslides he is finally shot. Chinese drug peddlers are also often shot, but nothing can be done with the Japanese and Koreans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Although the young and inexperienced and ambitious Chinese nationalists are eager for war with Japan, and altogether too confident of their ability to now stem the tide of Japanese invasion and conquest, yet a sober view of the difficulties in the way is shown by the older men, who shipped millions of dollars out of the country, to Hongkong and to London, to make sure of its safekeeping in the conflict.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">THE BATTLE to force Jehovah’s witnesses to salute the flag at school ig has broken out on a new front, this time in New York State. At Center* reach, L. I., the parents of 13-year-old Grace Sandstrom are under a $10 suspended fine because, forsooth, they are guilty of keeping their child from school by encouraging her not to salute the flag, an exercise required in that town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We had hoped that these attempts to make flag homage compulsory, in the name of liberty, were dying out. Evidently, however, some effort is still required to teach school authorities that the very principles the flag stands for forbid such intolerance. Their notion is not American. It is Communist, Nazi, Fascist—take your pick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is also silly to think you can kick people into patriotism. And in the case of these Jehovah’s witnesses no question of patriotism is involved. With them the issue is purely one of conscience, based on a peculiar literalistic reading of a passage in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We may think their notion that it is wicked to salute any symbol is ridiculous, but it is no more ridiculous than the belief of certain school authorities that American liberties are to be safeguarded by punishing some poor child or its parents for a refusal to give a merely outward sign of homage, even when there is full loyalty in the heart.—San Francisco </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Appellate Court of the Third District has just handed out its lesson to the school boards. The Court upholds a ruling by Superior Judge Peter J. Shields of Sacramento that the Sacramento board'of education exceeded its authority in expelling little Charlotte Gabrielli from school because, in obedience to her parents, she did not salute the flag..</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Little Charlotte declined to salute the flag because her parents think the Bible tells them</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MARCH S, 193£</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">it is wicked to pay homage to any inanimate object, indeed, to any object other than God. No question of loyalty was involved. Nevertheless, the Sacramento board, conceiving that the Republic was endangered, commanded that Charlotte should not be admitted to school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Judge Shields told the board its action had no backing in law. Others told the board its action had no backing in common sense. The board, however, remained convinced that its course was promoting patriotism and making children loyal citizens by depriving them of a schooling. Now the Appellate Court tells the. board, and if the school directors still persist, no doubt the Supreme Court in its turn will tell them the same thing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In .Jail, Jerseyville, J1J. I HATE to he bothering you so much, but they now have me in the jug, in Jerseyville, this cold day, the second day of the witness period. A policeman asked me to get in oar with him, saying he wished me to talk with him, which I reluctantly did. He then drove toward town, asking first what I was doing, I then told him that I was preaching the gospel by means of tracts, pamphlets, and the printed page. He then asked if I was selling. Answered, </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">‘Nq;</span><span class="font5"> but was leaving publications with the interested ones on contribution to oover cost of more publications,’ He asked, and said they gave me ten minutes to get out of Grafton, and that I should leave in a hurry. I challenged, but gave no information on that affair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He then said ho would give me ten minutes in which to get out of town. I replied that I would stand upon my constitutional right and my commands from Jehovah and IJis Christ and would not leave town. He got his circulatory system notched upward then, and banged his fist down upon steering wheel, growling savagely, “You will leave town,” stating that he had many (6) complaints fpr trespassing and offered to get the judge down to tell us what the law was, to which I assented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the police station the officer looked over </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font5"> and read about purgatory’s being urt scriptural, and said he and they would never allow this to be circulated, having several churches (about six very cosily opes) and that I should work in with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The so-called “judge” arrived asking what the charges were. Officer identified me to the judgo as that fellow that had been in Grafton and was run out, the mayor giving me ten minutes to get out, Judge grunts, “Oh-huh. ■’ Gets my name, address, and former address, and says I was violating town trespassing laws, and that they had numerous complaints from the Jerseyville residents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I then asked who were some of those com-plainer® that presumably- said I stepped right into their homes and played the phonograph, and put fliy foot ip the dopr, etc, After the judge wrote up,the charges the police asked him what he was to make it.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">their admission that the trespass charge and complaints by the people were false.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He then asked me to go out of town and no further action would be taken, I calmly informed them that under no consideration would I leave till it was finished, Showed them my testimony card, and emphasized the fact that I had the high honor of being a duly authorized representative of the Society, and acting under their instructions, ’I will finish the town, and they can dp with me as they will, but I am determined to forge ahead, eqme what may.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ The judge (a small ghrjveled-up cigarette fiend) then ranted about five minutes about a New York concern’s taking the brass to defy laws and ordinances of Jerseyville, Ill. I asked, when he piped down, “What ordinances and laws were we defying?” He said, “Peddler’s license.” I replied, “Did you know that articles religious needed no license formerly? and if this work needs a license, since when was the law changed?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The officer went on to state correctly about taking mail orders, I told him that that is what I was doing, and am going to do. Then the judge ordered officer to lock mo up, which was done, not even allowing me freedom to take a book into the cell with me upon which tp write this letter, and it is quite chilly ip here and 14° above outside, The cop got an admission from me that I would accept a 25c contribution for a book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Heard indirectly that the Grafton judge told them that they could do nothing with me, save the peddler’s license clause, and then they would have to see me personally “sell” the book and take the money, I demanded a trial by jury.

He was hungry and was asking for his breaks fast ip such a way that Buddy had to nay attention.

<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ No wonder Jiipmy is cross. He hasp't had breakfast yet,” said Jane as she brought out his own little box of grain.

<p><span class="font5">When the pigeon had finished eating, he flew onto Buddy X head for his morning frolic. He pulled Buddy’s hgir, pecked at his shirt, apd walked up and dawn his arms when the boy held them out,</span></p>

It clung to the sides of the trees and lay thick on every branch and twig. Even the straggling weeds along the roadside were heavy xvith soft, glistening snow. It was a world of almost unbelievable whiteness and beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Want some to eat?” called Buddy. He buried his mouth in the fluffy snow piled on a little branch, and giggled when it wept up his nose and into his ears-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Finally they reached thq hollow, and all Buddy could say was “Oh!” while Jane spoke not a word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The little stream made a merry, gurgling sound as it bubbled over the stones, no longer hushed and covered with ice. The banks on either side were soft and white clear to the water’s edge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Suddenly a bluebird flew across the still whiteness. Its wings were the bluest blue, and its breast the pjepst rose. There was just a flash and it was gone. But Jane and Buddy knew that spring wasn’t far off,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Are the robins back?” asked Buddy,</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">R</span><span class="font5">ELIGION and its interests have had some space in the newspapers during the past few weeks, mainly because its leaders have been trying to let the people know how concerned they are for the safety of the interests they have in their care. An outsider might well say that these interests are those of an industry which is in the hands of a combine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1922 a commission of prominent men in the Church of England was appointed at the instance of the two primates; it was to make suggestions for a common ground of acceptance of doctrine for the clergy and the principal of their flocks. Canterbury said he wanted the church to give a clear light for &quot;this bewildered generation&quot;. After fifteen years the commission has delivered itself, of an abortion. In effect the published report admits that the Church of England has no settled doctrines, and there is no message for the people. As to the Bible, it is admitted that it is the .Word of God, but its statements are to be held subordinate to the finding of the critics, and to historical and scientific discoveries. Quite evidently the church is the important thing; it will keep an open door to all who will give it financial and moral support. One writer makes the comment, &quot;The church seems more concerned about digging itself in than anything else.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In its weakness the Church of England turns towards the Papacy. The report says, &quot;It [the Church of England] is bound to resist the claims of contemporary Papacy,” but adds, &quot;Some of us look forward to a reunion of <sup>1</sup> Christendom ’ having its center in a Papacy, such as might be found in a Papacy which renounced certain of its present claims.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is nothing new in this exposure of the weakness and nakedness of the church, except the fact of its admission. Another evidence of the internal unrest amongst prominent religionists in England comes to light in the publication of a report of a joint committee, appointed by Canterbury and the Free Churches. Both these sections are realizing they are losing ground: they see their existence threatened by the apathy of the masses of the people, and the contempt in which their claims are held. The people are making their way without the guidance of these self-appointed lights, and the thunders of the parsons now leave the masses cold. The clergy see that unless they combine and show a better front they stand little chance of retaining their ' ‘ inheritance ’ *. In order to bring union the established church is now willing to forego some of its reserved honors: it will agree to allow a select number of Free Church &quot;ministers” to be made bishops, no doubt with the expectation that they will be styled &quot;my Jord bishop”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This will not be acceptable to many of the ordinary members of the free churches, whose fathers fought for religious liberty; but, poor sheep, necessity will drive them into the common fold, built to protect them against the ungodly pressure of contempt and apathy. On -the other hand, those who refuse to be so led or driven will surely hear the clear message of the warning now being given by Jehovah’s witnesses, and will find the fold which the Lord Jesus has ready for them. The religionists go on their way refusing to hear the message which is being given: they refuse to be guided by the book upon whose revelation their structure is professed to be built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While church committees are being mentioned it may be said that the Church of England has another committee at work. In this case it is an investigation concerning the &quot;spiritists” religion. The trouble is that there are at least 200 clergy in the Church of England who make open acknowledgment of being spiritists. The report of this committee is to be kept private. The editor of the leading spiritist journal says the inquiry is not to discover what truth there may be in spiritualism, but to find out what damage is being done to the church by reason of the increase of this altogether unorthodox section of religion. The committee may discover some facts in this demonism; they will not find truth there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All this reveals that religionists know their systems are in danger, and fear is laying hold of them. Their churches are getting to be a burden to be carried. The true worshipers of Jehovah do not carry concern of this kind: their trust is in the living God, and in Christ, the Head of the church, and the followers of. Christ are not required to carry His care. They know, too, that the day of Jehovah with its judgments is come, and that the churches: founded and sustained by human device have had their day. Religionists seek collective security, hoping at least to get some peace amongst themselves, and perhaps make religion safe in the world. But they will find that security is the security Which the Devil, the enemy of God, has led them to, to their destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems apparent that the leaders of the Church of England sec no hope of its preservation except by the support of the Free churches and then all going together to Rome, which, whether they like it or not, would mean control by the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That there is a very definite movement inside the Church of England for its union with Rome is evidenced in a statement made by a lay representative in the church Assembly, who proposes to raise the matter in the Assembly, in session at this writing. This gentleman, Mr. W. P. Adams, states, quoting, “There are 1016 clergymen in the Church of England who have subscribed to the faith of the Council of Trent, and have pledged themselves to it. Moreover, there are 2000 others who are in sympathy, and who join in a season of prayer for the return of the Anglican church to the Papacy. ’ ’ The Council of Trent was the answer of the Roman Catholic Church to the Reformation movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All unknowingly these religionists are fulfilling the Scriptures they willfully neglect. Judge Rutherford, in his recently published book Enemies, shows that the prophecy at Isaiah 23:16-18 is now in process of fulfillment; that the Papacy is the harlot of that prophecy and of Revelation 17. The Devil is both leading and driving all religionists inter his trap and to their destruction. There is now no hope for these systems, but the Scriptures show that many sheep will flee from the false shepherds and find safety in the fold of the true Shepherd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The troubles of religionists are not all internal. Just when they think,of uniting to revive belief in religion a widespread anti-God movement has been launched in Britain. Its existence has not hitherto been realized; now it is announced the movement expects to hold an anti-God congress in London next April. An observer.says, ‘ ‘ A stream of pamphlets, books, magazines and posters is being poured out. They prove the rise of a militant movement to discredit the Christian : faith and destroy</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MARCH 9, 1938 &nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">belief in God among the British people.” It is said that the Congress of the Godless was conceived in Russia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;■ v ■,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And adding to the religionists’ trouble, Jehovah’s witnesses are now in open warfare against religion. In the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font5"> already mentioned, it is categorically shown that religion has been the chief instrument of the Devil in his purpose to turn men away from God, the Creator, and from Christ, the Founder of Christianity. It is made clear for all to see that Christianity and religion are opposites, and that the only way to understanding and to knowledge of Jehovah is to drop religion and accept the teachings of Jesus and His apostles. Jehovah’s witnesses well know that it is not their </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">own</span><span class="font5"> business that engages them. They are not commissioned to destroy religion. They know that in their work they, are only obeying the lead given to them, and that the day is come when Jehovah will expose and destroy all that is in opposition to Him and to the glory of His name. Their lead is, ‘The battle is not yours, but God’s.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Hierarchy has already disclosed its purpose to class these faithful servants of Jehovah with anarchists and Communists and with those who declare themselves as anti-God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A recent edition of the London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Express,</span><span class="font5"> after stating that a speech by Lord Fitzalan, a Roman Catholic peer, had much to do with the defeat of a bill which would have made euthanasia legal in the ease of incurable disease, adds, “Although Roman Catholics have been allowed to sit in Parliament since 1829, their power has grown considerably since the war, and many people believe that our Foreign Office, in which they have great power; is more influenced by the Vatican than it is by the Houses of Parliament. ”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark163"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark164"></a>Diversion</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">A recently published biography tells a story about a former bishop of the see called “S odor and Man”, so called because the diocese is of the southern Hebrides and the Isle of Man. The bishop was one of a select company to meet in a London drawing room. As he entered the room the announcer called out, “His lordship the bishop of Sodom and Gomorrah. ’ ’ It was a bad slip for the bishop, but it must have given some of the company some amusement. After all, the announcer dropped into</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">..... 29 </span><span class="font5">a measure of truth; for Jehovah likened Uis professed people Israel to Sodom and Gomorrah, and Jesils himself said of the religious combination of this day that ‘spiritually it is called Sodom and Egypt See Isaiah 1:10 and Revelation 11:8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">London is keeping Up with the times. Robbery with violence is getting prevalent, as well in the streets by daylight as in housebreaking and burglary. And a few days ago, in a broadcast on social welfare work, Lord Ponsonby said, “London is a dangerous place for the stranger, particularly beautiful girls.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark167"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark168"></a>Liberty of the Subject</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Contrary to general belief, there is no provision in the law of England giving liberty of religious belief or manner of worship. Recently the Lord Chief Justice spoke of the liberty of the subject as a priceless possession. A case eanie before him of a claim by a young man against the London police for unlawful arrest. Wearing an overcoat, he carried another on his arm taking it to the cleaners, and two smart policemen held him up as a suspect. The police were let in for £300 damages. Right of personal liberty depends upon common law, since Magna Ch art a, and later statutes. Most important liberties, according to Hals-bury, are : (1) right of personal freedom from wrongful detention; (2) right of property; (3) right of freedom of speech or discussion; (4) right of public meeting; (5) right of association (trades unions, etc.) ; (6) right to a just trial; (7) right to strike.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>Football Pools and Queues</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Cash betting on the results of football matches is illegal in Britain, but an enormous business is done in investments in the results of the most prominent league matches played every Saturday. Betting is not to bo mentioned : the philanthropists who arrange the ' pools always speak of “investments” when they try to allure tlyeir friends to share what they receive, oven to promising a possible £27,000 for the investment of a penny. In the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> a writer says, “On any Friday afternoon or evening in the winter season there may be seen at Ludgatc Circus post office two queues of almost cinematographic length, winding towards the two wickets at which postal orders are sold. They are football pool enthusiasts, constrained to pay the financial penalty of last week’s unsuccessful forecasts before they can again exercise their talents afresh on the morrow’s matches”. In November the post office sold nearly 45,000,000 postal orders, a large proportion going to make up the pools. Forty million pounds sterling annually go into these pools; the managers say they distribute 80 percent, retaining the balance themselves. One firm employs over 5,000 clerks, and in Liverpool the post office has opened a special office to deal with the business. The weekly “investment” seems to have become as much a part of the workingman’s life as has the weekly visit to the cinema.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>The Campaign for Fitness</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">When the Great War was on and the manhood of the nation was conscripted for service it was declared that the men could be classed only as C3 Instead of Al. When put into training for the front the better food and tho physical exercises soon made a difference in their appearance and gave the men more stamina. Now that war is again threatening, there is a cry for men fitted to defend the nation, and the government is actively sot on a fitness campaign. It hopes, by some development of the muscles and by general exercises, to have more men immediately ready for the army and for the services necessarily called for in war. But there is little being done in the social and commercial conditions which keep the men in short food, and in the cramping conditions in which they manage in some way to subsist with their families. Money rules the situation: dividends must be kept up, and that so frequently means wages must bo kept low.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past herring fishing season millions of this fish were thrown back into the sea rather than disorganize the market. Of course, the whole social and commercial system is wrong; but the fact that there is great plenty both of fish and of other foods for the people is clear, if only money did not stand in the way of their getting it. IT ere is an example of mismanagement in the milk business. The government controls the country’s milk supply, distribution and prices; but, by what must be called stupidity, it causes millions of gallons of skimmed milk to be turned into the drains rather than allow its free sale. It is possible for a manufacturer of umbrella handles and buttons to obtain large quantities of milk at 5 pence per gallon when it is impossible to obtain it for infant feeding at less than two shillings and four pence per gallon.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark173"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark174"></a>March Snow—Cover Design for This Number</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">F</span><span class="font5">OR some time now Old Man Winter and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mother Nature have been having an argument, and it looks as if Mother Nature was going to win out. But it has been quite an argument, and all about the return of Daughter Spring. Mother Nature is determined to deck out everything in right good style, but Old Man Winter thinks things are all right just as they are, and, anyway, he is comfortable and doesn’t want to be disturbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As one who is bested (or worsted) in an argument sometimes gives one parting shot to his opponent before leaving the field of combat, so Winter, in former years, on similar occasions, has taken delight in leaving behind a good fall of March snow before giving in to Mother Nature’s demand that he make room for Daughter Spring, and take himself off to realms farther north. It seems an ungracious thing for Winter to do, but perhaps is only just recompense for the inroads that have been made in his hitherto uncontested bailiwick. Besides, it seems that territories once wholly subject to his sway for a good quarter of the year now have but fitful evidence of his erstwhile rigor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sporadic and spasmodic are Winter’s efforts to be stem. Only seldom does he have the field for more than a week at a stretch. Mother Nature is constantly admitting smiling and gentle visitors in the form of mild and pleasant days. No wonder Winter is disgusted. But he is not ready to go without leaving some evidence of what he could do if he had a mind to, only ... It may be that this year he will not even have the gumption to do this, but will beat an ignominious and limp retreat before approaching Spring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then laughing Mother Nature will get busy and put things in shape and welcome joyous Spring in good style, decking all things with glorious verdure, w<sup>r</sup>hile all her living charges hold carnival at the advent of kindness, and the victory of warmth and cheer over coldness and gloom, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">March snow, at best, is an acknowledgment of defeat, the last desperate effort of a defeated foe. Soon the gnarled oaks will awaken to the genial smile of Spring and forget their transient intimacy with Winter. Decking themselves in royal style they will join the general rejoicing.</span></p>

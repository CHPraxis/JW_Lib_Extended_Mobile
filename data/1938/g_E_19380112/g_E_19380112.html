<p><span class="font6">♦ London, Ontario, authorities intended to put' up a sign that all persons having colds would be excluded from City Hall meetings while the influenza was on. The printer made . a mistake and changed the word “excluded” to “executed”. Probably he was just coming down with a bad cold and felt it would be a kindness to be bumped off.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ New Jersey’s official shield has three plows supported by the goddesses of liberty and prosperity and crowned with a horse head. In view of the continued persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in the Garden State, would it be out of order to suggest that the goddess of liberty, be crowned with a jackass head, just for New Jersey?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Plenty of Pluck but Poor Judgment</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ During the night, on the run from Momba- • sa to Nairobi, East Africa, a white rhinoceros, peeved by the headlight of a locomotive, charged head on. lie had plenty of pluck, but poor judgment. It took an hour and a half to get his huge body off the rails; then the passengers went back to bed and the train went on.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses at the Paris Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Contributed by a British Beader</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font6">T IS over. The fact has been far, far more wonderful than the anticipation. Who of Jehovah’s witnesses who was privileged to attend that thrilling international convention will ever forget it? Surely none. It is an imperishable page in the tablets of memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One feels that he must tell everyone of Jehovah’s rich and abundant blessing thereon. Leaving official records to those whose duty and privilege it is to deal therewith, let me give a few impressions and tell of a few happenings. Like David, I feel “my heart is inditing a good matter”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Through the night of Thursday-Friday, August 19 and 20, Jehovah’s witnesses are traveling from the towns and countryside of England and Scotland to London. We must arrive there in good time. Organization instructions are that we must be at Victoria station at 9:30 a.m. They come from the four comers of the land, a happy, smiling company, intent on honoring Jehovah’s name. They all wear the badge—“Congrds des Temoins de Jdhovah, Paris, 1937.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By Jehovah’s grace we are going to give a mighty, smashing witness against the Devil and for Jehovah in the priest-ridden land of France. “Let us rise up against her in battle.” Forward, brethren, for Jehovah and His great Field Marshal, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Three full trains convey over twelve hundred of us to Newhaven. Exactly how many we are, we don’t know; but “e’est une grande armee”. Already we are going la fran-Qaise”. Some are busily polishing up the introductory sentences in French that we have been given to help us approach the public in the house-to-house work. Those with a slight knowledge of the language are in demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And now we reach Newhaven. I am in the third train. Our friends on board eagerly </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 12, 1»38 </span><span class="font6">await us. Let us lose no time. We cast off, and head for the open sea. The sun smiles. The sea is tranquillity itself. Surely Heaven’s blessing is with us. Let us see how it strikes an outsider. Three Australian ladies are on board. The travel agents are allowing them to reach France by this ship. They are strangers to us. They look around them with amazement. One </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">has</span><span class="font6"> to speak. She inquires the meaning of it all. She has, she says, never seen anything like it. A ship full of people, and not one of them smoking! “You do not all know one another, and yet you look at one another and smile.” She is put in touch with the literature. Certainly after this experience she will read those books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ah! here is Dieppe. We disembark slowly and orderly. We are on French soil. How good after all to have been compelled to learn French in scholastic days! Now we can use that knowledge to Jehovah’s honor and glory. A looker-on watches intently this badge-bedecked crowd of people from England going to an international convention at Paris. I will speak to him as I pass. I smile and say, “Il fait beau.” He smiles back, and replies, “Oui, Monsieur, il fait beau temps.” Good! We are intelligible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two trains rush us along through Rouen and on to Paris. It is evening before we arrive there. By God’s grace this week-end it will merit its title, “La Ville Lumiere”—“The City of Light.” Off to our respective hotels by motor coaches we go. Some go to the mass accommodation center where, we learn later, over a thousand brethren of different nationalities are assembled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The next morning to the convention hall, “La Maison de la Mutualite,” and so to the work. We go to Versailles by motor coach. Near me are a sister from Switzerland, a German sister, and a brother from California. An international convention indeed. We return from the work, tired but happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And what of the public lecture at night? Brother Rutherford is to speak on “Consola-</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;tion”. </span><span class="font6">Jehovah’s blessing is again manifested. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">sit near a little party of French people, one evidently a widow. I cannot keep silent. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">speak to her in her own language. What a joy! My French is not too bad. She understands me. She tells me she lost her husband in the war. Iler friends join in. Soon we are in animated conversation. They have heard our records on the phonograph. Oh, good for the French brethren!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The hall fills up. Brother Rutherford speaks, and a brother interprets. During the address </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">look at my widow friend. She is following it closely. Afterwards she takes the special offer of literature from a French sister. We part with smiles. Oh, let me speak to that lady and gentleman! I approach and introduce myself. Yes, they have been impressed with the, lecture. They believe it to be true:. Monsieur says they are on a visit to Paris, but live in the Champagne country. He assures me with every evidence of sincerity and earnestness that they will take the lecture away with them as a treasured memory. Will they read the books ?‘Madame assures me they will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another cameo. I am coming out of the hall the next afternoon-—Sunday. English and German-speaking brethren have been together sin Hall A. Two ladies, apparently mother and daughter, address me: “When will Judge Rutherford speak again?” I produce a program. Have they not got one? No; they are not of us. The elder of the two says that they are from Australia; they are traveling. She says:- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Z</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wherever I go I cannot get away from you people. I come across you in all parts of the world. I came to Paris, only to find that my sister’s dressmaker is in touch with you through a journal, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">L’Age d’Or</span><span class="font5"> [the ’French </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age}.</span><span class="font5"> I look at your faces. They are alight. I know you have got something I have not. Although I have education and wealth, I am not satisfied. life is empty, and I want the Truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">remind her of the scripture, “Blessed' are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.” She declares she will investigate further. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then on Monday morning into the service again. This time we walk straight from our hotel to the territory. Following the street</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">map, carefully mounted on cardboard by our French brethren, we find ourselves in Mont-unartre, in the midst of old-world Paris. We climb the slopes to where above us rises the mammoth Basilica of the Sacra Coeur, dominating the surrounding district and visible for miles round Paris. This so-called “Church of the Sacred Heart” is one of the profligate woman Jezebel’s show places. Gleaming white in the sunshine it reminds us of our Lord’s words concerning whited sepulchers. This morning, as we ascend by the cliff railway, ' hundreds of visitors from all parts of France and from abroad are making their way up to see it. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men in skirts (priests of Baal) are plentiful. When people get inside, I am informed, they are immediately asked for money by priests ‘ holding out collection boxes and saying, “S’il vous plait. ’ ’ But we have no time nor inclination to go inside. We are eager to commence operations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With an inward prayer to Jehovah, the Eng- ' lish friends quietly set to work in the* quaint old streets, almost cheek by jowl with modern skyscraper mansions or flats. Artists are seated . at easels as we call at the quaint old-fashioned houses of Montmartre (The Hill of the Martyrs), the site of martyrdoms of the past,. Praise be to Jehovah, we .immediately com-menee to leave literature with the people. The Lord’s blessing is with us. The sincerity, the smiles, the ea’rnestness, of the brethren leap the barrier of language and carry conviction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■In an old-world court I knock at a door. An old lady puts her head out of an upstairs window. “Est-ce le commerce?” (“Are you trading?”) she inquires. “Non,” we reply, “e’est le Christianisme. ” In a moment or so she is at the door. She reads the explanatory leaflet. She would have had the booklets, but she is * too old and poor. An English sister comes up. They are about the same age. They cannot understand each other. But the two kind old faces smile at each other. “The booklets are yours,” we say to the French lady, “a gift.” She is touched, and comes out. She places her hands on our arms, and says with feeling, “Que Dieu vous benit” (“May God bless you”). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One final incident: I am sitting on the steps, halfway up the bill, waiting for some of the friends to return. A French lady and gentleman and their grown-up son are on the same seat. They eye my badge. 1 speak to them and tell them of the convention. I speak of the world crisis. They agree. I produce the set of literature, and at once they take it, proffering the contribution. Paris is having its witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Evening comes. We must return to London. Outside the hall our French and Swiss brothers and sisters stand in the roadway as we file , by to the motor coaches that await to take us to the railway station. They are joined hand to hand, forming a living chain. Their eyes are alight; their faces glowing. In a few hours we are on the moonlit waters of the English Channel, speeding back to our homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■Jehovah has blessed the convention indeed. We are conscious that the Lord of Hosts has used His army to do a portion of His ‘ ‘ strange work”. Who ean gauge the extent of the mighty witness given by those thousands of conventioners ? Paris, we know, has had its greatest -witness ever. Who can set a bound to its progress?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Deacon Answered the Third Prayer</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The great question before the house is as to just the point at which a deacon should answer the prayeb of somebody who furnishes him with his bread ticket. The answer seems to be that, if it is all understood beforehand, he should get busy and open up on the third call. This all comes out in the doings at the consecration and reopening of the Rheims, France, cathedral.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Six hundred cardinals, bishops and priests started on the job shortly after sunrise and in order to get a good start followed one another (like any other dogs) around the walls three times, meantime sprinkling “holy” water on the walls. Whether the German shells that blew up the original walls were'sprinkled with holy water before they started on their flight through the skies is unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Well, finally they all got back to the front, door, safe and sound—oh, maybe, for persona! reasons, staggering a little, but nothing to speak of. Then the cardinal began to pray and rap on the door; and did he pray and rap ? But after the third prayer and wallop the deacon that was on the inside opened up and let the priests in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The floor was covered with little piles of ashes. That is important. In the ashes the cardinal wrote the Greek and Latin alphabets. Jt isn’t everybody that ean do that. Then the ’“relics” of five “saints” were toted out and sprinkled around among five altars, along with more holy water. The pillars of the cathedral were then blessed, and especial thanks were sent to John D. Rockefeller, Jr., for his substantial part in the circus. And that’s all for now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Did Not Find the Dame After All</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Determined to locate a certain Englishwoman, suspected of having morals offensive to Parisians (!), Paris police rounded up scores of British women, some titled^ some wealthy, dragged them off to the Paris “Yard” where they were examined at great length, all in vain. The woman wanted was not found. The innocent ones were turned out of police headquarters at three o’clock in the morning, without apology or explanation, to find their way back to their hotels or apartments as best they could. It was a shabby way to treat visitors.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>A Horror Story Made to Order</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Without a word of truth in the story the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail’s</span><span class="font6"> correspondent in Paris was ordered to fix'up and send to London what was published there in Lord Rothermere’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Dispatch</span><span class="font6"> with a triple banner line across the front page to the effect that France was in chaos, tourists, were afraid for their lives, France had gone Bolshevik, etc. ’The correspondent, when reproved by the French Government for sending out such manifest and complete falsehoods, admitted that he had been ordered by Lord Rothermere to send the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Rival Fascist Groups in France</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ ‘Fascism looms in France, but the Fascist! there are divided, though they may later be consolidated. It is estimated that the Croix de Feu has 300,000 members: they seek to make .Col. De la Rocque a dictator, pure and simple. The “Jeunes Patriotes” also claim 300,000. There are two other Faseisti leagues of smaller memberships, blue shirt wearers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">France’s Underground Cemeteries</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ In France’s underground forts, with capacity for one million soldiers, there are vast hospital and recreation chambers, kitchens, dining rooms and storerooms (already filled with meat and wine), and there are also huge tanks of sulphuric acid in which the bodies of the slain may be dissolved. Queer cemetery; queer world.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>How Caij </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Get One?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The following is an extract from a papal bull. Mentioning as their backers the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, the holy cross (long since broken up into carloads of fragments), Mary, Michael, all the apostles, all the prophets and patriarchs, the holy choir (which should not be confused with the papal castra-ta choir), all the saints, and a few other things, the bull went down the line with the following Christ-like tribute to somebody with whom the pope happened at the time to be in disagreement. Does anybody know how </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation-</span><span class="font6">can get one of these curses? It would be fun to frame it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">May he be cursed wherever he be, whether in the house or the stables, the garden or the, field, or the' highway, or in the path or in the wood or in the water or in the church. May he be cursed in living, in dying, in eating ‘and drinking, in being hungry, in being thirsty, in fasting, in sleeping, in slumbering, in waking, in walking, in standing, in sitting, in lying, in working, in resting, and in bloodletting. May he be cursed in all the faculties of his body. May he be cursed inwardly and outwardly, may he be cursed in the hair of his head, may he be cursed in his brains, and in his vertex, in his temples, in his forehead, in his. ears, in his eyebrows, in his cheeks, in his jaw-bone, in his nostrils, in his foreteeth and grinders, in his lips, in his throat, in his shoulders, in his wrists, in his arms, in his hands, in his fingers, in his mouth, in his breast, in his heart and purtenance, and in his hottomest stomach, in his veins and in his groin, in his thighs, in his hips, and in his knees, his legs, and feet, and toe nails.

<p><span class="font6">♦ At the annual communion breakfast of the Catholic League of the Bureau of Attendance of the Board of Education of New York City, Brigadier General Win. J. Costigan, of the New York National Guard, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a time many years ago in this city when people were a little afraid to advertise that they were Catholics. Nowadays we hold communion breakfasts and parades on the 17th of March with ■ more of a display of Catholicism than of the Irish. This public demonstration, which must continue to become even greater in the, future, is the only way we will ever down this oncoming scare of Communism.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Painful Impressions of a Spanish Catholic</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ May I express the painful impression produced on many Spanish Catholics by the Words with which the pope lias recently blessed the rebels? We Spanish Cat holies who have been scandalized by seeing the'greater part of Spanish clergy joining the initiators of a rebellion against the legitimate government of the nation; we who have witnessed how the soldiers of the republic were fired on by priests from church towers ; and, above all, we, who have been foreseeing for many years the disastrous end of a policy of constant identification of the spiritual interests of the church with the economic ones of the rich, cannot but lament that the knowledge of certain facts apparently has not reached the Vatican.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One must also not forget the attitude of the Basque priests, fighting against the rebels in complete unity of the people ■ nor the adhesion to the government of the republic of a minority of Catholics, poets and thinkers, who are trying to save by means of,the spirit that which cannot be saved by the sword, namely, the spiritual prestige of Catholicism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even in the event of a rebel victory, what influence on the masses will the priests have whose hands might appear stained with blood ? The memories of the peasants murdered by the legionnaires, and of the women violated by the Moors, would always be an insurmountable barrier between religion and the people.— Don Enrique Moreno, Catholic lecturer at Oxford University.</span></p>

It supports policies that can only be ma.de. to work by the enslavement of whole populations, by the destruction of freedom of every type, by a return to conditions paralleling those of the Dark Ages, but even worse because men today have an alternative of-which the Dark Ages knew nothing. If I am right this is the most tragic blunder in the history of your Church,</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Bishop Boosts Price of Chickens</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ While witnessing we hear many interesting things. Among them the following may deserve notice. During her confinement, it is the custom among Brazilians to feed the mother on chicken, but the Catholic church prohibits all meats or fowls on Friday, especially on “Good Friday”, pretending it is a great sin. It so happened that on last “Good Friday” a lady in this city gave birth; so they were in a quandary how to avoid violating the church decrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The husband went to consult the priest, who said: “I will give you a note to the bishop, for which you will pay me 5$000, and I don’t think you will have much more expense.” He took the note to the bishop, who pronounced the case very serious, but there is a solution.- “You give me 100$000 for a bula (permit.) to kill a chicken, without sin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So the husband paid the amount, purchased the chicken, and went home happy, but minus the 105&amp;000 (about $6.30 U.S. currency) the church stole from him, plus the price of the fowl. So the bishop raised the price of that chicken to about 108$000 ($6.48), which is more than many are able or willing to pay.— V. Ferguson, Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Clever Japanese Trick in Colombia</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The United States of Colombia has a Jaw limiting Japanese imports to the amount of Colombian goods exported to Japan. The Japanese got around this by marking their goods “Made in U. S. A.” and getting Germans to handle them. These German agents used fictitious letterheads and bills giving American firm names and addresses, but finally got caught at it.</span></p>

For the first fortnight I was confined in a solitary confinement cell. In many cells, six feet by nine feet, four people were imprisoned together without chairs or tables in indescribably filthy conditions. After that we heard the execution squad at work. One, two, three, four volleys rang out monotonously each night, the officers giving the coup de grace to each prisoner. The victims died gallantly, shouting “Long live the Republic”. Each day we walked in the execution yard slippery witji the blood of our fellow prisoners.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Yes? I had to shoot over 3,000 persons purely in the town. In Badajoz, town and province, in a few weeks we gained a complete victory.

<p><span class="font6">1,000,000 persons slaip in the first year of the Spanish War arid asserting that 90 percent of Spain’s army officers were in the revolt. And then, three days later, if readers of the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> they saw the statement of “Reverend Father” Sylvester Sancho in an address to Fordham University students that “not twenty percent of the army went with Franco”. Somebody lied; who do you suppose it was?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Waited a Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ On August,4, 1937, the pope gave de </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">facto</span><span class="font6"> recognition to the Franco government. But why wait a year to recognize the child of his own creation? It is an open secret that Franco never would have violated his oath and betrayed his countrymen but for the political and financial backing of the pope and his henchmen.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Franco Approved</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ A Spanish sergeant, serving in Franco’s army, decided to return to the side of Spain and deserted. A few days later he was captured, and Franco allowed the men of his former regiment to kick him to. death while they were on parade. Franco approved the dispatch which contained these facts.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>A Good Word for the Pope</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ It is a pleasure to be able to say a good word for the pope, in this, that the dispatches from Spain show his Moorish soldiers have sharpened their swords until they have razor edges, and when they hit one of the Spanish Republic’s soldiers fairly they decapitate him at a blow. This saves needless suffering, and the pope should have credit for it until he gets time to correct matters and get them more in line with usual Hierarchy practices.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>-The Italian Film “The Taking of Malaga”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The Italian film “The Taking of Malaga” was suppressed by the Italian government because it told too much. One of the captions was, “Justice accomplishes her work in the suburbs.” It showed a number of prisoners with hands tied behind their backs. Catholic priests appeared ; then a firing squad. At a distance of a few steps the soldiers fired, shooting the captives in the back. As the bodies fell in the agonies of death the voice of the commentator was heard saying, “Justice is done. ” Then an Italian officer rode over the bodies on horseback, finishing oft with a revolver those that showed any signs of life. Malaga was taken by the Italians by an act of strategy, not by an act of war. The pope was greatly comforted in his sick legs when the city fell, deriving nearly as great joy from it as he did from the butcheries at Addis Ababa.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Michael O’Flanagan, Honest Priest</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ In an address at Cincinnati, Reverend Michael </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font6">’Flanagan, an evidently honest Catholic priest, and said by the Catholic press to have been suspended from the priesthood ' (probably for the very reason that he </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">is </span><span class="font6">honest), said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I am here as an individual, not as a representative of the profession which my raiment indicates. The church in Spain was divided when the crisis . came. It was natural that the church would throw its support one way or another when hostilities opened, but it was unfortunate she threw it the wrong way. The pope, a very old man, sits on top , of the world in his little kingdom, surrounded by bayonets of Mussolini. I have the greatest reverence for the pope, but I believe he should comment on the Spanish strife or any other political unrest only as a citizen, not as an ecclesiastic. “</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Basques Protest to the Pope</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The Basques of northern Spain, all devoted Catholics and all on the side of the Spanish Republic, inquired of the pope why their priests were murdered by Franco’s men when they fell into his hands, and asked him to break his silence. In their appeal to the pope they addressed him as the ‘father of Christianity’. Poor things! How little they know what Christianity really is!</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>The Pope’s Answer to the Basques</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The Basques wanted the pope to speak up and say whether or not he approved the destruction of their self<sub>7</sub>government and of their churches by Franco and his hordes. They are accounted the most Catholic people in Spain. The pope gave them his answer. They got it on a Monday, which is market day in their little city of Guernica. Franco’s men bombed the entire city, section by section, leaving great holes where buildings had stood. The people ran, of course, and then the pope’s airplane “heroes” came &lt;jown and machine-gunned the fleeing men, women and children. Next came incendiary bombs, setting the city afire, and last of all those fleeing along the roads’ leading out of the city, the women and the children, were machine-gunned. This is Fascism, Catholic Action, which intends to rule the world, no matter what the price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">' 103 Jesuits Killed in Spain</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ In 1932 the Spanish Republic suppressed the Jesuits once more as trouble-breeders, the same as almost every other country has had to do at One time or another, and ordered them out of the country. In the summer of 1937 the pope announced that 103 of them had been killed by “Spanish radicals”. In other words, that many Jesuits, fighting against the government that ordered them out of the country, and fighting against their own countrymen, were slain. What is wrong about that? A good share of all the priests in Spain are now fighting in Franco’s army as common soldiers, and if they get killed they have only themselves to blame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Red Cross Insignia Means Nothing</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The Hierarchy’s aviators in Spain, following up their practice in the Ethiopian war, now make it a special point to bomb everything that has the red cross upon it, because in that way they can kill more people. Ralph Bates, English novelist, just back from Spain, declares that the Spanish Government has had to take in all Red Cross signs, even from ambulances. These deeds of the Hierarchy are showing it up in its true light. It is not Moorish troops that are attacking the Red Cross, but Italians, Catholics.,</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>Free Speech on the Gold Coast</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ At Toasi, on the Gold Coast, West Africa, a half dozen of Jehovah’s witnesses preached the gospel to the people. The Roman Catholic priest of the community could not ‘‘take it” and lodged a complaint with the police, causing the arrest of the witnesses, charged with breach of the peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the matter came into court the able magistrate on the bench reversed the charges, explained to the misled Catholic population, who had caused a certain amount of disorder, that religious tolerance exists throughout the British Empire and that everybody has a right to teach his own religious views. He cited the preaching at Hyde Park, London, where about seventeen religious bodies preach against one another, but where immunity from an opposing sect’s assault is assured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He then told the people that Jehovah’s witnesses have perfect liberty of action and speech. Those who had caused the disorder then pleaded guilty and were fined five shillings each. The report says: “The Catholics were very much ashamed, and it did not add to their peace of mind to learn that we intend to sue them for damages.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>Illicit Opium Growing in Egypt</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The cultivation of the poppy' is forbidden in Egypt, but is on the increase because each acre, at the present price of opium, brings in about £550, and as long as men are what they are they will not allow such opportunities for wealth to slip- from their grasp without an effort. Poppy fields are hidden behind high walls, and in the middle of fields of sugar cane and com, but a way has been discovered to locate them. Airplanes go back and forth, taking pictures of the fields below, with the result. that poppy fields are located with certainty : the analyses of the photographs never fail to find them.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Leopard Men of Liberia</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ It turns out that the ‘leopard men* of Liberia were a group of coffee planters that sought and obtained free labor by controlling the natives through terror and mystery. The society members dressed in leopard skins killed many natives. The impression was spread about that they were supernatural.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>Decimation of Ethiopian Populace</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The decimation of the Ethiopian populace proceeds apace. According to the Berbera, Somaliland, correspondent of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New Times and Ethiopian News,</span><span class="font6"> it seems to be the settled policy of the Italians to wipe from the face of the earth all Ethiopians above ten years of age. Some are burnt alive, and some are shot to death for gun practice with the various forms of guns now manufactured by International Murderers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Innocent Negroes from British Somaliland who were in business in Ethiopia were run out of the country and deprived of their businesses, homes and interests, without any redress. The Italians seized all they possessed. In six months Italian military ventures increased the circulation of Italian notes by 15,000,000,000 lire, and it is well known that Mussolini must inevitably wage war to save himself.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>Building Roads in Abyssinia</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Nobody can accuse the Italian people of being lazy. There is hardly to be found on earth a more industrious people. In the short time that Italian troops have been. in Abyssinia they have built two motor roads between Addis Ababa and Red Sea ports 400 miles distant, and there are now 1,000 miles of decent highways radiating from the capital, where Hailie Selassie will reign nevermore. Mussolini’s offer to replace that gentleman in Addis Ababa as governor, jinder his direction, are said to be largely due to the fact that the pope is disappointed with the expense of his &lt;&nbsp;Spanish adventure, and wants something back on what he put into the Ethiopian war.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Italian Troops in Libya</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The Italian army in Libya, amounting to about 50,000 men, is far stronger than the Anglo-Egyptian forces to the east of it or the French forces in Tunisia on the west. The presence of these troops is not needed to protect anybody in Libya, $nd the only explanation that is reasonable is that Mussolini still has it in his mind to reconstruct the old Roman Empire by making the Mediterranean an Italian lake. The Italian forces in Libya are equipped with 200 planes. What are these for?</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ The monk business is one of the best rackets going. A chink took a yellow robe off a clothes tree at Wat Sra Kes, Siam, and found he had become a monk and that the business was an easy business to learn and to practice, and paid much better than his previous line. Unfortunately, he liked to spend his evenings, after his days of toil, smoking opium, and, to save his face, was wont to put off his monk robe and put on ordinary clothing. Caught changing garments he was pinched and taken in tow to the police station. Now, like many other monks, he may have to work for a living henceforth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HE Hierarchy makes itself felt here too, but, instead of doing the work harm, their white-frocked '‘woemen.” have been the means of advertising greatly the Kingdom .gospel. They ride around their flocks on their female cycles telling the people to look out for the ship, and to have nothing to do with the books, sometimes wiring the next town ahead of us, and thus filling the people with curiosity to see and speak to these “fanatics” that have come so far in such a small ship,- and to read the books that have made the priests so very angry; Thus we often find the people ready to take the literature at once or ready to turn us away as the case may be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another scheme seems to be to work the Merchant-Shipping Act to try to prevent our books’ coming into a port that is closed to trading. At the above port we were forbidden to land the first day and were told that as it was a closed port there was nothing to hold us. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">'We </span><span class="font6">pointed out that if we were not allowed to work the port we would not have enough money to buy the stores with which to go to sea; so the harbor master wired his liead office, ' and after a few days we were told that in order to cope with our troubles, as a foreign ship, it was easier to make the port open to shipping. The speculation in the towm as to whether we would be allowed to land had advertised us very well; so the people were ready to help at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The captain of the Dutch ship Taradja has expressed a desire to have a complete set of the literature in English, because, as he says, “if the power behind your work is strong enough to move the Dutch government to make open a closed port, therr there must be something in it.” After the lectures in the Dand-raads Hall, the resident and the controlleure both expressed the view that the minister had done wrong, and he becoming somewhat worried asked me to go and see the above gentlemen. On so doing and explaining the work of Jesus while on earth, they both agreed that the Hierarchy teaches many things that are false and our work is a good one. There will be nothing more said about the matter, but both of them think that we will get into trouble yet, if we make such strong talks again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The independent minister here offered us his church to give our lectures to the people, and, instead of the usual service on the Sunday of 25th inst,, they had the pleasure of listening to the lectures “Rebellion”, “Truth,” “Keys,” “Holy,” and “Sanctification”. At the end of the lectures the minister said, “That is just what I believe.” He has read </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches, </span><span class="font6">and took the whole set saying, “Fine! Fine! These books are very good and I must take a few of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font6"> for my friends.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have many such experiences, and all give thanks to the great Jehovah God for this privilege of even a small share in thfc glorious service. We also thank Him for the care and protection that is so very manifest while we are at sea.</span></p>

It seems like a tall story, but details are given. Climbing the tree is made possible by cutting slits, into which planks are forced. The platform on which the cutter stands is the top edge vertical plank. Twelve competitors finished a like task, all under three minutes. The “trees”*are hardwood logs set up to a height of 15 feet and they are cut off about one foot from the top. Tree-chopping carnivals are popular in Australia.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">F</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">red W. Nussbaum, superintendent of police of Peoria, Illinois, is troubled with much agony,of spirit in the night watches .these days. Fred made a bad mistake about a year ago; several of them, in fact. In order to be kind and obliging to some of his religious friends he caused to be incarcerated in prison on five different occasions one Sarah Morris. Sarah Morris is one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and that is the reason why she was thrown into jail so frequently. No warrant was ever issued for her arrest, and no charges were preferred against her. Some priests in Peoria were shocked in their susceptibilities because she preached Bible truths to the people ; so this method of getting rid of her was adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It didn’t work. She brought an action for $20,000 -damages for false arrest and imprisonment against the police official. That didn’t trouble him much; for he believed the judges of Peoria county would be kind to him. But Landon L, Chapman, attorney for Mrs. Morris, was prepared for that, and filed an affidavit for a change of venue. The judge of the Circuit Court, Joseph E. Daily, allowed the motion, but then proceeded to make<sup>:</sup> it harmless by declining to call in any other 'judge, or to send the case to any other county. That is reported to be an old trick in Peoria. But it didn’t work. A petition was filed with the Supreme Court of Illinois informing tlie court of' that skullduggery, and that high judicial body promptly issued an order and decree directing and requiring Judge Daily to change the venue of the ease to some other county, and intimating gently to him to do it promptly in order that penalty thereon may not fall upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And so amidst troubled dreams this high police official now hath visions of a judgment of many thousands against him, with officers-surrounding, him with body executions, property executions, orders, writs, and capias </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ad infinitum.</span><span class="font6"> Truly the transgressor sometimes falleth into his own cesspool.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ At one time it looked like quite a clever idea to some people for Uncle Sam to buy all the gold he could get at double what it costs to produce it. The ones to whom it looked the best were those who produced the gold. Anyway, your dumb uncle now has half the gold in the world, some $12,000,000,000, produced at half that price, and, if he were to part with it, would probably get about 50 cents on the dollar. Moreover, he dare not now either stop buying or reduce the price, for ail the International Murderers’ prosperity is built upon this artificial foundation. In other words, Britain and Russia can afford their huge armaments, because they can sell their gold output to the world’s dumbbell, your uncle Sam. If Sam stops buying, or cuts the price, along comes not only the end of prosperity, but the. biggest lantern-jawed panic yet. And probably that is on the scroll.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>How to Rise in the Community</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Bertrand Swsell</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Reprinted from the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ During the French Revolution, when the Reign of Terror came to an end it was found that no one was left alive among the politicians except prudent cowards who had changed their opinions quickly enough to keep their heads on their shoulders. The result was twenty years of military glory, because there was no one left among the politicians with sufficient courage to keep the generals in order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The French Revolution was an exceptional time, but wherever organization exists, cowardice will be found more advantageous than courage. Of the men at the head of businesses, schools, lunatic asylums, and the like, nine out of ten will prefer the supple lick-spittle to the outspoken man of independent judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In politics it is necessary to profess the party program and flatter the leaders; in the navy it is necessary to profess antiquated views on naval strategy; in the army it is necessary to maintain a medieval outlook on everything; in journalism wage slaves have to use their brains to give expression to the opinions of millionaires; in education professors lose their jobs if they do not respect the prejudices of the illiterate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The result of this state of affairs is that in practically every walk of life the men who come to the top have served a long apprenticeship in cowardice, while the honest and courageous have, to be sought for in workhouses and in prisons. Now, as in the past, if you wish for success, you should be insinuating and pusillanimous rather than bold and self-reliant. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To those, therefore, whose ambition is to die in the odor of sanctity, respected by bank managers, admired by friends and neighbors, and universally regretted as models of what a citizen should be, my advice is: Don’t express your own opinion, but those of your boss: don’t endeavor to realize ends which you yourself think good, but pursue rather those aimed at by some organization supported by millionaires; in your private friendships select influential men if you can, or, failing that, men whom you judge likely to become influential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Do this, and you will win the good opinion of all the ‘best elements’ in the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is sound advice, but, for my part, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">would sooner die than follow it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">. ♦ Officers of the law are familiar with the' fact that pickpockets work in groups of four, each one of the four having a definite part to play. One does the picking, one carries the ■ swag, one is the apparently disinterested witness, and one does the knockout, if that is necessary. One of Jehovah’s witnesses near Albahy was relieved of $9 in bills, nestling in his left front pantaloon pocket, by a group of alleged gypsies who insisted on crowding close to him, to “tell his fortune’’. The same group got caught later, because too many missed their wallets. Avoid all such groups of ostensible fortune tellers or other voluble and fresh friends who want to come close to you. One innocent handshake may cost you your roll.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In the Eucharist the Body of Christ is ‘really, truly and substantially present’ not in a natural state, but in a Sacramental state which is not a subject for imagination at all.

<p><span class="font14">Q</span><span class="font6">UESTION: A friend lived in Brooklyn all her life and has been a Catholic. Recently a dear member of her family died and she was in great distress. She asked the Catholic priest to take the body into the church and say prayers for her consolation. He refused to do so unless she would pay him $40. Another priest offered to do as she requested for $25. The two priests got into a fight about the difference in the price, and she got no consolation. Is that the way God provides to comfort us when we are in distress?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Answer: No. Such is not God’s provision. The demand of those priests for money to say prayers for the dead is another evidence of the racket practiced by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization. These priests pretend to say prayers in behalf of the dead, and they use this means of inducing the living relatives of the dead to pay over money. Their prayers are not heard by the Lord. It is bad enough to rob the poor, but to claim that in so doing it is done with the approval of Almighty God is wickedness beyond the description of words, God does not hear the prayers of anyone who uttersi them for a money consideration. Such person, whether a priest or a layman, is a wicked person, because he wholly misrepresents God and defames Uis name and robs widows and orphans that the Catholic organization may benefit. He employs a false and wicked pretense to thus obtain money. Concerning that same-class of clergymen the Lord 'Jesus spoke these words: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer; therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of hell?” (Matthew 23; 14, 33) Any priest who resorts to the method you describe is an evil man, and the Lord will not hear the prayers of any who are evil; and concerning this it is written in the Scriptures: ‘‘For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 12, 1038</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ (1 Peter 3:12) Furthermore, such priests claim that their prayers will shorten the period of “suffering” of the dead persons whom they claim are in “purgatory”. The priests’ claim is entirely false. The dead are not in “purgatory”, because there is no such place.. The dead are not conscious in any place whatsoever, There are many scriptures showing the condition of the dead, of which the following is a sample: ‘ </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘ For</span><span class="font6"> the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward, for the memory of them is forgotten. Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.<sup>1</sup> ’ •—Ecclesiastes 9: 5,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The priests or clergymen wdio employ false pretense to obtain money by their claim to utter prayers to God in behalf of others, do not bring any comfort to anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ Where, then, do we find comfort when in distress? In the Word of God, the Bible; and the Catholic priests try to keep the people in ignorance of the Bible in order that they may carry on their wicked racket. If one will read the Scriptures and find out the condition of the dead, he will learn that the dead are unconscious; that Christ Jesus has purchased the human race; and that all that believe on the Lord Jesus Christ shall be raised out of the grave in due time and will have an opportunity to obey Him, and if they do obey they shall live. Concerning this Jesus said: “Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.” (John 5:28,29) The time for one to seek consolation is when he has the opportunity of hearing the Lord’s Word and obeying it. The Lord is causing the people now to be brought in close contact with the truth, and they are given an opportunity to hear the Word of truth, that they may know the right way to go and receive consolation and the blessings of the Lord. To such Jehovah now says: “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price.” (Isaiah 55:1) The Lord makes provision for the people without regard to paying money. Instead of paying money to Cath-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">17 </span><span class="font6">olic priests to enable them to carry on their racket, and which brings no consolation to anyone, give heed to the words of Jehovah, -who in this connection further says: ‘ ‘ Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satiS-fieth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and cat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.” '‘David” means “Beloved”, and is the name referring to Christ Jesus, the beloved Son of God; and concerning Him it is 'written: “Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.” (Isaiah 55:2-4) Writeethe Watch Tower for a copy of the booklet WAera </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Are</span><span class="font6"> Me </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dead?</span><span class="font6"> and in that you will find many scriptures proving beyond any question of doubt the condition of the dead and God’s provision made to comfort the living, anti showing the provision for those who have died and gone into the grave. The Scriptures give this consoling information and furthermore say, “Wherefore comfort one another with these words.” (1 Thessalonians 4:18) As honest people learn of the great fraud practiced upon them by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their priests, they will break away from that wicked organization and find peace and consolation in the Word of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Those are nice words. That is excellent advice. Perhaps we may be allowed to ask how long New Jersey’s chief executive has been dealing out spiritual counsel. Is it a newly assigned duty?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses recall vividly appealing to the governor of New Jersey a year ago with a serious problem. They told him of the shameful and brutal treatment handed to 114 God-fearing men and women in New Jersey. Those men and women, as attendants at a Bible convention in Newark in October, 1936,</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">were jailed and sentenced to heavy prison terms for advising and helping residents of New Jersey to , study the Bible, and 'to seek in that Book of books the answer to all personal and public problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is quite a difference between the way Ohio treats such persons and the way they are handled in New Jersey. This year thirty thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses gathered in convention at Ohio’s capital city. They visited</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the homes of the people of Columbus and vicinity, to encourage them in the habit of studying the Bible. They were not arrested nor interfered with. During the time that the New Jersey governor’s chair has been occupied by Harold G. Hoffman over a thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses have been jailed in New Jersey for the same kind of activity. Why is New Jersey so different from Ohio?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This probably has been quite a problem for you. The Hague political machine, with its ecclesiastical allies, has been engineering that inquisition against Jehovah’s witnesses, and only a real man has what it takes to fight that outfit. Did you turn to the Bible for a solution to the problem? Is it becoming to, the New Jersey governor now to grandiloquently inform the people thfct the God-given Book “is a catalog of human wisdom . . . and in it we will find enrichment of mind and soul”? Why didn’t you enrich your mind with the Biblical solution to this problem of persecution of humble, harmless followers of Jesus /Christ who sincerely tried and continue to try to help the people of New Jersey to understand the Bible, even in the face of the most persistent and vicious attempts on the part of agents of the Boman Catholic Hierarchy to suppress the dissemination of Bible truths in New Jersey ? That wouldn’t do. It would have brought you into conflict with Hague and his henchmen. So through your secretary you feebly squawked, “I ean’t do anything about it,” and hoped that we would not misunderstand you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And now, a year later, with effrontery unmatched by that of any European dictator, and hypocrisy on a par with that of the Pharisees and Sadducees, you step out as a great spiritual advisor and urge all people to seek the answer to their problems in the Bible. Who’do you think will consider you sincere and follow your advice? A few mental lightweights ipay listen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This same Bible which you now pretend to revere so highly describes clearly and accurately those who use it for selfish political and social reasons. It tells how such draw near to the Lord with their mouth and with their lips do honor Him, but their hearts are far </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font6">moved from Him. It tells also of Jesus’ words concerning such hypocritical billy goats who presume to address Him, saying, “Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?” And Jesus </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">an</span><span class="font6">swers them: “Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these [my brethren], ye did it not to me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This letter I write to inform you that you will not be able to deceive one genuine Christian in New Jersey with the brand of political hypocrisy that bubbles from your proclamation concerning the Bible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">O</span><span class="font6">N September 30, 1936, the Jersey Railway Advertising Company and the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society entered into a contract in writing whereby the said advertising company agreed to carry advertisements of Judge Rutherford’s lecture on “Armageddon” for a period of two weeks. The Watch Tower agreed to pay the organization $810.00 for the service. The advertising company carried the material for llj days, and then without cause discontinued the service. The reason was that certain subjects of the incubus ruling New Jersey, to wit, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, protested against the advertising. Entirely ignoring the fact that it had pledged its services for two full weeks the corporation broke its word just to accommodate these religious objects. Then it had the nerve, the gall and audacity to'send a bill for $665.35 to cover what it claimed was the value of its services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Watch Tower declined to pay the bill unless the company showed good reason' for ■ defaulting on the contract. The company brought suit, and in spite of the fact that it diligently refrained from disclosing the reason for breaking the contract, the City Court of New York decided in its favor. An appeal was taken to the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court, and that high judicial body, after carefully considering the matter, decided that the contract was entire, and that the company could not collect a nickel without rendering the service called for in the agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' <sub>(</sub></span></p>

Honesty is ’ a very good policy, is one. These high executives have heard of this principle. They should re-examine it, and make a good resolution to henceforth follow it. In other words, a contract is to be kept, not violated to meet the approval of a man who docsn ’t know on which side of his face to button his collar. These gentlemen who make it a business to do advertising for &quot;&nbsp;other people should also learn that a corporation which is so lacking in moral stamina as to permit a bunch of religious racketeers to dictate its business policy isn’t worthy of the respect or good will of honest people.

<p><span class="font6">♦ School officials are on a rhthcr tough spot regarding children of parents who belong to a religious group which is opposed to saluting flags. The law says the children must salute. School officials have to enforce the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before us is the photograph of a lovely, 12-year-old Roslindale girl, the sort any one would be proud to have as a daughter. Little Avis Thomson is not allowed to attend Boston schools because, obeying, her parents, she will not salute the flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, we haven’t the slightest fear that little Avis Thomson or her parents are not good Americans. We feel quite sure they are nice people. The point we see is that Avis and her parents are not disloyal to the American flag. Their particular creed forbids saluting the flag of any country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why can’t some sensible, patriotic, fearless legislators get together and improve this law we have so that compulsory flag-saluting is not made a yardstick of juvenile patriotism? This newspaper is not afraid of the wrath of pseudo-patriotic flag-wavers. It will help hlong the good cause.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ .Four juvenile witnesses of Jehovah are to be expelled from the public schools in Upper Marlboro because they refuse, on account of religious scruples, to salute the flag. The board of education wants it understood that this is to the end that “love of liberty and democracy . . . shall be instilled in the hearts and minds of the youth of America. ’ ’ A poor start, it seems to me.</span></p>

Another. triumph for one hundred per cent Americanism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But what happened to little Robert Besterfield, the young G-Man of the eighth grade, whose tattle-tale brought the matter up? I hope they make him stand in the comer, or at least that his schoolmates revert to the standards of boyhood of the pre-flag-saluting' era, and invite him outside. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And what about Robert’s father, the American Legion member whose complaint to the school principal resulted in so much fuss?

The lad in question, lured by the spring, set out to visit relatives in a southern state, and hopped a freight train to help him on his way. Seen to get off the train, he was grabbed and the police magistrate had no more sense than to sentence him to thirty days in the chain gang.

<p><span class="font6">You, being a citizen of the United States, should know more about its Constitution than does one who is not; but I venture to say that the Constitution of the United States guaran-, tees to all its citizens the exclusive right of free speech and the exercise of one’s faith according to his conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So far, so good, as far as you are concerned. But the question is: IIow do you Jews like it now? and how did you like it when Adolph Hitler, of Germany, put his thumbs down decisively on the Jews and everything Jewish in Germany?

<p><span class="font6">Answer this if you can: Where will you Jews be when an organization'similar to the Nazis gets control of the United States? Your war record will </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font6"> save you, as it did not save your brethren in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You owe an apology to Judge Rutherford and to all of Jehovah’s witnesses for your uncalled-for action. Jiidgc Rutherford has on several occasions expressed sympathy for tha downtrodden Jews in Germany and elsewhere.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Doctor Spring! How Could You?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the report of a funeral which I conducted, I was much chagrined, to see my name under the word “clergyman”. Think the word “speaker” or even “minister” would be much better. To be designated a clergyman is a characterization against which I vigorously protest. My reasons as submitted to the press were as follows:,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A “clergyman” is a professional religionist. The scribes and Pharisees were the clergymen of Jesus’ day. In His day there were thieves, robbers, adulterers and other sinners, but the most scathing denunciation that ever fell from the lips of man were the words uttered by Jesus in condemnation of the wicked clergymen of His day. Read the 23d chapter of Mattfwiw; and when doing so, &lt;substitute the word “clergymen” for the word “Pharisees” and note their appropriate application to the counterparts of our time. Now/as then, the clergymen are th^ suave, refined, sanctimonious religions leaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where there is the largest salary and the best parsonage, there, they claim, “the Lord has called” them. They are proud, haughty, arrogant, austere and hypocritical. Newspapermen have repeatedly told me that they are ever expecting prominent publicity and advertising for which they are not willing to pay. They expect a discount from the groeer, the baker, lie merchant—and for what? At public gatherings and in public places they seek the limelight and the high and prominent seats and positions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">True, there may be individual exceptions; but as. clergymen these are in bad company. Paul was a “Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee” but became a faithful servant of the Lord. The word “reverend” occurs just once in the Scriptures, and is applied to Jehovah, but clergymen use the name and apply it to themselves. They oppose the message of God's incoming Kingdom, and slander and persecute those who bear it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These “shepherds” may be pleasing to the world but, as is clearly shown in the prophecies and hj^ the words of Jesus, they are an abothination in the sight of God. Please do not list the writer as a clergyman—almost anything else would be preferable.—W. H.

<p><span class="font14">B</span><span class="font6">ATAVIA is a rather interesting little town, situated as it is, on the banks of a little river and on a mildly rolling countryside. If you should ever decide to go there you will find that there is a sign bidding you welcome. But that all depends on who you are. If you are a real Christian, one who is a faithful witness to the truth that Jesus preached when His feet trod the countryside of Palestine, then the least you can do, should you decide to go to Batavia, is to keep quiet about it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a result of the testimony given there during the special campaign two of Jehovah’s witnesses were arrested and there were several interesting things that transpired at the subsequent trial, if it really was that. One thing in particular was that the Constitution of the United States was all right in its place, but that place was not Batavia; 'and the reason is, they, have something much better there. And you will wonder what, that is. Well, believe it or not, it is an ordinance by the City of Batavia which makes it all very plain just who may or who may not knock at the door of the householder. If you wish to sell anything you must get a license, which costs $5.00 per day. It was explained that it was for the protection of the citizens of Batavia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among the important citizens of Batavia is a man who presumes to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, but whose sheep or goats will tell you that they are Lutherans. His method is to have a building of brick built with beautiful stain cd-glass windows and an imposing tower on it which looks like a miniature of the tower built by the ancient Babylonians. He has an offering of money taken up each Sunday and on various other occasions, which is all for the benefit of God, but the peculiar part of it is that somebne, somebody, gets the money that God was to get and which was contributed for that purpose with all good intent</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The interesting part of the trial, though, is that the preaching of the gospel really falls in the category of commercial enterprise. Of course, when you come to think of it, what other conclusion could you reach, when you take into consideration the way the above important citizen does it? Anyway, one corpora’ ,tion counsel, pf Batavia made it very clear to a jury of twelve men, honest and true, that they were not to consider the Constitution, but the ordinance, and that he really did believe in the Constitution himself. The thing is this, if you don’t understand it by this time, that the city of Batavia can do something the Congress of the United States cannot do; and that is, it can establish a religion and forbid the free exercise of Christianity. Now, don’t get this wrong; Batavia is in the State of Illinois, in the United States of America, and the Stars and Stripes are seen there on the 4th of July and on various other occasions. They even want to know where you were born and if you are naturalized. But here again it makes a big difference. If you are one of Jehovah’s witnesses, then it just isn’t right; but if you are one of the Lutheran sheep or goats, then it is all right, even if you do butcher the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But there is one thing that is very hard to understand; and that is, why the chief of police, the complaining witness in the case, should spend some ten minutes with the jury while they were considering the verdict and should find it necessary to lock the door from the inside. Of course, wo must believe the corporation counsel, when he says, “We do not fix juries in Batavia, like they do in Chicago, where you come from,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then, too, in case you should be arrested in Batavia, you must not tell the jury anything about the way you preach the gospel. Oh, no; what is printed on that (testimony) card is very clever sales talk, and you must not tell the jury. It is bad, too, if you don’t hire a lawyer to defend your ease: “Because of the way this case was conducted I’m not going to recommend a fine of $1Q, but a fine of $50.” Hence it would seem that what you had better do is to buy your protection from the Lutheran shepherd, and say nothing about Jehovah’s gospel, and if you should get caught worshiping The Ever-living God, then just quietly plead guilty, and it may go easy with you. Don’t forget, too, that if you should be of the opinion that the complaining witnesses are lying about you, you had better just let it pass; for, if you don’t, then a more serious charge, of perjury, will be preferred against you. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the sad part of it is, Jehovah’s witnesses don’t know when they are licked, and should</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">quit; just why they should appeal when they are found guilty and should insist on preaching the gospel of the Kingdom right in the courtroom, when the benevolent corporation counsel tells them not to, is another thing that is hard to understand. The people of Batavia, including the jury, have a right to be protected from what is in those books and from being told '‘that bricks don’t make a church”. Now, don’t think that they ■ don’t practice the “Christian (?) religion” in Batavia. They do: you couldn’t find a Bible anywhere in the courtroom, unless it should be among the literature Jehovah’s witnesses will persist in carrying with them in spite of everything.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark220"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark221"></a>Those “Fine Citizens” of Wheaton</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">R</span><span class="font6">ECENTLY some of Jehovah’s witnesses visited the people of Wheaton, Illinois. Wheaton has a sacred peddling ordinance, of which the community is very proud. They have construed that ordinance to apply to the work of preaching the gospel when literature is left with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On this occasion Jehovah’s witnesses carried no literature. They merely called on the people at their homes.and gave them opportunity to hear the Kingdom message by means of electrically transcribed lectures. They were courteously received by many of the people, and served the entire city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Members of the American Legion and of the Veterans of Foreign Wars have become imbued with the idea that they are the guardians of the city and have the right to say who may call upon the people. These so-called “patriotic organizations” have much to say about loyalty to the country, but pay little attention to their own duty to obey the law. A group of them sallied forth on this date and by the use of threats, intimidation and force tried to stop the work of ministry in which Jehovah’s witnesses were engaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They violated at least five sections of the criminal code of Illinois. They were guilty of unlawful assembly, disorderly conduct, conspiracy to violate the law, riot, and intimidation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Wheaton </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily -Journal</span><span class="font6"> commented upon this campaign, and in an article of three paragraphs published at least a dozen falsehoods. The paper described the group of Legionnaire-Veteran roughnecks as “loyal Americans and fine citizens”. The only comment </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> makes on that is to state that if you dive down in the cesspool of news-paperdom you will probably find the Wheaton </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Journal</span><span class="font6"> in the stenehy mire at the bottom.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark222"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark223"></a>* Lagrange, Georgia, Is Learning, Slowly</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH’S witnesses put themselves to a considerable amount of trouble to assist the good people of Lagrange, Georgia, to learn something of God’s Word. All who read “The Inquisition at Lagrange, Georgia”, published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> No. 467, issue of August 11, 1937, will bear witness to that fact. Over ten pages were needed to carry the simple story of what they suffered, and even then it was not all told.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Subsequently those ten pages were placed in every home in Lagrange, in each ease accompanied by a kind letter from some<sub>A</sub>Chris-tian man or woman, drawing the attention of the citizens to what had taken place, and the kind of men that have been ruling the community in the name of justice, law, truth and human decency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Letters were also sent to the officials of Lagrange and to the governor of the state of Georgia. The letters were received. The governor publicly acknowledged having received 7,000 letters in two days. They came from all sections of the United States, Canada, Mexico, and England, so said the Atlanta papers. A like number went to Mayor O’Neal of Lagrange, but no Lagrange paper had the courage to say a word on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thore were a few responses, Some' of the good people of the city said they were ashamed of what had taken place in their city. Others, a few, railed upon the courageous men and </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">consolation</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">W. A. Tyson, D.D., pastor of the First Methodist Episcopal Church, South, drew upon his imagination in his reply to one of Jehovah's witnesses when he said of the witnesses that—■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">they were fairly treated, for we saw to that, and the whole thing would have been stopped if they had been meek instead of insulting in words and acts tso that they made lawyers and others so mad we could do nothing with them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">’36, and the concensus</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">of opinion in La Grange is that a Jehovah witness started it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the cream of all the letters came in an envelope bearing the card of Fred M. Glover, chiropractor, Lagrange, Ga. The letter is unsigned, except on the typewriter, and though it' purports to be from Mr. Glover it would perhaps be unfair to him to accuse him of being its author. It stretches the imagination to believe that any man could get to be a ehiropraetor who in one letter of 53 lines could • manage to put in at least 54 errors in capitalization, 53 errors in punctuation, 19 errors in spelling, and 10 errors in grammar, or a total of 136 errors in 53 lines.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">Thomason’s pride</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">Still it may be true that Lagrange has fallen to that lowly estate where it is necessary to engage such a man as a chiropractor. The city is in bad shape and needs help. Any city that has to put up with such men as City Attorney Thomason, or Mayor O’Neal,- or Chief of Police Matthews, is in a bad way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">was punctured by the exposure which took place in Lagrange on election day. He looked one of Jehovah’s witnesses full in the face after the letters were received, and, though he knew her well, was too angry to speak. He deserved what he received, for the needless suffering he imposed on the innocent Christian men and women who went into his city with only love in their hearts for God and for the poor people held in blind- . ness and poverty by the god of this world, the Devil, and by his representatives, themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">December 20, 1937, Evelyn Phelps and Marie Porterfield called at 57 homes in Lagrange. In 37 of these they witnessed of God’s kingdom by the phonograph method ; were received most kindly; arranged for 20 back calls. When arrested, Thomason’s men were surprised to find they had no literature with them. When the police arrested Evelyn they asked her, “Where do you wish to be confined ? In a cell or on the dunghill ? That’s what you people call it.” She replied, “I’d like to have the best you have to offer to a Christian.” She was locked in a cell. After two hours’ confinement both girls were released and told to come to trial at ten o’clock the next day. Thomason postponed the case several days, absolutely without excuse, and then the girls went back to witnessing. They are finding many excellent people in the city.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">T HAD </span><span class="font6">snowed all that day and the day before and the day fiefore that, and on this late December night the drifts were piled deep. There wasn’t a sound outside—only the soft stillness of snow banks as deep and fluffy ps cotton. It wasn't snowing any more now, and though there was not even the tiniest sign of a moon, the stars were shining frosty-bright.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jane and Sally, arms about each other, trudged up the long, steep hill. From the top of this hill they could look down on the Quiet, snow-hushed town cuddled in the valley they had just left behind them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Isn’t it beautiful!” murmured Sally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“And very still,” added Jane. “The snow seems to catch every sound and bury it deep. . Even our voices are smothered in the thick silence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We’re nearly to the top.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Yes, just a few steps more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We seem closer to the stars up here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. &nbsp;&nbsp;‘ ‘ Look! the night is full of them—it seems</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">almost to be singing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Singing stars! Sounds pretty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It makes one think of the Creation. Can you imagine, Sally, what it must have been like before God created all that out there?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“I </span><span class="font6">don’t know just what you mean.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I mean, how dark and unfriendly all that space must have been with nothing in it. Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">* was when Jehovah was all alone. There were no stars, no suns, no moons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I can’t imagine it—it just doesn’t seem possible, that’s ell.” ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“But that’s exactly how it was. And now there are so many thousands of stars no one could count them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Oh, I </span><span class="font6">should think, with lots of time and care, the people who study the stars would be able finally to count them.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“But </span><span class="font6">Sally, what we can see of the stars is not all of them, by any means.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Of course, there are others in the other parts of the heavens. But I mean, couldn’t they count the ones that can be seen from one particular place </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1 ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“If we had a telescope, Sally, we could see many stars that can’t he seen with the naked </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">eye.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ '</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“You mean, from where we’re standing now?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Certainly. And on beyond them are still more stars which a stronger telescope would bring into view. And even beyond that are more and still more—stars no one has ever dreamed of.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Oh!” Sally couldn’t manage to say more than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In silence they gazed up at the stars for a while. Then Sally said, in a wee, hushed voice, “The stars are pretty bright for as small as they are.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“But they aren’t small, Sally; they’re just very far away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. “ How far ? ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Let’s see if we can explain it this way. It’s more than two hundred thousand miles to the moon. Suppose you are a little ray of light traveling from the moon to the earth. Light ' travels very fast, you know. If you were to leave the moon now, you would reach the earth before I could count one—two, the way our big clock ticks.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I can’t believe it!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;It’s true. Now suppose you are that same . ray of light traveling just as fast from one of those stars to the earth. I should have to count that way for over a hundred years before you would reach the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sally’s eyes filled with amazed tears. Finally she murmured, “How little and unimportant it makes me feel!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It makes us feel ev.en more unimportant when we know that our earth and our sun and all the distance between them could be-put inside one of those stars.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Look at that big red star. It’s larger than most of the others.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“That’s not a star, but the planet Mars, and it’s really much smaller than the stars. It is simply millions of miles closer to us. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“To think, God created aU that!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. ’ How can anyone look at th&lt;|t and say, ‘There is no God’?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HE </span><span class="font6">clear cool air of winter invites outdoor activity now, and so, befurred and mit-tened, one goes forth alone or with a companion, just to be breathing in the exhilarat-'ing freshness of outdoors. The heavy fall of snow, by the indecision of the first winter days, while it covered everything a few days ago, is now no more in evidence, but the ground is hard and firm underfoot. The mountains in the distance, are gray and barren of verdure, but the lake is not yet wholly covered &quot;&nbsp;with iee. The winding trail leads past the lake and out into the open stretches of the surrounding country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sun, which has remained hidden the greater part of the day, now breaks forth from beneath a gray cloud and sends a sudden radiance over the far-flung landscape. Then, as it is again obscured, the path of its rays may be clearly traced from heaven to earth in bands of light that stream in all directions. These gradually fade and then reappear, and so a constantly changing panorama spreads before one in light and shade, as the brow of the hill is skirted and the downward path to another lake opens to view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the day wears to a close the sun takes its parting view of earth and gradually finishes its appointed course in a radiance of coralcolored skies varied with hues of deep purple, clear azure, and a light topaz green. Gradually, yet rapidly, the light fades as the homeward path is taken. The darkly penciled outlines of empty trees contrast strikingly with the glow of the sides beyond them, as it shines forth unobstructed by anything except the delicate tracery of twig and branch, and is reflected for a time in the clear, cool waters of the lake. And now the shadows gather as with quickening step the paths are retrace^ that led one into the open country. Back in town when the last faint rays of the sun die in the west, the evening meal awaits the sharpened appetite, and thankfulness and praise pervade the grateful heart.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">EHOVAH’S witnesses throughout the world will be engaging in “His Work” on February 5-13. By “His Work” is meant the work that Jehovah is having done in the earth at this time. In the days of Noah He had Noah preach concerning the impending destruction. Today he is having the warning given to the nations of the world of the great catastrophe that will soon befall all nations. “His Work” refers to the tremendous witness that is being given concerning the establishment of God’s kingdom and the complete overthrow of the wicked arrangements that now exist throughout “Christendom”. The peoples of the earth must know who are their enemies and who are the people of good will. The people must know what true riches mean and how to obtain them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During this period, “His Work,” there will be thousands of people engaging in preaching this gospel of the Kingdom offering all with whom they come in contact the two latest books by Judge Rutherford. These bound books RICHES and ENEMIES are being offered together on a contribution of 50c. Would you like to have a part in this witness work by seeing that a few of your friends and neighbors also obtain these books, RICHES and ENEMIES, so that they too may study carefully the important truths set out in the Bible relative to the conditions now existing and their outcome ? Order two combinations, one for yourself if you do not already have it, and another for your friends.

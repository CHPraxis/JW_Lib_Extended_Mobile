<p><span class="font0">Threats of the Totalitarian Monstrosity</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Democracy of the Democracies</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">THERE is a slogan going the rounds today, “Collective Seeuri-ty”; the way to maintain peace is through Collective Security. With the idea of Collective Security no one can quarrel. It is a desire of the human race for which we are all striving in our hearts, but to say “Collective Security” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">today</span><span class="font7"> means </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font7"> and only one thing, and that is, an alliance between the democratic countries, England, France, and the United States, against the Fascist countries, Italy, Germany, and Japan. This alliance is supposed to start out by imposing economic sanctions; its more realistic proponents admit that it will end up with military sanctions. This, then, is what io meant by Collective Security today: we are asked to join in an alliance with the democracies of France and England, in order to prevent the growth of Fascism. The concerted action of these three governments wjll defend democracy and retard the aggression of the Fascist governments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let us examine in some detail just how much enamored of democracy these three countries are. Let us first of all take France-France is a democracy, that is, on the mainland, but through the vast stretches of North Africa and the more distant lands of French Indo-China the word democracy is unknown. These people are held in subjection by the French imperialists and have no say in their destiny. Do you remember with what universal condemnation and loathing the Germans were held during the World War when they bombarded and partially destroyed that monument of French art and religion, the cathedral at Rheims? Do you recall that we were especially indignant because this outrage was perpetrated upon the French, the guardian of light and culture for Europe? I am sure you remember this, but do you remember that after the war, after the world had been made </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 19, 1938 </span><span class="font7">safe for democracy and culture, the French decided they would take over the country of Syria, and in furtherance of this laudable purpose they bombed, not a cathedral, but the oldest inhabited city on the face of the earth, the city of Damascus? Do you recall that they destroyed one of the ‘holiest’ places of “Christendom”, a street in Damascus called ‘the street called Straight’ ? Even today, while Barcelona is being bombed the French will not help the legally constituted government but rather continue the farce of non-intervention and even go so far as to use the plight of the Spanish loyalists as a method of wringing concessions from the British to protect the French possessions in North Africa, also Ethiopia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then, the second country, Great Britain. Today Gread Britain is waging a war, and has been waging it for years. Not a very big war, it is true, but that is only because the people against whom she is waging it are not -able to carry on a greater struggle. I am referring to the northwestern frontier of India, where an independent and courageous people are trying to throw off the yoke of British imperialism. Do you remember one of the catch phrases of the British premier, Lloyd George, during the war, “Self determination for small nations”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was a beautiful phrase when applied to Austro-Hungary or Turkey, but it was different when applied to the hefroic Irish nation which tried to gain its freedom from 800 years of British oppression. Do you remember how Lloyd George sent into Ireland, in 1919, 1920, and 1921, regiment after regiment of vicious storm troopers known as “Black and Tans”, whose principal occupation consisted of burning a number of co-operative creameries and carrying out reprisals upon unarmed men, women, and children in retaliation for the losses which the Irish caused while fighting for Ireland’s freedom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Coming' down to date again, do you re mem -her that it was Great Britain that, imposed the farce of non-intervention upon Spain, which resulted in the rebels’ receiving all the ammunition and guns they required from Italy and Germany, while the duly elected government of Spain was refused this? Do you realize that it is this policy of Great Britain’s -which has nourished and kept alive Fascism in Spain?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And now, coming to ourselves. Let us see how much our government loves democracy. Today, in the Delaware river, boats are loaded with aerial bombs for the civilian population of Barcelona and the Chinese cities. These bombs are bought by Germany and Japan and they can be bought by any other country; that is, any other country except Spain. Do you realize that the one country in the world that, is fighting for democracy is prohibited by law from purchasing supplies in this country? Our government went so far in showing its teeth to those forces that were fighting for democracy as to especially prohibit the Spanish loyalists from purchasing supplies in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Need I recall to you how we have kept dictators in power in Central and South American countries? and did you read last week the speech of Mr. McNutt, the high commissioner of the Philippines? He stated that wc are not going to give the Philippines their independence, but that we are going to keep them as a base to protect our imperialistic interests in the Far East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What does all this mean ? Does it mean that life in England, France, and the United States is not freer, is not better thin life in Italy, Germany, and Japan? Of course not. Life is a hundred, a thousand times better in the democracies than it is in the Fascist countries. Does it mean that the people in control of the democratic countries are vicious, malicious, evil-minded? It does not. It means simply this: that any one of these nations will go to war, will enforce sanctions for only one purpose, and that is, to protect their own interests. France remained cold to Great Britain’s plea when Italy invaded Ethiopia, because her toes were not being stepped on. England remained cold when approached by France to guarantee Czechoslovakia’s independence, because her toes were not being stepped on. Wc remained cold about both Ethiopia and Spain, but were aroused by the Far East. Is there something finer about democracy in China than about democracy in Spain or Ethiopia? I think you will agree with me when I say there is not. Bui there are American investments or American spheres of influence in China where there are not. in Ethiopia or Spain, and consequently we are now preparing ourselves to defend democracy against Fascism in the Far East. Do you think for one moment that it is tenderness for the Chinese that prompts this action — the Chinese, whom we do not even respect enough to allow them to try their own cases and insist upon having our own courts in their country? The question answers itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;To sum up: Collective Security today means a military alliance between three powers who will not fight for democracy but will only tight to protect what they consider to be their interests,-—David 11. IT. Felix, Philadelphia attorney, in an address in Baltimore, Md,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Is it. true that Lewis and the C.I.O. &gt;&nbsp;are but pa.wns in that game of the president’s advisers, described by Bainbridge Colby, the distinguished secretary of state in Wilson’s cabinet, who, in 1934, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So completely has the administration turned its interest and its energies away from business recovery that it is openly charged, and indeed admitted, that a substantial number of the president’s immediate advisers are not desirous of business revival, feeling that to prolong the depression will produce a better psychological background for the prosecution of their revolutionary designs. The overturn of our institutions, including the Constitution, is their avowed goal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the C.I.O. is interested in something more than the betterment of labor has been demonstrated by its conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Michigan it not only closed factories and violated the law with impunity, defied' the law-enforcing officers, but it seized and held possession of the State capitol at Lansing, Mich., for a day, and for no other purpose than to demonstrate its power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For a like purpose, although it had a signed contract with Consumers Pmvcr Co., in the Saginaw Valley, it pulled the switches in the power plants and threw a goodly portion of the State into darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is backed by high authority. Otherwise it would not dare to defy the law-enforcing officers. — Representative Clare E. TToflmaji, Michigan, in an address in the House of Representatives in Washington. May 27, 1938. -</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Sheep Control &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">The United States is a wonderful country for societies. Organizations exist for evep<sup>r</sup> purpose of which the human mind can conceive. One of the latest is a society to study the methods by which the mass mind is moved —a society to study what we call “methods of propaganda”. This society has classified under names well understood across the Atlantic the methods adopted by propagandists to influence public opinion. There is, for example, the Name Calling device. That is the practice of calling by unpleasant names a doctrine or a proposal which the organizers wish to defeat. We should call it “slanging”. Another method is diagnosed as the Glittering Generalities device. This succeeds by the employment of phrases so brilliant that they dazzle those who possess the little learning that is dangerous. The Transfer Method involves the employment of a flag or a similar symbol to excite emotion. The Testimonial devicesis obviously the familiar one of carrying something to success by the use of a testimonial. Finally, there is the Plain Folk method, which rests on the assumption that anything' that is plain and homely is by that fact alone made glorious and worthy of acceptance. Methods are numerous and very ingenious, but examination show’s that all have the same aim. That common aim is to prevent people from examining for themselves the facts upon which they ought to judge the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Glittering Generalities blind people to the facts. The flag or symbol drags patriotism across the trail. The Testimonials create the feeling that the evidence has been examined by better minds. And the Plain Folk appeal stirs class consciousness. The great thing, you see, is to keep the mass mind from getting to grips with the evidence. That might be fatal to the purpose which the propagandist has in view. It is all very cunning, and to some folk very amusing. It is droll to see these poor sheep herded away from the pastures they pretend to seek. From the point of view of human progress, however, it is profoundly tragic—tragic because the future of humanity depends so much upon right judgment by democracy, and because democracy is so ready to be spared the exertion of thinking for itself. In that last fact lies the chief weakness of democracy. Men and w’omen “don’t w’ant to be bothered”. They can read, but they: won’t read. It is too much like work. Speeches at </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 19, 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">meetings, talks on the radio — these things, they say, are enjoyed only by the speakers. “We don’t want speeches. Cut out the talking,” is the familiar plea of people arranging social functions. So it comes about that nimble minds set out to supply democracy with readymade opinions, and to shepherd them to those folds where heads are counted .-Robert Power, in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">East Anglian Daily Times.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Questions on Fascism</span></h5>

If it corrects our institutions, why has Mussolini found it necessary to announce five times the establishment of the corporative state officially, and yet no such corporative state exists ? If it means a frank facing of facts, why is there such a tight censorship of news from Italy, so that w<sup>r</sup>e hear of the many peasant revolts and farmers’ uprisings by letter only months later? If Fascism inspires the respect of the masses of Italian people (and I have far too great faith in my own people to believe that), why does Mussolini find it important that when the people vote they vote “yes” for Mussolini on a blue ballot and “no&quot; on a pink as guards watch?—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">American Guardian. ■</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Progress- of the Racket</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ In 1918 there war; one Communist country. In 1924 there was still only one ■ in 1930 there was one; and in 1938 there probably isn’t any, because most experts think Russu is no longer Communistic. In 1918 there was no Fascist country. In 1924 there was one, Italy. Now there are Italy, Germany, Austria, Poland and Hungary. Spain probably will go Fascist, and England is virtually a Fascist country now. There is an example of real potency for you. Fascism has not suffered a single setback, and I firmly believe that when it comes to dominate Europe there will be no hope for us.—Professor John Ise, of the University of Kansas, in an address in Kansas City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Fascist Control of World</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">If the foreign policy of Great Britain, the United States and France had been directed by morons and imbeciles during the past six years, it could not have been any worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They have all been following blindly the policy of Micawber that “something would turn up”. They have been afraid to align themselves with Moscow against Fascism, fearing Communism. They have been afraid to make - agreements with Hitler and Mussolini, since every time they do they lose something. In their dilemma all they can think of to do is increase armaments; and for what? They say they do not want war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The democratic powers have acceded to every demand made upon them by the Fascist nations until if they yield another point they will “lose their shirt” and become seconder third-rate powers. All they can do now is to fight. If Hitler and Mussolini are permitted to Complete the conquest of Spain, France will be exposed to Fascist Germany on three ’ sides, rendering her helpless. It will then be an easy matter for Hitler to move on into Chechoslovakia and annex the colonies of France, bringing the French empire to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Britain will be finished also, because a Fascist Spain will make her position in the Mediterranean strategically impossible. As for Japan, she will be free to complete the conquest </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">■ of </span><span class="font7">all China, and, with those vast resources at her disposal, will be unbeatable in the Orient. The United States stands to lose what outlying possessions she has, including the Philippines, the Aleutian islands and Guam, and might eventually be at the mercy of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Japan </span><span class="font7">on the west coast. The. Soviet union would be incapable of alone combating Japan and would lose Siberia, the Ukraine and her other possessions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">turning point has come. The liberal nations must decide immediately, tomorrow, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">what </span><span class="font7">they consider worth fighting for. They </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">can continue </span><span class="font7">to accede to the demands of the Fascist countries and thus “commit suicide”. It has never happened in history that empires have given up their possessions without a ' struggle, although the past six years might seem to indicate that is what they are going to do now.—Dr. Frederick L. Schuman, pro-■ lessor of political science at Williams College, Massachusetts, in an address in Springfield, Mass. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>:</sub> '</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Patriotism by Compulsion</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ In Germany the grotesque gesture of saluting with a “Heil Hitler” on every possible Occasion has become an international joke. None suspects that the millions of Germans who under penalty of arrest mimic their loyalty to Her Fuehrer sincerely feel any devotion toward him or his policies. Theimsalute has become merely a convenient sacrifice to keeping out of jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We want none of this sort of patriotism in America. The Sincere declaration of allegiance by one citizen would mean more to us than the spectacle of thousands saluting the flag because they feared being arrested should they renege. ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Patriotism in this country, moreover, springs from the knowledge that every citizen is free to exercise his own conscience, and out of the knowledge that liberty is the first law of the land has arisen a spirit of national devotion that can never be emulated in countries where saluting the flag is nothing more than complying with the law. Under such a system the flag salute becomes very much like keeping on the right side of the road or observing the parking limit. We prefer to think of patriotism as something deeper than such compulsory obedience of law.

<p><span class="font7">♦ No one knows now whether our Government will endure. There come times when the ledger must be balanced. This is the hour in which the American people must answer as to their capacity for self-government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I like to look to Virginia, where, a decade before the Constitution of the United States, Virginia had her bill of rights. The time has come when you young citizens must demonstrate that you are worthy of your ancestry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Listen to me. Do you think that I have come down here just to make a speech ? I tell you I was never more serious in my life. We live in an hour when we must decide whether we will wear the yoke of a dictator or stand as free men on Virginia soil. I have seen too many States bargaining away their privilege of government at Washington. There is entirely too much Federal legislation today.— Representative Hatton W. Sumners, of Texas, in an address at Richmond,</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>The League Dances</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">THE last assembly of the League of Nations was presided over by the Indian delegate, the Aga Khan, reputed to be the world’s richest man. This potentate did his best</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">to give some life to the conference. But vain effort. Even‘the presence of this man, whose fortune is reckoned in millions, was not sufficient to dispel the uneasiness which hung over the palace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘‘Commence your proceedings, gentlemen,” said he to the delegates. But none was able to deliver his farcical speech with the'customary ease. The envoys from Spain and China were the only ones among all those present whose voices raised an echo. The first had rather a large audience. His observations, however, disturbed his colleagues to such an extent that, for fear of hearing the representative of China reveal even more disturbing truths, they preferred to retire to their luxurious hotels or to stifle their consciences in the pleasure resorts of Geneva. With broken heart the unhappy Chinese delegate spoke before almost empty benches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Spanish representative in his concluding remarks had said; “Open your eyes, gentlemen. It is no longewmerelv a question of the fate of my country. The future of Europe is being decided on Spanish soil.” But there was no sign of reaction on the part of his audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then the delegate from China also dwelt on the peril which threatens humanity in the Far East, but his few auditors were no longer paying attention. Already in other halls preparations were being made to brighten up this . mournful assembly. The Aga Khan, in his capacity as president of the illustrious company, wished to carry out an act of brilliance that would be worthy of figuring prominently in the annals of the institution of Geneva. He therefore organized at the Palace of the League a banquet for two thousand guests, of whom sixty were ministers on active service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Association of the Friends of the League of Nations protested energetically against this mad enterprise, but the Aga Khan would not give way. He even refused to accede to the wish of the delegates from Spain and China, who requested him to at least abandon the idea of the ball, because of the miseries of their countries. In case the dancing were vetoed, he would immediately order the banquet from one of Geneva’s wealthiest hotels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is understood that such a festivity is a windfall for the coffers of the League. So, as the secretary took good care not to forego it, what was the use of protestation ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The most famous chefs from Paris came to feverishly prepare this banquet under the direction of the millionaire Hindu’s “chef de cuisine”. After the guests had partaken of the choicest dishes, all kinds of delicate and expensive dessert were served,.and two thousand bottles of champagne were opened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The electric lusters were draped in gold, thousands of yards of green silk adorned the walls, fifteen thousand roses and as many carnations decorated the halls and the tables, and on the inlaid floors were spread the most magnificent carpets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fourteen of the finest European orchestras played joyous music without cessation; and forgotten were the cries of distress of the Spanish and Chinese populations, bombarded by the “civilizing” forces of their enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The revelers gave themselves up to dancing and carousing until morning. Fifteen doctors and forty nurses were on the spot to look after those who were overcome by the orgy. Oh, they were magnificent, those representatives to whom the poor people had entrusted their fate! and incidentally the orgy cost the Aga Khan half a million Swiss francs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This banquet reminds us of the old-time feast which Belshazzar, king of Babylon, gave to the thousand lords of his kingdom. After well partaking of wine, and in order to reproach the God of the Hebrews, the monarch commanded that the vessels of gold and silver, which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, should be brought forward so that his lords, his wives and his concubines might drink therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And while they were drinking, mysterious humanlike fingers wrote on the white wall of the royal palace the words, “Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin.” Seeing this, the Sacred Narrative says, “the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Daniel, the prophet of God, explained to the shaken king that the words meant “Num</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">bered, weighed and divided”, saying, “God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. . . . Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. . . . Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.” In that same night was Belshazzar slain, and Darius the Mede took the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same judgment has been pronounced agairftt the League of Nations. Although its acts are an abomination to the Lord, this worldly organization has been described as “the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth”. Soon it will perish in the battle of Armageddon, together with all the Devil’s institutions, after which Christ will establish, according to the Divine method, the true league of nations, making one country of all the earth. And then will be banished for ever wars, profiteers, misery, tyrants, kings, ministers, Aga Khans, and every authority but that of Christ Jesus, earth’s rightful Ruler.—Translated from the French edition of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>The League God’s Kingdom?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ In January, 1919, shortly before the League of Nations scheme was brought to completion, the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America boldly sponsored it as ‘the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth’. In view of the foregoing article, “The League Dances,” the significance of this eager approval of a league of selfish nations is readily seen. Some who were not connected with the Federal Council of Churches could see the thing in its true light, and said, “It is true that the darker forces of the world triumphed at Paris when the unjust treaty of peace was written.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the professed Christian church said, </span><span class="font6">officially: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The time has come to organize the world for truth, right, justice and humanity. To this end as Christians we urge the establishment of a League of Free Nations at the coming Peace Conference. Such a league is not merely a peace expedient; it is rather the political expression of the kingdom of God on earth. The League of Nations is rooted in the gospel. Like the gospel, its objective is “Peace on earth, good will toward men.” Like the gospel, its appeal is universal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The heroic dead will have died in vain unless out of victory shall come a new heaven and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. — 2 Peter 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The church can give a spirit of goodwill, without which no League of Nations ean endure,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this manner the unfaithful churches looked to scheming politicians and diplomats to establish the world in righteousness, and hoped to see the fruit of righteousness spring from a carnage such as the world had never before witnessed! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And the Roman Hierarchy wanted a seat in the League. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Some of the League Withdrawals</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Some of the League of Nations withdrawals are Germany, Austria, Japan, Brazil, Paraguay, and the five Central American nations, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Salvador and Nicaragua. Oddly enough, Guatemala, Salvador and Honduras are as thick with Japan and Germany as peas in a pod; and one can readily catch the impression that the lot of them think what a great excitement it would make in the world if they should decide to try to take over the Panama canal. And it would, too.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Lloyd George Pans the League</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ This is the fundamental fact, that the body that was set up with common consent, including Germany, Italy and Japan, for the purpose of insuring peace in the world, has been east aside. This great body has been stricken with palsy, its right side paralyzed, its right arm withered, its voice feeble, indistinct, gibbering, lying huddled on its couch in its great palace at Geneva, no longer consulted, no longer even alluded to.—Lloyd George, at a speech in Westminster.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ With Germany, Austria, Italy, Japan, Brazil, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras and Salvador out of the -League of Nations, and all of them either openly Fascist or inclined that way, it is quite apparent that another I.eague of Nations is under way. Ethiopia is still in the League of Nations though itself no longer has any existence. Uncle Sam never got in.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Despite its manifest failure “Reverend” J. Bruce Hunter, B.D., D.D., LL.D., of Montreal, Canada, in an address at London, Ontario, declared that the League of Nations is—</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the visible spirit of Jesus Christ, expressing his will concerning nations and people; the greatest thing which has come into the world since Pentecost.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Rules of Machiavelli,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Italian Statesman (1469-1527)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“1- Look eut for your own interests”: Machiavelli was morally </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">MgMn. </span><span class="font7">blind. He failed to see the world as a unit. Might was right; there-f<sub>orC)</sub> fj<sub>ie</sub> strong must always assert their strength and make laws for their </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">own </span><span class="font7">protection against the weak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“2. Honor nobody but yourself”: Advance the interests of others so long as you can make good use of them! But the moment they threaten to become popular, kill them! for an ambitious man can afford to have no rivals. All the rest must be slaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“3. Do evil, but pretend to do good”: He sincerely believed in the value of insincerity. He frankly advised statesmen never to be frank. In order to preserve his power, and plunder, it is often necessary for a diplomat to act in opposition to justice, charity, and good faith. Yet his subjects must not be aware of this. In other words, a successful ruler should make his subjects believe he is protecting them at the very moment he is crushing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“4. Covet, and get, whatever you can”: Have no regard for the rights of others; plunder all you can, and silence those who make complaints. Rob the weak but be aware of the strong; and at all times try to appear liberal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“5. Be miserly”: Machiavelli advises his </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">pro</span><span class="font7">teges to save their own money and to spend the money of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“6. Be brutal”: Only a brute, he writes, can succeed in ruling his people. Goodness </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">never </span><span class="font7">pays. A prince should stifle the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">man in </span><span class="font7">him and develop the beast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“7. </span><span class="font7">Cheat whenever you get the chance”: </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font7">advises his prince to cultivate the ferociousness of the lion and the cunning </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of the fox. </span><span class="font7">Force is greater than justice, and fraud more powerful than truth. Do not bother about keeping your promises, for nobody does, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">most men are stupid, and the world is always ready to be fleeced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“8. Kill your enemies, and, if necessary, your friends,” in order to attain your goal. Murder is but a means to an end, and the betrayal of a friend an accepted rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">_ “9. Use force rather than kindness, in dealing with others’-’: It is better to be feared than to be loved. When you have seized a</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">state, or robbed a man, you must inflict all your injuries at once, so that they will soon be forgotten. If you must confer benefits, confer them little by little, so that they will be long remembered, but try to avoid conferring them altogether. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“10. Think of nothing but war”: Wat is to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be the </span><span class="font7">chief business of the superbrute. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">‘For </span><span class="font7">war is the sole art looked for in one who rules.’ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In time </span><span class="font7">of peace he should prepare himself for war.—By a prominent educator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A “Comic Election”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ A </span><span class="font7">man in Italy who does not wish his identity revealed discloses in The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Spectator</span><span class="font7"> that in his part of the country a lad was thrown into jail for calling a Mussolini election a </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“comie </span><span class="font7">election”. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">hotel proprietor, who set a good table, failed because his guests who were Fascist officials did not pay their bills. He is now a waiter and his family is in straits. The new owners of a textile mill were about to open with a skeleton staff when they were given a list of 20 inexperienced persons for whom they must find jobs; they did, and failed. A farmer had his farm taken away under pretext that he was not working it to the best advantage. Another hotel proprietor was ordered to have an orchestra; he did, and went broke. America is on the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Trying to Sell Himself</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ AH dictators constantly try to sell them</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">selves </span><span class="font7">to the people over whom they temporarily hold control; they want to keep their jobs as long as possible. This is true of Stalin, Hitler, Franco, Mussolini and others that are either dictators now or are denying that they aspire to be dictators, which is always a necessary step just before the actual seizure of power takes place. Mussolini is one of the biggest of these big windbags. He recently had much to say of Italy’s 9,000,000 soldiers, powerful submarine fleet, eight first-line battleships, reconnoitering and bombing planes, etc. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">gentleman forgets something. He forgets the cool, determined, fearless, perfectly-trained </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">man </span><span class="font7">behind the gun. Mussolini is an ass with a loud voice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ In </span><span class="font7">Italy, in November, 1937, gasoline was selling at approximately 66c per gallon. -This </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font7">after a 40-pereent increase in the taxes </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">heretofore laid upon </span><span class="font7">it.</span></p>

The commonest type of hut is ten feet by eight, </span><span class="font6">with </span><span class="font7">perhaps no window’, and the doorway so low and small that one has to bend in order to enter.

But it seems to make little impression on those responsible for the administration of the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the poor worker who deserves one’s unqualified sympathy and support. Yesterday I found at the gates of a big mill stalwart Kabuli money-lenders with “lathis” (big sticks) waiting for their victims as they came out with their wages. The ordinary rate of interest is 150 percent, and no worker will dare to evade the moneylender. It is a common feature, it seems, in all Cawnpore mills, though the Government of India has passed a series of measures within the last two years to protect the indebted worker from being thus harassed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The employers complain about the low efficiency of the worker. The wonder is that he can work at all under these terrible conditions, with no provision for leave or sickness. Day and night the machines hum and the employers make enormous dividends; but for the worker there is no escape.—Manchester </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ In some parts of India the poor Untouchables may not own even a dog. If the shadow of an Untouchable falls over the food of a high-caste Hindu the food is thrown away.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom Privileges in Near East </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">{Continued from No. 497, page 14') </span><span class="font7">♦ This Syrian priest further told me that he was going to free himself from the yoke of that devilish organization. That surely did my heart good. Even though our feeble efforts sometimes do not seem to do much good, as long as we are faithful and obedient and perform our duties Jehovah will give the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It seemed every time 1 turned I saw the streets [of Palestine] filled with nuns, priests and other Catholics. They seemed to be everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I had previously brought two pioneers with me from Beirut to Palestine. The two pioneers and I took fourteen cartons of books and went to work. Wc covered the cities of Haifa, Jaffa, Nazareth, Tiberias, Ramallah, Jerusalem and Tarshiha. We surely were blessed in our efforts and left a large number of books and booklets and found many people who were eager to hear the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By the way, the Armenian priest whom I had met the year before and with whom I had- placed some literature had been inquiring about me at the home of a German witness who was formerly a pioneer, so 1 made it my business to call on him. He told me how happy he was .to have the truth, and that when he took the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font7"> he kept it in the slip cover of his pillow. One of the nuns discovered it one day and reported it to the arch-, bishop. Of course, the priest was put on the carpet and warned to burn the book or be kicked out. So he requested his back pay and told the archbishop that he would rather lose his job than give up the book. In fact, lie took, off his garments and threw thefn into the face of the archbishop, stating that.he was glad he was at last dressed like a man and free from bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then I proceeded to Bethlehem, and on my way I had to pass a large Latin monastery and 1 was instructed to detour, and I saw a large body of soldiers. After returning from Bethlehem I went to the radio station at Jerusalem and endeavored to buy time so that we could put on a program. Mr. Frey, who was the manager, informed me that he was Sorry he could not give me any time. I insisted on knowing the reason for his refusal to give me time, and he then opened up and told me that they had discovered several million rounds of ammunition and hundreds of thousands of rifles packed in piano boxes and stored at the monastery; and this accounted for the British soldiers that I had seen, as they had confiscated this large amount of arms and ammunition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When another witness and myself worked the city of Tiberias we called on the Gentile homes and were able to leave </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font7"> and six booklets in almost every home. We ran out of literature in two days. While I was in this city I ran across the metropolitan of the Greek Catholic Church and gave him the witness. He warned me not ro try to tell him about the Kingdom, because he knew all about it. He became very indignant and put his hand in his pocket and handed me a $5 note. Naturally, I left the literature with him, gave him his change, and urged him to read the literature. This city is a beautiful place situated many hundreds of feet below sea level and it has the finest hot springs found anywhere. I could not help but remember that ' the Lord Jesus, together with His disciples, visited this famous city on many different occasions, and I thanked Jehovah for having the opportunity to walk over the same spot where Jesus was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then we went to the city of Ramallah, where, working two days with five other witnesses, we were able, to place 140 books and 480 booklets and also placed one entire set of the [recorded lecture] series of “Religion and Christianity” and a set of “Exposed” as well, and one phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">IN GREAT EEBANON</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Tripoli company has distributed the records I left with them. The pioneer witnesses over there have to cover their territory by foot — sometimes spending three to four hours going to and from their territory each day, which time, of course, they cannot apply on their reports. One pioneer witness carried the publications on his baek and witnessed in towns and villages. He did not have any money, but wherever he went the people were glad to give him food and lodging, as well as take literature and make some contribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Owing to the terrible economic conditions in that country, the Syrian pound has dropped to less than 70c in American money. In other words, today the piaster is worth less than one-half cent, and it is ordinarily worth five cents or more. Since the Syrian pound is backed by the French franc and the franc today&quot; is worth less than two and three-fourth cents in American money, it is very difficult for the witnesses to return sufficient money to cover the cost of the publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is now my pleasure to give you some of my experiences with the sound car. The people in these countries, of course, have never seen a ear equipped with broadcasting facilities. The first town we visited was called Enfie and which has a population of about 5,000.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Transcript.ii&gt;a lecture, Copenhagen, Denmark</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">It is situated on the sea coast. There are five witnesses in this town who are really charged with the real of Jehovah,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We parked the car in a cemetery which overlooks the town proper, and started the program with a musical number: “Hear Me, 0 People!” We then put on the series of “Religion and Christianity”. The entire population of the town was so surprised they thought that Gabriel had blown the last trumpet. They tried to traee the voice, and when they found it was coming from the cemetery they were really convinced that the resurrection had begun. They were afraid to come to the cemetery&quot; at first, but when thousands of people began, to gather some got the courage to come a little nearer and we were able to place a large number of books and booklets with them and they invited us to come again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every day we had experiences of a similar nature. We took town after town by surprise. The people were eager to hear the message, and in some instances we were forced to put on the records again and again. We made on an average five or six towns a day and our little group of workers called at the homes of the people, placing a large amount of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At one place called Kisba, Alkora, we covered this town with about twenty workers and the sound equipment. It is situated on an elevation of almost six thousand feet above sea level, overlooking the most, fertile soil on earth and the largest olive groves found anywhere. We started to blast with the sound equipment, using the “Exposed” lectures and finishing with reading out of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon</span><span class="font7"> booklet. The entire town came out ami we placed an enormous amount of literature, the people showing keen interest in the message. The following night a tornado struck that entire district, uprooting hundreds of olive trees, destroying homes and killing many farmers and beasts. Satan at all times tries to bring injury and harm to honest people, so they can be made to reproach and blaspheme Jehovah’s name. Truly, the people thought Armageddon had come when they began to count the damage the next day. Two weeks later -we visited the towni again and the people were troubled and fearful. We put on the lecture “Peace Messengers” and comforted them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We covered the entire district of Alkora and practically all of Lebanon with the sound equipment. The people received the message gladly. They are greatly perplexed and the conditions are terrible. The people are very much dissatisfied with the governments, and especially with the yoke which has been placed upon them by their religious leaders. In Syria and Lebanon the two main branches of the Devil religion are the Roman Catholic and Mohammedan. I was surprised to learn, after visiting scores of Mohammedan towns with nothing but Mohammedan population, how the entire community came out as one man, showing interest in the message. Many were glad to contribute for the literature even though they were poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Five workers, including myself, visited a town north of Tripoli called Minna. It has a population of about eight thousand people. We started with the lecture ‘'Exposed”, and when we had the second record on the priest came running down with a staff in his hand and'looking as though ready to kill someone. He stood before the loud-speaker and shouted; “Stop, I tell you!” The witness who was operating the equipment turned on more juice when he saw what the priest was doing, and drowned out his voice; but this made him more angry than ever. Not being satisfied with trying to pick a fight with us, calling US everything he could think of, he turned to the people and started cursing them and told them if they were intelligent they would not listen to us and that they were Christians and not Mohammedans and that we ought to go to the Mohammedans with our message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people tried to reason with him, but he would not listen. He came and ordered me to stop and I took the microphone </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">asked the people if they wanted to hear </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">remainder of the program and, if </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">so, to sig</span><span class="font7">nify by raising their right hand. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Hundreds </span><span class="font7">of people responded and ordered </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">thfs priest </span><span class="font7">to leave, and when he </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">refused they carried </span><span class="font7">him away and were ready to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">dump him Into </span><span class="font7">the river. A half hour later he </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">returned and </span><span class="font7">the people again ordered him to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we finished with the “Exposed” lectures they asked us if we had anything else, and we gave them the entire series of “Religion and Christianity” and placed many pieces of literature with them. On our way out this priest had gotten some of his henchmen and they lay in wait for us, hardly leaving room for the automobile to pass through. Some were armed with hatchets, some with </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">axes, some </span><span class="font7">with Clubs and some with </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">guns. They stood </span><span class="font7">■with their arms upraised ready to strike </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">us, </span><span class="font7">but Jehovah withstood them and it seemed they could not move their arms. We passed through unharmed and very thankful for the loving protection that Jehovah had given us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The entire four months were spent with the sound equipment, working around fourteen hours a day, and in some instances we did not get through with the lectures until </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">eight </span><span class="font7">or ten o’clock at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In one town where the archbishop lives </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7">his palace we put on the lectures. He </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font7">walking in his garden in his lace petticoat, and when he heard the message he thought it was a voice from heaven and he rushed to the house and started running from one room to another. The people said he had told them he surely thought Armageddon was near, and he ordered several gendarmes to come and stop us. However, when they came, we gave them the testimony and instead of harming us they went back with some of the literature. —Joseph E. Rahal, Ohio.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ “You know, there is a radio station in Brooklyn that broadcasts the most unusual Stuff. At six-thirty practically every morning of the week I tune to 1300 kilocycles for Morning Worship. Why do I want to listen to a radio that early in the morning 1 Well— er—that is, a man has to wake up Sometime!

<p><span class="font7">♦ Reverend Harris, St. Andrews Church, Carshalton, England, has no doubt been making mistakes all his life, but one of his biggest ones was&quot; made when he warned his congregation against Jehovah’s witnesses. With that, 105 publishers entered his bailiwick, called on all the people the vicar could reach, and more, too, brought the vidars remarks to the attention of the people, told the people to listen to records explaining the truth, which they did, an,d incidentally left more than 3,000 pieces of literature behind. The vicar was called on, too (a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Cure</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font7">having been mailed to him in advance).

<h5><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>President Isaacs Was Right</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ When Stanley M. Isaacs, borough president of Manhattan, was invited to address 1,750 members of the Jewish Teachers Association, he'aecepted the invitation and told the teachers he could see no reason for the existence of their organization. And he was right. Publicschool teachers should not make their religion a test for themselves, their pupils, the public or anybody else. Let them keep the rabbis, the priests, the popes and the elergy out of it and attend to their own business, which is teaching the children the mundane things a child needs to know. If their parents want the children taught religion, let it be taught to them elsewhere, at the parents’ expense.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>Score One for Doctor Godfrey</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Score one for Dr. Edward S. Godfrey, Jr,, New York state commissioner of health. Having learned something about serums, and seen for himself that their use, to say the very least, has not been an unmixed blessing to humanity, he advises his fellow physicians against rushing pell-mell into the use of the new rabbit serums in the treatment of pneumonia “until careful tests [on the unsuspecting public] have proved their value, safety and limitations”. It should be added that the new rabbit serum was tried out last year on 15,000 CCC “volunteers”.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>New York Legislative Service</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Lawyers and others find interest in the unique enterprise established by about fifteen college boys somewhere in New York city, of telling customers what particular knavery is back of any legislation pending at Albany. The service is -said to be nonpartisan and plays no favorites. It seems like a fine outlet for honest and energetic young men who wish to learn something and do something for the benefit of their fellow men. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>Saved by an Hour</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Nine families were saved from 75-year-old tenements on Avenue C, New York city, only ■an hour before they collapsed and fell in ruins. The tenants fled with their clothing, but were barred by the police from trying to save their furniture and other belongings. New York is two decades behind Britain in its rebuilding program.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>Adult Authorities Needed</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ If a man decides that his religion compels him to shoot every red-headed pedestrian on Fifth Avenue, there are enough laws to prevent him from carrying out his determination. No religious conviction ean be alloWed expression when its expression involves harm to others. But where the issue is so highly theoretical as in the flag case, the authorities Should be a little more tolerant and a little more adult. It is insistence on such formal patriotism as this that brings patriotism itself into mockery and breeds patrioteers instead of patriots. We are saddened to see that the New York Staid Department of Education is expelling Jehovah’s witnesses for non-saluting. A test case should be brought here. Expulsion is not the way to teach patriotism and love of country.—New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Post.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ The WPA is doing a good work in New York city and other places educating the foreign-born. Of New York city’s 264,000 illiterates, 242,000 are foreign-born. It was hoped in the first half of 1937 to have at least 25,000 of these in classes. Of the 12,223 in classes at last report, one student was 83 years of age. Some of the classes are held in homes where the parents cannot conveniently get out. In most instances instruction is welcome.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>Good for New York! -</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Good for New York! In New York city a German boy, a Nazi, accused of carrying a concealed weapon, was defended by a Jewish lawyer before an American war veteran, and found not guilty. The court decided that he had a right to carry his knife as a part of his uniform. The American on the bench got a big kick out of his share in upholding American law and American common sense under the unusual conditions presented.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Gradually Folding Up</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ One of the first Episcopal churches in western New York, the St. James Episcopal church of Buffalo, folded up on April 17, 1938, after an existence of 84 years. The membership had dwindled until the survivors thought it not worth while to try to keep the olir ship afloat. The pastor will now have to go to work for a living. Sad.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Bazaar Did Not Get the Diamond</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Harpers Bazaar calling attention to a special issue of their magazine, delivered what they supposed were homing pigeons to 100 prospective advertisers in New York city. Each pigeon had an aluminum tube attached to its leg. The advertiser was supposed to release the pigeon, which would then fly back to Harper’s. Marcus &amp;&nbsp;Company, jewelers, were enthusiastic over this original advertising scheme. To show their appreciation they sent Harper’s a small unmounted diamond in the aluminum tube, ft just so happened that that particular pigeon was not, a homer; for it never showed up. Somewhere that pigeon, like some tion-eleet Presbyterian, is wandering through the skies not knowing where he will land, or what kind of reception he will get when he lands, or who will get the diamond.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Studies in courtesy conducted by the department of sanitation, New York city, indicate that Brooklynites are more polite than New Yorkers, boys are more polite than girls, the poor are more polite than the rich, and the Chinese are the most polite, with Italians, French, Japanese, Trish and Americans in the order named. The question was conducted among school children of ages 6 to 18, of every race, color and condition of society'.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Another honest man has been found, this time in New York city. He is a colored man, originally from South Carolina, a taxicab driver. Mr. Casey (that is the gentleman’s name) was laid up in the hospital from February 14 to March 28, and during that time his family received help from the city to the amount of $49.10. Now he is back on his feet, wants to have the relief stopped, and wants to know to whom he can return the money. He got some relief money years ago, and when he tried to find out how to pay it back he could not get any information ; so this time he swore out a statement of what he owed and mailed it to the city treasurer. He thinks he might need relief again sometime ; and if he should, we wants the city to know he is honest. The city knows it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Tt is calculated that when the highway tunnel under New York city is completed about 11,000,000 automobiles a year will be taken off the streets of the big city, with an immense saving in time for car owners driving between Long Island and New Jersey points, and the streets of the city will be safer and more free from deadly carbon monoxide. Incidentally, it. is less than forty years since the first man that drove a “horseless carriage” in a park in the big city was arrested for disorderly conduct. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■■</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>Religious Service</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE North-German Lloyd steamship company advertises in its folder that it has erected on its ships “altars for religious service during the ocean voyage. These altars are so arranged that they can be used by Catholics, Protestants or Jews”, This is further corroborative and very strong proof that the services indulged in on these ships are not to the honor of Jehovah God, but rather to the dishonor of His name. Mark this fact, that this provision for religious service is made by the Nazis who hate the name of Jehovah God and viciously persecute and imprison men and women who speak the name of Jehovah and who have in possession the Bible and books explaining the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Their advertisement says: “The officiating clergyman of whichever denomination he may be will find all the necessary vestments, requisites, etc?’ Those who indulge in “pure and holy worship”, as defined in the Scriptures, never use vestments. On the contrary, such vestments, as shown by the Bible, are used only by those who indulge in the practice of Baal, meaning Devil religion. As a striking example: Those opposers of God who indulged in Baal worship assembled at a point in Palestine and “vestments for all that worship Baal* were brought forth, and they put on these vestnients, and when they were thus dressed with their vestments Jehovah God sent His executioner in and killed every one of them, because they were indulging in the practice of Devil or Baal religion.—2 Kings 10:21 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Jesus was on earth the Jewish priests, who had covenanted .to do God’s will, turned away from obeying God’s commandments and indulged in religion, which Jesus told them was of the Devil. (John 8; 44; Matthew 23: 6-35) Men wear vestments and practice religion before altars, prepared for that purpose to be seen erf meh; and concerning such Jesus used these words: ‘“But all their works they do for to be seen of men; they make broad their phy-</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 19, 1038 </span><span class="font7">lacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi,” and father, and reverend. (Matthew 23:5-7) Phylacteries are frontlets worn on the head, made of strips of parchment, on which were written certain words to be seen of others. Similar thereto clergymen, particularly of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, who practice at such altars as advertised by the aforesaid steamship company, wear peculiar hats on their heads, and also vestments, so that people may be able to recognize them and call them “Father”, “Rev- , erend,” or some other high-sounding name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The aforementioned advertisement by the steamship company to aid religious services shows that religion, politics and commerce ' are closely allied together, with the avowed purpose of ruling and controlling this world. The steamship company is not trying to worship God or make any arrangement for His worship; but they hold forth this heathenish religious practice to overawe the people and afford the clergy an opportunity to rake in the shekels and thus carry’ on their racket. Reasonable and sensible persons see the absurdity of such practice, and they know that there, is no sincerity connected with it, that the same is not done to honor God and Christ Jesus, but rather to dishonor Them; and this is further proved by the fact that the Nazis have made this arrangement for their religious allies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the performance of what the afore-mentioned advertisement designates “the conduct of religious service”, the officiating clergyman goes through a senseless ceremony and often utters words in a foreign language that no one present understands, and such is done to impress the people of his ‘goodness and greatness’. It is no wonder that Jesus referred to ’ such as hypocrites. Those men utter what they call prayers, but their prayers never get out even from the top of the ship, and certainly they nevef reach to the throne of heaven. These “officiating clergymen” repeat their “prayers”, so called, over and over again, hoping by such means to put them across and get them even out of the ship. How ridiculous this whole matter appears to the Lord, and how nauseating it is to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, is indicated by what Jesus said to His faithful disciples with reference to prayer. Said Jesus: “And when thou pray-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">est, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when .thou praycet, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not Vain repetitions, as the heathen do; for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking, Be not ye therefore like unto them; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him/’—Matthew 6: 5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus it is seen that Jesus denounces such religious practice as hypocritical, performed to be seen of men; and this stamps with con’ elusive proof that the altars advertised in the Nazi ships are there for the purpose of helping religionists to carry on their racket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hypocrites are an abomination and despi* cable in the sight of the Lord, and hence they are doers of evil. The Lord so states. (Matthew 24 :48-51) Do the prayers of these hypocrites get out of the top of the ship and reach the Lord? The apostle Peter, who was a true follower of Christ Jesus and therefore a true worshiper of God, answers: “Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles; that, whereas they speak against you as evil doers, &gt;&nbsp;they may by your good works, which they ' shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.”—1 Peter 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is stated that these altars are for the cjnvenienee of any and all clergymen, regardless of the denomination. The Jews hate the name of Jesus, and refuse to worship Him, and therefore when the Jewish 'Mbbi uses the altar/ he has to turn it around’and use the other side. It would appear, then, that when the Catholic clergyman uses it, he would have to sprinkle a lot of ‘holy water’ on the altar to remove the objectionable things piit there by the Jews, and when it comes to the Protestant preacher he would have to close his eyes to all. The whole matter appears so absolutely ridiculous that any sensible person ean see that religious practice indulged in, like that described by the advertisement above mentioned, is a dishonor to God and to Christ Jesus, and should be avoided by all those who love righteousness and who want to go in the right way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Recently the Hierarchy’s alliance with Nazism has been exposed by this and kindred publications, and now the Hierarchy, the pope and the public press are trying to camouflage their position by publishing in America that the pope is against Nazism and Fascism. By so doing they fool some of the credulous Catholic population all the time, and thereby hold them in subjection.'The statement of Abraham Lincoln, however, is certainly appropriate here: “You can fool some of the people all the time, and all the people some of the time, but you can’t fool all the people all the time.” The time is here for the people to get their eyes open to the crookedness and hypocrisy of the religious racketeers. Sincere men will see that their hope must be centered only in Jehovah Cod and His kingdom under Christ Jesus. The people of good will will readily turn away from religion and become true Christians by being obedient ta Jehovah’s commandments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A noisy ghost; a spirit assumed as the explanation of rappings and other unexplained noises,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Bible account of a case of poltergeist follows, but dictionary-makers have fallen under the influence of the clergy and hence have no faith in the Bible, and their definitions suffer on that account. Poltergeist is nothing less than physical manifestations of unseen spirits, demons, devils, if you please.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Blue Island, Illinois, 18 persons undertook to find out why beds carefully made in their presence were all tumbled up and the pillows thrown on the floor as soon as the door was closed.

<p><span class="font7">carefully locked. The newspapers did not know how to explain it, the preachers did not knowhow to explain it; and yet see how simple it is to explain such a phenomenon when one reads and believes the Word of God:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And when he name to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them. And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed; and running to him, saluted him. And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them? And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit. And wheresoever he takcth him, he teareth him; and he foameth, and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away; and I spake to thy disciples, that they should east him out; and they could not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He answereth him, and saith, 0 faithless generation! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? Bring him unto me. And they brought him unto him: and-~4ien he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming. And be asked his father, How long is it since this eame unto him? And he said, Of a child : and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: hut if thou cans! do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us, Jesus said unto him, If thou eiuist believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead. But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose. And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately. Why could not we east him out? And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting.—Mark 9: 14-29.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ Chicago bookkeepers arc in a class by themselves. They have to juggle the figures of their employers so that they will tell one story to the Federal government and another to the county assessors, and this requires great ability, especially since the county assessor now has access to the Federal income tax returns. Westbrook Pegler tells, how one Chicago concern, reporting, in one kind of bookkeeping, no property at all in 1936, had $414,000 worth, in another kZnd of bookkeeping, the next year. And a second concern that, in one kind of bookkeeping, had $857 worth in 1936, had $2,746,000 worth, in another kind of bookkeeping, a year later. Wherever a railroad or highway enters the city of Chicago a huge signboard should be erected bearing the cheerful slogan, “Abandon honesty, all ye who enter here.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">(Confinwed </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">from No. 497, page 28)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Says Miss J, M. C. Toynbee in a letter to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New Statesman,</span><span class="font7"> November 2, 1935:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Up to the present, the Church in Italy has enjoyed liberty of conscience and of action under Fascism which it would undoubtedly he deprived of if Communism or anti-clerical liberalism gained power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In plain words this would mean that Pope Pius XI reasoned as follows: The Lateran accord of 1929 had wed the fate of the Catholic Church to Fascism. If Mussolini were to fail in his Ethiopian venture and if a liberal government were to replace Fascism, the Chureh would lose all the privileges gained through the concordat. The Church in Italy might even suffer the fate it has suffered in Russia, Mexico and Spain,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is the only and true reason <sup>lor</sup> ^<sup>ie</sup> P<sup>(,</sup>P<sup>C</sup>’<sup>S</sup> attitude; it implies that whenever it will be called upon to choose between justice and peace on one hand and special privileges for the Chureh on the other, he will choose the latter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our Catholics, unable to use the only good explanation which was not true, nor the true one which was not good, insisted that the pope had maintained his neutrality throughout. Apart from the fact that this statement is at variance with truth, it is an indictment of the “shepherd and master” who ha,d closed his lips while a. moral problem was troubling the conscience of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The archbishop of Westminster undertook to prove that “neutrality” was not only inevitable for the pope, but also the only justifiable course. He refers to the pope as a defenseless old man entirely at the mercy of his neighbors. Can there be a more dishonorable defense ? To think that the pope would abandon his duty to “guide and to instruct'’ simply because he was menaced by Mussolini’s Fascist hordes 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But even this argument does not hold water. The same Pope Pius XI during the conflict with Mussolini did not hesitate to publish encyclicals directed against II Duce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To the question of how the pope eould remain neutral “in the present case when a great power was preparing to perpetrate the greatest injustice by attacking a weaker nation without cause and in violation of solemn agreements”, a Jesuit Father in America offered up this feeble justification: “The pope is intent upon finding a way to end this war as quiekly as possible. If he were a judge instead of a ‘pacifier’, peace would be delayed much longer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many people believe that Mussolini has destroyed the edifice of international good will when he violated the covenant of the League of Nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With this view we cannot agree. The edifice of good will is not destroyed because the gangster follows his trade. It is threatened with destruction because policemen and judges whose duty it is to apprehend the gangster and punish him have joined him in his plottings. British and .French diplomats who masqueraded as the police of the League of Nations were in reality Mussolini’s accomplices. At the same time Pius XI, instead of making the force of his moral and spiritual protests felt, assisted Mussolini in every way and with every means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is only just to admit that some of the Catholic leaders outside of Italy have realized the immorality of Mussolini’s actions. It is not loss just to say they have attributed to the pope a policy which is the exact opposite of the policy which Pius XI has followed in this war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Saint Bridget</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The McKeesport (Pa.) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font7"> contains the information that St. Bridget is the patron saint of milk. Never heard of that before, but it is probably all O.K. Logically there should be some other “saint” to represent the tail that keeps the flies off the cow, and it would be no surprise to learn that there are several more “saints” looking after that end of the cow.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Pressure on the Pope</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ On March 18 Prime Minister Chamberlain told the British House of Commons that he viewed the Barcelona bombings of civilian populations with horror and disgust and that France was seeking to persuade the pope to make an appeal to stop further exhibitions of such terrorization. It may be added that the French appeal accomplished something; for the pope did shortly thereafter, for the looks of the thing, advise hisstar murderer, Franco, to desist from further bombing of cities, but, of course, the bombings went</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">right on afterwards, the same as before. The result, however, was to give many half-witted American editors a chance to spread-eagle in their papers the “kindness and tenderheartedness” of one of the most villainous and cruel -monsters of history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Pope Not in Politics (?) x</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ A short time ago the pope burst into print with a great wail that he was misunderstood by a certain Catholic writer who had denounced his political activities, and, in a pathetic cry to the newspapers and the Venerable Toadstools that sit in with him on *iis racket, he was not in politics, positively not. That lie lasted several weeks, which is a pretty good record for the Vatican. It was all upset by the following “Religious News Service” dis-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">21 </span><span class="font7">patch from London, under date of March 22, 1938, published in the Pittsburgh Press of that date. It tells'its own story:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The contention of Cardinal Van Hoey, Catholic primate of Belgium, that bishops are bound to make known to those under their authority their judgment on political ideals, and to favor or condemn political parties, has been- approved by the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cardinal Van Ftoey had written to his clergy saying that the doctrinal, or governing act of the Hierarchy was binding in conscience from the very moment the religious authorities manifested their </span><span class="font6">thought </span><span class="font7">and will. </span><span class="font6">This </span><span class="font7">authority extended to the whole domain of salvation, Nor was the political sphere closed to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The hierarchic authority is perfectly entitled to pronounce on any political party or political movement in so far as that party or movement opposes religious well-being or the precepts of Christian morals,” added the cardinal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He repudiated the suggestion that religious and non-religious affairs can be kept in separate watertight compartments, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In view of the controversy which raged over this pronouncement, and in view of the importance of the subject, the cardinal submitted his declaration to the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a letter to Cardinal Van Roey conveying to him the pope’s approval, Cardinal Paeelli, Vatican secretary of state, said that the teaching of the Belgian primate is completely based on the great pontifical encyclicals which deal ■with present-day problems.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“We’ll sit down soon and rest a while.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Jane, here’s a strawstack. Let’s climb up on top. It will be fun resting there.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Fine! Does that suit you, Sally?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Yes, I’d like that.” .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Soon three figures were outlined against the sky, side by side, on top of the strawstack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The moon is so bright I can see a long way off,” said Buddy,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The stars are bright, too,” added Sally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“We should see some ‘shooting stars’ if we watch carefully.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“What makes them fall like that?&quot; Sally asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“What we call ‘shooting<sup>1</sup> or ‘falling’ stars are not really stars at all. They are meteors. They pass fairly close to us at times and we get a fleeting glimpse of them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I see the big dipper,” Buddy announced, pointing skyward, “And there’s the North Star.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;And across there is the Milky Way ” murmured Jane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Where?” asked Sally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Across the sky — there, that whitish </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">milky streak.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“What makes it there?” questioned Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It is made of a great number of stars so far away that they seem to us to be quite close together, and the light from them makes </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">streak or band around the heavens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“That’s funny,” Buddy said to himself ns he leaned far backward to trace the branches of the Milky Way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Such beauty'” sighed Jane. “And look across there, where the moon makes dark shadows and light spots all among the rows .of corn shocks.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Suddenly a strange cry sounded from the clump of trees in the^ hollow some distance away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sally shuddered. “What was that?” .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Buddy laughed. “That was only a little screech owl. Listen. Hear him?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Well, I don’t like it,” answered Sally. “It’s the creepiest sound I ever heard.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“We have company,” said Jane, “right at our feet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“&quot;Where?” asked Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I don’t see a thing,” declared Sally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Neither do I,” replied Jane. “But buried out of sight in the straw, just near the toe of my shoe, is a little black cricket. He is quiet now, but in a moment we will hear him again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I hear him, now,” Buddy whispered. “Only maybe I ought to say, ‘I hear her.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“No, ‘him’ is right. You see, the female cricket docs not sing. She leaves that up to the head of the house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Where do crickets stay in winter?” asked Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“When winter comes,&quot; answered Jane, “most crickets die. But in the ground are laid eggs which will hatch the next spring.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“How do crickets sing ?” Buddy wanted to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Perhaps singing is not quite the word for it,” answered Jane, “Though we speak of the cricket as a singing insect, he really is a— well, let us say a violinist. By rubbing two little wings together, as a violinist draws a bow across the strings, he makes the sound which we call his ‘song’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“How wonderful!” breathed Sally. “How</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ever he </span><span class="font7">does it, I like to hear him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“He </span><span class="font7">is a cheery little felloe,” Jane replied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“We’d better be going home now,&quot; said Sally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Let’s slide down the strawstack,” cried Buddy, ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I never slid down one,” said Sally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“There’s nothing to jt,” answered Jane. “Stick but your feet, hold up your arms, and gwgy you go!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“There I” laughed Jane, as they reached the ground. “Wasn’t that fun?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Oh, yes!” cried Sally.—Contributed.</span></p>

The country, gravely disquieted by the events of the past twelve months, will expect Mr. Chamberlain to answer for his record of deeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In one speech, he destroyed the Collective Peace system built up and preserved by seventeen years of toilsome advocacy and sacrificing effort. He denounced Great Britain’s solemn pledges by throwing uneonquered Abyssinia to the Fascist aggressors. He tore up more solemn treaties and stood aside w'hen Hitler, by the process of undeclared war, turned Austria into a Nazi hell. He shirks action to end Japanese militarism’s rape of China. He continues to flout international law by refusing Spanish democracy the arms it needs to defeat Fascist invasion. He negotiates with Mussolini a pact which postulates the murder of Spanish democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When his actions force members of his own government to revolt, he promotes notorious pro-Fascists to high office in the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Chamberlain has not destroyed Collective Peace, denied the League the moral strength which he complains it lacks and struck a mortal blow at European democracy because he is a pacifist. He has entered into vague commitments with France and Belgium. He tells the British people that, if necessary, he will involve them in war for Portugal, for Iraq, for Egypt and for the inalienable right of British investors to the native populations ef Jamaica and Trinidad. In respect of these commitments, he piles up a burden of armaments threatening the home country with bankruptcy.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark137"></a>Story of the Market-House</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ In the parish of St. Peter, island of Guernsey, marketing was carried on in ill-protected stalls around the church square. The losses to vendors by rains and the inconvenience to buyers made the need of a covered markethouse keenly felt and some public-spirited citizen took the matter in hand to have one built. An estimate -of the size of house required brought its approximate cost in money to $22,000, and to raise this amount of money became the question with the promoters of the scheme. It was a question, however, of easy solution, as they had thousands of precedents. They drew up a petition setting forth the need of a market-house and desiring the governor to issue interest-bearing bonds, to be negotiated in Paris or London for the money wherewith to erect the building. To said petition were appended the signatures of some three hundred householders In the parish, and a committee was appointed to present the same to Gov, Broek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A MONEY INFIDEL!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It happened that, while the people were money-worshipers, that is, believed in the omnipotence of money, Governor Broek, on the contrary, was a money infidel, that is, did not believe that money was able to do the least thing. Consequently, when the people presented the petition, superstition and science came into conflict. The governor set to work; with arguments, to prevent the citizens from going into debt and becoming tributary to bankers in Paris or London. After explaining to the committee that all the money in the -world could not make nor lay a brick, could not plane nor nail a plank in the proposed market-house, with little effect, he finally struck the right way and reached their understanding as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A TERRIBLE COMMUNIST!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Will you permit me,” he asked the committee, &quot;to place before you some very simple questions?” Then, continuing, &quot;Have W6 the necessary number of mechanics to build the said house?” The committee replied that they had, adding that, owing to dull times, many workers were out of employment and would &gt;&nbsp;be glad to have jobs. This reply the governor put down on paper, summarily thus: “We have the men.&quot; He then asked about the ma<sub>t</sub> terials—rocks, bricks, lumber, lime, sand, tools, ' teams, as well as all the requisites to be found to maintain the men and teams while the work was being executed. To all these questions the committee had to reply affirmatively, because \ the whole was to be found in the parish. The governor set down on his list each in the order given. Holding, then, the list in his hands, he, with full assurance of being in the right, addressed the committee as follows: “Here you tell me that we have among ourselves everything needed to build the market-house, yet you desire ine to bond you to bankers for a material which is of no manner of use in the construction of the house. Strange anomaly 1” . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THE &quot;MONEY MYTH”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It is true,” remarked one of the commits tee, “that we have men and materials, but </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font7">lack the money to pay the men and to , buy the materials.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Friends,” replied the governor, “when a man gets paid for work done or materials furnished, It means he has worked for others and sold the materials. Is it your intention to build a house for bankers? If so, then you are right in demanding pay from those bank</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ers. </span><span class="font7">But, in such case, you should not place yourselves under bondage besides. If those cankers pay you for the house, and hold you in bondage also, demanding annual tribute, they will soon have both the house and the money they paid you. It will be no relief to say that We make the renters of the markethouse pay tribute to the bankers. The renters Will be a part of us, and they will demand of their customers that tribute in higher prices for goods. So wo jointly will have to pay tribute in perpetuity for an article which, as I said, is of no use to us. Allow me, gentlemen, to propose a better plan for building our market-house. Having, as you avow, men and materials, all that is necessary in the ease is to keep account of each man’s contributions of work or materials. In the future, we may balance equitably the expenses of the building. Instead of bonds, I will issue $22,000 market-house scrips, of different denominations (as money,), and with these pay the men and purchase the materials, then make these scrips receivable at par with legal tender money for the rent of the stalls.&quot; .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THEY </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">did</span><span class="font5"> it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The committee, after some hesitation, assented to the governor’s plan. Most of the citizens also agreed to it. The &quot;scrips” were</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Issued, the materials procured, the men put to work, the building erected, and the stalls rented. The scrips circulated in the island at par. Every month’s rent reduced their quantity, and in Jess than ten years all were batik in the public treasury and stamped “Canceled”, and thus ended the life of the Guernsey Market-House scrips. The house had been built, the contributions of materials and work were now all paid with the goods they had purchased at the market-house, or indirectly elsewhere, and not one cent lost to the people in discounting bonds or interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">AND IT WOBKED</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now for a word as to how this plan worked in Fairhope, Alabama: In their early days in the wilderness, on the eastern shore of Mobile bay, without railroad facilities or other means of intercourse with the outside wop Id, the people’s isolation was keenly felt and a boat wharf was urgently needed where passing steamers could load and unload their cargoes. The colony was growing and the need of a wharf was with every passing day more apparent. Finally someone suggested, “Use the Guernsey Market-House plan and build the wharf.” The plan was looked up and adopted as the only rational way out. The scrips were issued in various denominations, the materials purchased, men hired and set to work, and the wharf was built. Its use eventuallj<sup>7</sup> jiaid for itself&quot;.—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Epic News.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• Il Duce stopped the Italian anti-British radio propaganda when he and Mr. Chamberlain agreed to the paet between the two nations: it was one of the conditions of the pact that this should be done. The pact, however, was not to become operative until Italian troops were withdrawn from Spain. Mussolini has not withdrawn his troops, except those unable to carry on the war in Franco’s aid, and it is well known that the Italians in Spain have been reinforced by new arrivals from Italy. But if II Dues stopped the’anti-British propaganda amongst the Arabs he has begun a new way of hitting at Britain. At least this is credibly suggested by a well-known publicist. It is Mussolini’s anti-Jew menace. His newspaper more than hints at an understanding between Britain and the Jews, and claims that a working agreement exists with the Jews to get world control. As no paper in Italy (or in Germany) is allowed to print other than that which is inspired or given out by the rulers, this is evidently designed to have an embittering effect on the Arabs, that is, on the Moslem world, and will have the same effect as Mussolini’s direct attacks, now professed to be dropped.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>German Army Mobilization</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• The unusually extensive mobilization of Germany’s army and of transport material for the annual maneuvers has caused much comment and a measure of concern in this country, more particularly, of course, among those who are responsible for its affairs. The Paris newspapers, following the lead of most of their politicians, said Hitler’s action was a great bluff; but as the mobilization increased in size, and in view of the location of the army, on the Rhine border and on the borders of Czechoslovakia, they became less sure of that. The London papers took much the same view, and in this they probably represent the general feeling of the people; all the same, suspicion and uneasiness has obtained. Hitler has his admirers in the popular press. What Hitler meant by the large size of his mobilization and the unusually long time in which his army was in the field—at a cost estimated by some at £500,000 a day—was probably not known by anyone,' perhaps not by himself. What he would like to do, and purposes some day to accomplish, is well enough known; for he has published that to the world. So long as he is guided by the voices and the thoughts of the demons, he is subject to them, and will go contrary to expectation or to reason and without regard to others if his way is at all open to him. In the meantime Britain is thrown into enormous expense in its purpose to make itself strong against the evil day of war, which the country believes will come soon or late. The preparation is providing work for many who otherwise would be unemployed and chargeable to the country, and this serves to hide the fact that the trade of the country is not sufficient to maintain the workers, and the fact that it is dwindling in bulk and value.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>General Franco and Britain</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• Franco kept the British Government waiting more than a month before he acknowledged their proposals for the withdrawal of foreign “volunteers” from Spain, upon which depended the operation of the Anglo-Italian agreement, and which purported to lessen the danger of the Spanish war involving all Europe. When he replied he intimated that his counter proposals were not settled, but that he would respond when ready “in a friendly and sympathetic” manner. After more delay he put forward proposals which if accepted would nullify the work of the Nonintervention Committee, and make the British proposals useless. He wants belligerent rights at once, and concedes the withdrawal of a larger number of foreign volunteers if his proposals are agreed to. Franco believes he could bring his venture to an early successful conclusion if belligerent rights were granted to the Spanish contestants. Either side would then have power to stop and search ships around the Spanish coast or on the high seas; either side could blockade the other’s ports, and ships carrying war materials could be seized as prizes of war.: It is said that most of the war supplies which<sup>1</sup> reach the Spanish Government forces arrive by sea.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Some think and say it was Mussolini’s hand that guided Franco in his reply, and suggest .that Mussolini intended to make Spain a vital matter of preoccupation for Britain and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">France while Hitler was perfecting iris schemes for seizing Czechoslovakia.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>British Communists</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">•The British Communist party has published some figures concerning itself. When it was first established; in 1920, and for some years afterwards, it was subsidized by Moscow, and its membership did not exceed 5,000. It doubled its numbers during the long coal strike of 1921, and increased in the long labor struggle which culminated in the general strike of 1926, Afterwards the numbers fell to about 3,000, and the party was in a bad way: its leaders were at variance, and Moscow was critical. In 1935 it had no more than 6,500 members; but now it reports 15,750, a large increase Their report says, “The proportion of unemployed among the membership is small. Since its last congress the influence of the party has grown considerably among wide sections of the middle class and professional people; has increased among university students and is now firmly entrenched in the most important universities.” The report has some comments on the Government's air-raid precautions, and describes them as “an attempt on the part of the Government to give the people of the country, at the lowest possible cost, an illusion that they are being protected”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">• These have been out of the headlines of late. They had their spate of talk, which amounted to nothing. The call to religion fell flat, and their attempt to make something out of the “open Bible” anniversary probably benefited only the Bible sellers. The churches are losing the confidence of the people more all the time. What Tittle is heard of the parsons indicates that they are getting ready to throw in. with the army if it must be mobilized for war. They would be pacifists, of course, for the days when the bishops led armies into war are long since gone; but there would be the 'spiritual welfare’ of the poor fellows to be looked to, and the call to try to help the men from getting more beast-like than war of necessity makes them. When war comes the parsons are certain to find it a “righteous cause” into which they can throw themselves.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark153"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>Prayers</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">• When the preachers say prayers in congregation, to whom do they address them? </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 1®, 1938</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">The prayers of the larger church organizations are fixed for the clergy, and they must be repeated according to the set form of words. As the form of worship is merely formal and gone through as such, the sentiments of the prayers expressed in fine words meet the requirements of the congregation. The Nonconformist preacher is not bound to set words, but his extempore form of prayer must be couched in fine phrase and words or it is not * acceptable to his congregation, which means very frequently that the prayers are “delivered” to the congregation. All such formality of prayer means that they reach no farther, nor go higher than the range of the speaker’s voice. At th| recent Keswick convention of professed Christians—an annual event, begun by a Church of England clergyman about forty years ago, and kept alive as an annual holiday event—one of the speakers of prayers for missionary work in Africa thanked God “for the fine motor roads in Africa” and prayed God “so to move the hearts of these Christians who can afford luxurious cars that they may help to provide thy servants with mechanical transport”. There were very many fine cars parked around the meeting places, and no doubt the speaker expected to get a thrust in sideways. If these men were not blinded by religion they would get a chance to perceive the wrongness of their professed following of Christ. There is a prayer set by the Lord himself for His disciples which covers the greater portion of the needs of those who follow Christ, whether individually or when they meet together for worship. But these huge religionist, organizations, which are by no means under the care of God, require much money for their upkeep, and requests for money in the form of prayer to God are among the many means they use to get it. There are other means used, and always under some pressure, so that, as Judge Rutherford has said, religion is the greatest racket the world has knowm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Manufacturers* and Distributors’ Profits </span><span class="font7">• The large stores and multiple shop businesses, distributors of general and household goods and sundries, have reported large profits and dividends; some of the figures are surprisingly large. The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Labour Research</span><span class="font7"> journal says, “These rates of dividend, however, in many cases conceal the full magnitude of the profits made.” It instances the English Woolworth concern which in its last financial year</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;29</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">reported a profit of £6,781,202, “much of it on shares distributed as bonus in previous years, a profit seventy times as large as the total original English capital, and which means that for every pound held in ordinary shares in 1912 an annual income of £6,750 is now being paid.” Another, a competing firm, paid out a 40-percent dividend on a capital of £3,100,000; Boot’s Pure Drug company paid 30 percent—this business controls 1,170 shops in Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The conditions of employment in the distributive trades are marked by long hours, low wages, insecure and blind employment, and the large number of juvenile and female workers who are engaged in the industry. In the House of Commons R. J. Davies said, “I myself made an inquiry recently in a large city in the North, which showed that it is not uncommon for adulf<sup>1</sup> women to be employed at a wage of 15/- [$3.65] a week, before deductions are made for the meals they are expected to take in the establishment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The manufacturers have not done so badly. Whether or not they act fairly with their customers cannot always be known. A Glasgow man who has been collecting data for many years (so </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Reynolds&quot; News</span><span class="font18"> says) on the practice of unscrupulous manufacturers of pillows and bedding, filling them with injurious and dirty materials, has after many years got the minister of health to investigate the matter. A Rag Flock Act passed in 1911 stopped some of the practices then used by manufacturers; but a loop hole in the Act allows such to fill mattresses and pillows with dirty feather's, human hair and even seaweed. There is no regulation in this country, he says, that prohibits the use of secondhand hog and horse hair from being used in bedding, and from data he has collected, he says, he knows that thousands of tons of such hair are put into ‘new’ articles of furniture. Old feathers, fifty years old, are used in pillows and sold as new. Britain is the dumping ground for this rubbish. He mentions a consignment of unwashed human hair from China which was imported for upholstery, but the use of which for that purpose he was the means of preventing. We have seen a mattress cut open which disclosed old corsets only partly ripped up, and various other old clothing, and which mattress had been purchased from a reputable store. Before the above-mentioned Rag Flock Act came into operation there was a great business done</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">30</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">in the importation of old clothing gathered from all parts of the world. The garments of all descriptions were put into a “devil” disintegrator, torn into bits, further treated in order to make the material look somewhat like wool flocks for bedding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Unemployment</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18">• A. V. Alexander, M.P., told a meeting of a Co-operative summer school that “despite the heavy expenditure on arms, involving the employment of nearly one million people, there are today 1,800,000 unemployed”. He added, “And despite six years of protection, restrictions and quotas, the balance of trade against Britain is much more serious than it was in 1931. If the argument for protection really held good, then we ought to have seen it largely reduced in volume since 1931, and no serious decline in employment.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Labor</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18">• It is reported that British shipyards are short of work: new contracts for merchant ships are scarce; there are not as many as trade conditions would call for. At the same time shipyards on the Continent are booking valuable orders from British shipowners. It is estimated that orders amounting to £4,000,000 have recently been placed by British firms with shipbuilders in Holland, Germany and Scandinavia. British building costs are high in comparison with those on the Continent. Wages costs enter into the matter, but the cost of materials is perhaps the chief item. War preparations are responsible for higher costs in almost all material, and those who have an opportunity of making something extra while the going is good are ready for the chance. It is said that the home yards which specialize in the building of vessels for the British coastal trade are feeling the shortage of work. They can build vessels second to none; but they are undercut in price by foreign builders, who get the work. Money knows nothing of the patriotism which is so loudly applauded by some of those who could help. It must be admitted that no nation can live to itself, and there must be give and take both in international trade and in work. The noisy propaganda “Buy British” of a few years ago probably did as much harm to the country as it did good to the local trade; and some of the stores that covered their windows with this show of patriotism kept their shelves well laden with “foreign” produce.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark155"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark156"></a>Spring Green—Cover Design for This Number</span></h4>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">T IS hard for those who live in the northern hemisphere to realize that in the other half of the world </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> subscribers are enjoying the full evidences of Spring, Yet that is the case, and in Australia, where there are many enthusiastic boosters of this journal, they are looking forward to all that spring and summer mean^-. while here, in North America, as well as in England, readers are preparing for the siege of winter and .consoling themselves with the thought of pleasant evenings spent in the warmth of the home reading a certain magazine, which modesty causes one to refrain from mentioning more particularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Last winter the cover illustrations were all decidedly wintry in outlook, and so, by way of contrast and variety, Spring Green appears in October, as it dues in Australia, New Zealand and, of course, South Africa; though these lands, and particularly Africa, are so much closer to the equator than is New York that perhaps their readers will smile a little at the enthusiasm with which dwellers in more temperate zones hail the advent of Spring. And even then, sometimes Spring is a little disappointing, as when it is colder than it by right should be. At such times the odes of welcome may be somewhat subdued, as, for instance, the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sprig, sprig, 0 joyous sprig!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of thee I faid would loudly sig. , The labkid gabbols od the greed, To keeb hibself a liddle warb I weed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So one hopes that Spring in the remote southern climes is just a little more genial and that, though it marks no great variation in temperature, yet it comes with accompaniments that make it welcome none the less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Whether the illustration approximates scenes in those regions where Spring is now an actuality is, of course, uncertain. It at least is representative of the American and English countryside, and since the southern lands mentioned are also inhabited by Englishspeaking peoples, the illustration may not lack the appeal of the familiar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">THE MESSENGER</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">THE MESSENGER</span><span class="font7"> is not a regular publication of the Society. It is put out from time to time by the Watch Tower when it has a very special message to all people of good will. This time it has 64 pages, of the same size as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation. </span><span class="font7">It will contain a complete report of the world-wide convention of Jehovah’s witnesses and the reaction of the people to Judge Rutherford’s lecture “Face the Facts”, which was heard by more than 150,'000 persons assembled in auditoriums throughout the English-speaking world, in addition to the millions who heard by radio. A lot of things happened during and shortly after that lecture. If you want to know about them, then send in your order immediately for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font7"> Ten &gt;&nbsp;cents a copy will cover the cost of printing and mailing anywhere in the world. Those associated with the Society should place their orders with the company servants, so as to facilitate mailing and shipping. You will be thrilled with the report, which will contain numerous pictures as well as news items of every one of the conventions, held in 50 or more cities. There will be only one printing; therefore you should get your order in before it goes to press.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">♦ A card from “Father” Vincent, O.C.D., 1125 South Walker Street, Oklahoma City, Okla., wants to know why you don’t dig up? To show you that the salvation of man depends upon the amount you count out on the barrel he says:</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Secret Instructions of the Jesuits</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">HE Jesuits are trying desperately to get control of the United States of America, and the Devil and the politicians are playing everything into their hands. In bygone centuries their order was suppressed in every country in Europe. It was even suppressed by Pope Clement XIV, and he was murdered because of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1762 the parliament of France dissolved and abolished the order in that country, assigning the following as the reasons of their abolition;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The consequences of their doctrines destroy the law of nature: they break all the bonds of civil society, by authorizing theft, lying, perjury, the utmost licentiousness, murder, criminal passions, and all manner of sins. These doctrines, moreover, root out all sentiments of humanity: they overthrow all governments; excite rebellion; and uproot the foundation and practice of [Christianity]. And they substitute all sorts of superstitions, irre-ligion, blasphemy and idolatry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic bishop of Angelopolis, in a letter published at Cologne in 1666, made the truthful charge:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The superiors of the Jesuits do not govern them by the Rules of the Church, but by certain ‘'Secret Instructions and Rules”, which are known only to those superiors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The existence of these “Secret Instructions” has been known for centuries. Copies were found, one at Venice in 1596, one in the -Jesuits’ College at Paderborn, Westphalia, and another copy in the city of Prague. In the preface is found the injunction:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If these Rules fall into the hands of strangers, they must be positively denied to be the Rules of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Secreta Monita Societatis Jesu. Caput I. Qualem societas prsestare sese debeat, cum incipit de novo alicujus loci fundationem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY SB, 193S</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Instructions of the Jesuits. Chapter I. How the Society must behave themselves when they begin any new foundation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Some of the Rules</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">5. Caveant nostri emere fundos in initio; sed si quos emerint nobis bene sitos, fiat hoc mutato nomine aliquorum amicorum fidelium et secretorum; et ut melius luccat paupertas nostra, bona quas sunt vicina loeis, in quibus collegia habeamus, per provincialem assignen-tur collegiis remotis, quo fiet ut nunquam prineipes vel magistratus habeant certain no-titiam redituum societatis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">V. At their first settlement, let our members be cautious of purchasing lands; but if they happen to buy such as are well situated, let this be done in the name of some faithful and trusty friend. And that our poverty may have the more colorable gloss of reality, let the purchases, adjacent to the places where our colleges are founded, be assigned by the provincial to colleges at a distance; by which means it will be impossible that princes and magistrates ean ever attain to a certain knowledge what the revenues of the Society amount to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Caput II. Quomodo principum, magnatum et primariorum PP. societatis familiaritatem acquirent et conservabunt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Chapter II. In what manner the Society must deport, that they may work themselves into, and after that preserve a familiarity with princes, noblemen, and persons of the greatest distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">12. Inimicitiffi et dess ent iones inter magnates ad nos distrahendffi erunt ut componantur, sic enim in notitiam familiarium et secretorum paulatim poterimus devenire, et alterutram partem nobis devincere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">XII. Let proper methods be used to get knowledge of the animosities that arise among great men, that we may have a finger in reconciling their differences; for by this means we shall gradually become acquainted with their friends and secret affairs, and of necessity engage one of the parties in our interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">15. Denique ita omnes solliciti sint, prih-cipes, magnates, et magistratus cujusqueloci . conciliare, lit etiam contra consanguineos, et affines, et amicos cues, pro illis, quando ocCasio sese obtulerit, strenue fideliterque agant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">XV. Finally,—Let all with such artfulness gain the ascendant over princes, noblemen, and the magistrates of every place, that they may be ready at our beck, even to sacrifice their nearest relations and most intimate friends, when we say it is for our interest and advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Caput III. Quomodo agendum societati cum illis qui magnos sunt auctoritatis in republics, et quamvis divites non sint, aliis tamen modis juvare possunt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Chapter III. Hew the Society must behave themselves towards those who are at the helm of affairs, and others who, although they be not rich, are notwithstanding in a capacity of being otherwise serviceable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">3. Adhibendi etiam ut mitigent et eom-peseant homines viliores, et plebem societati nostrae contrariam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">III. They must be also employed in calming the minds of the meaner sort of people, and in wheedling the aversions of the populace into an affection for our Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Caput IV. Quse eommendata esse debeant concionatoribus et confessariis magnatum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Chapter IV. The chief things to be recommended to preachers and confessors of noblemen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1. </span><span class="font7">Nostri, prineipes virosque illustres ita dirigant, ut solum ad majorem Dei gloriam tendere videantur et ad talem austeritatem conscientiae, quam ipsimet prineipes conce-dunt; neque enim statim sed sensim speetare debet directio illorum extern am et politieam gubernationem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I. Let </span><span class="font6">the members of our Society direct princes and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">great </span><span class="font6">men in such a manner that they may </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">seem</span><span class="font6"> to have nothing.else in view but the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">promotion of God’s glory;</span><span class="font6"> and advise them to no other austerity of conscience bnt what they themselves are willing to comply with; for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">their aim must, </span><span class="font6">not immediately, but by degrees and insensibly, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">be directed towards political and secular dominion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">4. </span><span class="font7">Meminerint summop ere confessarii et concionatores, prineipes suaviter et blande tractate, nullo modo in concinionibus et privates colloquiis perstringere, omnes pavores ab illis removere, et in ipsa fide, justitia politick potissimum adhortari.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">IV. Let the confessors and preachers always remember, with complaisance and a winning 'address, to sooth princes, and never give them the least offence in their sermons or private conversations; to dispossess their minds of all imaginary doubts and fearSy and exhort them principally to faith, hope and political justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">All the Rules Are at Hand</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the rules are at hand, 145 of them, both in Latin and in English, being exact copies of those found, and accurately translated. To save space and labor several of the rules are now given only in English, but anyone who desires the Latin for any of these may have it on presentation of an adequate reason for desiring the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Chapter VI. Of proper methods for inducing rich widows to be liberal to our Society,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">IV. Care must be taken to remove such servants particularly as do not keep a good understanding with the Society; but let this be done by little and little; and when we have managed to work them out, let such be recommended as already are, or willingly would become our creatures; thus shall we dive into, every secret, and have a finger in every affair transacted in the family. IX. It will be proper, every now and then, cunningly to propose to her some match, but such a one, be sure, as you know she has an aversion to; and if it be thought that she has a kindness for any one, let his vices and failings be represented to her in a proper light, that she may abhor the thoughts of altering her condition with any person whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Chapter VII. How such widows are to be secured, and in what manner their effects are to be disposed of.</span><span class="font7"> XVI. The same art must be used with princes and other benefactors; for they must be wrought up to a belief, that these are the only acts which will perpetuate their memories in this world, and secure them eternal glory in the next: but should any persons out of ill-will pretend to trump up the example of our Saviour,, who had not whereon to lay his head, and from thence urge that the Society of Jesus ought to distinguish themselves by their poverty, in answer to such insinuations as these, we must seriously inculcate on the minds of all, that the state of the church, being altered from what it was, and now changed into a monarchy, it cannot maintain its ground against mighty enemies, unless supported by great authority and power, and that it is that little stone which was foretold by the prophet should be hewn out of the rock, and afterwards rise into a vast mountain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Chapter IX. Of increasing the revenues of, our colleges.</span><span class="font7"> V. Let the rectors of colleges endeavor to procure thorough information of the houses, gardens, fams, vine-yards, villages, and other effects belonging to the prime nobility, merchants and citizens; and (if possible) of the taxes and rents with which they are incumbered: but this may be done with caution, and most effectually at confessions, in familiar conversation, and private discourses. And whenever a confessor has got a rich penitent, let him immediately inform the rectors, and try all winning artifices to secure him. XI. The better to convince the world of the Society’s poverty, let the superiors borrow money on bond, of some rich persons who are our friends, and when it is due defer the payment thereof. Afterwards let the person who lent the money (especially in time of dangerous sickness) be constantly visited, and by all methods wrought upon to deliver up the bond; by this means we shall not be mentioned in the deceased’s will; and yet gain handsomely without incurring the ill-will of their heirs. XVI. Lastly, let the women who complain of the vices or ill-humor of their husbands, be instructed secretly to withdraw a sum of money, that by making an offering thereof to God, they may expiate the crimes of their sinful help-mates, and secure a pardon for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Chapter XI. How our members are unanimously to behave towards those who are expelled from the Society.</span><span class="font7"> VII. Let them (as far as is possible) be timely removed from the exercise of honorable functions in the church, such as preaching, confessing, and publishing of books, &amp;c., lest by these means they attract the affection and applause of the people. The strictest inquiries must therefore be made into their lives, manners, and conversations, what they apply themselves to, and their very intentions: to which end, matters must be so managed, that we may keep up a good correspondence with some of the family in which they live, and the minute the least trip be discovered, or anything deserving censure, let It --— be industriously spread abroad in the world by some of the lower rank of people, who are our friends, that so the noblemen or prelates may be restrained from showing them any farther countenance, for fear of the scandal it may bring upon themselves; and should they behave so as to leave us no room to find fault, let their virtues and laudable actions be de-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY26, 1938 </span><span class="font7">preciated by subtile insinuation and. doubtful expressions; till the esteem and credit they had formerly acquired be lessened, in the opinion of the world; for it is altogether for the interest of the Society, that the dismissed, especially such as of their own accord desert it, should be entirely kept Under.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Chapter XVII. Of the methods of advancing the Society,</span><span class="font7"> III. Let kings and princes be kept up in this principle, that the Catholic faith, as matters now stand, cannot subsist without the civil power, which however must be managed with the greatest discretion. By this means our members will work themselves into the favor of persons in the highest post of government, and consequently be admitted into their most secret councils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The copy of these instructions from which citations herein are made is accurate; taken from the copy seized at Paderborn, Westphalia, Germany, when Christian, duke </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">Brunswick, took the city and seized the Jesuit college there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the published and admitted tenets, of the Jesuits are that it is lawful to murder the innocent, rob, and commit lewdness (Aquinas-Alagona); to repudiate and violate oaths of fidelity and obedience (Philopater); to kill the innocent husband of an adulteress to conceal the guilt of a priest (Henriquez); to accuse parents of heresy even though knowing they may be burnt alive for it (Fagundez); for a priest to murder anybody who prevents him from taking any ecclesiastical. office. (Amicus); to kill an accuser whose testimony jeopardizes one’s life and honor (Escobar); to steal from an employer (Cardenas, Tabema); for a wife to rob her husband (Gordonus) ; to lie on the witness stand to avoid injury to self or posterity (Tabema); for priests to murder any layman to preserve their goods (Molina).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At a very early period after the establishment of the order of Jesuits, the civil and ecclesiastical authorities of France proclaimed the Society ‘<sup>1</sup> dangerous to the Christian faith, disturbers of the peace, and more fitted to corrupt than to edify ”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The present pope confesses to a Jesuit. All Jesuits agree to do unhesitatingly anything whatever desired by the pope. Occasional interception of letters has proved that there</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">5</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">are female Jesuits and that some Jesuits occupy Protestant pulpits. Also, there are polished courtiers, brilliant scholars and captivating gentlemen who are Jesuits who know nothing whatever of these authentic “Secret Instructions”, and would swear on the cross that no such instructions were ever given to or received by them, and in this they would he correct. The instructions are not for the rank and file.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Celery Juice for Epilepsy</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font7">D. Buck, one of Jehovah’s witnesses in</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">• Massachusetts, and a very earnest and faithful worker, wrote the following, which should be of interest to epilepsy sufferers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have been a victim of epilepsy for nearly forty years, which necessitated the continued use of drugs during that time; I have taken from three to four and one-half grains of phenobarbital daily for the last twelve years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For seven weeks now I have taken one pint of celery juice half an hour before breakfast each morning; and I expect to continue another seven weeks, when 1 hope to be cured permanently. To say I am feeling better would be putting it mildly; I feel like a new man, having reduced my medicine gradually each week so that now I have been entirely free from drugs for two weeks. I use unbleached celery, and a juicer may be obtained at health food shops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I have discontinued all refined sugar (catmg houey instead), all tea and coffee (for which I substitute hot water), and practically all flesh foods. I find raw vegetables very beneficial, such as lettuce, carrots and cabbage shredded, with mayonnaise, radishes, etc., with plenty of fruit and nuts. Cooked greens are excellent; also cottage cheese. I obtain some fine celery and greens from Italian stores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Correct Eating </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. Ben Opsakl {Minnesota)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(If this shocks your particular health susceptibilities, be tolerant.- -Fd.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> AM </span><span class="font7">enclosing an article on “Correct Eating”. This plan was originated some thirty years ago by Dr. J. H. Tilden, of Denver, Colo. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. </span><span class="font7">Tilden, although a graduate of medicine, saw -its weaknesses and through his research found that most of man’s ills were the result of his own wrong doing. He established what he called “The Tilden Health School”, and, by taking the failures of the regular profession and returning them to health, as well as showing them how to stay well, built an institution valued at $£50,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His procedure was, first of all, to explain to the patients that by their wrong eating they had poisoned their bodies. Thus the first thing to do was to fast for several days and clean out the accumulation of toxins. After he was satisfied that the body was fairly clean, he then set about instructing the patient how to eat so that his ills would not recur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For many years Dr. Tilden published a monthly periodical called </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Stuffed Club, </span><span class="font7">in which he exposed the fallacies of the modem cures. Naturally, this brought upon him the wrath of the regulars and he was a lone wolf ostracised by medical associations. And at this time, to the best of my knowledge, Dr. Tilden is still alive and well and living in Denver, Colo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The thought that I would like to give you is that it seems that such an organization as yours should try to instill through education . the wrong that has been promoted by the orthodox churches of all denominations. I have but to call to your mind how these groups sponsor and run many of the largest hospitals in the country. These hospitals are surgical plants and surely under the guise of religion; it is hard to conceive of them as being in harmony with the teachings of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So I would like to contribute what little I can of the teachings of Dr. Tilden. It seems to me too bad that such institutions of learning as our many large universities do not touch these great truths, but, in their stead, dillydally around with a lot of ultra pseudo science.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Coffee and tea should be used very moderately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">people doing light work, and one for people doing heavy work. If you are a light worker, that is, not doing manual labor, you should eat a breakfast of only fruits. Your dinner may be eaten at noon or in the evening, as you choose, and should consist of boiled, broiled, or baked meat (column 3), one or more noh-starchy vegetables cooked (column 2), any'fresh and green vegetables, such as a combination salad of lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers, dressed with olive oil and lemon juice preferably. For dessert, fruits, fresh,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">cooked or baked.

<p><span class="font7">For people doing manual labor, we suggest a starch breakfast of cereals and bread but no meat or eggs and no acid . fruits. The dinner is the same as prescribed for the light worker, with the exception that some acid fruit should be added to this meal, and the lunch or- supper could be a baked potato (column 1) or some other baked dish and any of the vegetables that come under the non-starchy vegetables (column2).</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The, reason for not eating foods in the different classes or groups all at the same meal is explained as follows: For example, the dinner. We stated above that meats are digested by the acids in the stomach. That means this: that when you eat meat it excites the flow of acid into the stomach to tear down the meat so that it can be assimilated into the body when it gets to the intestine. If you eat any form of starches with meat the starch goes into the stomach and picks up the aeids, thereby robbing the meat of sufficient acid to digest it; and not only that, but, once the acid is absorbed into the starch, when the meal is finally passed on into the small intestine the starch acts as a conveyer or carrier of the acid that it has picked up in the stomach. Thus the add is misplaced, because the construction of the stomach and that of the small and of the large intestine are extremely different. The stomach is tough; it is so constructed that the acids do not injure it, while the intestine is a delicate organ lined with a delicate mucous membrane and bathed with bile. Bile is alkaline; therefore the intestine should be alkaline; and when acids get into the intestine they set up an irritation of the delicate mucous membrane lining it. This means a congestion of blood and a thickening *of the mucous membrane. It means many things, such as setting up a chronic sore at whatever point is the weakest. The most common place is the caecum, which is {he beginning of the large bowel. Nature realizing that it must not, if avoidable, allow this misplaced acid to accumulate, in the bowel, the blood picks it up and carries it to the liver. One of the functions of the liver is to screen out this foreign material from the blood so that the kidneys or skin must carry it out of the body. By wrong eating the liver is overworked to the extent that it is soon unable to keep the blood free of acid, mucus and other poisons and they are allowed to go on their journey in. the blood to every part of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus this haphazard method of eating starts a chain of disease conditions which include practically every disease to which man is subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This plan of eating is correct; it is practical ; it works; it is the truth; and I know that your readers are going to like it, because many of them are my patients.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The United States does not average 100 lynchings a year—not quite. The total number since 1882 (55 years) is 5,108. That is only 93 a year. It is quite safe to commit murder in the United States in this manner, and many enjoy the pastime very much. The lynchers escaped punishment in 99.2 percent of the cases.

<p><span class="font7">♦ France wants a larger population, for the reason that the German population is growing and the French population is shrinking. The French Government now bestows dowries of $600 on good girls of the poorer classes, between the ages of 21 and 30, provided they marry within three years after the dowry is assigned. Reduced railway fares are given to large families. Public employees are awarded increases in their pay with every increase in their families.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Medical Opinions Against Vivisection</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ R. Lawson Tait, LL.D., L.R.C.P., L.R.C.S., F.R.C.S., Birmingham, England, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every year for centuries, thousands of animals have been vivisected and nothing whatever has been learned from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">William Blackwood^ R.D., M.D., Brigadier General, U.S.A., Philadelphia, Pa., said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is physically impossible that other than misleading and false doctrines should be the result of the cruel and degrading work of vivisection,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J. B. S. King, M.D., Editor </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Medical Advance,</span><span class="font7"> Emeritus Professor of Chemistry of Herring Medical College, Chicago, III., said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is my opinion that vivisection is a procedure entirely unnecessary to the advance of science, and unproductive of any good to human suffering, or human disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Albert Leffingwell, M.D., Aurora, N. Y., said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the last twenty-five years, infliction of intense torture upon myriads of creatures has failed to develop one remedy of generally accepted value in the cure of disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. William Howard Hay said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I do not know of one single thing of material benefit to health or longevity emanating from this practice that could not have been determined in other and less cruel ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Vivisection in Elgin, Illinois</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The newspapers tell about vivisection in Elgin, Illinois. Speaking of the animals upon whom the vivisection experiments were tried, the account says: “Sulphur suspended in oil was injected into the muscles of their thighs. Then they were sent to bed with fevers ranging from 101 to 104 degrees. They remained in the infirmary three weeks.” And the animals vivisected, what kind of animals were they? Oh, they were people; just plain folks, humans. They were insane; they could not help themselves. The doctors in charge of the experiments claim improvements resulted in nearly half the eases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Torturing an Ape at New Haven</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">♦ Electronics,</span><span class="font7"> October, 1935, (379) 37, contains a picture of an ape whose brain tissue is coupled magnetically to a circuit. There is also a reproduction of an X-ray photograph of the ape’s brain, showing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a'</span><span class="font7"> eoil and wires buried in the tissue. This torturing of the ape by sending electric currents through his brain </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 25, 1938 </span><span class="font7">is reported in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine.</span><span class="font7"> The report shows the poor ape cooped up in a cage just big enough to hold him, and there is the admission that— </span><span class="font6">the wires greatly impede the freedom of action of the animal and constitute a definite disturbing factor in the investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “brain excitation device” was developed&quot; by Prof. E. L. Chaffee, of Harvard University, and Dr. Richard U. Light, of the Yale University School of Medicine. Men will be next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Thanks, Just the Same</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ A reader with a heart, and interested in the little four-legged folks that run around among human creatures, wants the editor to read some articles from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The American Journal of Physiology,</span><span class="font7"> explaining thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These deal respectively with boiling live rabbits, and with uniting two dogs so that the blood circulation will pour back and forth between them (40 pairs used in the experiment) as a sort of Siamese twin and that, surviving the frightful operation necessary to accomplish the feat, the two animals live, eat, walk and sleep in a forced union of their bodies until they rot apart or tear apart or one bleeds to death into his mate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thanks, just the same, but it makes the heart sick to know that such things are done every year in vivisection laboratories, and that they will continue until Jehovah God destroys the human vermin that now clutters up the earth. Meantime, “fret not thyself because of evil doers.” A better day dawns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">What He Learned and How</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ In St. Louis Dr, Kissane, Columbus, Ohio, told the American College of Physicians bow he struck dogs sharp blows on the chest and </span><span class="font6">produced various types of heart irregularities which followed almost immediately after the blow was struck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now, isn’t that wonderful? And, just to think, Dr. Kissane learned that all by himself 1 like the bride who discovered that she could open a can of tomatoes by using her husband’s razor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Germs </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Mrs. May Parrett (Tasmania) </span><span class="font6">(Broadcast over 7HO)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">OTTTHERE </span><span class="font7">axe you going?” asked an </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">VV </span><span class="font7">Eastern pilgrim on meeting the plague one day. “I am going to Bagdad to kill 5,000 people,” was the reply. A few days later the -same pilgrim met the plague returning. &quot;You told me you were going to Bagdad to kill 5,000 people,” he said, ‘‘but instead you killed 50,000.” &quot;No,” said the plague, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">*<sup>4</sup>I </span><span class="font7">killed only 5,000 as I told you I would; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font7"> others died of fright.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Waldo Trine says: “Fear can paralyze every muscle in the body. Fear affects the flow of the blood; likewise the normal and healthy action of all the life forces. Fear can make the body rigid, motionless and powerless to move. Practically all disease, with its consequent suffering, has its origin in perverted mental and emotional states and conditions. The mental attitude we take toward anything determines to a greater or less extent its effects upon us. If we fear it, the chances are it will have detrimental or even disastrous effects upon us. No disease can enter into or take hold of our bodies unless it finds therein something corresponding to itself &quot;which makes it possi</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ble.” I </span><span class="font7">wish you specially to bear the fore</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">going- </span><span class="font7">quotation in mind in studying this germ question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All life starts originally from a germ cell, whether it be a human, animal, plant or any other form, and nothing can start unless it is present; so you can see that it really becomes the basks of everything created, and without it nothing could be that is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But, unfortunately, following some investigation into the processes of fermentation, Pastetir, in April, 1864, gave utterance to the generalization, “Life is a germ, and a germ is life.” Had he stopped there, it would have harmed no one; but he did not. Within ten years his advertising instincts led him to coin </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">new generalization, “Disease is a germ, and a germ is disease.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">great hunt was then started to locate the different germs. Different diseases must have different germs, and each specific germ must therefore produce its specific disease. Plants depend for their growth and development upon germs that<sup>are</sup> in the earth; and Pasteur asserted that the disease germs were found in the air, and that the reason, for example, that</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">12</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">an open wound would become septic was, because these air-borne germs get access to the broken surface and into the blood stream. If Pasteur were right, that all disease arises from air-borne germs, then none of us should be alive, seeing that they exist in countless millions and that within a few hours one germ, in a suitable medium, may have three million descendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The most necessary people in our city life today are the sanitary engineers and those whose work it is to keep the city clean. In like manner are the germs; for without them we could not live. The moment human or vegetable matter becomes unhealthy the germs attack and change it into its various constituents, nature’s way of sea ven ger ing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If we allow the natural defenses of our bodies to become unhealthy by constipation, and our .resistance and vitality lowered by nerve pressure, etc., why blame the germs because they attack us? That is the work to which they have been appointed by the Creator, and His laws cannot be broken. In the words of Dr. ■ Claude Bernard, the greatest physiologist of his day, “The microbe is nothing; it is the soil that is everything.” Injecting filthy serums, such as antitoxin, etc., into your blood stream and that of your little child, will not save you or it, but only makes matters a great deal worse; for, the blood being the life, its natural resistance is broken. To quote Fitzgerald: “So tender and so delicate are the various organs within us, and so precious the blood stream which flows through all our veins and arteries and through the millions of microscopic capillary vessels, that nature has provided a thick and tough protection for them in the skin which covers us all over. Only by means of. the mouth and gullet can anything enter us without grave danger; and even this means of access is elaborately furnished with tender membranes and delicate senses of taste and smell to warn us of lurking danger in the things we swallow. A stupendous, complicated and mysterious apparatus awaits these things inside, analyzes them and separates the good from the bad and injurious substances without delay. This elaborate organization, however, is far too cumbersome for the twentieth-century experts of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>r</sup> CONSOLATION </span><span class="font7">medical science, who, ‘knowing better what is needful for us than the God who made us,’ have devised costly nostrums to be injected direct into the blood stream by means of a syringe furnished with a hollow needle, which penetrates the tough skin provided by nature as a shield.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The great pioneer of the nursing profession, Florence Nightingale, wrote: “The specific disease doctrine is the grand refuge of weak, uncultured, unstable minds sueh as now rule in the medical profession,. There are no specific diseases; there are specific disease conditions,” To appreciate the full significance of this, let me call to your mind again Dr. Claude Bernard’s famous dictum, “The microbe is nothing; it is the soil that is everything,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A very eminent French doctor, Dr. Martin du Theil, has just published in Paris a book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Defence, by Means of the Nervous System.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In order to demonstrate the weakness of the germ theory of disease causation, this distinguished doctor takes, among others, the specific example of typhoid fever. He asks why we should regard the typhoid germ as the main factor in the disease if in a town of a thousand people only forty are taken with typhoid fever, although all the inhabitants drink the same polluted water. Obviously, he says, it is the soil in the diseased body, rather than the germ, to which we should direct our attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Hydrophobia </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Contributed by a Physician</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font7">NOTABLE failure was that of a young French postman, named Pierre Rascol, who, with another man, was attacked by a dog supposed to be mad, but not bitten, for the dog’s teeth did not penetrate his clothing; but his companion received severe bites. The latter refused to go to the Pasteur Institute, and remained in perfect health; but unfortunate Rascol was forced by the postal authorities to undergo the treatment, beginning March 9, On the following April 12, severe symptoms set in, with pain at the point of inoculation, not at the place of the “bite”, for he had never been bitten. On April 14 he died of paralytic hydrophobia, the new disease brought into the world by Pasteur.—Dr. Lataud, page 277. For a similar case, see page 345.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two young Frenchmen were bitten by the same dog at Havre. One died from the effects within a month, but before’ this the other man had sailed for America, where he lived for fifteen years in ignorance of the end of his former companion. Returning to France, he heard of the tragedy, and actually himself developed symptoms and within three weeks was dead of hydrophobia.—Dr. Lataud, page 262.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A lady returned from bathing and stated that she had been bitten by a dog. The anxious parents rushed her for Pasteur treatment. After fifteen treatments she became violently ill. Stricture at the throat,- eonvul-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY26, 1938 </span><span class="font7">sions, coma and death followed. On the way home from the funeral, the two girl companions who were bathing with her told the parents of the dead girl that she was not bitten by a dog, but by her young man friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Over 3,000 deaths are on record in reports from Pasteur Institute, of persons bitten by dogs, all of which deluded sufferers had taken the Pasteur treatment. On the other hand, the record of the London Hospital a few years ago showed 2,668 persons bitten by angry dogs; not one of them developed hydrophobia, and not one had been pasteurized.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Good Joke on Palm Springs</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Palm Springs, Calif., is an attractive resort, but still superstitious; and so, when Clyde Yates came down with smallpox, it had everybody in town vaccinated except Russell David Baumgardner, an ex-service man who had already had all the vaccines pumped into him that he cared for in this life. The town then quarantined Mr. Baumgardner in hi§ trailer, and his attorney, following plain warnings of his intentions, circulated the story all over that part of the world that Palm Springs was virtually one vast pesthouse. That did not help, the town any, and, besides, at last accounts Baumgardner was threatening to sue the town for depriving him of his liberties.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Interesting Facts Concerning Aircraft </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Contributed)</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font7">IRPLANES are lifted by the wings, not the engine. The engine pulls the craft through the air with sufficient speed to cause lift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A plane at an altitude and with the engine stopped can glide to earth by nosing down to a degree necessary to maintain forward speed. Gliding distance in still air is about twelve times the altitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Both the top and bottom surfaces of a wing give lift, the greater part of which comes as a result of a partial vacuum caused by the curve peculiar to the upper surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Speed gives controllability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The controls may be described as flaps which act on the air as they pass through it. There are three such flaps: the rudder, the ailerons for balance, and the elevators to rise or descend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An airplane that is stalled in the air has lost forward speed, lift and controllability, though the engine may be operating normally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Stalling may be done purposely or accidentally by climbing too steeply, resulting in an involuntary dive until speed, lift and control are regained. A stall near the ground is dangerous, due to the resultant dive and possible tailspin which starts from a stall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Throttles are hand-operated, and steering is done by foot pedals which actuate the rudder. Ailerons and elevators are connected to a hand control or “joy” stick, which in a circular movement operates both controls, simultaneously or independently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Heavier loads may be lifted in cold air than in hot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Department of Commerce regulations require aircraft manufacturers to have airworthiness certificates before commercial planes can be sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Each important structural part of a plane must be several times stronger than needed for any strain put on it in flight. When planes . pre damaged, a report must be filed with the Department of Commerce, and repairs made to specifications and approved by a department inspector. Flying time of airmen and aircraft must be recorded in a log book, subject to periodic inspection. In the vicinity of busy airports all ships must circle to the left, to avoid confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wings are called “planes”, hence the name “airplane”. Heavier-than-air craft have been built which carry a load greater than the weight of the craft itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Steam and Diesel engines have been used successfully to propel modern aircraft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Planes are in use which have immovable fins instead of a rudder, and are steered by banking. By means of flaps, high speed in the air with a heavy load is possible, and still comparatively slow landings are made with the flaps depressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tail skids act as a brake and a preventive of “ground loops”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With individually operated wheel brakes, the skid may be eliminated in favor of a swiveling tail wheel. Brakes are used to steer on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ships in the air balance on the wing at a point designated “center of lift”. About this point the useful load centers, including fuel which, in diminishing, does not affect balance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fuel is carried in wing tanks and fed by gravity, thus eliminating troublesome pumps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All such small items cut down weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Controllable propellers, Rie pitch of which may be varied in flight, enable a ship to climb steeper, cruise faster, and, on multi-engined ships, when one engine is inoperative the propeller blades can be feathered to give a minimum of air resistance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Baffle plates in tanks prevent an unbalancing rush of fuel during maneuvers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Take-offs and landings are made against the wind for better lift, quicker climb and slower landing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Banked turns prevent skids.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When in a vertical bank, the action of rudder and elevators reverse and must be compensated for by the pilot’s skill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One type of plane has flaps to quickly cut down excess speed gained in a dive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Conventional construction is welded tubing framework in the body called “fuselage”, wings of wood, and covering of cloth shrunk tight by a cellulose solution, or “dope”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tapered wings are most efficient for stunting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Landing gear is well forward of the balancing point, making planes tail-heavy on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A recent trend is just the opposite, noseheavy with a steerable wheel ahead of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">main landing gear. In large sleeper transports,. this makes a more comfortable horizontal position for the beds in landing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bumps felt when flying in disturbed air are not “air pockets’’, but are caused by rising and descending currents of warm and cool air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Air becomes thinner with altitude; hence aircraft are limited to a maximum ceiling averaging twelve to twenty thousand feet. Greater altitudes are attained with supercharged engines and breathing equipment for the crew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Aircraft engines will sometimes weigh less than two pounds per horsepower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wings carry loads ranging from six to more than twenty pounds per square foot of area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Popular with beginners are light planes that are slow flying and easy to operate. By a light plane is meant one that may be as large in general proportions as a heavier ship but lighter in construction, lower in power and with smaller load-carrying capacity. There are many such in operation that carry two persons, cruise'at seventy miles per hour, land at thirty, and use less than three gallons of fuel per hour. They are, however, hard to handle in high winds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>t</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Air traffic at large airports is so great that red and green electric signal lights, aimed like a gun, are used to direct planes as to whether they may or may not land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Transport ships are guided by radio beams; and when visibility is so poor that an airport without a beam terminal cannot be seen from one thousand feet altitude, the ship is required to proceed to another port with better visibility or one with a beam terminal to be guided to the ground.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Two Round Trips in One Day</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ By the American Airlines it. is now possible to leave Chicago at 12:30 midnight; arrive New York 6:08 a.m.; leave New York 8: 00 a.m.; arrive Chicago 12:30 noon; leave Chicago 1:30 p.m.; arrive New York 7:10 p.m.; leave New York 8:10 p.m. and arrive at Chicago at 12:40 midnight. Thus, lacking 10 minutes, in one 24-hour day one can four times span the distance of 751 miles separating America’s largest cities, with two complete round trips, and a lay-over of 2 hours 52 minutes in New York, and one hour in Chicago in the middle of the day.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Federal Reserve Racket</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Seventy-five of. the largest banks in the United States own more than 50.percent of the assets of the 15,000 banks now doing business. Twenty-seven percent of the loans and investments of all the 15,000 banks are held by 20 of those banks. Less than 600 firms own over half of the corporate wealth. At a, cost of 27c per $1,000 the 12 FederaLReserve banks issue money that is a blanket mortgage upon all the property and wealth of the people of this nation. Don’t you wish you could issue money that would be legal tender for $1,000 and that it would cost you only 27c? Barring this 27c, the Federal Reserve banking system uses the Government’s credit free of charge. Originally it was to pay some interest (the amount to be fixed by themselves), so the Federal Reserve Board fixed it at zero!!! Originally the racket was to-be for twenty years; this has been amended so that .it is to be perpetual (?). Next to the Roman Hierarchy, the Federal Reserve racket is one of the most powerful in the world. And the two work together. There is hardly a bank of any size that is not loaded up to the gills with the Hierarchy *s ‘ ‘ securities ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">I have seen them come in freshly gassed from the front line trenches. I have watched the long, long trains loaded with their mutilated bodies. I have heard the raving of those that were crazed and the cries of those who wanted to die and could not. I hate war for what it forces us to do to our enemies, slaying their children with our blockades, bombing their mothers in their villages, and laughing at our breakfast tables over our coffee cups at every damnable and devilish thing we have been able to do to them. I hate war for its consequences, for the lies it lives on and propagates, for the undying hatreds it arouses, for the dictatorships it puts in the place of democracies, and for the starvation that stalks after it.

<p><span class="font7">♦ The big fellows that control credit have been having a good time shaking out the little folks. Early in 1937 forty-seven of the principal industrial, railroad and utilities stocks were marketed at an average price of 88.7. By the end of October they had dropped to 39.4, representing a shrinkage of $25,000,000,000. Don’t ask who got the money; it was the same old crowd, merely working the pump again, cleaning out the pockets of those who had saved something. There is no occupation they enjoy more. They sold out at the right time and the public bought at the wrong time; as soon as the public were loaded to the gills they were forced to sell and their lords took all.</span></p>

In case of a war a battleship would be of about as much use as a palm-leaf fan in hades.

<p><span class="font12">Q</span><span class="font7">UESTION : Recently the chief executive of the State of New York told the National Preachers’ Mission that &quot;once again religion must come to rescue the world from barbarism and destruction”. How does this compare with the course of religious organizations during the World War period and since ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Answer: That speech by the governor, who, by the way, is a Jew religionist, shows that he has no conception nor understanding of the great danger religion is to the rights and liberties of the people. Religionists claim to be followers of the Prince of Peace, Christ Jesus, and yet they take a course directly opposed ■ to Christ Jesus and His kingdom. Although the law of God, which Jesus always obeys, commands that man shall not commit murder, yet during the World War practically all the religious organizations were vigorously advocating that “America enter the war”; and when America did enter the war, the religionists turned their church buildings into recruiting stations and urged the young men to go to fbe war and die. They were heard constantly crying out, “The war will make the world safe for democracy.” The facts show that the World War made -the nations safe for dictatorship and democracy is practically dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The reason that religion is such a great danger to the people is this: Religion was first organized by Satan the Devil, with Nimrod as the chief visible representative. (Genesis 10: 8-10) Since that, all the nations have had some kind of religion. Religion is a superstition that turns the people away from God and turns their minds to creatures or things in defiance of God’s law. The purpose of the Devil in organizing and carrying on religion is to carry out his original challenge made to Jehovah, in which he declared that Jehovah God could not put on earth men that would remain faithful and true under the test. Religion has been the chief means of carrying out that wicked challenge. Instead of reli-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 26, 1938 </span><span class="font7">gion’s coming to the rescue of the world to save it from barbarism, religion has been the cause of the greatest amount of barbarism ever practiced under the sun. Since the World &quot;War the religionists, and in particular the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, have been pushing forward to destroy all who are in opposition to religious institutions. It was religion and religionists that prosecuted the cruel war in Abyssinia, murdering many persons without any just cause or excuse. It is a religious organization that fomented and is now pushing the rebellion in Spain, which has already resulted in the destruction of great multitudes of persons, including many who arc entirely defenseless. The worst part of religion is this : That it reproaches and defames the name of Almighty God and is opposed to His kingdom under Christ, which Kingdom is the only hope of the world. Jehovah, pointing to Christ Jesus, the King, who shall rule in righteousness, said: “Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased; I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall declare judgment to the nations. And in his name shall the nations hope.” (Matthew 12:18,21, A.R.I<sup>7</sup>., margin) Religion is opposed to every interest of the people of every country. It seems quite certain that if the governor above mentioned understood and appreciated the great evils that result from religion, he would never have made the statement he did. Instead of the people’s needing religion, they need a knowledge and understanding of God’s Word and the blessings that God has in store for mankind by and through His kingdom under Christ Jesus, the Prince of Peace, who shall rule the world in righteousness. Concerning Him it is written in the Word of God: “The government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end. ’ ’ (Isaiah 9:6,7) His government will be a righteous government; as it is written: “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness.” (Isaiah 32:1) Religion will never accomplish any good, but lasting harm; and for that reason the Lord’s kingdom will destroy all religion and religious organizations and turn the minds of all those who will live to Jehovah God and righteousness.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>In the Creator’s House</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">S</span><span class="font7">O BIG is this wonderful house that the human mind<sup>1</sup> cannot conceive the vast distances which separate its gigantic parts. Such incomprehensible distances are believed to exist between the stars and planets that wc are prone to accept without question the conclusion that this little earth will never be in closer communication with the other spheres of the universe than now. But in the face of recent discovery and the application of laws long unconceived (except in the fanciful minds of discredited fiction writers), who will tell us what shall be tomorrow? or what shall not be? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With nature daily yielding its long-cherished secrets of a thousand things to the restless probings of man; with the much-derided dreams of centuries past the accomplished commonplaces of our everyday life, should we not ask, How far have we come?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A hundred years ago who would have believed the “absurdity” of a mail service from England to Australia operating to a weekly schedule? or that the thousands of intervening miles could be traversed within three days? Who would give credence, when our. forefathers pored over their schoolbooks, to a prophecy that shadows on whitened walls would reproduce a thousand times the scenes of distant lands and past events, together with the sounds and voices incident to the original fleeting moment, and repeat the same for the pleasure and instruction of the thousands and millions denied all possibility of seeing the given scenes in actual fact ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yet where, in “civilized” lands, do people gape in amazement at such accepted triumphs of “science” and speak of wit ch craft? A few generations ago the very mention of such possibilities would have labeled the utterer with that very brand, to his probable violent death as a “witch”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And how far have we traveled? Shall anyone refrain from expressing a conjecture of possible future applications of probable future knowledge which will render our present triumphs obsolete? Is the scope of man’s mind to eease extending with Armageddon? or are our present experiences merely a gap in the veil as it begins to part upon the wonders Jehovah has reserved for those who love Him and fear . Him—-wonders that will transport the willing and obedient into such realms of practical delight as the unaided human mind could never possibly conceive?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a certain issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> the fact was noted that by means of electrical and electronic devices the human voice had actually been increased in volume or loudness four million times. A veiled comment aroused the question: “If such a principle is ever applied to light, will not the largest telescope become merely a child’s toy? the most powerful microscope a relic of past endeavor?” May not such means be used by the great King of the universe to enable communication among the myriad mansions in His House? Will it then be said that the earth, the home of man, is a mere speck in unbridgeable space ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is claimed that the possible amplification of the human voice by radio is restricted only by the limitations of available apparatus; which means that if it were possible to construct the mighty valves and transformers required, and feed them with appropriate voltages, there might be produced a voice of such power that it would encircle the earth. This is no mere dream! The potentialities of the subtle power that makes living speech of lines on a celluloid strip and opens doors at the winking presence of a passing form cannot be measured nor its limitations conceived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And if the same unlimited powers of amplification be applied to light, what shall we then see? May not the uttermost bounds of God’s universe become,as closely linked as any two antipodean cities of earth in the imminent time of television? Why should we then feel isolated? Would the now “far-distant” stars and planets be discussed in terms of “lightyears”, or of wave-lengths and frequencies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fancy (or imagination) not based upon truth is aimless; but it is of profit at times to try . to penetrate the veil of future things and contemplate on the basis of known attainments the possibilities of later times. To say we have reached the end of knowledge and the application of it would be foolishness—none will do so; but if wo ask, ‘ ‘ What shall be ? ” who will answer us? Jehovah will undoubtedly do so in His own good time; and it cannot be wrong for His creatures to try to visualize some general applications of probable future scientific revelations from the. Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Time was when many months separated men who were many miles apart. Distance has always been closely related to time; for miles are only terms to indicate the time required for communication from point to point. Follow this closely. A thousand miles between two cities were reckoned also in the weeks of travel by land and sea that would be occupied in sending word from the one to the other. When steam eame, and superseded the previous mode of transit—horses ’ hoofs—the clipping short of the time required in transit shortened also in the human mind the conception of actual geographical distance. Distances traversible in one-tenth of the time previously required became, for communication and travel, one-tenth the length, while the people affected became so much the closer. Distance, then, is inseparable from time, since the only reason for being interested in distance is that we might know how long it will take to travel or to communicate over the given span.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the hoofs of stage-coach horses first thundered through the dust of night and day it was thought by conservative minds that the sixteen miles per hour thus maintained was “Hying in the face of Providence’<sup>1</sup>. Who would then have believed the possibility of such speeds as the forty m.p.h. introduced a little later! And why? Because the means to do sueh “impossibilities” were not as yet discovered I But wdien steam brought the seabeach to the back doors of almost every European city, no one staggered in unbelief—the means were apparent. One by one the barriers of skepticism have been broken down by demonstrable means and accomplished facts, till today we look into a fog of speculation and with wistful eyes long to sec it lift and reveal the glorious landscape beyond. Let us not be fretful, but patiently abide the Lord’s due time, doing now what Me gives our hands to do; but let us quietly think a little as we vrork.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A generation ago the telegraph,' for communication purpose, annihilated the Atlantic. That vast ocean disappeared, and men on either side were in immediate communication at will. Time sped on, and the telephone, enlarged the scope of that accomplishment, so that a man may often be traced by ringing phone after phone among the places he is known to frequent, until he is at length located and called up to speak. No one doubts that this is done, every day, in every country enjoying the benefits of telephony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 26, 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shall we stop here? or will the Lord permit and provide for still further advances? When shall radio itself cease to modify our conditions of living and our outlook? Just consider the possibilities. If the money used today on armaments were applied to facilitating intercommunication we might have a scene like this (and it is a possibility, even now, if men were willing to use their money to that end) :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One friend ineeting another asks: “Have you seen So-and-so lately!” “Not for months,” comes the reply; “I believe he’s abroad.” Then the first'draws from a pocket an instrument resembling a hand-telephone, with dial attached. Saying, “We’ll see,” he operates the dial much as we do today, and presently speaks, asking of the invisible one, “Where are you?” To him comes back the answer: “I’m in Hong Kong at present. Coming back for the week-end. Sec you then”; and so on. One may be riding, walking, or sitting on a park bench, when a buzzer in a breastpocket tells you that someone, somewhere in the earth, wishes to ask or tell you something. You adjust your own instrument and converse as in a modern, telephone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this way time and distance are forgotten. The actual bodily position of the persons concerned is of no account; for no matter where that may be, the wave-lengths of the instruments will locate the wanted ones. Add to this the refinements of television, and the picture seems complete. Time, space, and distance are no more, so far as travel and communication are concerned, for all such at will are abolished, and mind to mind expresses itself as freely over thousands of miles as if both were at arms’ length. And with actual speed of transport far surpassing anything dreamed of even today, will not every part of the earth become to every inhabitant no more awesome than a present-day inter-suburban visit? And so, here are glimpses of what is meant by the annihilation of space and time: that, for creatures in harmony with Jehovah, and using the laws and forces under His command and by His provision, space and time do not exist, since they offer no impediment to desired intercourse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To make this a little clearer: London is just about five hours ahead of New York time; that is, it is midday in London five hours before it becomes midday , in New York. If a man w'ere able to traverse the distance be-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">19</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">tween the two cities in five hours, leaving London at noon, he would arrive in New York at noon—apparently having spent no time at all; yet five definite hours arc involved. Where are they ? How would they he recorded ? How could they ? Further, if he could travel still a little faster, covering the distance in three hours, he would then be leaving London at noon, and arriving in New York at ten o’clock—'‘two hours before he started from London”! What has happened to the time? You don’t believe that will ever come? No more did our forefathers believe that iron ships would float, or any of the myriad miracles surrounding us today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So! And what can the angels do more? That, Jehovah will reveal in His due time. Their work is not our business, nor the means the Lord gives them to do it; but surely these conceptions of what will be under the kingdom of God show' how limited has been our provincial thinking hitherto. It may be that planet will thus communicate with planet, &gt;&nbsp;discussing the Father’s works, across chasms of space, till every part of God’s great house is acquainted with every other part, and 'all giving constant praise to Him who made them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">May there not come times, too, when every creature will' stand with head uncovered, tuned in to Zion, while the eternal Father himself addresses his children, throughout those countless glopious mansions,—the revered Head of His own great House?—Percy A.

<h5><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>No Nazi Statement Can Be Believed</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ No Nazi official statement or promise of any kind can be believed at all. Joachim Hans Wandel, German airman captured by the Basques, not only admitted participation in the bombing of Guernica, but also admitted that he enlisted in Berlin after the international ban on foreign volunteers, to which Germany subscribed, had gone into effect. Moreover, he was recruited at the official Berlin office for Spanish volunteers, although he was of age for compulsory military service in Germany.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>Restrictions upon Jews</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Jewish musicians may not play in German operas, and in their own conceits they may not use the music of German composers. In certain parks -ire benches marked “For Jews Only”. Jewish loan libraries may not have German customers, Jewish bookshops may not sell German books, and Jews may not sell German newspapers. Jewish papers may not be sold in German subways. Hotels receiving Jews are boycotted.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>Koenigsberg Nearly Lost to Hitler</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The German cruiser Koenigsberg, laden with arms for Franco, was nearly delivered to the Spanish Republic instead. A plot of seamen to take over the vessel was betrayed, and thirty men were executed immediately thereafter.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>Germany’s Economic Debacle Near</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ There are 1,754,000,000 more marks in circulation in Germany today than there were when the scum of the country began the management of its affairs. Of the 33,000,000,000 marks invested in armaments 27,000,000,000 were financed on short-term notes which can never be paid. The Jews arc tightening their boycott; barter agreements are not working well; Brazil will not sell any more coffee. A financial smash that will involve the whole world is not far ahead. Let it come.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>Germans Not Interfered With</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Officials of the Spanish Republic claim that in June, 1937, in four days five German steamers and one Belgian ship laden with immense quantities of wa? materials, including 400 cannons, Landed at the Rebel port of Pasajes, Spain, under the very eyes of the British border-control, and were not hindered in the least. Protests, but of no use, were made to the Non-Intervention Committee, which, apparently, is a unit in wanting the Hierarchy to win, and the Spanish Republic to be defeated.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>The Recruiting Office at Oranienburg</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The recruiting office at Oranienburg, Germany, accepts candidates for the war in Spain, and trains them two months, during which they receive 450 to 580 marks per month. When they leave for Spain they dress in civilian clothing and are under signed statements pledging themselves to reveal their destination to no one. Numerous wounded Germans have been sent back from Spain by airplane. And, of course, when the planes return to Spain they do not fly empty.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark111"></a>Bombs from the Reindorf Factory</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ With German bombs from the Reindorf factory, German planes bombarded the civil population of Guernica, Spain, reducing it to ashes and pursuing women and children with machine-gun fire. The same crowd killed 200 in Durango, 14 of whom were nuns, and then sent out word to the w<sup>r</sup>orld that the deaths had been caused by Marxist mobs. It seems a set policy of General Franco, the Butcher, to accuse the Spanish government of the crimes of which his side alone is guilty.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>Greece and Turkey</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>Nazi Police in Athens, Greece</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ What it means to have a nation go Hitlerwise may be judged from what happened to 24-year-old Chryssa Papadopoulos in her home city of Athens. Because she publicly protested against her nation’s following in the path of Hitler she was taken from the municipal hospital to the police station, was made to undress, was hung by her feet to the roof, was whipped with a knotted rope until she fainted, was then criminally assaulted, and is now about to become a mother. The Greek police have been reorganized on the lines of the Gestapo of German experts. The German army has also reorganized the Greek war office.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>Progress in the Near East</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Two little items in the Near East attract attention. The priests of the Armenian church went. on strike in Istanbul because the patriarch forgot to give them their pay checks on time. And at Jaffa the British government blew up a section of slums that have stood for hundreds of years, so that it could put in modern roads and modern buildings. The Arabs did not want to vacate and see their old shacks disappear, but they had to move. And it is well. Why honor anything merely because it is old and decayed </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">1</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>All Modern Dictators Are Alike</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The whole world is now aware of the fact that all modern dictators are alike, from Hearst in the West to Metaxas in the East. In a dispatch from Vienna to the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> Emil Vadney said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Similar to other dictators, Premier Metaxas likes to appear as Greece’s savior from Bolshevism, who prevented Greece from turning into a second Spain. He also brands everybody in Greece disagreeing with Fascist methods as an “enemy of the Greek nation bought by Moscow”.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>Seventeen Istanbul Beggars</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Seventeen Istanbul beggars organized a company, with one of their number as an accountant, to keep track of their earnings. Police seized the books and learned that these men, many of whose injuries were self-inflicted, averaged more than £200 a year apiece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 26, 1938</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark121"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>Greek School Boys in Rhodes</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ In the Greek boys’ high school at Veneto-clean, in the island of Rhodes, the students were given the opportunity to vote whether they would unfurl the Italian flag in commemoration of Mussolini’s slecping-ear march on Rome. They voted against the proposition, with the following result, as published by the Dodecanese magazine:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Italian armed constabulary sought to beat the boys to submission. Twenty of them were treated most brutally by the beasts of Fascism. Many of them were led under the points of bayonets into jails. There they stayed for ten days, ill fed and beaten daily, by the heroes of modern Italy. Mr. Anastassiades, the principal of the high school, disappeared. Some believe that he was forcibly exiled. Others claim that he was thrown into jail. The terrors of Fascism hide the truth.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>“The Perfect Father of Turks”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The meaning of the title &quot;Ataturk”, conferred on Kemal Pasha, is that he is ‘ ‘ the perfect father of Turks”. His picture is in every home that can afford pictures; he made reading and writing in Latin characters and figures compulsory; banned the fez; uncovered the faces of the women; adopted international time, the metric system, and. Pope Gregory’s calendar. He took over the Swiss Civil Code, the Italian Penal Code, and the German Commercial Code. One of the most capable living generals, he does not believe in war. He drinks like a fish, but it docs not seem to hurt him.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark125"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>No More Kurdish Revolts</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ There will probably be no more Kurdish revolts. The Turks slew 5,000 of them by airplane attacks, one of the most effective of which was by the 22-year-oId adopted daughter of Kemal Pasha himself. She dropped a bomb on the home of the Kurdish chieftain leading the rebellion, and that ended it and him. The Ataturk celebrated the occasion by giving all his property, lands, buildings, stables, cattle, etc., worth several million dollars, to the people.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>.Family Feuds in Turkey</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Family feuds in Turkey will be broken up by arbitrarily separating the combatants by distances of at least 300 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>Italy</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Military Training of Italian Children</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ It </span><span class="font7">may well be doubted that the world has ever seen the like of the training in militaryaffairs now being given to Italian youth. It begins at six years of age and ends at 55. The Wolf Cubs, six to eight years of age, are , taught to wear gas masks, handle diminutive ' rifles, march and sleep in tents. Their toys are military, including bicycles with steel windscreens through which they point imaginary machine guns. Girls, too, may join. Later come night drills, actual use of firearms, bayonet practice and all the usual instruction in the things of the Devil’s civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Italian Cannon Fodder Department</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The Italian cannon fodder department exempts the head of a family of ten children from paying any taxes, and aids those with large families under ten in number. Bachelors are subject to extra-heavy taxes. Italian girls need not bring any dowries if they marry Italian officers. Despite all these inducements, there were 3,000 fewer births in the first half of 1937 than in the first half of 1936, but in the corresponding period there were 52,000 more marriages. And so the cannon fodder department is not disheartened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Grateful Italy</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Referring to the debts of the Associated Murderers of the World to Uncle Sam, Mussolini’s personal mouthpiece, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Il Popdlo d’Italia,</span><span class="font7"> referring to Italy’s share in the conspiracy, said recently:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people continue to pretend they believe these debts will be paid one day. Now everyone knows this is materially and, above all, morally impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Italy’s Strength in the Air</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Mussolini is making good his threat of some years ago to make the sky black with Italian planes. And they are swift and powerful. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">new type is capable of flying up to 264 miles an hour and carrying a load of twenty tons, and there are some 20,000 trained pilots, the equal of any anywhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Italy Can Mobilize 8,000,000 in Few Hours ♦ In </span><span class="font7">a speech at Rome Mussolini made the statement that in a few hours Italy (ian mobilize 8,000,000 men. Sir Oswald Mosley, British Fascist, was recently in Rome (and Vatican City, too, no doubt) to confer with Mussolini and others, on methods for destroying the democracies of the West.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">This Particular Fake Not Well Done</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">♦ July 23, 1936, “Reverend Father” Raffaele Cordi di Pietro, priest of Paganico Sabina, Rieti, Italy, called the attention of his congregation to some * ‘ drops of blood ’ ’ issuing from the wafers supposed to represent God’s flesh. He claimed a miracle and invited the Vatican to investigate. The show was not well staged, and the priest was excommunicated, charged • with having effected an act of sacrilege and simulation. This was done to lend support to ■ the claims of the Hierarchy that other “miracles” which it endorses are genuine.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">New Airport Near Rome &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Italy will have a new airport for seaplanes five miles from Rome. A lake a mile and a half in diameter will be scooped out and joined to the Tiber, near the grounds where the International Exhibition is projected to be held in 1941. There are already three airports in the fifteen miles between Rome and the mouth of the Tiber.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Italian Troops in Spain</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Stung by the claim of the Spanish Republic that there are 100,000 Italian troops in Spain, the Italian Foreign Office has given out that there are only about 40,000 (as of October, 1937). It is anybody’s guess as to who is to be believed. Lloyd George accepts the Spanish Republic’s figures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Mussolini Getting in the Papers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">♦ What with his love affairs with strange women, and his notes to General Mancini, in charge of Italian army operations in Spain (with which country Italy is supposed to be at peace), Mussolini manages to crash the headlines.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Showing Its Ethiopian Claws</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Showing its Ethiopian claws and fangs, the Vatican 'bestowed a golden rose upon Queen Elena, using for the first time the Fascist title, “Queen of Italy and Empress of Ethiopia.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Eden’s Sympathy for Fascism</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Eden’s sympathy for Fascism (Catholic Action) is making Britain ridiculous in the eyes of all the world. Though Franco’s war against the Spanish Republic has never been even partially recognised by the British government by giving him belligerent rights, yet, when his planes sank a British vessel carrying wheat and condensed milk, Eden, instead of demanding an indemnity for this trespass on British rights, made a plea in favor of the Spanish rebel cause.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>Plucky W. G. Collins</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Plucky W. G. Collins, of Ebbw Vale, Monmouthshire, England, lost both arms while at work as a bricklayer, but today he supports himself, wife and children by work in an office. He handles a telephone by gripping it between chin and shoulder point, writes with a pen gripped in his teeth, and operates a typewriter by using his chin and nose. He also draws and paints well, and even plays the piano by the same means that he operates the typewriter.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>Worship of Union Jack</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ That many people actually worship the flags of their respective nations, and are expected to so do, is clearly shown in the following extract from “The Royal Law, Coronation Souvenir, 1937”, page 4, under the heading “We salute the Flag”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Grand old Union Jack! Fly'to the breezes of every wind under heaven, re</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font6">ding us all what citizenship of Britain means. What is implied, in the salute to the Flag<sup>1</sup>? Worship; Honesty; Industry, Wrong-doing is treason to the Flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Want Tuberculosis? <sub>]</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ Do </span><span class="font7">you want to crowd yourself into tuberculosis? That is just the way to get it: by crowding. In the city of Glasgow the tuberculosis death rate for one-room dwelling units is 1.76 per 1,000; for two-room units, 0.91 per 1,000; for four-room units, 0.66 per 1,000.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>Vivisection in Britain</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ In the year 1936, according to Government reports, 822,167 experiments were performed </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font7">living animals in Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">26,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Without Precedent in Naval History</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Without precedent in naval history was the action of two Italian war vessels in luring Spanish Republic vessels out to sea and away from their objective to defend the city of Malaga, Spain, which thereby fell into Rebel hands. At the end of the day the Italian vessels disclosed their identity, too late for the Republic’s vessels to profit by it. It was </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">typically Fascist (Catholic Action) move.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Cremation More Popular</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ In Britain last year 11,289 persons were cremated. This is a gain for the modem method which disposes of the dead without waste of ground, without superstitious reverence for the body of clay that no longer lives, without risk of burial alive, and without infection of the soil or the encouragement of bodysnatching by medical students and others.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark137"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark138"></a>Practical Television in London</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ B*tain is miles ahead of the United States in television, and always has been. It is estimated that about 50,000 televiewers within an area of 7,500 square miles saw and heard the coronation proceedings, and it is declared that the broadcasting and reception was a huge success. A television set of good quality costs about £80.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark139"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark140"></a>Rubber Boots for Sheep</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Foot-rot in sheep, which heretofore robbed British farmers of £500,000 a year, is now cured by fitting Ihc sheep with rubber boots, so designed that they hold the dressings in position until healing takes place. This usually takes a week.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark142"></a>150 Miles to the Gallon</span></h5>

<h5><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>Few Cats, Less Honey</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ An English village killed off its cats and lost its honey. With few cats, the field mice multiplied. They destroyed bees’ nests. Fewer bees pollenated less clover, and hence there was less honey for the bees to gather.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>Sound Car in Quebec </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By R. E. Browning</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font7">AS giving lecture at Attwater Bus transfer at 7 p.m. in Montreal. The lecture “Riches” finished with suitable closing announcement when a man at door says, “I am your first customer.” That was the third location in sequence with results; so with enthusiasm moved to fashionable Westmount adjacent to the Park, backing into island parking spot for one car, caused by a tree in the middle of the street. Saw a policeman before parking} but he was going the other way. “Riches” lecture was sounding out its message when a sprightly policeman arrives at the door: “You cannot make that noise here. Shut her down right away.” “But it will be over in two minutes, Officer.” “Oh, you must stop her down right now! The city mayor’s house is just over there, that red one. You must stop her right away.” “But, Officer, that would be an insult to Jehovah to stop that lecture.” “Oh, the whole world is an insult to Jehovah! All the people round here are Catholics, and they don’t belief the Bible. You must shut her down right away.” “If you want to step inside, Officer, and shut her down, you can.” “How much longer is it?” “Oh, about a quarter of a minute.” Then followed a closing announcement, and the advice to see the eity authorities, and how he would “get hell” if we continued, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In French and English Rosemount</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Last week in French and English Rosemount we had run in five locations. We were doing fine, and had just finished last position when a police officer appeared asking for authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“So far as preaching the gospel is concerned, Officer, authority comes from Jehovah; but we have no sound-ear license, because the city docs not issue one.” .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Well, you can’t go on without a permit. Is there room for me in front?” “Yes.” “Then we will go to the station,” etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Forty to fifty adults gathered around, and loads of children. At the station we received kindly treatment. This has been the writer’s experience at all times when contacting the police of Quebec province, with one exception, when the officer of the law went wild with rage when he could not remove the ignition key from my car, which is not possible on<sup>-</sup> that type unless it is in neutral. All the captain wanted last week was a ruling from the director of police, so as to know what to tell the complainers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In North Montreal</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While in Kingdom service in North Montreal recently, on Saturday afternoon, all went well until suppeytime, which we spent on the lawn at the kind invitation of a lady having a soft-drink stand. An importantlooking private citizen ventured the remark that he didn’t think we could do “that” about there. Whereupon we gave him the message that Jesus the King had begun His reign in 1914, etc. “Ah, a bit late, eh?” “Yes, according to organized religion, but not according to Paul, who said that Jesus had to sit at the right hand of His heavenly Father and wait until 1914.” “Oh, I don’t think you’re allowed to do that around here.” “Well, we are doing it all the time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After supper, which lasted one-half hour, the chief brought one of our workers to the sound car. When we mentioned something about Jehovah, the officer said, “Jehovah is a long ways from here.” “No, Officer. He is not a God dfar off, but near. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We had six hours in and were good and tired and miles away from home; so we moved out, and had the “joy” of seeing our important man, the informer, and the priest, sitting on a veranda and giving us the ha-ha. That was hard to take. But you fellows at headquarters say we must work with sagacity, and I guess that’s how it works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While giving the “Resurrection” lecture in French last Friday, three Frenchmen near the front of the ear listened closely to near the end, when two of them suddenly darted for their houses. But before their mission could bring results we had quietly moved on, lowering our speakers through the roof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">At Sainte Genevieve</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Last Saturday, equipped with a good French Canadian brother, E. Ouillette, sound car and nine other workers, we drove through two hours of drenching rain, hail like moth balls (honest), and lightning, to find fine weather at 4 p.m. in a French village. We stopped at a gas pump, and got permission</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">for sound. An organ solo by Jesse Crawford attracted plenty of attention, but nothing like the French Canadian voice which was carrying the Truth about the “Trinity” out to the people. From that spot we moved to another nearer to the eenter of the little town. This, of course, was nearer the church, which, of course, is Roman Catholic. (‘There ain’t no others round these parts.’) ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Information on the “Soul” began to issue forth in the native tongue, and fell on attracted ears, two of such articles being fixed very, very near the top end of an apparition in black skirts, which approached the sound car from the church two blocks distant, and asked the driver by what authority we were doing these things. How history repeats itself! Discussion was carried on in French with the French brother, while protection had to be given the sound car at the rear, mostly from a truck driver who had stopped close behind us and stepped on and held the horn while the talk over the sound car was in progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Later in the evening, after another French lecture had started, a tall, stately “lady” dressed in a crushed strawberry three-quarter-length cape advanced close to the driver’s face, villainously displaying an orange-si zed stone in each hand (I was glad I had put shatterproof glass in our sound car), threatening if we didn’t go away. As we didn’t move, she said, “Here are the police,” and wildly talked to two men in a car, who were listening. Whereupon the driver suddenly jumped out, yelling commands (he had no authority), and just as suddenly gave the driver a resounding backhander across the face.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark147">1</a></sup> The driver asked him if he was a Christian, and he snarled back that he was. So he was asked was it not strange that one Christian should hit another across the face. Thus ended a good day, and ten workers went home rejoicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The sequel to the professional liar’s visit to the car on Saturday was the following article in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">La Presse,</span><span class="font7"> Montreal (circulation, 1,200,000 daily), Monday, July 1.9, 1937:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WOULD-BE PROPAGANDIST STOPPED</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ste. Genevieve.—An intended lecture of the Disci pies of Jehovah sect was stopped Sunday at Ste. Genevieve de PieiTcfonds, county of Jacques Cartier, where they tried with the aid of loud speakers to make known their doctrines in a public park. We ignore the name of the individual in question. Yesterday morning at the masses in the parish church, M. L’Abbe Emery Laporte, viear, well versed in Holy Writ, refuted the errors of the propagandist on the Holy Spirit, and quoted many texts of the Bible.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>Great Bear Lake Radium Ore</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Discovery -of pitchblende, the chief commercial ore of radium, on the shore of Great Bear lake, Northwest Territories, Canada, has proved to be valuable. The ore is shipped by a combination of air service, boats on the Mackenzie river, and thence by rail to Port Hope, Ontario, a distance of over 3,000 miles, and pays, even at that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Quintuplets Worth a Half Million</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ At 33 months of age the Dionne quintuplets have $543,046.39 invested in government and government-guaranteed bonds and contracts for two years assuring an income of $200,000 a year, and no debts. The children are now being turned over to their parents, now virtually millionaires, and will be brought up along with the other children of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Uncertified Deaths in Newfoundland</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ One of the startling results of living in a sparsely settled land such as Newfoundland and Labrador is illustrated in the fact that in the year 1935, in these two districts, out of the 4,097 deaths which occurred, 1,287, or over 31 percent, were uncertified. That is, more than that percentage died without medical attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Derivation of “Canada”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ The beautiful Indian name “Canada” is derived from the Iroquois tongue, and originally meant a village. It was first used by the Indians to refer to the village of Stadacona, on the site of the modern Quebec City, and was applied by the white explorers to all the surrounding country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Cleaning a Pavement with a Magnet</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">♦ Carrying a magnet on the front of a truck for a distance of twelve miles in the province of Quebec resulted in picking up 18 pounds of nails, pins, hooks, bottle caps and other small pieces of metal. The experiment was considered a success.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>An Open Letter to Mr. Felix</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font7">T IS both with amusement and utter disgust that I read your pamphlet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rutherford Uncovered.</span><span class="font7"> I doubt seriously if you will have the courage to read this letter through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I was'reared in the Catholic faith by my parents, along with two younger brothers, as well as received a scant musical education from the nuns of this city, but for bigoted, religious intolerance, your booklet caps the climax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For parallel illustrations, first I point to the threat contained in the closing paragraph of your booklet, by Duffy, in reference to Rutherford, “This enemy [?] of the Stars and Stripes shall once again, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God willing, </span><span class="font7">wear the stripes of a convict. By my martyred boy I swear it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are but two major issues in this entire pamphlet; viz., the legality of the title “Judge” and the salute to the flag, the latter of which is the cause of the outburst. Throughout your entire pamphlet, no reference is made to any Scriptural teaching; for on this point your church has been challenged by 2,630,000 petition signers to bring forth your champion of your views versus Rutherford, and as the Scriptures state you would forebear to fight, they have scorned to debate the issues involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The above threat in paragraph three is a conspiracy and an offense indictable under Sections 19 and 20 of the Federal Penal Code, should it result in the conclusion your crowd hopes for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Constitution of the State of Ohio, adjoining my residence, and that of the State of Kentucky are almost identical in their language. No doubt your own State has a constitution with a similar article for the identical purpose. Article One, Section Seven, Rights of Conscience; the Necessity of Religions and Knowledge, reads—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience. No person shall be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship or maintain any form of worship against his consent [such as flag-saluting—an interpolation of mine]; and no preference shall be given, by law, to any religious society; nor shall any interference with the rights of conscience be permitted. [This would also include flag-saluting.] Religion, morality, and knowledge, however, being essential to good government, it shall he the duty of the Gen- .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">28 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">eral Assembly to pass suitable laws to protect every religious denomination in the peaceable enjoyment of its own public worship, and to encourage school?, and the means of instruction, '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In John 16:2 we read: “They shall put you out of the synagogues [churches]: yea, the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.” Why?. “And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor, me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">John 12: 43, “For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God,” is another reason why,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">John 11: 47,48, 53: “Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council [just as your booklet descrfbes], and said, What do we ? for this man doeth many miracles. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him, . . , they took counsel together for to put him to death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Matthew 26: 59: “ Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death”; and so they accused Jesus of blasphemy, sedition, treason, etc. (just as your pamphlet threatens you “ will scorch the brow of this new Benedict Arnold. Down with Arnold! Up with'the Stars and Stripes!”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Simon Peter, whom you claim as the first. pope (and an endeavor is made in the publication </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Testimony of History for the Roman Catholic Church,</span><span class="font7"> as published by the Paulist Press, to prove that Peter was the first pope and has had .many successors since), was guilty of using the sword in “defense”, for which Jesus rebuked him—“all they that take the sword, shall perish with the sword.” (John 18:10; Matthew 26:51,52) Peter, further, was a married man (Luke 4: 38); he cursed and swore (Matthew 26: 74 and Mark 14:71); he denied our Lord three times (Matthew 26:75); he lied (Matthew 26:7075). Jesus rebuked Peter: “What! could ye not watch with me one hour?” (Matthew 26:40) and‘on another occasion said, “Get thee behind me, Satan.” Peter would not fit in well with your Holy Name Society and their various parades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">None of the apostles were called “Reverend”, “Most Reverend,” etc., including Peter; for, note just the plain names Jesus, James, John, Peter, Paul, etc. So why quibble</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">over the title “Judge”? Jesus also questioned, “Why callest thou me good? There is none good, but one, that is, [Jehovah]” (Mark 10:18); but my! oh, my! how good you “Reverends” are! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">James and John asked of Jesus, “Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory,” Note Jesus’ reply to this, in Mark 10:38-40. Where, according to your religion, are the various popes, and Mary, along with the created saints of your church? I ask, By what authority are you called “Reverend Father”? If thousands desire to call J. F. Rutherford “Judge”, whether the same is a legal title or not, that is their privilege. There are thousands of Kentucky colonels—yea, school boys and adults, both male and female —who have no military connections, but bear this military designation. Note the many military titles within the Salvation Army, not awarded by a military court of the U. S. Government. Furthermore, perhaps you can cite in what book or booklet the author J. F. Rutherford uses the title “Judge” or refers to himself as “Judge”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The earth is the Lord’s, including the entire U. S. A., and the fullness thereof. It does not belong to a small minority who profess patriotism but in reality are actuated by anarchistic motives, the taking of lawless methods to achieve selfish ends. Vengeance belong-eth to Jehovah, and if this work be not of God it will come to nought.—Acts 5: 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Luke 9:1: “Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devil's;<sup>1</sup> ahd to cure diseases.” If you are one of the successors of the apostles, why don’t you cure the sleeping sickness, infantile paralysis diseases, etc., sweeping the country? Why did you not help to check the sweep of the Spanish flu during the year 1918? Why do you have Catholic doctors, if the bones (?) of “saints” and prayers suffice for cures?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the National Convention of the Churches of Christ held the last week of October in Columbus, Ohio, the editor of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Century</span><span class="font7"> declared: “Mankind will turn on its heels in scorn of a church which does once more what the churches did in 1914 and 1917 . . . thousands of clergymen will refuse to fight, they will refuse conscription.” Is this treasonable to you? This is much more than merely saluting a flag. Is your church willing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 2E, 1934 </span><span class="font7">and desirous to. receive this scorn the editor speaks of? Do you recall the ten commandments, in which it is written: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is ip the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them ” ? Do you believe and accept this scripture ? Do you recommend it to the “children of the ‘church’ ”? Do you concur in the attitude of the three Hebrews thrown into the fiery furnace, in their refusal to salute, or of Daniel in his refusal to acquiesce in the king’s command? If it came to the question of obeying the laws as set forth by the Vatican and those set forth by the Government of the United States, which might be in direct conflict one with the other, which would you obey? Would you be “treasonable” to the U.S. Government? The judge believes in obeying Jehovah God rather than men, just as the apostles admonished one to do. (Acts 5:28,29) What has been the attitude of the “Church” in Mexico, Spain, Germany, Russia, etc., to the existing governments? '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I fail to find the word “purgatory” in any concordance; likewise any Scripture containing the name. Can you enlighten me as to the location of said passage? Don’t cite 2 Maccabees 12: 46, where it says one can pray for the dead, as this is acknowledged not a part of Holy Writ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord’s prayer had best be altered to suit your religion, and the word “heaven” substituted by “Vatican City”, thus reading “Our Father, which art in Vatican City, etc.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By the way, the title of one of your records is listed wrong. It calls Mary the mother of Christ instead of God. Whence the correction ? —A. E. Franz, Kentucky.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“Honest?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Uh-huh. Right out there.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bunny turned too suddenly and bumped her head on the window. There was a soft flutter of wings outside as several birds hurried away to safety. At the same time Bunny set up a frightful howl,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“What is wrong, darling?” asked Jane,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“She bumped her head on the window,” explained Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bunny stopped crying long enough to sob, “It didn’t hurt a bit,” then went on with her weeping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jane looked puzzled. “If it didn’t hurt, why are you making all those tears?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“They went away,” wailed Bunny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“What did, Bunny?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The birds. The window made a noise and , seared the birds and they all went away. ’ *</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“And that’s why you’re crying?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But the birds will come back. Ydu just keep quiet and see if they don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Jane,” said Buddy, “Bunny saw a bird with snow stuck on its stomach.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“With what?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Snow on its tummy,” put in Bunny. “It sat in the snow, and when it got up the snow was frozed on its tummy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jane laughed. “That was a snowbird.” “Sure,” Bunny agreed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘ ‘ But it didn’t have snow on it. Its feathers are white. Its real name is Juneo, and it is such a'dear, friendly little fellow.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Is it cold?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“No, Bunny. But it might be hungry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Buddy gave it crumbs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“That’s fine. But do you see what is happening? The big snow flakes are covering them all up. Soon the birdies won’t be able to reach them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“What can we do about it?” asked Buddy. “Maybe we don’t need to feed the birds.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But we do. Thousands of those dear, fluffy, gay little fellows die every winter when the snow is deep. If people aren’t thoughtful enough to feed them, they are sure to die. ’'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Then they won’t sing in summer time,” murmured Bunny, sorrowfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Not only that, but they won’t be able to eat the insects which ruin our gardens. The birdies that die during the winter would have eaten whole truckloads of bugs during the summer. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Buddy looked outside again where a wet snow had changed every tree, shrub, and weed into a fluffy, white mass. “What will we do?” •</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘ ‘ Suppose we make a feedboard for them. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“What good will that do? The snow will cover it, too.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Not the kind we make. Ours will have sides and a roof.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bunny’s eyes sparkled. “A playhouse!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Yes, dear, and a glass one at that, if Daddy will help us make it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A glass roof, too?” asked Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“No. We’ll have a roof made of wood, and slanted to let the snow slide off. But Daddy can make the three sides of those little panes of glass he has in his workshop. The fourth side we ’ll leave open for the birds to fly in/ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Will there be a glass floor?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The floor will be made of wood. We’ll let it stick out past the walls all around for the birds to fly onto.” ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Won’t snow come in the open side?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Not often. You see, most of our snows come from the northeast, so we’ll turn the front of the house to the south. Our biggest job will be to keep water for the birds. It will always be freezing.” ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Water too?” Buddy was surprised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Of course. Birds need water just as we do, but they can’t get it when everything is frozen. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Look at the junk!” cried Bunny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Junk? Oh, you mean junco!” and surely enough, there on the ground outside was a little gray and white snowbird. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark158"></a>Winter Sport—Cover Design for This Number</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">E</span><span class="font7">VERY season brings its own pleasure as well as discomforts, and winter is no exception. Discomfort there is, in a way, but how much of real enjoyment both the aspect and activity of winter bring to the person who is in fair health. The brisk cold, the clear air, no less than the*beautiful snow and the ice on pond and stream, call to action. Hence winter sport. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!” Sleigh-riding is one of the joys of the winter season. Coasting is another. Skating a third. And where snow is abundant and bills are available, skiing provides a thrill for the daring, and perhaps for some who are not so daring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Winter is a season of delight for the young. Youth gets its full measure of good, clean fun out of the frigid span. Where there is a hill the fun is undoubtedly increased; but in event of its absence there is still abundant opportunity for enjoyment, with such a medium for sport as is the snow, available in such quantities. Everywhere it calls for attention, for use, for profligate wastefulness. Here there is no need to economize in one’s materials. The snow fort and the snow man may be made as large as ambition can visualize it, and ammunition for the defense of the fort may be laid up in plenteous store. What denizen of the snowless dimes can understand and appreciate the sport that the inhabitant of the favored northern regions enjoys during the winter months?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No need for bacchanalian festivities to liven things up. No need for artificial aids in the pure enjoyment of nature’s winter sport. No need for tinsel and trappings within the home /to offset the beauty without. Winter sport is simple sport, clean sport, healthful sport, and most enjoyed by the unspoiled simplicity of youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah “made summer and winter”. (Psalm 74:17) The marvels of the winter season are of His devising. We cannot but think that He finds satisfaction in the pleasure that winter sport brings to His human creatures.</span></p>

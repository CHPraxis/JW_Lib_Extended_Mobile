<p><span class="font8">♦ At Voltago, Italy, a group of girls said . they had been visited by the virgin Mary, and ' they had touched the rosary which she carried, but when they tried to cut off a corner of her sash Mary beat it. Usually a thing like this goes over big; and it did in Italy. Tens of thousands came to the city; but the bishop of Belluno thought it was a little bit too raw, and instructed the clergy to discourage the demonstration, which was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Blessed the “Hpiy Fire<sup>5</sup>*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ A picture in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The People,</span><span class="font8"> London, shows Bishop Myers blessing the “Holy Fire” outside Westminister Cathedral recently. After a little practice a bishop gets so he can bless the holy ash can, make a straight shot with a soger at the holy waste basket, or decorate the holy cuspidor with a perfectly straight face, confident that the common people are so foolish they will swallow it all without turning a hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Maybe You Heard It Before</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">, ♦ Maybe you heard before about the Pullman car porter that was told by a certain man to be sure to put him off at a certain station, no matter what he said or did. Late the next morning he woke up to find his station fifty miles in the rear. He sought out the porter and bawled him out right. The porter took it resignedly but finally said, “Go on; it’s nothing to what the man said and did that I did put out. ’ *</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ The Chicago </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">News</span><span class="font8"> makes it all plain as to the difference between Socialists, Communists and Fascists, thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you have six cows, the Socialists take three and leave you three; the Communists take all six; the Fascists leave you all six, and make you feed them, but they take the milk.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ In Auckland, New Zealand, a Mr. Brown was astonished to see in the morning paper an announcement of his death. Calling up his friend Smith to inquire if he had seen it, he was astounded when Smith cautiously replied, “Er—yes; where are you talking from?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">In deleting the second commandment from the law of God as given to Moses, the Hierarchy show they have a guilty conscience. They encourage the use of images and likenesses in the formal worship of Catholics. The excuse is made, of course, that they do not accord these images the same honor that is given to God, but merely show them a lesser degree of honor. Surely, say they, we should show respect to images and likenesses of angels, saints and the cross.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The honest Catholic population, and there are millions such, are urged to diligently compare the ten commandments given by Jehovah God to Moses, and recorded in Exodus, chapter 20, of the Bouay (Catholic) Bible, as given below, with the extract from the Catechism, opposite thereto, in the right-hand column. Notice that Jehovah God's second commandment, appearing in Exodus 20:is omitted altogether, and that this subterfuge is covered up by splitting the tenth commandment into two portions falsely labeled 9 and 10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">My bear Mr. Hall:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">You sure must have read that book called </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> very hastily or else “you could not take it”, since you wrote the following at the time you returned it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“All men tell lies, only the Bible tells the truth, so here is your book of lies: X prefer reading the Bible. 1 think it would be advisable for you also to read the Bible instead of reading such filthy lies as there is in this book. Do you know which was the first church to preach the gospel! When you look<sup>1</sup> it up you will find it was the Roman Catholic Church, and it will be the last.” [Signed] ... “A devoted Catholic.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is natural for all men to tell lies: we are all imperfect; but I don’t see any excuse for any to be as big liars as the Catholic priests and nuns, and, in fact, anyone who is with them or around them. I know this to be a fact, because I was a Catholic myself for forty-five years, was raised up in it, served mass hundreds of times and took part in all the foolishness they go through with. I call it foolishness because it is all borrowed from paganism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now you say that you read the Bible; so, if you want a real ‘' hangover ’ ’ for tomorrow morning, just try to hook up the mass with the Bible. Did it ever occur to you that if the Catholic church really were the first church to preach the gospel, then Jesus Christ should have been a Catholic; but we find the Bible says He was a Jew. The Bible also gives the genealogy of Christ, which is found in the first chapter of Matthew. Every generation [in the lineage] of Christ is given there, and they were all Jews clear back to David. The Jews are farther away from being Catholic than any other denomination. They know it is idol worship. That is why the pope hates the Jews and is trying to run them out of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And, by the way, did you know that the word “Catholic” is not in the Bible? It is not even in the Catholic Bible, except in the footnotes, where some monk put it there. These might be good questions to ask your priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Think it over, fellow, rub the mist from your eyes, and look around. You are some better off than some of the Catholics, anyway. I say this because you read the Bible, so you said. I have an aunt here who calls herself a “devoted Catholic” and yet she told me that if I were to bring any Bible, even a Catholic Bible, into her house she would figure I was bringing the Devil in. If you get mad about this it only proves that you can’t take it. I mean the truth. If you don’t write me I will figure you got mad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since I have been out of that church (so-called “church”) many people have asked me why Catholics get mad when you talk about religion, The only answer I can give is, Because they are kept in the dark about the Bible and when they can’t find an answer they get mad. Not more than two percent of the CatH-olics around here have Bibles. Here are a few scriptures [from the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Douay]</span><span class="font8"> to ask your priest about:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Matthew 23:9: “ Call none your father upon earth,” etc. In the Catholic teaching it says the soul is immortal and cannot die. Now Ezekiel 18:4,20 says, “The soul that sinneth, the same shall die.” I suppose you rattle the rosary off by the hour; but in Matthew 6:7 it says, when you are praying, not to speak much, as the heathens; for they think that for their much speaking they may be heard. In John 5:39 it says, ‘Search the Scriptures; for you think in them you have life everlasting; and the same are they that testify of me.’ How many Catholics do this, when most of them haven’t-a Bible? In the 8th chapter of John, 31st verse, “Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, If you continue in my word, you shall be my disciples indeed.” Notice it says “Jews”, and not “Catholics”. His disciples were Jews. The Roman Catholic church teaches that the church is God’s house and He is always in it. Now the Bible says, in Acts 7:48, ‘Yet the Most High dwelleth not in houses [some Bibles say “temples”] made with hands.’ Look it up; don’t be blind. Also read Acts 17:24; it speaks of temples here and that He does not dwell in them. Read what it says in Acts 20:20, how Paul taught publicly from house to house. If you have the Truth, why don’t you do this ? It is your duty, if you claim to be a footstep follower of Christ, The Bible says, in Romans 5; 12, all men have sinned. Yet I have a brother-in-law who is a “devoted Catholic” and he says a priest can’t sin. Do you believe this? If you do, you are believing a lie, In the 2d chapter, 15th verse, of Paul’s letter to the Galatians, Paul says,- “We, by nature, are Jews, and not of the Gentiles, sinners.” Now he did not say “Catholics”. This shows Paul was a Jew, and not a Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is a good one for you to take notice of: It says, in Hebrews 10:11, that the priests daily offer sacrifices that can never take away sins. And my grandfather willed the priest $150 or $200 to pray him out of “purgatory”; and you can’t find the word “purgatory” in the Bible. This is a man-made racket, and millions have fallen for it, and you are one of them. The Roman Catholic church teaches her people to have respect for the pope and the priests, but the Bible tells us if we have respect as to persons we commit sin. This is found in James, chapter 2, verse 9. Look it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your church is full of statues of Christ and the apostles and the saints. This is clearly for-bidden in Exodus, 20th chapter, 4th verse. In this verse it plainly states not to make any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or in the earth beneath, nor of those things that are in the waters under the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, then, just who are the liars? What is “truth”? The answer is, The opposite of a lie. What is a lie ? The opposite of truth. It’s got to be the one or the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Exodus 20:4 says not to make any image or likeness of anything that is in heaven or anywhere else; and you know that your church is full of these things. Now turn to the book of Wisdom in your Catholic Bible and read the 14th chapter, 8th verse, which says: “But the idol that is made by hands, is cursed, as well it,«as he that made it: he because he made it; and it because being frail it is called-a god.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am yours very sincerely,</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Catholic Action Adopts Foundling</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17">C</span><span class="font8">OMMUNISTS are usually athfeists. Atheists are opponents of religion, especially of the “holy Ro man’* variety. Atheists deny the existence of Almighty God. When an atheist-propagandist joins hands and consorts with, and renders aid, comfort and assistance to the “holy” church in its war against humble servants of Almighty God and His Christ, that, dear fellow thinkers, is something. Listen, therefore, to the tale of Charles P. Windle, sometimes called C. Pliny Windle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Chicago, in a dingy little office cluttered with magazines, newspapers and pamphlets, Pliny Windle has embarked on his new campaign in defense of religious freedom of that much abused (tears), long-suffering (more tears), persecuted and maligned (“whales” of anguish here), satan ie, demoniacal, diabolical and execrable aggregation of parasitic, religious racketeers called the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For many years the Windle family were exponents of atheism and opponents of religion, but that form of propaganda seems to have petered out. Something was needed in its place, and as C. Pliny looked over the field the Catholic racket looked like a good source of income. Those priests know how to collect the shekels from the flock. Why couldn’t he share in the fruits thereof?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So he takes his pen in hand and brings to birth a conglomeration of words entitled “The Rutherford Racket”, making it a part of a series called “Truth and Light”. Its announced purpose is to .combat Communism and religious prejudice against the Catholic church. He claims that as a non-Catholic he can render efficient aid to the abused old , snake-in-the-grass, and, of course, at a profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A sample of the “truth and light” in his brochure is shown in this paragraph from page five:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“He [Judge Rutherford] mixes unwarranted assumptions, brazen falsehoods, agonizing prophecies, misapplied biblical quotations and weird intellectual interpretations of the Scriptures into an intellectual dish that must give many a Witness of Jehovah a bellyache in the place where his brains ought to be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It’s not a difficult task to rattle off a bunch of adjectives and nouns from a typewriter and call it “truth and light”. It goes over well with the beskirted gentry who have been dodging a debate with Judge Rutherford these many years; but to be an article of worth along the lines of truth and light some proof ought to be produced. Some of the alleged “unwarranted assumptions” Pliny mentions should be shown. The “agonizing prophecies, misapplied biblical quotations” and “brazen falsehoods”, if such there be, should be brought into the cold light of day for all to read. Windle knows that he cannot do that, and neither can his priestly nurses. If it produces some of the greatly desired long green, why should he worry about the truthfulness of the allegations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Hierarchy’s “inspected and passed” </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Irish World and American Industrial Liberator</span><span class="font8"> (New York City) in its issue of December 11, 1937, sniveled and sobbed almost a column of favorable quotation from and comment on Windle and his effusions about Jehovah ’s witnesses, and especially Judge Rutherford, under a bold headline, three columns wide: “Non-Catholic Lecturer Raps the Ill-Informed Who Speak Blind Prejudices.” The editorial motto of this step-papa to atheism is a “holy” utterance of the Hierarchy’s Archbishop MacHale, nobly printed in each issue: “ If you wish to have an honest press, you ought honestly to support it.” It’s lovely to have such lofty and sublime aspirations about an honest press, but just how closely the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Irish World</span><span class="font8"> adheres to the exalted sentiments of its patron archbishop can be judged from its whole-hearted approval of a Godless writer’s profane disseminations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An ambassador to convey this precious “truth and light” (not forgetting to collect the circulating medium therefor) to the waiting dupes was needed. Thereupon one Leo Connelly, alias R. J. Keyes, alias Tom Bosey, alias----Fitzpatrick (he didn’t have time to</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">think of a first name), noamed through Ohio soliciting orders. Windle wrote to him that he was doing fine, and discussed the delicate financial situation, suggesting that perhaps the “Most Reverend Bishop” at Cleveland might help at that critical point with a loan of a substantial order for a supply of lumps of lies, alias “truth and light”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Said Pliny: “ It would be the greatest thing he [the bishop] could do to help build a mighty bulwark against atheistic communism, Rutherford’s religious prejudice, and enemy forces which aim at the destruction of religions, morality and inalienable rights.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And if it doesn ’t take too many of his shekels, the “most reverend bishop” may take a flyer at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bishop Sheil, alias the Most Reverend Bernard J. Sheil, D.D., vicar general of the archdiocese of Chicago, is also supposed to come across for Pliny’s project with something more substantial than a sacerdotal, blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Connelly, alias Keyes, alias Bosey, alias Fitzpatrick, also did a little gum-shoe work for the “cause”. He called on some of the companies of Jehovah’s witnesses, talked with them, procured liberal quantities of books and booklets, and evidently tried hard to find some “communists” and “communist propaganda” to prove the need for building up that desired bulwark. He told some wonderful fiction of his great and burning love for truth, and of injuries inflicted on him by papists. He didn’t deceive Jehovah’s witnesses, who told him to go on his way and cease pretending to be what he is not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Catholic.Hierarchy, with all its wealth and its oodles and oodles of “holy” societies and orders, dare not condescend to direct a priest, pontiff, pontifex primate, bishop, prelate, rector, abbot, vicar, apostolic reader, nuncio, apostolic delegate, buck ntu^, sissy </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 9, 1938 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' </span><span class="font8">saint, or even a cardinal, to meet Judge Rutherford in public to discuss the fundamental issues involving the eternal destiny of fair-minded and evil-minded people. The “glorious” Hierarchy dare not make even a pretense of answering the challenge 'presented in his writings. It can and does try to escape the judgment of clearly stated, God-given truths by shouting “calumnies”, “libels,” “slanders,” “lampoons.” And even in such shouting it appears to be losing its power and might. Its falsehoods, perversions, dissimulations and fabrications do not Stem the mounting flood of TRUTH, So with that supreme inconsistency which has marked its actions from ancient days, the Hierarchy now publicly adopts and cuddles to its ugly bosom an unbelieving heretic to carry forward its dirty work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">.Consolation</span><span class="font8"> wonders who will find himself stung first. Will C. Pliny suddenly discover that his loquacious efforts are not bringing in the gingerbread, angel-food cake, lady-fingers, macaroons (or what have you) ? Or will the “always right” and most reverend bishops find that they are dishing out the horseshoe nails for the essence of nothingness?</span></p>

Cox, Pittsburgh, Pa., offered $25,000 in prizes; chances $1 each. The chance-takers were each to get a medal called the “St. Christopher Miraculous Rose Medal”, concerning which “Reverend” Cox says with more or less truthfulness:</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE same bloodthirsty old Devil that was after the Albigenses in the south of France in the twelfth century is after them still. The Albigenses held unwaveringly to the belief that the Roman Catholic church, as governed by the pontiffs of Rome, was corrupt. Their lands were forfeited and all the inhabitants of Beziers, Catholics as ■well as others, were put to the sword, 40,000 being killed indiscriminately. Evervinus, a Roman Catholic, addressing “Saint&quot; Bernard, another Roman Catholic, is reported as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tell me, holy father, how is this? They entered to the stake and bore the torment of the fire, not only with patience, hut with joy and gladness. I wish your explanation, how these members of the Devil could persist in their heresy with a courage and constancy scarcely to be found in the most religious faith of the Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Seven hundred and twenty years have passed, and as proof that the Devil who hounded the Albigenses to death in the Dark Aggs is the same old Devil, and will be until God Almighty chokes off his wind, here is an extract from an encyclical put forth at'Vatican City, September 29, 1937, which makes the blood run cold, in its appeal to all that is worst in fallen man:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the terrible sect of the Albigensians was overcome by the invocation of Mary, so, we hope, shall they be overcome who, as Communists of today, remind us of them by their craftiness and violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It should be added that anybody that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">dis</span><span class="font8">agrees with the bloodthirsty son of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Devil </span><span class="font8">at the Vatican is a “Communist”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But, considering that the Albigenses denied the doctrine of transubstantiation, trinity, purgatory, infant baptism, and rejected all papal claims to infallibility and vicegerency; and considering that they tried to live according to the Bible, and not according to the traditions of men; and further, that Pope Innocent III preached, a crusade against them (about 1165 to 1179) and that they were faithful unto death, whom would you say Pius XI was especially referring to when he called modern Albigenses “communists”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Draper says: “She [the Roman church] did not crush it [the Albigensian ‘heresy’]; that would have been too indulgent; she absolutely annihilated it. Awake to what must necessarily ensue from the • imperceptible spread of such opinions, she remorselessly consumed its birthplace with fire and sword; and, fearful that some fugitive might escape her vigilant eye, or that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">‘heresy’</span><span class="font8"> might go wherever a bale of goods might be conveyed, she organized the Inquisition, with its troops of familiars and spies. Six hundred years have elapsed since those events, and the south of France has never recovered from the blow.” </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">—Int. Dev. Ev.,</span><span class="font8"> ii, 147.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Pope, Cardinal Pacelli and Felix in Conspiracy</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font8">HE old gent that backed Hitler in his destruction of the German Republic, and Backed Mussolini in his rape of Ethiopia, and backs Hitler, Mussolini and Franco in the attempted destruction of the Spanish Republic, is in agreement with “Father” Felix, of Missouri, in the conspiracy against Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Register</span><span class="font8"> of January 13, 1938, conveys “assurance of Pope Pius Xi’s prayerful interest” in the devilish work of “Reverend Father” Richard Felix, treated atlength in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> No. 466, July 28, 1937. If you did not see the pretty pictures in that issue, you missed something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From his own writings, which he admits are purely fictional, Mr. Felix appears to crave the arrest and imprisonment of Judge Rutherford more than any other one thing. That is the only point he makes that could have called forth the approbation of either the pope or Cardinal Pacelli. What is wrong with these gentlemen that they do not dare debate their doctrines with Judge Rutherford, but that they do dare to conspire to violate the Penal Code by advocating imprisonment of an innocent man?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are laughing loud and long at Felix’s claim that he and his friends have already circulated 150,000 pieces of literature making personal attacks on the ablest Bible expositor of our day. One thing is sure, and that is, that, whatever may come, Jehovah’s witnesses never stir up mobs, at any time, anywhere.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Tufts College, Universalist denomination, a private school, near Boston, had as one of its teachers Prof. Alfred C. Lane, 72 years of age, accounted one of the best geologists in the world. Massachusetts is in the grip of Curley, otherwise Catholic Action, otherwise Fascism. When Catholic Action demanded of Prof. Lane that he take the oath of allegiance he prefaced his oath with the following statement: “At the request of the trustees of Tufts college and protesting that my status as a teacher does not and will not make of me a public official^ and construing the oath as provided in section 2A of chapter 370 of the acts of 1935 that it does not abridge the admirable provisions of th^e constitution of Massachusetts protecting liberty of religion, of thought and of speech, ” I do solemnly, etc. And what did the tool of the Jesuits, Mr. Reardon, Roman Catholic commissioner of education, do when the amended oath came into his possession! Don’t be silly! Why ask foolish questions! Mr. Lane lost his job, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font8">course.

Although the article does not mention the &quot;Roman Hierarchy, it does say: “The purpose of the loyalty oaths that these pseudo-patriots are pushing is not to promote loyalty to the nation, the interests of its people and the imperishable principles of free government embodied in our fundamental instruments; it is the regimentation of American minds into conformity with their own patterns of political thought by police control under their own direction. And that is Fascism.”</span></p>

He said: &quot;Why must I go to a Church of England school?” His mother explained that as there was no other school she could not help it, but that she would speak to the master and ask him to excuse Bennie from any religious teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the first morning the whole school assembled in the hall for a hymn and .prayer. When the master sat down at the piano Bennie thought he was to take part in a religious ceremony, and called out, &quot;Oh, please, Mr. Rudge, I can’t stay here, I can’t stay here!” The master replied, &quot;Why not, Bennie? What is the matter?” Bennie said, &quot;Please, m'y mother and my father do not want me to learn any Church of England teachings. I ’in one of Jehovah’s witnesses’ little children.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The master kindly sent him into another room, saying how much he admired the little ehap for speaking up like that, and that he would see that Bennie did not learn any Church of England doctrines.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ L. MacNeill Weit, British M.P., describing the British king’s duties, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The point to be remembered with regard to the king is that he has no executive functions whatever in a constitutional democracy. He reigns, but does not rule. Every letter he writes, every speech he makes, is put into his hands by others. His duties are purely spectacular. He is called upon to do nothing as king that involves the use of his judgment or even his intelligence. All that is left is ceremonial and pageantry. As the king has little or no executive functions to perform, something must be substituted. Hence the adoration, the deification of the monarch. If you want to see how wonderful and adorable the monarch is, read the Tory press. There you will see that £410,000 a year is cheap when you consider that it is one of the ways in which the indispensable aloofness,is obtained.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">On the way home I encountered a van with a loud-speaker on the roof. Inside the van was a gentleman operating a gramophone, and from the speaker came the pleasant, friendly voice of a famous American preacher. I stopped, and for some time found myself listening intently to an address on a religion I am not particularly interested in. It struck me then that if our ministers would preach to us in this fresh, friendly manner, they would have no cause to lament about the sparseness of their congregations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Deutschland-Berichte &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ From the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Deutschland-Berichte,</span><span class="font8"> of the Social Democratic Party of Germany are drawn the following impartial reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not the masses that encourage action against the Jews. It is a small minority; but this minority holds sway: it has all the power in its hands, and with its terrorism stifles every, voice that would protest. . . . The resuit of the anti-Semitic movement up to the end of 1936—expressed in figures—is a decline of the Jewish population of Germany from 517,000 to 390,000. Approximately 110,000 Jews have emigrated, and' the balance of the decline is caused by an excess of deaths over births. On the other hand the Reich can boast of 153,000,000 marks in revenue from the so-called “Flight tax” which accrues almost exclusively from Jew's. ... Of the economic injury inflicted upon the Jews, these 153,000,000 [marks], how'ever, form but a small fraction. Big Jewish concerns are continually passing, under compulsion, out of Jewish into Aryan hands. . . . The Jews are becoming impoverished. Large numbers of them need social assistance if they are not to be driven to suicide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What are the authorities doing? They have laid it down that philanthropic gifts for Jews are not exempt from taxation. Old men and old women, the inmates of the almshouses of the B’nai B’rith Lodge were literally turned out of doors. . . . After long absence a man, anxiously expected, returns from a concentration camp to the arms of the woman with whom he had lived for seven years. He is an Aryan, however, and she a Jewess. They seize him again and condemn him for another two years in prison. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now comes the supreme head of the four-million city, the lord mayor and city president, Herr Lippert, who says: “In 1935 we placed a notice board at Wannsee with the ' inscription ‘Jews^not admitted!’ At the request of the foreign Office we had to take it down, as preparations were then in progress for the Olympic Games. On that I made the superintendent of the baths acquainted with a skillfully formulated measure of self-help. Thebe is no need to regulate everything officially, but one must remember that, thank God, there are SA and SS men. That proved a success in the open-air bath, . . . The matter was managed without making a terrible rumpus on the spot and causing a big crowd to gather. The swimming master was called in to assist. He has called upon any Jew in question to leave the bath at once. Whenever it was necessary the stalwart SA men have waited a little in the forest outside the baths till the man came out, and they have just shown him what was necessary.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Germany they will not forego the pleasure of maltreating the Jews, but they will also not forego making use of them when they can. Jewish technicians, for example, are kept back from leaving the country, since they are indispensable in the war industry. Above all, however, it is Jewish doctors that, despite all chicanery to which they are subjected, Germany will not allow to emigrate. When war comes the army will need doctors, and then the Jewish doctors will be indispensable!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From every quarter of the Reich reports come in of restriction of output and of short time being worked in consequence of shortage of raw materials. In Saxony there are weaving mills that work only one day in the week. To save on real coffee, malt coffee is made, but some day the malt coffee factories will have to close down because they can no longer obtain the necessary barley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The trades unions have ceased to exist. Every attempt to continue their work is punished with penal servitude. There are no longer employers and employees to negotiate together as parties with equal rights, but only a Works Community, the leader of which is the undertaker, whereas the workmen, as his “following”, are under obligation of fidelity to him. There are, in consequence, no Works Councils, but only so-called “Trust Councils’ which bear this appellation because they do not enjoy the confidence of the workmen and have been forced upon them. But these “trust councilors” may not discuss matters amongst themselves, but only in the presence of the undertaker. Freedom has been abolished, and the workman is bound to the con* cem. ... If the workman, in the face of rising costs of living, coupled with sinking nominal wages, wants to maintain himself and his family, then he must work overtime. . . . With the present regulation of the market </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">dismissed workman ... is as good as a pariah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ During the merry month of August, a certain submarine, or submarines, appeared and disappeared, fifteen miles north of the island of Lemnos, which is about two hundred miles north of the Greek islands of the Dodecanese ' that are occupied now by Italy, and where this imperialistic nation has built a strong naval base, sheltering all kinds of keels of death and destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This “mystery” boat or boats attacked some vessels carrying cargoes of wheat to the starving people of Spain, whom Italy decided to exterminate in her true “Christian” spirit. They were torpedoed in the name of Christ and Civilisation. Food needed so badly by the Spanish children and women was sent to the bottom, and men forming the crew were dispatched forcibly to tell St. Peter the progress of our age.—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Dodecanesian.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>Mussolini and Hitler Hang Together</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Mussolini and Hitler hang together—and should! The agreement between Germany and Austria makes the accord between the two dictators practical. Austria was whittled down by the World War so that for a distance of more than a hundred miles it is no more than </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">mere sliver. At the Brenner Pass Italy is only forty miles from Germany. Barracks convenient to the pass are being rebuilt and 5,000 civilians were at work, at last reports, making military roads on the Italian side of the pass, so that when the time comes to exchange troops there will be no difficulties in the way. Heavy artillery emplacements, bomb-proof shelters, munition dumps and airdromes have also been built, indicating that Italy is anticipating trouble and preparing for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Italian Munitions Used Against Italians </span><span class="font8">♦ In the war in Spain a group of antiFascist Italians, called the Garibaldi Battalion, are battling their own countrymen, enlisted to aid the cause of Franco and the pope. Loud-speakers, explaining the issues of the war to Mussolini’s army, led to many desertions from the Fascist side.

<p><span class="font17">Q</span><span class="font8">UESTION: &quot;What trends in America show that Fascism is a real and present danger ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answer: Fascism is a real menace to American traditional liberty. Fascism and Nazism are one and the same thing operating under different names. They are the offspring of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and are therefore both religious, and back of them is Satan the Devil. For many centuries the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has been moving to gain control of the entire world. At the time of the formationof the League of Nations, the Vatican attempted to get a seat in that conference. Not succeeding in that, when the League of Nations was born, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy rides on top of the whole thing. Communism was a supposed threatened danger in Italy. Mussolini led the Fascist crowd and soon openly identified Fascism and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy by making an alliance with the Vatican. The policy of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is to practice fraud upon the people by raising up a scarecrow to induce the people to believe that some great danger is impending and immediately about to fall, and that the only way to safeguard the people from such danger is to adopt the remedy brought forth by the Hierarchy or some _ of their tools. This arrangement was worked successfully in Germany. The Jesuits organized Communism in that land and then declared it to be a menace to the German people. When that scare was on in full sway, Fascism was organized by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy under the name and title of Nazism. The result was that the Nazis committed many crimes and charged them against Communists in order to create a sentiment in favor of Nazism and thus to furnish an excuse to grab the control of the country, with the apparent consent of the people. The Roman Catholic organization backed up Nazism openly until it became so apparent that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is back of Nazism, which is the same as Fascism, and then a few priests and nuns were arrested on a charge of taking</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 9, 193B </span><span class="font8">money out of the country or for immoral conduct, shoved in the front door of the jail and immediately let out the back door. This scheme was for the purpose of blinding the people to the truth' of Romanism's backing up Nazism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is to be observed that every person who opposes the Roman Catholic Hierarchy scheme is denounced as a Communist, because that is their chief bogeyman employed by the religious gang to frighten the people. As an example: In the recent political campaign for mayor of the City of New York, the Tammany candidate, backed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, charged that Mayor LaGuardia is a Communist and if re-elected the Communists would get control of the city. Of course, they knew that such a charge was wholly false, but, by means of using that fraud, expected to frighten order-loving people into the support of the gang that has ruled New York for several years. The purpose of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and hence of Fascism and Nazism, is regimentation of the people, that is, to organize the people into groups and assign each one to his place and to rule or control all by a dictator, so that Rome and her forces can rule to suit her own selfish desires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nazism, Fascism and Romanism combined desire to have the United States ruled by a one-man dictator. For a long time they have had their eye on America, and it is quite evident that Mr. Roosevelt is entirely agreeable to fill the place of dictator if the opportunity offers. Within a short time after his election to the first term, Rome announced that the president would arrange to have a Vatican ambassador at Washington whenever the people of America could be brought around to that point. Then followed the “Holy Year” fiasco, and several other things in America since, the purpose being to create a more favorable condition for a dictator. At the last presidential election, just before the election day, the Vatican’s ambassador, Pacelli, came to America and, although a Catholic priest had been howling against Mr. RoOsevelt, it suddenly turned up that practically all Catholics of America voted for Mr. Roosevelt. It seems almost certain that Fascism, Nazism, a Roman dictatorship, will soon gain control of America, and when that takes place the liberties of the people will be a matter of past history. Throughout the United States groups of Nazis are organizing and becoming more</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">17</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">bold in demonstrating their &quot;allegiance to a rule by a dictator. Almost all thoughtful people in America see the danger of a dictator, but not all of them, by any means, see the cloven paw of Romanism back of it. In every community where the Roman Catholic Hierarchy controls the political affairs, the liberties of the people are curtailed. Fascism is, therefore, stealthily moving upon America and it is exceedingly doubtful if the American people will be awake to the real danger until after it is too late.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Brazil for a long time has been dominated by the Roman Catholic religion, and just now that nation has become a “corporate state” ruled by a dictator who has seized control of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">the government, Washington appears to be alarmed, but will any of the representatives of the people in Washington profit by what is taking place in other countries? Watch the forward march of Fascism, Nazism and Romanism, going hand in hand to grab control .. of all the nations and rule the people by dictators. In that category is now found Italy, Germany, Japan and Brazil, and, in due time, where will the United States be? Will the American people take warning and act to preserve the fundamental principles of American institutions? It is hardly probable. In due time you may see the United States declared to be a “corporate state” ruled by a one-man dictator. /</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">M</span><span class="font8">ANY questions come in concerning the attitude of school children towards the patriotic exercises. Shall they stand mute while others salute the flag, or insist upon remaining seated? Shall they join in the patriotic songs? Shall they insist on remaining seated, contrary to the school regulations, while the others stand and lustily sing the patriotic airs?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the first place the reader is advised to bear in mind that it is not the province of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font8"> or any individual to tell what anyone should do. Each individual must decide on his own course of action. His guide </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font8">the Word of God, and the only thing </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font8"> would do would be to point out what the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a, </span><span class="font8">1S3B</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Christians do not salute flags or creatures, because to do so violates the express command of God. Standing mute while others salute doesn’t violate God’s law. That is not participating in the salute. It is merely obeying a regulation to stand while others do the saluting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many so-called “patriotic” songs give adoration and praise to men, and attribute protection to men. Some songs call upon God to save the king, or preserve the nation. To join in singing such songs would violate God’s commandment. Christians will not join in singing such songs, but to stand mute in obedience to school regulations while others sing would not violate Jehovah’s commands.</span></p>

This makes one wonder, mildly, what steps the A.M.A. would have taken to supervise the marriage of Adam and Eve had they been present on that occasion.

<p><span class="font8">In a later epistle, commenting on the spontaneous tributes which the officeholders were required to offer up to their liege-lord, Mr. Roosevelt, Pegler said, sympathetically:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is tough on the feet and vocal cords, this howling and braying which constitutes the routine spontaneous tribute, but these things happen only once in four years and the time between is easy and the j)ay attractive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

Moreover, many of these have pension protection, are safe in their jobs, get sick leaves, vacations, traveling expenses and fees on top of their salaries.

Prediction was made that in a little while the Hierarchy would erect a new church on the site, in such a manner as to convey the impression to the casual observer that the Roman Hierarchy’s “church” is the very heart and center of New York’s municipal government. This step is now being taken, and the “Right Reverend Father” William E. Cashin is raising $400,000 to erect the necessary structure,</span></p>

The only Usson seems to be. that it is better, to spend a little less money on doors, so that thieves won’t want to steal them; or, better still, and it would be best of all, to build no buildings at all where God’s name is dishonored and His Word repudiated.

<p><span class="font8">♦ For unmitigated crust, induced by greed, this experience with a Presbyterian clergyman takes the leather medal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Last Thursday a friend (Hungarian) called the writer by phone, asking for one of Jehovah’s witnesses to deliver a funeral talk and conduct the services for her deceased husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All arrangements were made accordingly. The night before the funeral, however, she again called, stating that the Presbyterian natural brother of the deceased wanted to have the funeral services at the church instead of at the undertaking establishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">She definitely and flatly refused to agree to such arrangement, advising him that she had made all arrangements for the funeral.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Shortly afterward, the Presbyterian clergyman interviewed her and tried to bully and bluff her into letting him have the funeral at “his” church, but she, of course, refused. Then he asked her for the telephone number of the Jehovah’s witness who looked after funerals, and she gave him my number,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">About eleven that night he called me and, after pompously announcing who he was, stated that all arrangements were made to have that funeral at “his” church the following day. Upon being asked if such arrangement had the widow’s approval, he stated, “That is the arrangement made-by the family,” and that he called me to tell me the new arrangements so we wouldn’t have a trip for nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then I opened up on that “dominicker rooster ’ telling him I was fully aware of the whole proceeding; of how he and the brotherin-law were trying to bulldoze and browbeat the poor bereaved widow to permit something to be done against her expressed desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When I suggested that “if you had the manhood of a self-respecting mouse, you would respect the wishes of the widow”, he replied: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“You won’t get anything out of it,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then I was really filled with righteous indignation (or, in plain every-day language, I was mad) and answered him as follows: “Jehovah’s witnesses are not like you birds; freely have we received, and we give freely and gladly.” Then I positively and firmly told him that the funeral was not going to be from “his” church, but was to be conducted at the undertaking parlors and if he wanted to attend as a listener he could do so, but that he would have absolutely no part in the services, and if he tried to cause any trouble of any kind we would immediately call the police and have him taken care of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The-funeral was a fine witness to God’s loving provision for the dead. The preacher never showed up, and it was afterward learned that the price offered him if he could get the funeral arrangements changed so it would be from “his” church, was $30. “Thirty dirty pieces of silver” still seems to be a popular price for those who have the Judas mind, doesn’t it? —W.

In your speech you stated that money will not be spent for radio after October 31, but will be used for sound cars. I will be short, as I know you are busy. Jehovah’s witnesses and the Jonadabs could well help to purchase additional sound equipment through saving of old newspapers; old papers will bring about 80c per 100 pounds. Bach truth-loving person could bring a few papers to the meeting places at a time. And think of the quantity all over the United States!

<h6><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark176"></a>Puncturing One More God</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17">D</span><span class="font8">URING the course of history, people have worshiped an astounding number and variety of gods. They have prayed to trees, stones and mountains. They have bowed down to personifications of fearsome natural forces and prostrated themselves before the bolt of lightning. They have set up idols of all possible materials, sizes, and shapes, which range all the way from representations of the lower animals, of sex, greed, murder and the'Devil himself, to representations so ethereal 'as to vanish into the nirvana of nothingness. They have idolized fame, wealth, power, other men, their loved ones, and even themselves. The list seems endless. One is tempted to say that during the last six thousand years they have overlooked nothing in an attempt to find a substitute for the pure worship of the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It has remained for this century, however, to bring to birth still another deity, the youngest, but not the least arrogant, of the galaxy. The name of this late arrival is Science. Around it have sprung up with amazing fertility and vigor the cults, rituals and superstitions of a religion whose devotees are legion. In its stark and stainless “Iloly of Holies”, high priests prostrate themselves with passion, infinite faith, and selfish devotion, while, without, the uninitiated multitudes wait humbly for its pronouncements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let us examine for a moment the claims of this new god, Science, as interpreted by its priesthood, and the demands it makes of its followers:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” Science claims the right and authority to dictate, not only the actions, but even the thoughts and desires of the people. There must be no whoring after other gods lurking in the shadowland of the emotions. Christian and philosophical ideas must be ruthlessly discarded, and the stern, undeviating path of absolute submission must be followed. On the laws of Science, one must meditate day and night.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2. ‘‘Thou art altogether righteous.” Science is pure and holy, with no other motive than to lift mankind to a higher level. Its true followers, therefore, must also be pure, undefiled by commercialism or greed, serving only this noble purpose of elevating the race.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">3. “Thou alone canst save.” This is, with-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">24</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">out exaggeration, the attitude of the true Science devotee. He is an extreme pietist, believing that only if he and others submit themselves wholly to Science will the world move toward the Millennium ; but that if we do so, all human ills and difficulties, all evils, will ultimately be eliminated. What other force, asks the scientist, can regenerate the race and save man from his brute self I And when the “golden age” has indeed been reached, there will be abundance for all furnished by “Om-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">•nipotent Science! ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To the scientist, his cult holds out even the promise of immortality. The solution of the mystery of life is at hand, he proclaims. Soon we shall know how to create—to produce life at will. We shall be able to bring forth wuth our test tubes and our chemical combinations as we desire, so that we shall be as gods—. And at the other end of the scale is old age, a disease the intricacies of which we shall also solve. Perhaps death itself is not, after all, a mystery, but only a problem which will ultimately yield before the onslaughts of allpowerful Sei cnee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The salvation offered by this wonderful “God” will be universal and for all colors, races and creeds. And then, having conquered, by the might of the deity which his own brain and hands have created, the wilderness of the elements and the chaos of his own subconsciousness, having thrown light into the dense groves of the imagination and harnessed his intelligence and his ego, every man will “sit under his own vine and fig-tree, and none shall make him afraid”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But note how inconsistent and, in fact, dishonest is the scientist in making these claims to supreme authority and power. Denouncing emotionalism in the conduct of research, he explores with intolerant zeal, or indeed fanaticism. Claiming to disinterestedly serve the race, he teaches that all our motives arc com- ' pletely selfish, having their roots in the muck of a brutal subconscious self. Claiming to follow the light of reason, he teaches that we are merely metabolism, action and reaction, and therefore, to be logical, entirely the products of environment. With complete lack of logic, he theh asserts that the same environment reacting on identical forms of living matte.r produced the present diverse forms of life. Nor</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">consolation</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">does he explain how, if man is merely metabolism, such human attributes'as thought, emotion, imagination, and the sense of beauty could have developed from the metabolism of the mud-flats of pre-history. What, indeed, was the source of his own professional ideals and moralities?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To explore further these inconsistencies, let us examine the scientific assertion that there are no mysteries, but that all things are discoverable problems. On analysis, we find that to know, in science, is merely to replace one mystery with another. Exploring matter, we discover that it is made of atoms, which in turn are compounded of protons, electrons, and neutrons; and these, in the last analysis, are systems of tension. But does that explain the nature of an atom, or in what way systems of tension came to exist; or how something so nebulous as a multiple system of tensions should form, in one instance, a star, and, in another, a fly buzzing annoyingly around ■ still another system of tensions known as our afternoon tea?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus the great god Science stands inseru-' tably wrapped in its mysterious robe of discovered and discoverable problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And how disillusioning are the activities of its acknowledged priesthood! How profaned with commercialism its shrine! They have put, or allowed others to put, such a price on the products of their labor that the mass of mankind cannot in any way take advantage of them. They advocate the constant use of the most poisonous foods and materials in everyday life, thus slowly undermining the health of the race, and this entirely for the sake of profit. They race after fads and fancies, to the detriment of those who race after them, and jump constantly to unsupported conclusions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Claiming to work for the betterment of the race, to be devoted to the work of expanding our horizons in order to usher in a new era of life in abundance, they expend their energy in perfecting methods of warfare, of torture and slaughter unparalleled in history. During the World War, in order that they might not be sent to the trenches and slaughtered, thus cheating the generations of the benefit of their wisdom, they were organized into groups in the various countries, and used their knowledge to devise materials which sent to their graves far more of humankind than these future discoveries could possibly save.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, at last, let us gaze carefully at this</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">youngest of the innumerable company of false gods as it stands revealed. It is clothed, not in mysteries of light, but in skirts bedraggled with filth and blood. Its feet are sunk in the mire of commercialism. It is blind as Justice, iron-countenanced and glacial as Nemesis; its insignia, <sup>1</sup> * Life in Abundance ”; its instruments, in one hand the test tube of deadly chemicals and in the other the bolt of lightning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Which shall we serve: this inconsistent, hybrid, man-made image of destruction, which is not true science at all, or the One who says to suffering mankind, “Behold, I make all things new,” and who promises, “My word . . . shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please”?—Alice L. Browne, New Jersey,</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Informal duties of rural school teachers in Britain are said to be seeing all the new babies, visiting the sick and aged, and cutting, shingling and bobbing their hair, coaching a cop for an examination, making wills, filling in income tax returns, attending parish council meetings to advise the councilors, acting as secretary of the garden show, organizing outdoor sports, serving on the women’s institute committee, helping a woman farmer, helping choose wall paper and curtains, dusting cobwebs from the beams of an old woman’s shop, and playing the organ in church and at concert when the organist fails to shbw up. After a little bit some fool of a Dorgan will introduce legislation that such women must also take oaths of loyalty. The Dorgans are like that. And, by the way, at the Massachusetts election Dorgan was snowed under, which shows that there are some people in Massachusetts that have some sense after all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Eratosthenes, the Greek geographer and philosopher, born 276 B.C., starved himself to death, in 196 B.C., because he discovered that he was going blind. His studies of the earth ■were so accurate that he estimated the circumference at 252,000 stadia, or 28,966 miles. He was only 4,064 out of the way, which, considering the little that was then known of the shape or size of the earth, and the crudeness of the instruments with which he worked, was very remarkable.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark181"></a>The Friendly Cold</span></h6>
<p><span class="font17">M</span><span class="font8">ANY noted scientists have agreed on the theory that nature does not produce unnecessarily, that each thing produced has a definite place in the program of life. If all other functions come under this rule, why, then, should not disease ? Contrary to the common conception, disease in itself is not the harmful malady which it is generally considered. Even the common cold has its place in helping to maintain a condition of general health within the system. When the matter is scientifically understood, it becomes blear that the body must function in this manner to maintain and produce life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To understand better what actually takes place within the body, it might be well to consider briefly some of the characteristics of its construction. The cells which make up the body are constantly reproducing themselves, thereby causing growth. Through the birth and death of these millions upon millions of cells, motor activity such as thought and emotion is produced. These cells may be compared to a large community. Each individual in this community does his particular work for the good of all; each cell must be ready to die that its locked-up energy may be used in the functions of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How many of these cells must die that their energy may be used in a given thought is but conjecture. It is estimated that there are seventy-five thousand million cells in a cubic inch of blood. Thousands of cells are being bom, and thousands are dying, each minute of our lives. It is this balance that determines growth and decay. When the latter results, and the death rate of the cells is higher than the birth rate, we have what is known as '‘disease”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The rate of subdivision and general health of the cells depends upon the cell food. The more perfect this cell food, the more vigorous and healthy will be the cell that forms. Hence, in the newer sciences our policy is to build up, through the use of diet schedules, as Urge and as perfect a quality of protoplasm as is possible. The term “diet”, as used here, refers to the correct proportion of foods which will supply the body with the elements required in its chemical composition. Oxygen and water are also essential for this balanced combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, that protoplasm which is the best food for the cells is also the best food for germ life, the only difference in its function being due to the length of time it has remained in the body. Cell protoplasm that has not been used up during the day’s activities remains as stale protoplasm for the next day. This staleness, of course, reduces its value as cell food and increases it for germ, activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the body has reached the point where it will no longer tolerate this stale protoplasm which has become a poison or toxin, and begins its program of elimination, we say that the “saturation point” or, as some authors term it, the “crisis” has been reached. How soon this point will be reached depends on the particular individual and upon the factors influencing his body at any given time. In other words, it is upon this basis that a person’s susceptibility to disease is determined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The rain water that is so pure and wholesome when it is fresh, becomes putrid when it is stale, regardless of how much sunshine falls upon it, or how pure it was to start with. It must flow or circulate if it is to be kept pure. This is also shown in the flowing of a stream. How quickly the water becomes purified as it flows! Logically enough, then, just as nature functions in our environment, so with the human body. Before any of the surplus protoplasm which we have built up has time to become stale, it should be drained from the system by an “internal bath”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are numerous ways in which this cleansing or removal of stale protoplasm may take place. Hours of physical labor or fasting will use up the surplus. Breathing exercises are beneficial in that a deep breath of air forces the oxygen through the lungs, into the cell tissues. This increases cell division and freshens the protoplasm. Some people would go to almost any extreme to avoid a draft or a sudden change of temperature. What actually takes place is that this change in temperature loosens the surplus of toxins or poisons in the cells, and the body starts throwing it off in large quantities. It is when thia process takes place that the individual is said to have a cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What a contrast these scientific explanations are to the older and more common conception of the disease. The prevalent belief</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">has been that colds were caused solely from external contacts or influences on the body— that the individual “catches” cold. The newer sciences, on the other hand, are teaching that there can be no activity of germ life without body toxins to feed upon. All acute and inflammatory diseases are simply nature’s way of burning or using up the poisons stored in the system. According to the soil and climate, so the vegetation. Likewise, according to their location within the body and the type of toxins they feed upon, we get our classification of germs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The usual attempt to control disease has been to isolate and destroy each particular kind of germ without destroying the cells. The result of this practice has produced on the market every conceivable type of germicide, sedative, and opiate. The individual working from misunderstood premises will take the opiate or sedative, he will “dope up” and appear to have broken the cold. Nearly every form of infectious disease will appear to improve as the result of medicine, because the body has slowed down its functioning program of throwing off the stale protoplasm. The common reaction to these scientific facts is that the body will throw out the poisons after the opiate has subsided, and the individual begins to feel better. But if this were true, the body, in ridding itself of these toxins, would inevitably produce another cold. It is the draining off of the poisons that IS the cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now, in the event that one takes sufficient medicine to “ward off” a cold every time he feels one coming up, and the toxins in his system are continually repressed, they will eventually reappear in a much worse form. This isdrue because of the fact that the longer the stale protoplasm is stored, the more poisonous it becomes, so that when it is finally discharged it becomes culture for the more destructive germs. In fact, this condition may be increased to the point where the system becomes so saturated with broken down tissues and decaying food matter, that the cells positively cannot subdivide. When this occurs in a local area, we have a disease called “cancer”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Localization of cancer, instead of its </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">gen</span><span class="font8">eral existence throughout the entire body, is based on the degree of circulation to the greater part of the anatomy. The slower the circulation, the less the amount which will be delivered to the cells, and hence the higher the death rate of the individual cell. The more loaded with toxins the blood becomes, the slower its flow, and the more likely it is to become congested because of physical obstructions such as bruises, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">True, this state of saturation must be maintained through a period of years before a cancerous condition will become acute. Nevertheless, it has its beginning at the time when the toxins accumulate to the point where the death rate of the cell becomes greater than the subdivision or birth rate. That this very process is taking place in a large percentage of our population is proved by the fact that there were seventy thousand deaths as a result of cancer in one state alone, over a period of one year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How may we avoid all disease, from the common cold to the other extreme, cancer? By aiding instead of restraining the body in its elimination of toxins. Instead of “taking care of” oneself by avoiding drafts, “doping up” at every indication of a cold, etc,, what should be done is to help the body maintain a proper balance of protoplasm. If there are no surplus toxins in our body, then no external influence can produce a cold. On the other hand, if our system is clogged with poisons, it is through the process of a cold that they are discharged, and our general health maintained.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">♦ Referring to the widespread use of garb age-fed pork, and the consequent fact that recent examinations by the Government have shown that one American in eight now has trichina worms in his muscles, the United States Department of Agriculture gives further information as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The seriousness of this ailment depends on the number of live trichina: in the pork eaten. Slight infestation following the consumption of moderate quantities of lightly infested pork, that is raw or imperfectly cooked, may pass unnoticed or may cause but slight illness. But the consumption of heavily infested pork or of large quantities of raw or imperfectly cooked pork that is lightly infested may produce a painful and sometimes fatal attack of trichinosis. Common symptoms are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, severe abdominal pains, general dullness, weakness, twitching of muscles, and sensations of tension and pain in the muscles. In later stages of the disease the eyeballs may become inflamed or show small hemorrhages* Swelling of the legs, forearms, abdominal wall, and face may occur, sometimes with skin eruptions. Muscular pain is an outstanding symptom of trichinosis. Fever is commonly present during the first stage of the disease, reaching its height in about ten days after the first symptoms. The symptoms are by no means constant, and typical cases have sometimes been diagnosed as typhoid fever, undulant fever, meningitis, and other diseases. When patients are seen by a physician within a few days after eating the triehinous pork and the disease is correctly diagnosed, some good may follow attempts to expel the parasites from the digestive tract.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Dr. Mary Cover Jones (at the I.'niversity of Minnesota) reports that in the work with the older children at the Ileckshe r Foundation, the frog especially, when it suddenly jumps, is the most potent stimulus of all in bringing out fear reactions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We first took thfe </span><span class="font6">chil</span><span class="font7">dren to the laboratory and put them through the routine </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font7">tests </span><span class="font6">with </span><span class="font7">various animals. . . .

<p><span class="font6">Behaviorism of doctors</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Loud sounds </span><span class="font6">almost </span><span class="font7">invariably produced a marked reaction in infants from the very moment of birth. For example, the striking of a steel bar with a hammer will call out a jump, a start, a respiratory pause followed by more rapid breathing with marked vasomotor changes, sudden closure of the eye, clutching of hands, puckering of lips. Then occur, depending upon the age of the infant, crying, falling down, crawling, walking or running away. . . . In the half-sleeping infant of two or three days of age I have called them out repeatedly by suddenly crinkling a half page of a newspaper near its ear, and by making a loud, shrill, hissing sound with the lips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The other stimulus calling out this same fear reaction is loss of support—especially when the body is not set to compensate for it. It can best be observed in newborns just when they are falling asleep. If dropped then, or if the blanket upon which they lie is suddenly jerked, pulling the infant along wif.h it, the response usually occurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Eleven months three days old. (1) White rat which he had played with for weeks was suddenly taken from basket (the usual routine) and presented to Albert. lie began to reach for rat with left hand. Just as his hand touched the animal the bar was struck immediately behind his head. The infant jumped violently and fell forward, burying his face in the mattress. Jie did not cry, however. (2) Just as his right hand touched the rat the bar was again struck. Again the infant jumped violently, fell forward and began to whimper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just as I show the snake I can make a terrible noise and cause the child to fall down and cry out completely terror-stricken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The responses are especially easy to bring out by the stimulation of what, for lack of a better term, we may call the erogenous zones, such as the nipples, the lips and the sex. organs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The citations foregoing arc from the work </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Behaviorism, </span><span class="font8">by John B. Watson, Ph.D., and lead these physicians and others that experimented with 70 children at the Hecksher Foundation and elsewhere to arrive at the brilliant conclusions that human babies may b$ frightened by frogs, snakes, rats, dark rooms, loud noises behind their heads, and by having blankets jerked out from under them.

<p><span class="font8">“Listen, Jane! What’s that?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It’s the electric wires ‘singing’. They always do that in very cold weather.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“We’ll soon leave them behind. Look at those trees!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Firs. Aren’t they beautiful—those deep blue-green shadows tucked into every branch ? Evergreens are never so lovely as when they are laden with snow.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“You mean the one with the top-knot? What kind is it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“A tufted titmouse. If you look carefully you’ll see that that tree is full of them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Aren’t they darling? Oh, Jane!—that one is hanging upside down on a cone.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It’s having an early breakfast.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“You mean they eat the cones? Why, I’m sure if I tried eating while I was standing on my head, I’d choke.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘ ‘ Titmouse doesn’t. Let’s watch them awhile. They do such Interesting things.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“There’s a redbird. How very clear his song sounds on a frosty morning! Did I tell you, Sally, we’ve had one for a boarder all winter ! He and his little brown wife both come. We have corn on the feeding board for them all the time.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“On the fence over there is a tiny bird with a black cap and light-colored feathers. Who is he, Jane?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“That is our cheerful little chickadee. He does about as many stunts ’as his cousin, the thfted titmouse. He’s, a friendly fellow, too. I’m sure he’s been to your feeding board.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">L</span><span class="font8">EAVE it to an artist to glorify one of the most disagreeable aspects of winter. Winter thaw! What memories it evokes of impassable roads and bypaths. Everything is wet, muddy and sticky; and who enjoys that? The mud cakes on shoes and boots and is tracked into every place where it is not wanted.. And yet an artist will draw a picture of a winter thaw and make it look interesting, possessed of a certain beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The writer, on the other hand, is stumped. What can be said in eulogy of a winter thaw? Who can grow eloquent in the description of it? Beauty it hath none, as far as the writer is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the artist has turned the trick, and the winter thaw is depicted as a means of aesthetic enjoyment! Well, give the artist his due, as long as he gives the public something intelligible. A winter thaw (on paper) is to be preferred, always, to the aberrations of cubists and futurists, who, with their originality run to seed, resort to the sorry expedient of painting gibberish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Perhaps the only thing that can he said in favor of the winter thaw, as distinguished from the thaws that inevitably come in the spring, is that it is generally of short duration. The spring thaw, on the other hand, is persistent, and may even lead to floods and ruin. Yet the thaw is one of those things that take their place in the scheme of nature and serve their purpose. A scientist could doubtless tell us much about the beneficent effects of the thaw<sup>r</sup>. But this is not a scientific treatise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To a writer, and perhaps to an artist, a thaw is something to be seen rather than felt or expei'ienced. Who enjoys getting stuck in the mud? But on paper a winter thaw makes an interesting study and produces a pleasing effect.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord's next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall live on earth forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The term &quot;His Work” applies to the nine days, February 5 to 13 inclusive, as the next period of special united testimony by all those who delight in Jehovah. It will feature the combination of the two latest books, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font2"> to be placed with all contributors of 50c. This testimony, taking place in midwinter, will require considerable planning and arranging, and all who give a part in Jehovah’s &quot;strange work” first place will arrange all that is due. Detailed instructions appear in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Infoimant;</span><span class="font2"> which you should study and closely follow.

It is a grand work, of 384 pages, excellently bound, gold-stamped, with eolor illustrations and a comprehensive index. The initial edition is the autographed edition and contains, in facsimile, a letter written by the hand of the author and addressed to all the Lord's servants. Due to the limited quantity of this author’s edition a contribution therefor of 50c a copy is asked to offset the special expense of publishing this edition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">YEAR BOOK FOR 1938</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font2"> for 1938 embodies the features that have made the issues for previous years so valuable to all who declare themselves on Jehovah’s side and who are actively interested in and participating in the publishing of his name and his kingdom. The president's report contained therein gives an accurate and comprehensive account of the state of the Lord’s work in the various lands throughout the earth, showing in considerable detail the activities and efforts put forth during the service year just ended and the results thereof. Then there is the year text for 1938 and a pointed comment thereon. This, together with well chosen daily texts and explanatory comments thereon from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> makes this 1 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ear Book </span><span class="font2">one of everyday help and use for all the Lord’s faithful.

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark1"></a>JEREMIAH</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“See, I have this day set thee over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.”—Jer. 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH has a controversy with the nations because all the nations have given their allegiance to the Devil. For everything Jehovah has a fixed time; and this is his time for war. That war will settle the long-standing controversy, and settle it right. Before the beginning of the actual destruction of the enemy Jehovah does his “strange work”, which consists of his causing his name to be declared throughout all the earth and announcing his purpose about to be executed. God has taken out of the world a people for his name, and it is that people to whom he grants the privilege of proclaiming his name throughout all the earth. Everyone who loves God will delight to have some part in the strange work. Such witnesses must first inform themselves of God’s purpose toward them and then be diligent to perform the work assigned to them. The world is at enmity with God, and the day has come when all creation that survives must become God’s friends and faithful servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’Jehovah never does anything against the enemy secretly, but always openly. He gives the enemy full notice while the opposing armies are maneuvered into position for the final conflict. In order that the enemy might be fully advised of God’s purpose, and in order that those who love God might be fully instructed in the right way, Jehovah long ago caused prophetic dramas to be enacted, in which men played the parts foretelling what God would bring to pass at the end of the world. Among those prophetic dramas played under the direction of Jehovah is that recorded in the prophecy of Jeremiah, and because it was written aforetime for the encouragement and hope of God’s people that prophecy is now unfolding to those who are devoted to the Most High, disclosing the fact that its complete fulfillment is in progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">* The name “Jeremiah’’ means “Raised up of Jehovah”. Since Jeremiah played a prophetic part in the drama, those whom he foreshadowed must therefore be the company “raised up of Jehovah”. Jeremiah was a type of Jesus Christ and the members of his body, including the faithful remnant now on the earth, and the remnant are now performing in reality a part of the drama played by Jeremiah. The commission that God gave to Jeremiah is given to Christ on a far greater scale, and that commission extends to his body members. What Jeremiah did toward Jerusalem and those connected with that city, Christ Jesus, together with the members of his body, now does to the religious organizations of earth and to that particular religious organization which is misnamed “Christendom”. Christ Jesus has gathered his body members together, forming the temple of Jehovah, and all of the temple company do now show forth the praises of Jehovah by wholeheartedly obeying his will and their Leader’s commandments. This is the time of complete unity in Christ, and all who are on the Lord’s side move forward in a solid and compact body against the enemy. Therefore it is written concerning God’s organization under Christ: “Jerusalem is builded as a city that is c&lt; mpact together.” (Ps. 122: 3) Everyone of the temple must have a vision of God’s purpose, and all such must move with one accord under the command and leadership of Christ Jesus, the Head of the- temple organization. All those who murmur or complain against the Lord’s organization or who oppose the same thereby give evidence that they are not in the temple and therefore are no part of God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> In the great prophetic drama of Jeremiah King Nebuchadnezzar was caused by Jehovah to play a part foretelling or representing the Lord Jesus Christ as the One who executes the judgments of the Most High. Before Jerusalem was destroyed by the executioner, God sent Jeremiah to bear testimony to that city, including the rulers and the people. Before “Christendom” is destroyed by Christ Jesus the great Executioner, Jehovah sends his witnesses to bear testimony before the world. It is therefore seen that Jeremiah played parts in the drama foreshadowing both Christ Jesus, the great Leader, and the remnant of his organization, who bear testimony to the rulers and to the people. As the great prophetic drama unfolds to the vision of the people of the Lord it should today thrill the heart of everyone who loves righteousness and hates lawlessness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COMMISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> For centuries the Devil and his organization, de-famers of Jehovah’s name, have ruled the world in</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">lawlessness. The mighty religious organization known as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has taken the lead in the blasphemous and defamatory work against God and his kingdom. “Babylon,” the name of Satan’s organization, particularly applies to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy because that organization is the Devil’s chief representative on earth and the principal part of his earthly seed. The Lord designates that religious organization as the ‘old harlot’, which now sings seductive songs that she may entice into her trap all </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">nations and peoples of the earth. She is the masterpiece of Satan’s earthly production. During the many centuries in which lawlessness and hypocrisy have been carried on God has been long-suffering toward his enemies. But the end has come and the day of reckoning is at hand, and therefore Jehovah says to his organization under the leadership of Christ Jesus: “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle” (Obad. 1) ; thereby meaning to arise against the Devil’s organization, and that part of the commandment which applies to Jehovah’s witnesses on earth directs them to arise especially against the religious element of the Devil’s organization. In keeping with this war order Jehovah has commissioned his Chief Officer and all who are under his leadership and command. That commission in part says: “See, I have this day set thee over the nations, and over the kingdoms.” That part of the commission applies primarily to Christ Jesus, and this is further shown by the declaration of Jehovah as set forth in another scripture, to wit: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. Ask of me, and I shall give thee the [nations] for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a rod </span><span class="font3">of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”—Ps. 2: 6, 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">• Marching under the command of their great General, Christ Jesus, all the members of his organization must perform their part of the commission, and therefore must be wholly obedient to the Lord’s commandment. Let everyone, therefore, who has fully enlisted under the leadership of Christ Jesus, and who desires to go in the right way, give heed to every word of the commission, whieh reads: “See, I have this day set thee over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.” (Jer. 1:10) By the terms of that commission we are fully informed what must be done by all whom the Lord approves and what will be the final result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>T</sup> The Lord is directing his forces against the hypocritical religious enemy, and his declaration is that the leaders in that organization as well as the organization itself shall be completely ‘rooted out’. The devilish, religious system which long ago was planted be</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">side the </span><span class="font3">“waters” of the earth, that is, the peoples </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">the nations of the earth, has grown great and mighty. Her poisonous roots have sunk deep down into the earth and tightened themselves around the people. Today she prides herself upon her stable position and boastfully says: ‘No evil can befall us, because we have made lies our refuge.’ That wicked system has drugged the people with her vicious doctrinal wines, which have been fermented and prepared by the Devil himself. By that means the people have been made blind to God’s gracious provision for them, have been made drunk with wickedness and have been deprived of their freedom of thought and freedom of worship, and have been frightened into submission and robbed of their material substance; and this has been done by the greatest scheme of racketeering that has ever been operated on earth. Shall the Devil be permitted to longer continue to use that religious system and the supporting elements of that organization to deceive the people and to defame God’s holy name? No; because the Almighty God has decreed that she shall be rooted out, pulled down and destroyed, and the time to begin that work has arrived.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah has commanded his people to rise and engage in the war and has handed to them their commission directing what shall be done, and he has supplied them with the weapons by which they must carry on that war and by which they must press the enemy to the wall. The weapons of our warfare are not such as battleships and guns, bombing planes and poisonous gas; they are not cruel schemes of boycott, threatening personal injury and the wanton destruction of property: our instrument of warfare is the Word of the Almighty God, the sword of his spirit, which, when wielded by his joyful army, shall root out the defamers that have hidden themselves in a great mountain of vicious lies. We have no fight against any human creatures. We must not and will not attempt to inflict bodily injury upon any creature. We have no malice against any man. We are not fighting to do injury, but to do good in the name of God. We are engaged in a holy and righteous war, prompted entirely by unselfishness and, at the command of Almighty God, prosecuted with vigor against the most stupendous system of racketeering and crowd of racketeers that have ever operated against men. Above all, that system of racketeering operates falsely in the name of Christ and God, and thereby defames God’s name and his Word. It is a religious system improperly defined and falsely used to accomplish a wrongful purpose, employing political and commercial tactics to reach its goal. Religion is the offspring of Satan, and religion has ever been a shield and a blind behind which ungodly men have operated to deceive the people and work injury to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> Only the spirit of Almighty God, operating through his Word, can and will root out that devastating religious system. That his servants may be properly equipped for the war in which they arc commanded to engage, the Lord directs them to put on his armor, and then adds: “And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. ” (Eph. 6:17) Thus he shows that the offensive weapon of his witnesses on earth is his Word. The members of his army on earth still walk in a fleshly organism, but they operate according to the spirit of God; therefore for their instruction it is written: “For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: (for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of strong holds;) casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.”—2 Cor. 10:3-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Their weapons being thus clearly defined and identified, the Lord then says to these faithful witnesses: “And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.” (2 Cor. 10:6) Clearly this means that when God’s servants faithfully obey his commandments they are in readiness to proclaim his vengeance against all disobedience and by this means to expose the hypocritical and deceitful enemy. Every person who is on the side of God and his kingdom must and will arm himself with the Word of God and go forth in obedience to the Lord’s commandment. Have you obeyed to thus arm yourself? and are you carrying out God’s commandment?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> That the men of God might be fully equipped for this work, Jehovah, in recent months, has unfolded to their view the meaning of his prophecies written long ago foretelling his purpose and his action. By the unfolding of his prophecies Jehovah has given his people a vision of his kingdom and his work and of the obligation he has laid upon his servants. He has brought into operation and use the radio and has used it as a means of transmitting information to many persons of the world who have desired to hear the truth. That broadcasting of the kingdom message of God greatly frightened the religious leaders, and they tried in every possible way to hide the truth and keep the people in subjection, and, being unable to answer the sharp thrust of the sword of the spirit, the leading practitioners of religion remained in their holds (hiding places) and refused to fight like men. God’s prophet describes them in these words: “The mighty men of Babylon have forbom to fight, they have remained in their holds; their might hath failed; they became as women.”—Jer. 51:30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Being crowded and prodded by the sword in the hands of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, those hypocritical buck-nuns have stealthily and catlike tried to bluff the radio stations into silence and have silenced many stations and thus prevented the people from hearing the truth. But many of the people have heard the truth and have desired to hear more. Those religious prognosticators and practitioners, being unable to fight like men, became as women, even in appearance of their dress and by their actions. They began to scream out against Jehovah’s witnesses, saying: “They are liars, they misrepresent us and our religion, and they shock our religious susceptibilities.” They scratch and bite and kick and pull hair, but never attempt to boldly defend one of their false doctrines, because they have no defense. Their conduct so aroused the people of America that recently more than two and one-half million persons signed a petition requesting the religionists to use the radio to tell the people wherein Jehovah’s witnesses, who proclaim the message of God, are in the wrong. Again the religionists refused to come into the open and fight in defense of their false doctrines, and instead have resorted to their only means of fighting, by crying out against Jehovah’s witnesses, ‘ ‘ Liars, jailbirds, bigots and sedition-ists,” thus hoping to so blind the people that the issue would be entirely hid. Then the Lord provided a further means for the wielding of his sword, and this time brought into operation thousands of sound machines and hundreds of thousands of recordings of speech by which the kingdom message is reproduced and proclaimed for the people; and now thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses are carrying these machines to the people, reproducing the message and enlightening the people concerning God’s name and his kingdom, and by this means they are rooting out those religionists who have burrowed deep down into the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> As Jehovah commissioned Jeremiah to go to the practitioners of the Jews’ religion and to pull down and throw down that devilish system that the people might find the only way of escape, so now God commissions and commands his witnesses to do a like work toward the religionists and religious systems, which Satan has employed and used for his purpose, and particularly that false religious system wrongfully named “the Christian religion”. Jehovah caused his prophecy to be so written that no man could understand it until God’s due time to make the same clear. Now Jehovah has removed the covering and made clear his prophecies and clearly to appear his purposes. He has caused the message of the kingdom to be printed in more than seventy different languages and put in book form and caused these publications to the number of more than 250 million to be placed in the hands of the people who desire to know the truth. Today multitudes of people are studying the message of God’s kingdom thus provided, and they find great comfort therein. By this means God is pulling down and throwing down the fortress of Satan behind which he has hidden his religious racketeers. God is uncovering their hiding places and is exposing to view the falsehoods that have long been leveled against his holy name and his Word and is now affording the opportunity for the people to see his gracious provision for their welfare and blessing. This work he has committed to the faithful people taken out of the world for his name’s sake.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> Jeremiah was a Jew and was sent to the Jews of Jerusalem to do a work that exposed the religionists </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">the Jews, and to inform the people of God’s purpose to destroy that city, where he had put his name, and to point out to the people the only way of escape. That work of Jeremiah appeared to the religionists to be a very strange work. Likewise today, Jehovah God is sending his true and faithful servants, whom he has made his witnesses in the earth, to carry his message of truth to those who call themselves Christian and who practice what is called “the Christian religion”. He sends forth his witnesses now to warn the people that soon he will completely destroy “Christendom ’ ’, which bears his name, and at the same time shows to the people that there is only one way of escape and that is by fleeing to the kingdom of God under Christ. This work of Jehovah’s witnesses is rooting out the religious leaders, destroying their pastures, pulling down their strongholds, and throwing down that which the clergy have claimed to be their impregnable fortress; and this work of Jehovah’s witnesses is to them and to their supporters a “strange work”. All who are against God and his kingdom cry out and say: “It is a strange work for professed Christian people to be engaged in. It seems passing strange that they would fight against other Christians. ” It is strange to them because they do not have a vision of God’s purpose to now clear out the Devil and his organization and to establish complete righteousness under Christ His King. This is God’s “strange work”, and it is the fulfillment of his prophecy long ago written, to wit: “For the Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim, . . . that he may do his work, his strange work.” This work must be done and completed before God begins his “strange act” at Armageddon. (Isa. 28:21) When Armageddon begins, there will be no more opportunity for his witnesses to engage in such work.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The commission which God gave to Jeremiah furthermore contained these words, to wit, &quot;to build and to plant.” Likewise today, God has commissioned his people in Christ, and who are working with Christ and who are working under the immediate command of Christ Jesus, to build and to plant. In this connection Jehovah said to Jeremiah: “Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.” (Jer. 1: 9) Likewise to his witnesses today Jehovah says: “And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.” (Isa. 51:16) Thus it is seen that by his Word he is accomplishing his purpose. To all who have the ear to hear Jehovah says of his King, Christ Jesus: “Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.” (Isa. 55:4) Then addressing all persons who love righteousness and hate iniquity the Lord God says </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">them: “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">eat; yea, </span><span class="font3">come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread [for such things as prayers to get your dead friends out of ‘purgatory’] ? and your labour for that which satisfieth not ? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.”—Isa. 55:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>16</sup> The work of Christ Jesus now, and in which his faithful followers are permitted to have a part, is tearing down the strongholds of the wicked one and his wicked servants, and at the same time erecting a lasting habitation for the abiding place of the peoples on earth and inviting those who are of good will to enter and partake of its blessings, and that without money and without price. Therefore Jehovah commands the true followers of Christ Jesus in these words: “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people. ’ ’—Isa. 62:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1T</sup> Clearly, therefore, these witnesses are commanded to lift up, not the standard of some earthly government, over which Satan is the invisible ruler; the standard which God’s people are commanded to lift up is that of Jehovah, pointing the people to the only government that can ever bring to mankind peace, prosperity and everlasting joy. Never have creatures on earth been given such a privilege as this. Do you have understanding ? Do you appreciate your relationship to God and his kingdom under Christ ? If so, are you doing your part to carry the message of warning and of comfort to the hungry and thirsty people? Everyone who is on the Lord’s side must now be a witness to his name. Are you proving that you are on God’s side by joyfully rendering yourself in obedience to his commandments? The strange work foreshadowed by Jeremiah is now in progress and must be done, and those on the side of God and his kingdom will do that work willingly and joyfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MODESTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Modesty is the possession and exhibition of a moderate estimate of one’s own worth and importance. The arrogant, boastful and self-important man is immodest and is therefore presumptuous before the Lord. He has an undue estimate of his own worth. Such was the disposition of Lucifer, and led to his downfall. The creature that is pleasing to God is modest, not thinking more highly of himself than he ought to think, but soberly considering what he may do by God’s help. The arrogant, boastful and self-important creature is an abomination in the sight of God. Those among the company of God’s people who have and manifest the disposition to boss others, to use harsh words and means and arrogant methods, are headed for the “evil servant” class and to the end which awaits Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> The prophet Jeremiah was a modest man. The true and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are modest because the man Jesus was modest and they must be like him. He was meek and lowly of heart. (Matt. 11:29) He was always diligent to do his Father’s will, and that with delight. He admonishes his followers to pursue the same course. Jeremiah exhibited his modesty before God when he said: “Ah! Lord God! Behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child.” (Jer. 1:6) He thus spoke the truth, because of himself he had no power to perform the duties laid upon him. Then Jeremiah became fearless and bold because he was given the assurance that God was behind him and was backing him up and supporting him and would do so to the end. That made Jeremiah very courageous and strong in the power of the Lord. God said to Jeremiah: “Say not, I am a child; for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. Be not afraid of their faces; for I am with thee to deliver thee.”—Jer. 1: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Likewise today, those whom Jehovah approves as his witnesses are modest, realizing that in themselves there is no strength. But to Jehovah’s witnesses these words of the apostle are addressed: “Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God. For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the holy [spirit], and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.” (1 Thess. 1:4,5) Realizing that Jehovah and Christ Jesus are backing them up and fully supporting them, the faithful witnesses of the Lord cast aside all fear of man and demons and become bold in the Lord and joyfully declare the message which God has committed unto them. Thus they show their love for God and Christ. (1 John 4:17,18) Here again it is seen that Jeremiah was an example unto God’s people of this day, and this is another proof that the prophecy was written for their benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">•* Jehovah then specifically commanded Jeremiah to move forward declaring his judgments against the religionists, that is, the Jews who had forsaken their covenant and had turned to devil worship. Today God commands his witnesses on the earth to move forward declaring his judgment against the religionists, that is to say, those who have pretended to be his servants but who have given themselves over to the practice of the Devil religion. Therefore the words addressed to Jeremiah apply with greater force today to the witnesses of Jehovah, who says: “And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands. Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.”—Jer. 1:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Jeremiah knew that to obey God’s commandment he must face a powerful and entrenched crowd of Jewish clergymen who would be supported by a credulous and unreasonable people, and that therefore he must face a very great danger. And receiving such words of encouragement and assurance from the Lord he went forth in the strength of Jehovah. His diffidence exactly corresponds with the timidity of frail men and women who now go forward in the witness work, knowing that they must face a cruel and powerful entrenched crowd of religionists who resort to unfair and underhanded methods of warfare. The words that God then spoke for the assurance of Jeremiah were written specifically for the encouragement and assurance of the people of God on earth today, and which words of further assurance are these: “For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.” (Jer. 1:18) Thus it is seen that Jehovah today provides for the defense of his people, and he makes them strong in his power and might and makes them as brass walls against the rulers, the politicians, the strong-arm squad, and all other religionists who come against them. The faithful of the Lord, therefore, see that he who is for them is far greater than all that can be against them. (Rom. 8:31) Jeremiah, a lone man, was to go against a cruel, arrogant and boastful crowd. He knew that those religionists of Jerusalem would bitterly oppose him, and likewise today Jehovah’s witnesses know that the religious leaders and their supporters in “Christendom” will bitterly oppose them and do oppose them, and for their encouragement and full assurance Jehovah says to them: “And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” (Jer. 1:19) Such is further and corroborative proof that the battle is not man’s, but it is God’s fight, in which man is permitted to have some part in order to prove his integrity toward God. It is God’s “strange work”, which he has risen up to do, and he commands his servants to join in that war. When his “strange work” is done, then will follow God’s “strange act” to be performed by Christ Jesus and his host of invisible warriors, resulting in the complete wiping out of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PURPOSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">” Jehovah’s purpose in sending his prophet Jeremiah to prophesy at Jerusalem was twofold, as shown by the record. Jeremiah must warn the religionists of Jerusalem to amend their way and doings and to no longer trust in their religious leaders, and that they must cease oppressing the stranger; and their failure to give heed to and obey this admonition would result in their punishment by God sending his Executioner to destroy that people. Also he was to warn all persons of good will that their only place of safety was to put themselves under his “servant”, King Nebuchadnezzar, who foreshadowed Christ Jesus, the world's rightful King. Likewise today, Jehovah uses his witnesses to give warning to the religionists of the world that unless they amend their ways and doings, and cease the practice of Devil religion and refrain from giving heed to religious leaders and false prophets, he will send his mighty Executioner, who will destroy them and the whole world. Also these witnesses must declare to the people of good will that all who would find safety and salvation must flee to God’s King, Christ Jesus. Jehovah’s witnesses, under the leadership of Christ Jesus, are engaged now in this very work in obedience to God’s commandment. We are against religion because it is of the Devil. We are for Christianity, that is, the kingdom organized under Christ, because it is of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COMPANIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>,4</sup>In the land of Palestine there were honest and sincere persons who were not Israelites and who did not indulge in devil worship, and which persons were the descendants of Jonadab. In that land there were also slaves not Israelites but who were made to serve the Israelites, and these were represented particularly in Ebed-melech, who showed favor to God’s prophet, Jeremiah. The Jonadabs and Ebed-melech pictured the persons of good will who today are not religionists but who are anxious to hear the message of truth and who, when hearing it, take their stand on the side of God and his King and become the companions of the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses, to whom is committed the testimony of Jesus Christ. The anointed remnant, pictured by Jeremiah, now leads, and those of good will who have devoted themselves to God join them in service and as companions, which companions go to make up the great multitude that serves in God’s organization all the time with zeal and joy. The organization of Jehovah is symbolized by Jerusalem because he put his name there; and so those of the temple company are designated by the psalmist under the name “Israel”, and concerning them it is prophetically written: “I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord. Our feet shall stand within thy gates, 0 Jerusalem. Jerusalem is builded </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font3">a city that is compact together. ’ ’—Ps. 122:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">*’ All who are of the antitypical Jerusalem, or God’s organization, must be at peace with each other and must work together as one unit. They pray constantly for the peace of the organization. The words of their prayer for peace to the visible part of God’s organization include these, to wit: ‘ ‘ For my brethren and companions ’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.” (Ps. 122:8) In a compact and united body the remnant and their companions, the Jonadabs, with joy </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font3">songs of praise to Jehovah march out to war against the enemy, and they hear the words of Jehovah saying to them: “Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude [of the enemy]; for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">battle is not yours, but God’s.” (2 Chron. 20:15) </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Are you in </span><span class="font3">this army of the Lord marching to war with songs of joy and praise upon your lips ? Have you the faith in God’s promise that moves you into zealous activity ? Are you trusting solely in the Lord, and are you going forward doing your part ? Every one must perform the obligation laid upon him. No one can substitute for you. No one can sit idly by and let someone else do the work, and then expect to receive God’s blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FEARLESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>M</sup> Necessarily the message which Jeremiah delivered was very unpopular with the religious leaders of Jerusalem. It was so very unpopular that it called forth upon his head the wrath of the clergy. That did not frighten Jeremiah, however. He did not compromise or shun to declare the words which God had commanded him to declare. He must obey God without regard to whether it pleased or did not please men. Jeremiah did not ask for or accept a license from any of the rulers to go about and deliver his message, because God had commanded its delivery and no power could give a license to do or could properly prevent the doing of that which the Almighty God commands. Exactly like conditions exist today. The message which Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions are delivering at God’s commandment is very unpopular with the clergy, and particularly with those of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. This does not frighten those who love God, however. His witnesses do not shun to declare the message as commanded, nor do they compromise by permitting that message to be censored by others, nor do they ask for or receive from men a license to deliver the kingdom message. God has commanded that it shall be done, and his witnesses must obey God, and when the laws of man are contrary to God’s law the faithful will obey God’s law and take the consequences as God may will. Thus it is seen that Jehovah cle.arly outlined the course of action that his witnesses now on earth must take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2T</sup> Doing the command of Jehovah, Jeremiah warned the people that they should not give heed to the clergy and their supporters who are teaching false doctrines, and if they did so hearken to these religionists then all the people should be destroyed. At the command of Jehovah Jeremiah said to the people concerning those religious leaders and clergymen: “For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.” (Jer. 27:10) Likewise today, the witnesses sent forth by Jehovah warn the people that if they continue to hear and obey the clergymen and religious leaders they will certainly suffer destruction. God commands this to be done because these religious leaders are defaming his name by bowing down to and worshiping that which the Devil has created. For the aid of the people Jehovah’s witnesses point to his Word, wherein he says concerning Christ Jesus the King: ‘Behold, my elect Servant, upon whom I have put my spirit. In him [Christ Jesus] shall the people hope.’ (Matt. 12:18,21) These words of truth, when declared, shock the religious susceptibilities of the clergy, and they become very angry and make strong efforts to have Jehovah’s witnesses imprisoned or destroyed and their work stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’•The Jew religionists sought to have Jeremiah killed because he told the truth. Had those Jew religionists been the representatives of God, as they claimed, they would have received the message of warning with fear and trembling and would have sought diligently to amend their ways. They should have known that if Jeremiah was delivering a message in God’s name and contrary to His will God would punish him in due time, because God had killed Hananiah the prophet for teaching rebellious doctrines. Those Jewish clergymen did not want their means of a living by easy methods endangered. Likewise today, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy claims to be God’s representatives, and if that claim were true they should receive the message of warning with fear and trembling and cease obtaining money from the widows and orphans upon the false pretense of rendering aid to their beloved dead in “purgatory” and would cease any other like teachings which blaspheme God’s holy name. But those religionists do not care to have their means of revenue endangered. Hence they resort to all manner of underhanded methods to put to silence Jehovah’s witnesses and to prevent the people from hearing the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>89</sup> The religious leaders of Jerusalem took the lead in their effort to have Jeremiah put to death for delivering the truth; as it is written: “Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.” (Jer. 26:8) The Jewish clergy seized Jeremiah and brought him into court and howled for his lifeblood. So today, the religious leaders hear the message of the Lord at the mouth of Jehovah’s witnesses, and they become very mad, cause the arrest of Jehovah’s witnesses, and hale them into court, charging them with sedition and with inciting the people to the commission of violence, and they demand that Jehovah’s witnesses be severely punished. These clergymen know that they lie against Jehovah’s witnesses, but such underhanded and unfair methods are their only way of fighting. It is the clergy who cause the false charges to be made against Jehovah’s witnesses, and it is the clergy who incite their fanatical supporters to form a mob, and often Catholic priests lead the mob against Jehovah’s witnesses. Those clergymen claim that the truth, when proclaimed, will cause mob and insurrection, but the clergy themselves are the ones who attempt to stir up dissension and form a mob.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">•° Jeremiah was fearless because he knew he had the support of the Almighty God. Likewise the witnesses of Jehovah today are fearless; and as Jeremiah said to the religionists, even so now the faithful witnesses of Jehovah say: “The Lord sent me to prophesy against you, and the Lord God we will obey.” Here Jeremiah set a precedent by which Jehovah’s witnesses are to be guided, because the record was made for the benefit of those now on the earth, Jeremiah knew that his life was in danger, but his trust was in Jehovah. Likewise today, the witnesses of Jehovah know that they are always in danger, but their trust is in the Almighty God, and with joy they obey him. That prophetic drama made by the Lord shows two different classes of persons today on earth who claim to be the servants of God, that is to say, a class of fearful ones and a class of fearless ones. The record shows that Jehovah had two men who prophesied at the same time against Jerusalem, to wit, Urijah, who became fearful and was killed, and Jeremiah, who was faithful to the end, and whom Jehovah God protected and preserved. Urijah learning that the religionists were about to arrest him, and fearing they would kill him, he fled to Egypt; but he was there apprehended and brought back and put to death. Jeremiah delivered the message of the Lord, as he was commanded to do. The fact that Urijah had been put to death did not deter Jeremiah. Instead of showing fear and fleeing to some other part of the Devil’s organization, Jeremiah stood up before his accusers and said to them: ‘I have delivered the message which God sent me to deliver. Now do what you will.’ Urijah sought protection in the Devil’s organization, and died as a result. Jeremiah put his trust wholly in the Lord God, and was spared. There was also set a precedent by which God’s people must now be guided. Their protection and salvation is to be found only in God’s organization under Christ Jesus, and for anyone to seek other means of safety shows lack of faith in God. The experiences of Jehovah’s people in Germany and elsewhere show that the fearful suffer far more than the fearless. When we have a duty to perform, we should perform it without fear of man or devil and we should remember the words of Jesus, who said: “And be not afraid of them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” —Matt. 10:28, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>81</sup> The fanatical religionists may kill us now, but the faithful unto death God will immediately resurrect to a perfect and glorious life. Jehovah’s witnesses, anointed and commissioned of the Lord to perform certain duties, know that they must die some time in order to prove their integrity and to enter fully into the spiritual kingdom of the Lord. They are determined, therefore, to die in faith and faithfully devoted to God in the performance of duty, and, having this faith, they are blind to everything save that of doing the will of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">•’ Those who now receive God’s approval must be faithful even unto death. The Lord God has committed to them through Christ Jesus the interests of the kingdom, which kingdom interests include faithful obedience in carrying out his instructions to declare the message of his kingdom. Having committed to his witnesses much, the Lord demands of them much more than a mere passive obedience. They must prove themselves entirely reliable and dependable. Dependability shown in small things shows dependability in greater things. The privilege of now serving Jehovah in his “strange work” is the greatest privilege ever given to man. Such witnesses then must show faithfulness and dependability in all things that the Lord commits into their hands. It behooves everyone who has made a covenant with the Lord to examine himself to see whether or not he is meeting that which the Lord requires of him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">•• As to the Jonadabs or “other sheep”, they have sought and found refuge in the organization of the Lord, and they too must be faithful and faithfully give heed to and obey the commandments of God. They must not get out of bounds, which means they must stick close to and remain faithfully devoted to God and his organization under Christ. They are privileged to be the companions of the anointed and to serve with them before the temple of God. They are not to fear men or devils, because by so manifesting fear they would easily be led into the snare of the enemy. They are to seek righteousness by faithfully obeying God’s commandments which he has given them. They are to seek meekness by being diligent in their efforts to gain knowledge and to grow in wisdom and understanding. The same degree of faithfulness is required of them as is required of the remnant.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>34</sup> Now the day has come when Jehovah calls to his organization, both invisible and visible, and commands all: “ Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle. ’ ’ That means that God’s organization arises to give battle to the enemy, which enemy is represented on earth chiefly by the ‘old harlot’, who now goes about singing and putting on her gaudy show, hoping thereby to induce all the people to put themselves under her influence and control, and thus she turns them against God and his King. She is but the visible instrument and representative of the real enemy, Satan, who together with all of his associates is described in the Scriptures as ‘principalities and powers, and a host of wicked spirits’. (Eph. 6:12) For centuries Satan and a host of wicked angels have mocked Jehovah and reproached his holy name, turned the people away from their real Friend, Jehovah, and have hurried them on the road to destruction. Jehovah has been long-suffering, abiding his own good time when he will bring the issue to a final settlement. That day is at hand, and soon at Armageddon God, through Christ, will destroy the religious systems that work fraud and deceit, sweep away the hiding place of lies, and then completely wreck every part of Satan’s organization. Before this devastating peril falls upon the world Jehovah sends forth his faithful servants, commanding them to give warning to the people of his purpose, and that the people of good will toward God may flee to his kingdom under Christ and there find safety and salvation. If you are on the side of God and his kingdom it is your privilege and bounden duty to engage in this “strange work” of the Lord. Will you do your part and prove your faithfulness and your integrity ? or will you sit idly by and rest your hope of salvation merely upon a little knowledge you have gained in times past, and in what you think is your sanctimonious good character?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>35</sup> That the people of God might perform with intelligence their commission and duty, Jehovah has revealed to them the enemy and his position, and at the same time has supplied his witnesses with another means of using their offensive weapon, the sword of his spirit. By His grace the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> is now provided as another instrument of war. Through it he discloses the enemies of God and of those who love and serve God. He shows that the enemies are seeking the destruction of God’s people, and how God’s people must meet and resist their assaults. He discloses how the enemy, seeing that the time is short, now desperately puts forth every effort to turn all the people of the nations against God and to plunge them into destruction. He shows that the principal visible instruments the Devil is using for his purpose are the religious organizations, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which carries on its great and seductive racket by which the people are robbed of their substance, deprived of their freedom of thought, action, and worship, and are shoved blindly into the ditch of despair. He makes it possible for iis to warn them of their danger now impending. He points out to those of good will their real Friends and discloses to them the only way and means of salvation to life everlasting. Those on the Lord’s side cannot now remain silent and at the same time escape responsibility. God declares that if they do remain silent and do not warn the people, that will mean their own destruction. (Ezek. 33:7) We cannot maintain our integrity by remaining silent. We can maintain our integrity only by energetically and faithfully obeying the Lord’s commandment and by going forth to the people with his message of warning and of salvation. First, then, we must arm ourselves and equip ourselves with the information concerning the enemy, that we may intelligently perform our commission. God used Jeremiah to blaze the way by ensample. His witnesses must now walk in the same way. It is our bounden duty to go to the people with God’s revealed message of truth, declare it fearlessly and boldly, and thus perform our commission to root out of their hiding places the buck-nuns and other visible tools of Satan, to pull down and throw down the most gigantic and fraudulent system that has ever afflicted the people and reproached God’s name, and at the same time to lift up for the people the standard of Jehovah and his King and thus participate in planting and building the kingdom of God under Christ, which shall completely and for ever vindicate the name of the Most High. It is the last time. Will you perform your duty by joyfully obeying the imperative mandate of the Almighty God ?</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark3"></a>TEMPLE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH’S covenant people, the remnant, now on the earth, were foreshadowed by his prophet Ezekiel. Let it be kept in mind that the vision of the temple (Ezekiel 40-48) was given to Ezekiel in 592 B.C., fourteen years after Jerusalem was smitten by Babylon. Since the desolation of Jerusalem must continue for seventy years, till 536 B.C., such desolation must continue for fifty-six years after the date of the vision had by Ezekiel. (2 Chron. 36:19-21) Some general observations at this point may be helpful to the earnest student in the examination of the Scriptures relating to the temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The war in heaven and on earth began in A.D. 1914, in which Satan’s organization was smitten both in heaven and on the earth. The war in “Christendom” ended in 1918; and the presumption is that the war in heaven ended about that time, because the Scriptures show that Christ Jesus came to the temple of Jehovah in 1918.—Mal. 3:1; Isa. 6:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The vision of Ezekiel does not fix the date of the erection of the temple structure. He saw it as though it were complete. The time of Ezekiel’s vision would seem to more particularly correspond to the time when the faithful remnant of God’s covenant people as a company would be given an understanding (or vision) of the meaning of Ezekiel’s prophecy relating to the temple. The Lord came to his temple in 1918, as the proof shows, and fourteen years after that time would bring us to the date 1932. In this latter year the explanation of Ezekiel’s temple-vision was published in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font3"> Book Three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophetic vision of Ezekiel gave assurance that at some time there would be a restoration or re-establishment of God’s covenant people in their homeland. This does not mean the restoration of the natural descendants of Jacob, called Israelites or Jews. The Israelites were a typical people; hence the re-establishment must refer to the spiritual Israelites foreshadowed by “the remnant of Jacob”, to wit, God’s chosen and anointed ones for membership in the royal house. Isaiah prophesied: ‘ ‘ And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God. For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.” (Isa. 10:20-22) One of Isaiah’s sons was named Shear-jashub, which name means “the remnant shall return”. Undoubtedly the prophecy of Isaiah refers to the remnant of God’s covenant people, and not to the natural descendants of Abraham and Jacob. Ezekiel and Isaiah corroborate each other and show that these prophecies were written for the special encouragement and comfort of the remnant that escape from Satan’s organization and return to their proper place in Jehovah’s organization, where they shall worship and serve Jehovah God in his temple.—Rev. 3:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The temple which Ezekiel saw in vision must be erected or reared up before Armageddon, the battle of that great day of God Almighty. Gog, the chief marshal of the Devil, leads the army in making assault upon God’s remnant at his sanctuary, and God will protect his people. “And the heathen shall know that I the Lord do sanctify Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.” (Ezek. 37:28) During the World War God’s sanctuary was trodden down, and afterward the remnant were brought into it. The very purpose is that observers may know that Jehovah has a people on earth who are entirely devoted to him and who delight to be his witnesses. God will especially protect and shield his people during that battle at Armageddon.—Ezek. 36:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Solomon’s temple was situated in the city of Jerusalem, but the temple or house that Ezekiel saw in vision, and here under consideration, is located separate and apart from the city and is on the north side thereof in the “holy portion of the land”. It is certain that Haggai the prophet of God refers to the temple that Ezekiel saw in vision when he wrote: ‘ ‘ The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts.” (Hag. 2:9) This prophecy of Haggai is considered in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication, </span><span class="font3">Book Three, chapter 11, pages 128-139.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Who is the builder of the temple Ezekiel saw ? The vision written down by the prophet shows that the temple was not an architect’s plan set out on blueprints, which building was afterward to be erected according thereto, but that the house or temple was even then fully constructed. The heaven-sent messenger was there to measure it, and did measure it in detail, which shows that it was completely erected. It was immaculately elean and pure, undefilcd and absolutely holy. Its condition is exactly opposite to that of the former or typical temple (as described by Ezekiel in chapter 8) which was destroyed because profaned and polluted. The building as seen by Ezekiel God will never permit to be defiled, because it is his dwelling place.—Ezek. 43: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ezekiel does not state who built the temple that he saw, but other scriptures show that Jehovah is the builder, by the hand of his beloved Son, Christ Jesus. “Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH: and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord: even he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.” (Zech. 6:12,13) Ezekiel’s vision therefore prophetically pictures the “building of God, an house not made with [human] hands, eternal in the heavens”. (2 Cor. 5:1) “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy ; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.” (1 Cor. 3:16,17) “And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.”—2 Cor. 6:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The temple house built by Solomon, and the one built by Zerubbabel, have long ago been destroyed; and the vision of Ezekiel, showing that the new house was completely built and shall never be defiled, proves conclusively that old “Christendom”, or “organized Christianity”, which became a false growth upon God’s temple class, and which began in the apostles’ day, will be completely cut off and will never have any part in God’s blessed organization. “In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the Lord’s house shall be like the bowls before the altar. Yea, every pot in Jerusalem, and in Judah, shall be holiness unto the Lord of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts.” (Zech. 14:20,21) It must be borne in mind that Ezekiel merely had a vision of a temple erected, and therefore it could not be properly said that there is or ever will be such thing as. ‘ ‘ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ezekiel’s</span><span class="font3"> temple”. He had a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">vision</span><span class="font3"> of God’s royal house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The coming of the Lord to his temple is pictured by the prophecy appearing at Ezekiel 43:1, 2. No mercy seat nor ark of the covenant is shown in the Most Holy of this temple. An ark appeared in the prophetic temple built by Solomon to represent God’s presence. But now the Lord himself is present; hence there is no necessity for any object to picture his presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning Jehovah God’s foursquare and living organization it is written, in Revelation 4:6-8: “And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[(Roth.)</span><span class="font3"> four living creatures], full of eyes before and behind. And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.” (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book One, page 58.) The living creatures described above are with the Lord at his coming and are also pictured on the walls of the temple Ezekiel saw. Hence this foursquare organization is pictured by Ezekiel’s prophecy (41:17-21). The temple or royal house is Jehovah’s dwelling place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah will for ever magnify the importance of the ransom work of Christ Jesus, and to him every knee shall bow for ever. Attention is called to this by the altar mentioned in chapter forty-three of Ezekiel’s prophecy, verses thirteen to eighteen, and it is given its proper place in the temple. This does not mean that the old temple practices and rites and festivals performed in accordance with the law given to Moses will be literally restored, but it does mean that God’s law is unchangeable, is perpetual and for ever binding. He will adhere to and enforce his law forever, and this he will do by establishing the real things which the Mosaic law foreshadowed. Evidently the purpose of bringing this matter to view in this prophetic vision is to stress the fact that God’s royal house will be used for active and continuous service to his glory. Its priesthood will not be merely an honorary company having a pension, without work, but will at all times be serving God to his glory and praise, and their service will result in blessing the obedient ones of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The kingdom of God is shown in the fact that the temple is built ‘upon the top of the high mountain’. (Ezek. 43:12) This house or temple is called by the Lord “the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet”. (Ezek. 43:7) This is the righteous kingdom. “The prince” is assigned to an outstanding position and given special privileges in the temple. He is the ruler under the King Of Eternity in the royal house. (Ezek. 44:1-3; 46:1-12) “The city” is located to the south of the temple in “the holy oblation” of land which is devoted to Jehovah’s purposes. (Ezek. 40:2; 48:35) As the city is a part of Jehovah’s organization, over which the royal house is the head or capital, judgment is shown in the royal house or temple. (Ezek. 44:1-5) Rules and regulations, to be sure, would be enforced in the house of the Lord. Judicial decisions are rendered regarding the antitypical Levites (both the priests and the nonpriests) and those who will be the “princes in all the earth”. (Ps. 45:16) The fact that the heaven-sent messenger or guide of Ezekiel was equipped with a reed and a measuring line, and measured the temple throughout, also shows a judgment work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The raising up of the temple before Armageddon wpuld indicate a witness work to be done in the name of Jehovah. This is shown by the fact that Ezekiel was given instructions to publish the minutest details of the temple. (Ezek. 40:4; 43:10,11; 44: 5-7) In Ezekiel’s prophecy (47:22,23) it appears that strangers or heathens, others than God’s anointed, would sojourn in the land of Jehovah’s people; and this would indicate that a people of good will, and which often are referred to as the “millions now living that will never die” class, were coming to the kingdom, ‘the mountain of the house of the Lord, ’ seeking the Giver of righteousness, Jehovah, and seeking truth, meekness and righteousness. This information God caused to be written aforetime for the encouragement and comfort of his faithful people now on earth, to whom is given the privilege of bearing the fruits of the kingdom to the glory of God. With these general observations let attention be given now to what occurs between the heaven-sent messenger and Ezekiel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The man having the appearance of copper stood in the gate when Ezekiel observed him. “And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee: for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.” (Ezek. 40:4) Addressing Ezekiel as “son of man” shows that Ezekiel’s name was kept out of the picture and that the words of salutation are addressed to the remnant of God now on the earth as a company. It also suggests that the remnant company were seeing the beginning of the fulfillment of the vision while still on the earth in the flesh; and it is even so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Ezekiel class, that is to say, the remnant of God, must be wide-awake and on the alert. This is proved by the fact that Ezekiel was told by the heavenly messenger that he must have his eyes and ears open and his affections set upon things of the kingdom, and not on things of the earth. One may be consecrated and begotten of the spirit of God and called to the kingdom, but if he is dull of hearing and his heart has grown fat and gross, and his eyes are not beholding the privileges the Lord is setting before him, he could not be pleasing to the Lord. The remnant will be watchful, having “the hearing of faith”, and be wholly devoted to God and to his kingdom. If one is not this kind of servant of the Lord he could not be an accurate witness for the Lord in these days when the testimony must be given. He must appreciate the fact that his greatest privilege is to watch, be careful, and do the work of the Lord with greater consideration and care than he would do anything else. A dullard or one who goes along the line of least resistance could not be pleasing to God. As the Lord brought Ezekiel to the place in vision, even so now he has brought the remnant into the condition where they have the vision brought to them, there ‘to show His servant things that must speedily come to pass’.—Rev. 1:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the remnant must now bear testimony to the name of the Lord is shown by the further fact that the heaven-sent messenger told Ezekiel that he should declare all that he saw in the house of the Lord. Ezekiel was not to seal up that which was revealed to him, nor to meditate upon it merely for his own selfish aggrandizement. He must tell it out and thereby be a faithful and true witness for the Lord and his kingdom. That the highest degree of watchfulness and energetic activity is now required by the remnant is shown by these texts that follow: ‘ ‘ Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.” (Ezek. 43:10) “And the Lord said unto me, Son of man, mark [set thine heart </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(margin)] </span><span class="font3">well, and behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the Lord, and all the laws thereof ; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.” (Ezek. 44:5) “And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand. He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.”—Rev. 22:10,11.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark5"></a>PUBLI</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH’S witnesses recognize that Ezekiel’s prophecy was written at the dictation of the Most High God, to be understood only in God’s due time by his obedient servants. In chapter nine of that prophecy these words appear: “Behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side; and they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Who is the one man clothed with linen and with a writer’s inkhom by his side? Whom does he represent in God’s organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Manifestly he could not picture any one individual in the flesh. Aside from the Lord Jesus Christ, God has never committed to any one individual on earth an exclusive work to be done by that individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the very beginning of his ministry Christ Jesus had a visible organization, and his apostles, acting collectively under his direction, formed the visible part thereof. There was unity of action by the faithful apostles; but with the passing away of these the unity did not again exist in the church until the coming of the Lord to the temple of Jehovah, as indeed it could not be complete until that time. Upon the coming of the Lord to the temple he found a faithful class, and these faithful ones are made the keepers or custodians of “his goods”, to wit, the kingdom interests. (Matt. 24:47) Those faithful ones, brought into the temple, are incorporated into God’s organization and made a part of the ‘elect servant’, because such are in Christ and form a part of The Christ. Such Jehovah designates as “the feet of him”, The Christ. (Isa. 52:7) Throughout the prophecy Jehovah addresses Ezekiel as “son of man”, manifestly because Ezekiel pictures that class which is counted in and made a part of The Christ, who is “the Son of the man”. ‘The man with the writer’s inkhorn by his side, ’ therefore, clearly represented the anointed “servant” class of Jehovah on earth, which class is a part of God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prophecy uttered by Ezekiel, therefore, pictures the greater part of God’s organization, in heaven, and which is invisible to men and to which the major part of the work is committed; and the lesser part, on the earth; the greater part being indicated by the number six, and the smaller part of the organization</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>SHERS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">being indicated by the number one, and together the two parts, making seven men, represent God’s entire organization under Christ Jesus the Head. Individuals do not appear at all in the picture, because God deals with the members of his organization on earth collectively. There is not one scripture to support the conclusion that the man with the writer’s inkhorn by his side and clothed with linen pictures an individual. There are numerous scriptures proving that this one man pictures all the anointed ones on earth, and which constitute the “servant” class, the remnant of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This one man is further described as “clothed with linen”. Concerning the faithful approved ones, counted as members of the “bride” of Christ, it is written: “And it was given unto her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright and pure: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.” (Rev. 19:8, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> Such represents the approval received by the remnant, or “servant” class, from Jehovah, because they are in Christ and there is committed to them “the testimony of Jesus Christ”, and they keep the commandments of God and faithfully deliver this testimony. This fine apparel is the approval of the “servant” and his faithful service. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, pages 155,156.) This further identifies the man with the writer’s inkhom as the “faithful servant” class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It would be utterly inconsistent, and therefore impossible, for the six men described in the vision to picture any part of the world organization. The world organization is the Devil’s. The Devil’s organization is not under the command of Jehovah. Satan will not destroy his own organization. Every one of the seven must of necessity be in Jehovah’s organization and wholly devoted to the Most High God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the command was given, every member of the organization responded and registered before Jehovah for service; and this is pictured by the statement that “they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar”. Not one of these sat down and meditated and consoled the others; but every one stood at attention, ready to hear and to obey further commands. Each one of the earthly division of the organization ‘presents his body a living sacrifice, wholly devoted to and acceptable to God, which is his reasonable service’, and which he must gladly perform. (Rom. 12:1) Anyone who is not willingly and joyfully ready for service could surely not be of that organization, and hence could not be represented among those who registered at the altar for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fact that the earthly division is described as ‘the man with the writing material by his side’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font3"> shows that the work assigned to this servant is to write down Jehovah’s will, as revealed, and to publish and to distribute the truth to the people who would hear. This means that the “servant” class do not sit down or stay at home or confine themselves to one place of worship and talk among themselves, but that those composing the “servant”, or earthly division, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">go out among the people</span><span class="font3"> as representatives of God’s organization to perform the duty assigned to them. Their work is one of publishing, informing, witnessing, as shown by the order given. (Ezek. 9:4) This conclusion is likewise supported by the commission given to the anointed of Jehovah.—Isa. 61: 2; 62:10; 43:10-12; Deut. 32:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The entire organization is under orders from Jehovah God, who is present, directing the movement thereof. The glory of his presence was at the threshold of the house (the point of beginning) ; showing the entire organization of Jehovah alert and ready to begin action upon command’s being given. Then the one in command gives direction to the man with the writing material and who is clothed with linen. He is called and given orders as to what shall be done: ‘ ‘ And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer’s inkhorn by his side; and [Jehovah] said unto him, Go through . . . the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh, and that cry, for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.” (Ezek. 9: 3, 4) The vision discloses God’s expressed purpose to destroy “Christendom” with his army of destruction, which is in readiness; but before the assault is begun, he would have notice served upon the rulers and upon the peoples of “Christendom”. Also, while this is being done an opportunity is afforded for those people of good will and proper condition of heart to escape from or be hid from what is about to fall upon “Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “servant” class, pictured by the man with the writing material and clothed in linen, must go through the midst of “Christendom”, symbolized by the city, and mark in the forehead (or seat of intelligence) a certain class, that these might be spared from the slaughter weapons of those that follow. This marking would indicate that the ones thus marked must by some public confession or action take their stand on the side of Jehovah before the destruction begins. This work must be done by the “servant” class of God’s organization on earth; and when it is done, then the slaughtering work must begin by the ones represented by the six men with the slaughter weapons. This is in exact accord with the words uttered on another occasion to the “servant” class, to wit: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) Jesus also said that, at the conclusion of that witness work, “then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. ’ ’—Matt. 24:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These words of Jesus serve to further identify the man clothed in linen with the writer’s inkhorn by his side, and definitely show that he represented the “servant” class, and that those who do the slaughtering work are the invisible ones of the army of Jehovah. This shows the entire organization of Jehovah in action against the enemy in declaring and in enforcing the judgments of Jehovah that are previously written. In harmony with this the psalmist says: “Let the saints be joyful in glory; let them sing aloud upon their beds. Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the [nations], and punishments upon the people; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written; this honour have all his saints. Praise ye [Jehovah].”—Ps. 149:5-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This shows the entire organization working in exact harmony, as indeed God's organization must and does act. No one who is today in present truth could have the slightest doubt concerning the work that the anointed must now do in obedience to God’s commandments. For anyone to say that the active service in the field is improper is to demonstrate clearly that such one is not in the truth and no part of God’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The commandment is given to put a “mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh, and that cry, for all the abominations that be done in the midst” of “Christendom”. Who are the ones that receive the mark in their foreheads? Whoever they are, they cry for the abominations that are done in “Christendom”. It could not have reference to those who come to a knowledge of the truth and who are anointed of Jehovah, because such are in “the joy of Jehovah”, rejoicing in the fact that the time has come to clear out those that cause abominations and to destroy Satan’s organization and to completely vindicate the name of Jehovah. These are described as singing the praises of Jehovah and declaring his wondrous works.—Isa. 12:4-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ones marked are a class of people within the land of “Christendom”, under the Devil’s organization, but who are no part of it and do not sympathize with it. They arc people of good will who have a desire for righteousness but who have not had an opportunity to learn the truth, this being due to the unfaithfulness of the clergymen in “Christendom”. These people of good will observe the great degeneracy in “Christendom”, and they see the hypocrisy practiced by the leaders thereof, but they are powerless to bring about any better condition. They sigh and cry because of the abominable deeds committed by the ruling factors &quot;who wrongfully call themselves by the name of Jehovah God but who reproach his holy name. Many people of good will, non-churehgoers, seeing that the leaders in &quot;Christendom” are hypocrites and practice hypocrisy, while claiming to represent God, refuse to join any of the church organizations, because they wish not to serve a god such as the clergy represent that they serve. These people of good will are ignorant of God’s Word and his purposes of redemption and deliverance of the human race by and through the ministration of the kingdom. They have much consideration for the poor and oppressed, and a great desire to see them relieved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah tells of a class of persons whom he will ‘deliver in a time of trouble and keep alive and bless upon the earth’. (Ps. 41:1,2) This is the class of persons often described as ‘the millions now living that will never die’, who receive the mark in their foreheads ; that is to say, they are given, some knowledge of God’s purposes to destroy the wicked organization and to establish his own government of righteousness under Christ and according to his promise to bless all the families of earth. The persons in this class have tried to do right in proportion to the knowledge they had, but now, just preceding the great day of the wrath of God upon &quot;Christendom”, they must be given an opportunity to gain m&amp;re knowledge, that they may profit thereby. They are not a people that are desired by the rulers and chief ones in ‘ ‘ Christendom”, because they will not willingly lend, their support to &quot;Christendom”. Therefore Jehovah says to such: ‘Gather yourselves together, yea, gather to-: gether, 0 nation not desired; before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah’s anger come upon you. Seek ye Jehovah, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be ye shall be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger.’ (Zeph. 2:1-3) This they could not do without some knowledge; and it is the &quot;servant” class that must bear to them the precious truths of the kingdom, that they may see the way to go and what to do. The work of the &quot;servant” class, pictured by the man in linen and with the writer’s inkhorn, is therefore clearly and definitely marked out.</span></p>

The phonograph makes it so much easier to get into the home; and even if they don’t take any books they get some of tho message any way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Heard you talk on Sunday September 26, over the Richmond station. Will be glad when the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> comes, so I can read </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">it; </span><span class="font2">and hope I shall see your last talk at Columbus, on Questions and Answers, as it appealed to me very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Did not intend to take up so much of your time; but the Lord surely opens up the way when one goes to do his bidding. Just two weeks before I did not see how I could go to the convention; but things opened up so that Brother Martin and myself went. So you see we are of the Jw’s at Chincoteague, Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your sister and coworker by his grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anna Martin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THANKS FOR USE OF THE PHONOGRAPH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font2">want to express my thanks to the all-wise heavenly Father for the use of the phonograph and those wonderful records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many times I have witnessed, and felt the need of a coworker to help and explain a point. Now I have you along with me, and literature is left almost every time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Am looking forward for a record explaining our new book entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font2"> The “Riches” record is quite complete. It </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font2">very hard for me to sum up in a few words all the wonderful things in tho </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> book; but you, Brother Rutherford, have </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font2">summed up well in just a 4]-minutc talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now we are all soon to be better equipped to help the poor who can’t afford radios. All the money that would have been used on radio programs will be used to purchase- more sound cars and phonographs. Truly this is the Lord’s provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This week I found a Jonadab and his wife (also a Jonadab) away back in the hills of West Virginia. First they didn’t want any of my Bibles or books, and they didn't want to hear my Bible talk on the phonograph; but when I asked them if they ever heard Judge Rutherford they immediately let me come in. Their first question was, “Where do you get him on the radio! We have tried and tried on our little radio, but can’t get him.” After I explained the Lord’s new provision, I played one of the records. The man commented, “How wonderful!” and said it was the first time he had heard Rutherford’s voice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May Jehovah continue to use you in this great warfare as we ‘rise up in battle against her'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With Christian love,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Helen</span><span class="font2"> M. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Miller, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">West Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SEE REFUGE OF LIES WIPED OFF</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Having again the privilege to send you our Bethel study report for the month of October, 1937, at Helsinki office, I can state following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have studied the two articles on “Racketeers”. Plain speech, words that cannot be misunderstood. It is only natural that all those who love righteousness are rejoicing for these hard truths, and that the “pious” racketeers themselves are boiling over with rage when they see their refuge of lies, which they have considered as unconquerable, wiped off as a tiny, trifling tiling. Surely this is “strange work”, and we are waiting for more of that kind. The heavy hails which are painfully smiting all racketeers in the darkness of the cold world are melting into refreshing heavenly waters of truth for us in the warm shine of the Sun of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">October 5 we had no study for the [special] period. October 12 there were 14 persons at the meeting; October 19, 13; and October 26, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Unspeakably thankful for the dear </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> we are daily praying for the welfare of you according to His will. With our warmest greetings, I am,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your little brother by his grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Eero Nironen, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Secretary.</span></p>

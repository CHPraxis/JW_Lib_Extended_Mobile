<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● How can we harmonize </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:14:21-5:14:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 14:21</strong></a> <strong>(<em>NW</em>), “You must not eat any dead body,” and </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:40-3:11:40" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Leviticus 11:40</strong></a> <strong>(<em>NW</em>), “And he who eats any of its dead body will wash his garments and he must be unclean until the evening”?—D. H., Eire.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Actually, there is no disharmony between these two texts. One prohibits eating an animal that died of itself or was found dead, and the other shows the penalty for eating in violation of the prohibition. The mere fact that the eating of a dead body is forbidden does not mean that will never take place. The Law contained prohibitions of many things, but it also contained penalties for violating those prohibitions. The mere fact that a thing was prohibited did not of itself mean it would never be indulged in; hence penalties were set up to give force to the prohibitions. There were prohibitions against stealing, talebearing, adultery, murder, and many other sins of varying magnitude, and penalties of varying severity were fixed by the Law to guide Israel in dealing with violators. So it was in the matter of eating a dead body.</p>

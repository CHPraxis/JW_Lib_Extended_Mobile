Actions Belie Preaching
● According to Christ Jesus the actions of the clergy of his day belied their preaching. (Matt. 23:3-5) That they have a modern counterpart is apparent from the following. Professor Ole Halesby, president of the Lutheran Inner Mission Society in Norway, over the state broadcasting system warned sinners: “If you are not a believer, be careful! If you were to collapse and die suddenly, you would crash right straight into Hell!” Incidentally, those remarks set off a violent national religious controversy. Just how seriously the learned professor of theology took his own hell-fire preaching can be gathered from the fact that he, not long thereafter, was convicted of defrauding the government of taxes for at least ten years.

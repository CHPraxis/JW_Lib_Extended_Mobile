In Behalf of Religious Liberty
● A United Press dispatch for May 22, 1954, reported the following: “The Unitarian Ministers Association has gone on record against a proposal to include the words ‘under God’ in the pledge of allegiance. The association—at its 129th annual meeting in Boston—also protested against a proposed constitutional amendment which would say the United States ‘recognizes the authority and law of Jesus Christ.’ The association says the ‘under God’ phrase in the pledge of allegiance violates religious liberty . . . while the constitutional amendment would ‘imply a theological test for citizenship.’”

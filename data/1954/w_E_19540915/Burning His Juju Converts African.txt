Burning His Juju Converts African
● It was back in February that some Christian ministers visited a certain person of good will who was a leader of a juju society and an ardent believer in the power of the juju. They called his attention to what the Bible had recorded regarding Baal worshipers in times past and what it said about Jehovah’s being the only Life-giver. After giving careful attention to all that the witnesses had to say the juju worshiper stated that if they could prove that they had power over his juju he would believe. So on an agreed-to date the witnesses gathered together and invited all the townspeople to see what would happen. First a Bible lecture was given and then the juju idol was publicly burned. Through Jehovah’s undeserved kindness not only has this leader of the juju become a witness for Jehovah but he succeeded in interesting another person of good will in the true worship. Recently both were baptized at an assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses.

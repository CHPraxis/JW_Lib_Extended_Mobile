<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>PRAISING THE NEW WORLD’S SOVEREIGN EACH DAY</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Those whom God has called into his wonderful light desire, in accord with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:2-19:145:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 145:2</a>, to declare abroad his excellencies each day. Jehovah’s witnesses will continue doing this during October by talking to others about God’s purposes and presenting to them aids to understand both the Word of God and world events. <em>Awake! </em>magazine serves such a purpose. A year’s subscription for this very fine magazine will be offered for $1. To each new subscriber will be given three Bible booklets. If you are not associated with a congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses and would like to be, contact the closest Kingdom Hall or write this office.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Belief based on unsubstantial grounds, no matter how well meant or believed, is certain to bring disappointment. True belief and faith must have a good, solid foundation, a rocklike and firm basis. Hoping for a better world, and all of us do, we must base our belief on a sure foundation. Is God’s Word, the Bible, <em>the </em>source of accurate and true information concerning the new world? If you have any doubts now as to the Bible’s being the great storehouse of truth, your doubts will vanish after reading the 64-page booklet <em>Basis for Belief in a New World. </em>You are invited to obtain one copy for 5c or seven for 25c. Write for them today.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Nineteen centuries ago the apostle Paul wrote: “Where is the wise man? Where the scribe? Where the debater of this system of things? Did not God make the wisdom of the world foolish?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:20-46:1:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:20</a>, <em>NW</em>) That Christendom today is no different from the world of Paul’s day is apparent from the following observations made last April by Dr. T. Lord, president of the World Baptist Alliance, as reported by Leicester <em>Evening Mail, </em>April 17, 1954: “It will avail us nothing, our cleverness, our mighty power, unless the Lord himself comes into the midst of our councils, and directs them with his compassion. If we don’t turn to the Lord Jesus Christ, we are lost. Civilisation can be saved if we put the Lord in the centre.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I get worried about it. We are so clever, so erudite, we have never had so many degrees in the world, so many erudite preachers, so many DDs, so many undergraduates and so many scientific advances, and yet we were never in such a mess. We never had so many broken homes, so many children growing up into crime and we have never lived in such a perpetual state of fear as we are doing now.”</p>

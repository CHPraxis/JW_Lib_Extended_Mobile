<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>DAILY BLESSING THE NEW WORLD SOVEREIGN’S NAME—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:2-19:145:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 145:2</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">God himself, Jehovah, is the great sovereign of the new world. That new world is his provision for those of mankind who love him, who look to him for direction and who acknowledge him as the source of all permanent good. With him is the fountain of life, and by his King Son, Christ Jesus, he administers to all who want to be on his side the blessings of light and truth. Surely, then, the name of this great Sovereign should be acknowledged and blessed every day. But is this accomplished by merely saying now and again, ‘Bless God’? No. To bless and praise God’s name is to make known what his name stands for and the provisions he makes for those of good will toward him. You are invited to bless and praise Jehovah’s name with his witnesses this month of October by presenting a year’s subscription for <em>Awake! </em>magazine for $1. Three Bible booklets will be given free with each new subscription. Why not share in this opportunity to bless the new world Sovereign’s name?</p>

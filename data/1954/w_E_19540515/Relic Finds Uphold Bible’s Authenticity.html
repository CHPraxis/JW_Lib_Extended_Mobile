<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In the New York <em>Times </em>of December 22, 1953, appeared this arresting item: “The Smithsonian Institution is about to open to public view a collection of rare archaeological finds tracing the history of mankind through 500 centuries. The exhibit provides material support for disputed stories in the Bible. The ancient treasures—weapons, manuscripts, statuary, mosaics and religious relics—will be on display at the museum Jan. 10 through Jan. 27. Most of the items have been unearthed in the last two decades—a period that has revolutionized archaeological understanding of the Biblical era. Included in the exhibit will be a bit of copper from King Solomon’s mines, a slingshot from the time of David’s battle with Goliath, and the jawbone of an ass similar to the one Samson reputedly used to slay the Philistines.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">●“At a preview today, William F. Albright, Johns Hopkins University archaeologist, said the relics ‘revolutionize our understanding of the Bible.’ Mr. Albright said he suspected that the newly discovered treasures, as their mysteries were unraveled, would add fresh conflict to the old controversy of science vs. religion. The new data, he suggested, will give strong support to so-called fundamentalist interpretations of Biblical stories. For example, he said, some of the latest finds prove Solomon was even more fabulously wealthy than he was depicted in Biblical history. On exhibit, too, will be the oldest known Biblical manuscript, the ‘Dead Sea’ scrolls of Isaiah discovered in a forgotten cave by a Bedouin shepherd in 1947. The exhibition of 1,500 items was assembled by the American Fund for Israel Institutions from museums and private collections all over the world.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● One of the reporters for the Chicago <em>Tribune </em>recently interviewed a group of graduates from Chicago’s Southwest Side High Schools who were chosen as outstanding representatives of their graduating classes. The graduates were asked about their vocational plans. Regarding the wise choice made by one graduate the <em>Tribune </em>(January 17, 1954) reported: “A trip to Europe and later a life as a missionary for Jehovah’s Witnesses are in the future for Gage Park High School’s star student, Miss Eleanore Spitzke, 17. . . . She’ll take a job after graduation to earn money for her European tour, set for summer, 1955, when her denomination will hold a series of conferences on the continent. . . . Miss Spitzke’s choice of missionary work replaced earlier wishes to become a doctor or a mathematics teacher because of a belief that as a missionary she could be of greater help to more people.”</p>

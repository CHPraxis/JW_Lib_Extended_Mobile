<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Strikingly contrasting the attitude of the false shepherds, who feed only themselves, and the true, who feed the sheep, is the following experience of a lost sheep looking for the Right Shepherd, Christ Jesus. This lost sheep, a man of good will residing in a certain town in Norway, obtained a copy of the “New Testament” back in 1949 and began reading it. From it he was convinced that these were the last days, and to gain further knowledge he purchased a complete Bible. From his study of the Bible he gathered that he had something to do; but what, he did not know. He began talking to his friends and neighbors, but they were not interested. He went to the Protestant bishop, but the bishop was resting and so could not be disturbed. He managed to ask, however, “Where can I find a preacher who is willing to talk with me about the Bible?” He was told, “You will find that in the telephone book.” So he checked the phone book and then went to several preachers but they all told him that it was not necessary for him to study the Bible—just go to church regularly, that is the important thing. But this did not satisfy him.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A year and a half passed and he was still looking for an understanding of God’s Word. Then one day he accosted one of Jehovah’s witnesses who was offering Bible magazines on the street to passers-by. Would Jehovah’s witnesses care to discuss the Bible with him? Would they be willing to study the Bible with him? He was invited to come to the public lecture being held the next day and arrangements were made to have a regular Bible study with him. After just a few evenings of study he joined his instructor in the street-witnessing activity, offering Bible magazines to those passing by. He kept making progress and soon dedicated himself to Jehovah, was baptized, and today is a servant in the local congregation, taking the lead in helping others to be able ministers. Happy because of having found the Right Shepherd, he now is aiding others to find Him.</p>

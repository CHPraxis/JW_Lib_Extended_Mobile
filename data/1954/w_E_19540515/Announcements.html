<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>BE SURE TO COME TO THE ASSEMBLY KINGDOM HALLS</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah’s witnesses can accommodate themselves to all kinds of circumstances, and if the Kingdom Halls they have and use every week are not sufficiently large they can turn other places into Kingdom Halls for pure worship. This will be very practically illustrated this coming summer during June, July and August, at which time Jehovah’s witnesses will be using five baseball parks, eight auditoriums, four fairgrounds, two arenas and two race tracks—all of them being converted into huge Kingdom Halls for the 1954 district assemblies. Instead of hearing the crack of the bat and seeing home runs, the whirling of wheels, the clapping of flying hoofs, the hum of roller skates, flying fists, grunts and groans of wrestling gladiators, you will hear the singing of songs and voices expressing praise to the great Creator. This will mean quite a transformation, but Jehovah’s witnesses can do it, and be content and <span id="page320" class="pageNum" data-no="320" data-before-text="320"></span>rejoice in the assembling of themselves together as Jehovah has directed they should. You can join in with Christians coming from all parts of the United States and Canada blessing Jehovah every day. Have you planned by now to be at one of these twenty-one conventions on the North American continent? Do you know which one you are going to attend? Surely you will go to one of them and take with you your family, your people of good will, and help all in your congregation to get there. Remember the program will be the same at every one of the assemblies from coast to coast. The only exception is Toronto, Canada, where one more day is added so that the 23rd class of Gilead can be graduated there. Why not use your vacation for attending this year’s district assembly?</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>SERVE WITHOUT LOITERING OR COMPLAINING</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Loitering and complaining are associate evils. Loiterers complain because they do not keep their minds occupied with worth-while things. A complaining frame of mind is not compatible with joyful service. God’s people do not find time to loiter or complain, for they see the new world taking shape, a world of God’s making that will bring into existence the greatest of blessings and joys. They do not loiter a moment in telling other persons about it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:11-45:12:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 12:11</a>, <em>NW</em>) You also may have a part in this joyful activity during June by presenting to people the Bible-study-aid book <em>“New Heavens and a New Earth” </em>and the booklet <em>After Armageddon—God’s New World, </em>on a contribution of 50 cents. If you are not active with a congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses, inquire at the nearest Kingdom Hall for further information, or write to the Society.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>STAY IN GOOD HEALTH</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">How long do you go without partaking of food? Most persons enjoy eating three or more times a day: in the morning, at noon, in the evening, and sometimes in between. Having in mind Jesus’ words that ‘man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God,’ the following question is worthy of serious consideration: “In addition to eating physical food, do I regularly partake of spiritual food in harmony with Jesus’ statement?” To stay in good spiritual health study of God’s Word is necessary. A wholesome and enjoyable aid to Bible study in the morning, at noon, in the evening and in between is this magazine, <em>The Watchtower. </em>It is published the 1st and 15th of every month. The subscription rate is still only $1 a year. You are invited to stay in good health and benefit from each issue by subscribing now.</p>

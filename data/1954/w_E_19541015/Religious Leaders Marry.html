<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Do you believe that your religious leaders should be forbidden to marry? Many people are of that opinion today, yet the apostle Paul showed that such was not the proper view. He wrote at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:1-54:4:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:1-3</a> (<em>NW</em>): “The inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired utterances and teachings of demons, by the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, marked in their conscience as with a branding iron, forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who have faith and accurately know the truth.”</p>

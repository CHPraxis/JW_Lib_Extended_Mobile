No 100-Yard Dash!
● The thought of a prize fighter reminds you of at least a half-hour fight. Mention a marathon race, and you think of men running for many miles. But the Christian’s race is longer and his fight is harder than either of these. He is therefore admonished at Hebrews 12:1 to “put off every weight” and to “run with endurance” the race set before him. Paul set the example, as recorded in 1 Corinthians 9:26, 27: “The way I am running is not uncertainly; the way I am directing my blows is so as not to be striking the air; but I browbeat my body and lead it as a slave.” Why hold so firmly to the Christian course? Because, as Jesus said at Matthew 10:22, it is the one that has endured to the end that will be saved. How are you running?

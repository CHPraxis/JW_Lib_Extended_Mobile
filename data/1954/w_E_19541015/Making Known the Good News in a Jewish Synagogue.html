<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">An experience by one of the staff of workers at the Watch Tower Society headquarters</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHILE serving the Pittsfield (Massachusetts) congregation this year, the assistant congregation servant, his wife and I were invited to attend a Jewish synagogue for the purpose of answering questions about Jehovah’s witnesses in one of their classes that is studying different religions.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We arrived promptly at ten o’clock at the synagogue, a newly constructed building of modern design which happens to be within three blocks of the Kingdom Hall and on the same street. We were warmly received by the instructor of the class, who in turn introduced us to the rabbi in charge of the synagogue. The pleasant reception made us feel at home at once. After exchanging a few words we were ushered into the classroom where the discussion was to be held. The room was large in size. To one side of the room was a library of selected books and Bibles. In the center of the room was a rectangular-shaped table with the July 28, 1953, issue of <em>Look </em>magazine on it. We took our seats at the far end of the table. Since the students were not yet present, the instructor took a few minutes to tell us what they were doing in his class. He said that on the previous week they talked about Jehovah’s witnesses, using what <em>Look </em>magazine had to say about them as the basis for their discussion. Since there were many questions that came up that no one present could answer authoritatively, they thought it best to invite one of Jehovah’s witnesses down to the synagogue and in this way get their questions answered directly.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">About this time in came the class. A lively, energetic and intelligent group of youngsters, whose ages were anywhere from fifteen to nineteen years. After they all got seated around the table there were some seventeen of them—the instructor briefly made known our purpose there and turned the remaining time over to us. In his words: “The class is all yours.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">We told the class that we understood that they had many questions and that we would do our best to try to answer them. No one seemed to want to be the first to start. The class instructor quickly spoke up and said: “Perhaps you [speaking to us] might have a question that you would like to ask us.” The class thought that would be a good idea to get things rolling. We said that we did have a question and that we have tried to find the answer to it for some time but were not entirely successful. They were anxious to know the question. So we asked: “Could you tell us the origin of the ‘star of David’ or the ‘shield of David’?” The class quickly exchanged glances at one another questioningly. It was quite obvious that none of them knew the answer.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The instructor spoke up and said: “You didn’t expect to get the answer to that question here, did you?” We answered: “What more appropriate place could we go to than a Jewish synagogue for our answer, especially since the synagogue uses the symbol?” The instructor collected his <span id="page618" class="pageNum" data-no="618" data-before-text="618"></span>thoughts and said that he did not know exactly what its origin was, but that he thought it originated with mythology and he wondered if we in our search found the same thing. We said that we did. But we found it hard to understand why the Jews would accept this pagan symbol, especially since they were strictly forbidden by Jehovah to have anything to do with pagan practices and their symbols. To this the instructor replied that he did not think that David was acquainted with the “star of David.” We agreed with him. We did not think so either. In fact, we were quite positive that David had nothing to do with it or knew anything about the symbol.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">After this brief exchange the class seemed to have retreated into even greater silence. So we thought of a way of putting them at ease. We would tell them about Jehovah’s witnesses, what they believe, who they are and what they preach, etc., after which they no doubt would have questions. They nodded and smiled approvingly.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">We began our impromptu speech by showing them that Jehovah’s witnesses are people from all walks of life, that what they teach and believe is very much like what the prophets of old taught and believed. The prophets of old believed that Jehovah was the one and only true God; so do Jehovah’s witnesses. As the prophets of Jehovah believed Jehovah to be the great Purposer with a purpose for his people, so do Jehovah’s witnesses. As the Jewish prophets believed and proclaimed a new heavens and a new earth as God’s purpose, so do Jehovah’s witnesses believe and proclaim. Quoting almost exclusively from the Hebrew Scriptures, we showed the class that it is Jehovah’s purpose to make this earth of ours a glorious footstool for Jehovah’s feet. Jehovah stating this to be his purpose, his word would not return to him void.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:46:11-23:46:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 46:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:9-23:55:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 55:9-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:13-23:60:13" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 60:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:17-23:65:17" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> 65:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:66:1-23:66:1" data-bid="1-5" class="b"> 66:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The purpose of Jehovah was traced from the garden of Eden to our day, showing the reason for sin, sickness, sorrow and death. The entire group appeared to be hanging on to every word, including the instructor. It was pointed out that the glorious earth that Jehovah promised and that the prophets wrote about is due to arrive in our day, and the only ones proclaiming this good news to mankind are Jehovah’s witnesses. People today, they were told, are actually choosing life or death by their attitude toward the Kingdom message; that this is a message of hope, a happy message, a message of life to all who would hear; that this message means everything to the young about to face life, because it gives them logical reasons for conditions in the world and it offers to them the brightest possible hope that mankind could possibly conceive—the hope of living forever under a perfect government, in perfect conditions, in everlasting peace, prosperity and happiness. This was the hope for those gathered there. It was available to them if only they would choose it.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">After this thirty-five-minute discussion on the purposes of Jehovah the meeting was reopened to questions. This time there were many hands that sprung up from all sides. The first question was: “How can we prove that Christ came and began his rule in the year 1914?” To follow in quick succession were such as these: Why do Jehovah’s witnesses object to saluting the flag? What do they have against blood transfusion? Do Jehovah’s witnesses baptize? How? How old does one have to be before he can be baptized? Before he can become one of Jehovah’s witnesses? How does the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses operate? How was it possible for them to conduct a huge international assembly <span id="page619" class="pageNum" data-no="619" data-before-text="619"></span>like the one at Yankee Stadium July 19-26, 1953? Do Jehovah’s witnesses believe in a trinity? A purgatory? What do they believe about heaven, hell and resurrection? Do they celebrate Christmas? Birthdays?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">At first the students would raise their hands and wait to be called on to speak, but the discussion became so lively that they felt free to speak without hesitation. Their comments, expressions and enthusiasm were something simply wonderful to behold. They asked intelligent questions and not once throughout the entire session did they show any signs of antagonism or prejudice. Their eagerness to participate in the discussion was something commendable and outstanding. And the answers that were given to their questions they accepted without any display of resentment or dissatisfaction.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">They wanted to know if Jehovah’s witnesses wear anything to distinguish them from the rest of the world. They were told that the zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses for truth, for their religion, their eagerness to praise Jehovah and make known his name, distinguishes them from the rest of the world. They wanted to know whether we use images, how the draft boards treat Jehovah’s witnesses, if we celebrate the Passover and what we thought of the sabbath.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Every now and then a comment would bring a wave of surprise from the class. For example: They were amazed that we celebrated Memorial on Nisan 14 and how we keep the date. Most of them were swept with amazement when they learned that we do not celebrate Christmas, do not believe in a trinity and that we do not believe in a hell-fire. They wanted to know why there were only a 144,000 chosen to be joint heirs with Christ in the heavens, if this did not prove God to be partial. Another would ask if in the resurrection man will have conveniences such as we have today, radio, television, etc. From across the table would come another question: “Do Jehovah’s witnesses think that they are the only ones of all religions that are right?” How do we explain the virgin birth mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:7:14-23:7:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 7:14</a>? Many, many more questions were asked.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The discussion was to last only an hour to my understanding, but after the first hour the questions were still coming in heavily. After an hour and a half and two hours, the class still showed no signs of slowing up or wanting to discontinue the discussion. Hands kept popping up from all sides of the table. It is doubtful if there were any present that did not ask more than one question. Most of them asked five or six. Their eyes sparkled. They appeared to be thoroughly enjoying this experience with us. After almost two and a half hours the session was brought to a close. A tract, “Who Are Jehovah’s Witnesses?” was passed around. The group expressed how much they enjoyed our being there. Some of the girls gathered around the sister and asked her further questions. We literally had to pull ourselves away. Waving good-by we left the synagogue.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">As we walked up the street we could not help but feel exhilarated. We had such a wonderful time. We thought, too, that this experience should teach us to be “always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:15</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sd">There is neither Jew nor Greek, . . . if you belong to Christ, you are really Abraham’s seed, heirs with reference to a promise.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:28-48:3:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gal. 3:28, 29</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

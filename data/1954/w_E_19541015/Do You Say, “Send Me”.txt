Do You Say, “Send Me”?
● What is your attitude toward the preaching activity of Jehovah’s witnesses? Do you enjoy The Watchtower and like the message and still draw back from telling others? Do you admire those who do the work, perhaps who brought the message to you, and yet hesitate to participate in it yourself? Or is yours the right and zealous course that Isaiah took when he willingly said: “Here am I; send me”?—Isa. 6:8.

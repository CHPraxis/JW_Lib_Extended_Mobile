TAUGHT BY JEHOVAH
Amidst the great confusion that exists between nations and peoples of this war-torn, unhappy world, the great God of the universe is teaching men of good will: “Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.” (Ps. 146:3) No lasting peace will come through the efforts of men. The kingdom of God alone is the hope of the world. To understand its blessings and what it will do for lovers of righteousness requires one to be taught by Jehovah, for he is the Provider of the Kingdom by and through his Son Christ Jesus. (John 6:45, NW; Isa. 54:13, AS) These two Scripture texts are cited on the inside cover of each issue of The Watchtower, for the purpose of this journal is to announce Jehovah’s kingdom. During March Jehovah’s witnesses will offer a year’s subscription for The Watchtower to all persons they meet. Three booklets will be given free with each new year’s subscription at the regular rate of $1.
NEW WORLD TRANSLATION OF THE HEBREW AND GREEK SCRIPTURES
These excellent volumes have proved a source of real enjoyment and satisfaction for Bible readers. They present in understandable, present-day speech the words of the holy Bible. Gone are the outmoded and obscure terms of Shakespearean English. In their place are clearly understood words used in speaking today. Copious references and footnotes facilitate your study, while an absorbing foreword and informative appendix add further value to each of these volumes. In the New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, Volume I, are the Bible books Genesis to Ruth. The New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures contains Matthew to Revelation. Each volume is only $1.50, the two for $3.00. Send for your copy of either or both volumes and increase your Bible reading pleasure.

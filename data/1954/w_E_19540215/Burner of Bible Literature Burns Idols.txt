Burner of Bible Literature Burns Idols
● A few years ago a policeman in the Quebec village of Bourlamaque was sent by the priest to gather some literature that had been left at certain homes by Jehovah’s witnesses. Some of the literature he brought to the priest but some of it he kept to examine for himself. When his wife saw the literature she threw it in the stove. The policeman kept getting more literature from those who had shown interest, and his wife, a very devout Catholic, continued to burn it. This went on for about two years. Then one day his wife found one of the Society’s magazines in her husband’s coat pocket. She read it and then burned it so that her husband would not know that she was beginning to take an interest after having been such an ardent Catholic. The next time one of the witnesses came to the door she invited him in. Previously she had thrown them out, literally. This time she obtained a copy of The Watchtower. Her husband, the policeman, discovered her reading it and so they read the magazine together. Shortly thereafter the husband quit his job as a policeman and took a “more honorable job,” as he put it. They have since subscribed for both The Watchtower and Awake! and procured all other available literature. A Bible study has been started in their home and they have removed all their religious statues and other paraphernalia and burned them. They are very thankful to Jehovah for the truth and have already shown their appreciation to the extent of sharing in the field service, making it known to others. They being very well known and much respected, their taking their stand for the truth has resulted in giving a good witness.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Amidst the great confusion that exists between nations and peoples of this war-torn, unhappy world, the great God of the universe is teaching men of good will: “Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:3-19:146:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 146:3</a>) No lasting peace will come through the efforts of men. The kingdom of God alone is the hope of the world. To understand its blessings and what it will do for lovers of righteousness requires one to be taught by Jehovah, for he is the Provider of the Kingdom by and through his Son Christ Jesus.

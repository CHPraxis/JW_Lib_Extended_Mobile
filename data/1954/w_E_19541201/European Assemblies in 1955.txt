European Assemblies in 1955
At the conclusion of the international assembly of Jehovahâ€™s witnesses in Yankee Stadium in New York city in 1953 announcement was made of a series of international assemblies to be held in Canada and the United States and Europe during 1955. Already many thousands outside Europe have indicated their intention of attending one or more of the European assemblies. Not only from the United States but from South America and Africa and other continents delegates will come, to make these assemblies truly international.
The locations and dates of the assemblies are as follows: London, England, July 27-31; Paris, France, August 3-7; Rome, Italy, August 5-7; Nuremberg, Germany, August 10-14; Stockholm, Sweden, August 17-21; and The Hague, Netherlands, August 17-21. Many of the delegates from other lands will attend, not just one, but two or three of these assemblies, and some will even cover the entire series by spending some time at each of the assemblies.
At Yankee Stadium representatives from 97 countries attended and on the last day their numbers rocketed to more than 165,000! It was a tremendous witness not only to New York but to the nation and the world. It was a spectacle that is still remembered and commented on. Why not make the coming European assemblies equally noteworthy for their international flavor, showing the New World society knows no national barriers? Jehovah will surely bless those making the effort to attend. Will you be among the tens of thousands present?

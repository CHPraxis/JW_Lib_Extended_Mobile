Observe the Sabbath?
● Do you think a Christian must keep the sabbath? Many people do, but did you know that the Bible does not agree? Not only does Galatians 4:9, 10 (NW) say of those who are “scrupulously observing days and months and seasons and years,” “you are turning back again to the weak and inadequate elementary things,” but Colossians 2:16 (NW) says: “Let no man judge you in eating and drinking or in respect of a feast day or of an observance of the new moon or of a sabbath.”

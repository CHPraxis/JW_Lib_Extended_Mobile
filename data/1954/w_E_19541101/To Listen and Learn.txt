To Listen and Learn?
● One small-town newspaper recently told of children going to church with comic books. The paper said it was sure that the preacher did not mind the children’s doing this, but it jokingly accused a mother of reading the comic book too. Her reply: she was listening to the sermon, but the child wanted an explanation of every picture. Do you approve of your child looking at pictures, or perhaps taking a paper and pencil and drawing during congregational studies? Or does the child go for the entirely different reason that God instructed the Israelites to take their children? “Call the people together, the men and the women and the little ones and your temporary resident who is within your gates, in order that they may listen and in order that they may learn, as they must fear Jehovah your God and take care to carry out all the words of this law.” (Deut. 31:12, NW) For which reason do your children go?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Do you think a Christian must keep the sabbath? Many people do, but did you know that the Bible does not agree? Not only does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:9-48:4:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Galatians 4:9, 10</a> (<em>NW</em>) say of those who are “scrupulously observing days and months and seasons and years,” “you are turning back again to the weak and inadequate elementary things,” but <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:16-51:2:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 2:16</a> (<em>NW</em>) says: “Let no man judge you in eating and drinking or in respect of a feast day or of an observance of the new moon or of a sabbath.”</p>

Where Do You Seek Security?
● Commercialism is the thing today; a “what does it get you?” attitude permeates almost all activities. Money and wealth are worshiped as those that will bring security, and the desire for “security” often overrides all else, including one’s love for God, for his family, and even of his own sense of decency and uprightness. Yet this “security” is shaky. Many factors could rob you of it: inflation, crime, war. Is there nothing better, more firm? Faithful men of old such as Abraham, Job and Moses thought there was. So did Jesus and his apostles. Money, or the lack of it, was not the prime consideration with them—they put God’s service and his blessings first. These were treasures stored in heaven, “where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves do not break in and steal.” (Matt. 6:20, NW) This is real security—blessings from the Almighty God; blessings that are firm, unwavering and sure. They alone have real value. No one can take them from you. They lead not only to contentment now, but to everlasting life. Accept this real wealth. Make Jehovah, not money, your God.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Though it might sound almost too good to be true, the Bible assuredly points to the near-at-hand end of all wickedness, sorrow, tribulation and distress. When? Plainly <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:1-40:24:51" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew chapter 24</a> relates that it will be within “this generation.” The remaining days that the desirable, honest-hearted persons from all nations can come in are numbered! No wonder, then, God is now having the Kingdom message proclaimed loud and clear in all nations. Through it he is drawing out of all nations persons who love truth and righteousness. Having been blessed with an understanding of God’s purposes, all of Jehovah’s witnesses during November will make wise use of the remaining time by telling as many others as possible of what the Bible says will soon take place. From house to house and at all opportunities there will be presented as an aid to people who hunger for truth and righteousness three books and three booklets on a contribution of $1.50, or the <em>New World Translation </em>of either the Hebrew or Greek Scriptures together with one book on a contribution of $2.</p>

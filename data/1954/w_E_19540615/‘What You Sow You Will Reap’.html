<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN THE December 7, 1953, Des Moines, Iowa, <em>Tribune </em>appeared the results of a survey made among clergymen regarding what was their biggest problem. Among the answers were: “Spiritual drowsiness of the congregation.” “Indifference.” “Apathy toward church work.” “Lukewarm Christianity which leads to all kinds of problems.” “Getting church folk to do personal evangelization work. So many are timid, afraid.” “The larger the church, the less zeal and activity usually is shown.” And so on.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">And under the heading, “Churches Held Failing to Fulfill Purposes,” <em>The Daily Times Herald, </em>Dallas, Texas, February 3, 1954, reported on the remarks made by Boston University president, Harold C. Case, at the Southern Methodist University’s 19th annual Ministers’ Week. Mr. Case warned clergymen against becoming so absorbed in the development of their church as an institution that they overlooked its real purpose. “Budgets may receive more attention than the Bible and competition for ‘a place in the sun’ may be more captivating than co-operation or fulfilling the condition of the Kingdom of God on earth.” He further observed that “people expect [the clergymen] to be religious and to pose and use great words without rigorous self-examination. Ministers, in some cases, are losing sight of their objective by overinterest in their salaries, positions and advancements.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Can it be that there is a cause and effect relationship between the clergy’s being engrossed in such matters as salaries, position and advancement and their parishioners’ apathy, drowsiness, indifference and lukewarmness? Can it be that in stressing their budgets more than their Bibles the very clergy who complain about their parishioners’ condition are merely seeing in their congregation a reflection of themselves, are merely reaping what they have sown?—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gal. 6:7</a>.</p>

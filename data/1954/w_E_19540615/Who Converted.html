<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Franciscan priest Berard Haile, who has spent 53 years working with the Navaho Indians in the southwestern United States, has, according to <em>Time, </em>March 15, learned bit by bit from their medicine men “what no white man had known before him: the whole of the ‘Blessing Way’—a sacred, secret collection of ceremonies covering the whole religious life of the Navaho people.” He has written this carefully searched-out information in a 1,203-page manuscript, which he hopes to have published. When the Navahos gave their approval and support, he said: “I am one of you.” But one of the tribal councilors put it another way: “You came to make Christians out of the Navahos, but the Navahos have made a Navaho out of you.”</p>

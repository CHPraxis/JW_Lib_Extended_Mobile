<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In Istanbul, Turkey, as a result of the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses, a young Jew accepted Christ as the Messiah and was baptized in public expression of having dedicated himself to do Jehovah’s will and to follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. At his place of work he succeeded in interesting a Moslem Turk in the truth about Jehovah and, as a result, this Turk also took his stand, accepted Christianity and was baptized. A young Greek, a member of the Greek Orthodox Church, was a spectator and an interested listener to the discussions between the Christian Jew and the Moslem Turk. One day this Greek was contacted by another witness for Jehovah to whom he expressed great interest. Why? Because it appeared to him as a modern miracle that a Jew should be able to convert a Moslem to Christianity! This young Greek is now himself studying with Jehovah’s witnesses and is learning more about the wonderful news of God’s kingdom, which is so powerful that it can accomplish amazing things.</p>

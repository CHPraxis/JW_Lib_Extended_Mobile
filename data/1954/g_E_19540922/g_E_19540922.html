<p><span class="font28" style="font-weight:bold;">Starvation or Salvation—Which?</span></p>
<p><span class="font31">R</span><span class="font20">IGHT now the world is concerned with starvation. Authorities predict the world’s population will rise from two and a half billion to four billion in thirty years and in a hundred years the population will skyrocket to seven billion. To feed these growing billions under present standards will call for a miracle. With the present modest population of only two and a half billion the New York </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram and Sun</span><span class="font20"> asserts that &quot;seventy per cent... go to bed hungry every night,” and the New York </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font20"> for May 2, 1954, reports “that over one-half of the world’s population is living on the edge of starvation and suffering from malnutrition diseases.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">All this starvation without a food shortage is difficult to believe, but it is true. The executive director of the relief organization CARE revealed that the Commodity Credit Corporation alone has some $6 billions’ worth of surplus foods and fibers that are feeding and clothing no one, piled in idle ships and storage. Not only would the release of these items ease hunger pangs but would help to save American taxpayers almost $168 million a year which they now pay in storage charges alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“The gloomy, basic prediction of the report,” says Kathleen McLaughlin, referring to a report compiled by United Nations’ experts who examined the possibilities of production to sustain an increased population, &quot;is that ‘ignorance, greed, strife, superstition and blind adherence to tradition’ will prevent men from accomplishing works that are in their power, ‘even though the alternatives may be misery and starvation.’ ” Showing how superstition contributes to malnutrition and disease, Science </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Digest</span><span class="font20"> for June, 1954, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“The reason that the people of the world are badly nourished is due to ignorance about diet as well as to the lack of needed foods, says Dr. Cicely D. Williams in the British medical journal, The Lancet. For instance, although meat and milk are widely available in East Africa, women do not get them. ‘The women are told that if they eat eggs they will become sterile, if they eat fowls they will crow, if they eat goat they will grow beards.’... In India things are even more difficult. Eating even an egg is looked on as a kind of murder. On the African Gold Coast, there is a prejudice against condensed milk, although the inhabitants suffer from a lack of proteins and it is well known that milk, fresh or condensed milk—out of cans—is considered a luxury. It is believed inelegant to drink the nutritious local buffalo milk.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">While the world worries itself over its food famine, it has completely lost sight of a greater and by far more devastating famine in its midst—a spiritual famine. Not just a half or seventy per cent of its people are thus starved, but in the words of John: “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (1 John 5:19,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font16"> If the political administrators have proved themselves poor managers, then the clergy have shown themselves to be twice as slothful and selfish in the handling of spiritual food. They have a never-ending supply of spiritual food at their disposal in God’s Word the Bible if they would use it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But the clergy have &quot;rejected the word of Jehovah; and what manner of wisdom is in them?” Instead of dining on the &quot;wheat,” solid truths of the Bible, Christendom’s religious leaders have preferred the “husks,” the synthetic diet of philosophy, political economy, psychology, sociology, tradition and mere ethics, and have forced its members to eat this diet until the souls of its parishioners are starved for they know not what.—Jeremiah 8:9, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Almighty God foretold the coming of this famine through his prophet Amos, saying; &quot;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord Jehovah, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of Jehovah.” The lack of material food may cost one this life, but the lack of hearing the words of Jehovah is far more serious. It will cost one his' everlasting existence. That is why Jesus said: “Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.” These utterances are food for the mind and heart that persons must have to gain Jehovah’s approval and life. Without them a person is the samp as starved. Such is this world, and it will die the death at Armageddon.—Amos 8:11, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan.</span><span class="font16"> Ter.; Matthew 4:4, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Therefore, “work, not for the food that perishes, but for the food that remains for life everlasting, which the Son of man will give you, for upon this one the Father, even God, has put his seal of approval.”—John 6:27, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19540922_files/g_E_19540922-4.png" alt="" style="width:409pt;height:107pt;">
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Why are hit mcceiiei so limited? What hope do the Scriptures give in thia materialistic age? How will the auro hope mean a new world? What doe* it all mean to you? and how can you benefit from thia knowledge?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font29">T</span><span class="font16">ODAY’S world is in the dark. It thinks it knows where it has</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">been, is not sure of where it is, and is afraid of where it may be going. It has no firm hope toward which to direct its course, no beacon light to mark its path, no clear destiny in view. The United Nations has not brought peace, wars have not remedied matters, delinquency increases, fear grows. Just as Jesus long ago foretold: &quot;Men become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth.” (Luke 21:26)* Indeed, this earth certainly needs godly new conditions!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Without a sure hope man despairs. He</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">* In this article texts from the Greek Scriptures (“New Testament”} are quoted from the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font13"> and, unless otherwise noted, those from the Hebrew Scriptures ( ’Old Testament''} are quoted from the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">American BtandaTd</span><span class="font13"> Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">has no specific aim, no one purpose toward which he can direct his life. Under norma] conditions this is bad enough; in times of crisis it may prove disastrous. But a desirable hope must be a sure one, because a false hope that collapses under strain may be worse than none at all. So, man needs not only a definite hope, but a reliable one, worthy of trust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Where is such a hope to be found? Surely the Creator of the universe did not make man a miserable failure to despair; yet man’s basic schemes today continue to fail. Human efforts for a desirable world, for peace and righteousness, continue to prove little more than the dreams of waking men!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Futility of Human Efforts</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Some people put their trust in politics, thinking that this alone is practical; yet as </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Pageant</span><span class="font20"> magazine said in discussing future world prospects: “Genuine, wholehearted [political] agreements that can be trusted do not appear on our horizon at all.” We must agree with world analysts who take that view, because the mere prospect of development of international political agreements, so hard to make and so frequently broken, does not really provide a firm basis for confident trust. Those who really rely on such agreements to bring man’s desires are trusting in a dream that is still tar short of realization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Other people pay little attention to politics. What they want is money. It is their trust for the future. Yet money is based on politics, and if politics fails your money collapses. Indeed, it may do so anyway! For example, if you live in the United States and are just now inheriting savings that your grandfather put away in 1900, you find that what he put aside for a shirt buys only the collar, for shoes buys only the heels and laces, for a chicken buys only the drumstick. Even more recently, every $1,000 that you confidently put away in 1939 was by last year worth only $533. And at that the United States’ dollar is one of the world’s sounder currencies. Thus, money is not a firm hope, and those who consider it a real security also prove to be dreamers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Still other people turn to religion to see if it provides the sure hope. True religion should &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sibh hwpfc, Vwrt. many wYiu</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">have turned to today's denominations have come up with the conclusion that was expressed by Boston University Professor Harold A, Ehrensperger at a Methodist Student Movement meeting in Lawrence, Kansas, last January 2. He said religion has become “a name, an institution, not an experience in life. What we lack are prophets—there are no prophets any more.” Another problem regarding religion concerns which religion’s hope is sure, which is right? You say it does not matter which of the several hundred kinds of religion you accept? Then you are living in your own hope that this theory is correct, not in a flrm trust in that religion. And even worse, God’s Word disagrees with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Others have turned materialistic, turning to science as a savior. But that indeed seems foolish in this year of the H-bomb. It is science’s developments that have made modem war possible, have struck the world with, fear and have uuderstcxed the need for a sure hope. No matter who uses these weapons, the science that has made them certainly provides no sure hope for man today!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Why, then, have all of man’s efforts to find a firm foundation for trust failed? Why have his high hopes proved to be merely the dreams of waking men? Because the task is bigger than weak, imperfect men are. Today’s world is under the control of wicked spirit creatures who are far more powerful than any human forces. Many people scoff at this, but that scoffing</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">is to their hurt, for the existence of such spirit creatures is certainly not a myth. It is an absolute fact!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Note that the Bible tells us that &quot;the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one,” and that it further says that &quot;the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers&quot; Who is this &quot;god of this system of things”? Certainly not Christ, for he said: &quot;My kingdom is no part of this world.&quot; Then who is this world's god? He is the one who, because he was in possession of these kingdoms, had the audacity to offer Jesus “all the kingdoms of the world,&quot; namely, Satan himself! (1 John 5:19; 2 Corinthians </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">4:4;</span><span class="font0"> John 18:36; Matthew 4:1-11) He is the one who is responsible for this world’s distressed conditions. Thus Revelation 12:12 predicted: “Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If these Scriptural facts seem amazing to you, then it would be well for you to get your Bible out and read them for yourself, for they are true, and are a key to understanding the world's present darkened condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A Dependable Guide</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These Bible promises are not just a dream, they are a reality. How do we know we can trust what that Book says? Because it is God's dependable Word. That Book’s historical accuracy has repeatedly been proved true, to the consternation of its critics. Its permanency is indisputable. “The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever.” Its basis of authority is unexcelled. Its writers did not write on their own authority, but they attributed it to God, as did David, who said: “The spirit of Jehovah spake by me, and his word was upon my tongue.&quot;—Isaiah 40:8; 2 Samuel 23:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Most conclusive, however, is the fact that the Bible reliably predicts the future. Hundreds of years in advance it foretold regarding Jesus that he would be bom of the tribe of Judah, bom in Bethlehem, bom of a virgin, would be hated, would be betrayed by a follower for thirty pieces of silver, would be convicted by false witnesses, would be impaled with sinners, even that lots would be cast for his garments, etc.—Genesis 49:10; Psalm 22:16, 18; 35:11; 41:9; 69:4; Isaiah 7:14; 53:12; Micah 5:2; Zechariah 11:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But we do not have to go back even as far as Jesus, just 1900 years ago, to appreciate the Bible’s miraculous power of prophecy. It predicted even the wars and distress this century has witnessed. In symbolic language it told of the failure of man’s attempt to establish a unified world peace organization, the League of Nations, and even told that that organization would go out of existence and then come to life again, as it did when the United Nations was bom. It even foretold the United Nations’ failure to bring peace. (Matthew 24:7; Revelation 17:8-14) Thus, such a tried and proved guide can be firmly trusted regarding its statements about man’s present condition and its promises of a new world/It provides, not the dreams of men, not a wobbling hope built on a sand foundation, but the sole firm, reliable and unshakable hope for today!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Real Hope</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What does this reliable Guide say about the real hope? about a new world? about righteous conditions to come to this earth? Why, that new system of things is the whole theme of the Bible! No one ever told you that before? If not, then it is time to get some new instructors! Note how this theme prevails. The Bible’s first chapter, Genesis chapter 1, tells of the earth’s preparation for man and of man’s creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The second chapter tells of Jehovah’s instructions to man, and the third chapter tells how the serpent representing Satan, who is still causing earth’s difficulties today, caused man’s fall, prompted him to disobey his Creator and to lose his right to perfect life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Right then and there, at Genesis 3:15, it was predicted that the serpent’s (Satan’s) head would be bruised, thus foretelling the destruction of this one who had caused rebellion and loss of life. Thus Satan’s old world or system of things would not go on forever, but would end, and this would allow for the establishment of a new system of things, or the re-establishment of conditions that had prevailed in Eden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah and other faithful men of old looked for such desirable conditions. Thus we read bf Abraham: “For he was awaiting the city having real foundations and the builder and creator of which is God.” (Hebrews 11:10) Isaiah prophesied of the King of the new world when he said: &quot;Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end.” (Isaiah 9:7) The Bible books of Matthew, Mark, tuke and John tell of that royal King Christ Jesus’ coming to earth, proving himself under the test and ransoming those who would benefit from the Kingdom’s blessings. Finally, Revelation 20 tells of Satan’s binding; then in Revelation 21, the next to the last chapter of the Bible, we read: “ 'And [God] will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more. The former things have passed away.’ And the one seated on the throne said: ‘Look! I am making all things new.’ ”—Verses 4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">This new world under God’s kingdom is not just heavenly, for we are told in the preceding two verses that these conditions are coming down to prevail among men on earth. Thus the conditions that were lost in Eden will actually be restored to this earth, and as Isaiah 32:16,17 says: &quot;Then justice shall dwell in the wilderness; and righteousness shall abide in the fruitful field. And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and confidence for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Satan and his wicked rulership are to be destroyed—of that fact there is no doubt. We read: &quot;For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be.” Again: “All the wicked will [God] destroy.” And then In contrast with the wicked rule, &quot;in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, . . . but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.’’-Psalm 37:10; 145:20; Daniel 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">So the fact that Jehovah will destroy these kingdoms of earth that Satan controls will not mean that the world will be without a ruiership. It does not mean anarchy, but rather it means a replacement of the present failing and wicked rulership of the earth, both visible and invisible, with a righteous rule under the supervision of the invisibly reigning King, Christ Jesus. The difference between that rule and the one earth now knows is well stated in the Proverbs: “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.” —Proverbs 29:2, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">King James Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Making This Hope Yours</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">This is not abstract, it is not just theoretical, nor is it a blessing reserved for the long-distant future. We are living in a special time in history. Bible prophecies and current events show that ours is the time for Satan’s destruction and this new world’s establishment. Just because it has not come in the past, some say: &quot;It couldn’t be in our day.” But they are blind to the turbulence of current events. The Jewish people</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">in Jesus’ day had been looking for the Messiah for centuries, but when he came they were blind to all the proofs that he was that Messiah. They had waited so long that they thought, “It couldn’t be now.” Do not make the same mistake. Do not close your mind to the seriousness of our time, nor become blinded to the fact that the very turbulence of our day is in fulfillment of the text cited above: “The Devil has come down to you, having great anger, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">knowing he has a short period of time.’<sup>3 </sup></span><span class="font16">(Revelation 12:12) He knows that time is short, but would like to blind all mankind to that vital fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Yet he has not done so. The great sign of the birth of Jehovah’s heavenly kingdom, and the promise in Matthew 24:34 that the generation on which this sign comes “will by no means pass away until all these things occur,” fire with zeal those who have not been blinded to this bright hope for today. A New World society is formed that points to these Scriptural facts, calls attention to their present fulfillment and is tireless in preaching it to the world. The scope of its work is tremendous. A half-million people are preaching this message in 150 lands. On the average 139 more persons each day, fifty thousand each year, join in this activity, conforming their lives to what God’s Word says, living even now as a New World society and abiding by its right principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Their faith is solid, their hope is sure. It is not a popular hope, but it is right. Accepting it is not like being converted to a new religion every time a revivalist hits town, but it means changing your entire way of life, conforming it to the honest principles of God’s Word. Such a viewpoint is ridiculed, it even brings persecution, but in this right kind of faith there is the greatest of strength. Remember; “Everything that has been born from God conquers the world. And this is the conquest that has conquered the world, our faith.”—1 John 5:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">How can you get such strength today? You must study God’s Word to know what he has promised, you must associate with God’s people to gain mutual help and strength, and you must trust in God’s power. “The everlasting God, Jehovah, . . . giveth power to the faint; and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength. . . . they that wait for Jehovah shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint.” —Isaiah 40:28, 29, 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Then you must cut loose from the old world’s habits, for its impurities are not invited into the new world. “What! Do you not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men, nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom. And yet that is what some of you were. But you have been washed clean.”—1 Corinthians 6:9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">To a world conditioned to Satan’s rule the new world seems astounding, but it is not just a dream of men. Its hope is a foretaste of pure blessings. The new world being firmly backed by the supreme Creator of the universe and definitely promised in his inspired Word, the knowledge of it is realistic: it shows where the old world has been, the danger of where it is, and the necessity of changing your course from the way it is going. This knowledge provides a firm hope toward which to direct your course. It is like a bright beacon light to mark your way, bringing into sharp view the marvelous destiny of everlasting life on a perfect earth. A firm confidence in these godly new conditions of life in the new world is the only sure hope today!</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">Well, we do not have to go to the elephant, who has a good sense of hear-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">electronic ears to hear the sound for him* One of man’s hearing achievements is sonar. This term applies to all types of underwater sound devices that operate on the basis of reflected sound waves. With a sonar device man can detect an enemy vessel by the sound of its engines. A new development in sound detection is a device for termite exterminators. The instrument consists of a tiny microphone with a “hip-pocket” power unit and earphones. With this device-the “termite detective” can hear the clicking noises made by the termites’ jaws and their footsteps as well. Still another man-made hearing device is one that makes a visual record of sounds higher in pitch than those man can hear. Marvelous this is. But do not praise man too highly, for all these things, including the detection of sounds pitched beyond the human limit, are not new. Nature had them first!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Do not think it strange that some animals can hear sounds that we cannot. We know that the bloodhound’s nose is more sensitive than ours and that the eagle’s eyes are more farsighted than ours. So it should be no big surprise</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font20">to know that some animals have, in several respects,</span></p><img src="g_E_19540922_files/g_E_19540922-6.png" alt="" style="width:646pt;height:150pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">Ing, or to the deer, whose sense of hearing is believed to be keener than man’s, but we can begin right at home with those favorite pets, the cat and the dog* Did you ever notice how these animals prick up their ears, turning them forward and backward? Often, when they do this, we cannot hear a thing, so we may imagine that the animal just had a “false alarm,” But, more probably, our pet has heard a sound that we could not hear. Incidentally, this ability to move the ear forward and backward has two big advanta?ges for Fido and Tabby: it enables them to make the most of the sound that comes to them, and it helps the animals decide where a sound comes from.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Range of Hearing</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">To gain a better understanding about some of the keenest ears that hear it is well to know the human limits of hearing. Man can hear sounds pitched from fifteen to about 18,000 cycles per second. That is a wide range! But what can the dog do? Why, the dog’s range is from thirty two all the way to 35,000 eye second. Since sound waves having a frequency too high for detection by the human ear are called &quot;ultrasonic,” it becomes clear that the dog has a measure of ultrasonic hearing. No wonder a dog whistle has been made that is so high in pitch that it can be heard by dogs but not by us!</span></p>
<div>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">Now here is a surprise: rats have better ultrasonic hearing than dogs. They can hear sounds pitched up to 40,000 cycles per second. Ah now, what about that foe of the rat, Miss Pussy Cat? She even excels the rat in ultrasonic hearing, for she can detect sounds pitched up to 50,000 cycles per second! So dogs, rats and cats are all at their best listening to sounds pitched higher than those we enjoy. Really, then, when it comes to ultrasonic hearing, nature had it first*</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">No list of the keenest ears that hear would be complete without mentioning that clever character, the fox* Well known is his reputation for escaping enemies the clever way* Now we can take a peek into the fox’s “bag of tricks” by learning something about his hearing ability. His ears are so wonderfully keen that he depends upon them much more than upon his eyesight in avoiding his enemies. When the fox first hears hounds baying in the distance he pricks up his ears. He listens anxiously. In a few moments the fox knows what course the hounds are following, whether they are on his trail or that of another fox; in the latter case he simply goes to sleep again or watches the course of the hunt at a safe distance. But if the hounds’ baying tells the fox’s ears that they are on his track, the fox stretches himself and starts off, planning all sorts of stratagems to throw them oft his scent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">When not hunted, the fox is an excellent hunter himself! Again using his ears more than his eyes, the fox tracks down rabbits, muskrats and mice. The fox frequently sits on his haunches dog-fashion in the middle of a meadow, listening for a mouse dinner. If a mouse in the neighborhood so much as lets out a tiny squeak, mouse-</span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">burger is certain to be on the fox's</span><span class="font20"> menu that day! How true this is can be realized from an experience related by one naturalist who wrote: “[The fox] was at least one hundred and fifty yards away and going from me, but the air was still and I squeaked like a meadow mouse, hoping that perhaps his big ears might catch the sound even at that distance, though the sharpest human ears could scarcely have heard so faint a noise at a tenth part of the distance. Yet the fox heard it and stopped instantly, and turning came leaping lightly over the hassocks in my direction*”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Sonar—Nature Had It First</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Sonar, and even the whole concept of ultrasonics, was unknown to man until, comparatively speaking, a few years ago. But that flying mammal, the bat, has been using the sonar principle long before this modem age. The bat emits cries that cannot </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">be heard by man, some of them pitched </span><span class="font20">as high as 90,000 cycles per second. These air-borne waves bounce back from obstacles ahead of the bat when it is in flight and are picked up by the supersensitive ears of the animal in the periods of silence between the bursts of sound. Thus the bat, operating on the principle of sonar, can invariably change its course in time to avoid a crash with any obstacle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In the field of detecting enemies by the sound they make, the kangaroo rat is outstanding. Although well known for his going through life with never touching a drop of liquid the kangaroo rat deserves to be better known for another reason: his sharp, two-way ears* Now this animal dwells in a maze of tunnels and cozy chambers. He finds it is a good idea to have several back doors to his underground apartment house so that if an enemy enters via the front door he can exit via a back door. Even if a snake, on the prowl for a tasty steak dinner, slithers its way ever so silently down one of his front hallways, the kangaroo rat is seldom caught off guard. How does he keep on the alert in such an amazing manner? By using his ears. This animal has specially keen ears, for he can hear not only through air but through the ground as well! His ears’ resonance chambers, which take up half of his skull space, enable him to detect enemies through the ground vibrations they make. So when a snake invades his home the kangaroo rat hears the warning sound and has time to slip out the back door.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Keen Ears in Birddom</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Man’s newly invented termite detector is an ingenious device. Yet long before man thought of it the robin has been locating his prey by a similar technique. Did you ever notice a robin on a lawn suddenly stop and cock his head? Wonder why? He is listening. To what? Why, to the soft stirring of an earthworm under the grass. In a moment, If you watch him closely, the robin will reach into a tiny hole and come out with a long worm. TYuly, the robin’s ears are his own built-in worm detector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">So birds have a remarkably sharp sense of hearing, as we might well infer from the vocal abilities exhibited by many of these gifted songsters. Recently, a group of professors analyzed bird songs with a device that “hears” notes much higher than the human limit and writes them down on its paper tape. Most bird songs, the professors discovered, are ultrasonic, that is, they are not intended for human ears. A few, such as the songs of whippoorwills and song sparrows, can be heard complete by man, but others contain many parts that are too high pitched. When heard by human ears the golden crowned kinglet’s song is believed to be a pale shadow of what ft sounds like to another golden crowned kinglet, which can appreciate all of its highest notes. The blue jay, the professors found, can sing what amounts to a major chord, holding a low note and a high note simultaneously; then after a hundredth of a second, he adds a middle note.—</span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Time, </span><span class="font20">July 20, 1953.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Among nocturnal birds the sense, of hearing is exquisitely developed. The owl has found that the satisfaction of its stomach depends, not only upon his eyes, but also upon his ears. Fully at ease at night is the barn owl. His ears are large and so sensitive that they detect the slightest stir. Do long-eared owls hear much better than short-eared owls? Strangely, they do not. For the short-eared owls, though their ear tufts are small, have ear openings much larger than those of the long-eared species. In fact, the ear openings are almost cavernous in their proportions. This owl needs keen ears. In the long grass the movements of much of its prey cannot be seen and must be heard. It does much of its hunting with its ears rather than its eyes..</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">So it has been interesting learning how birds and animals excel man when it comes to keen hearing. But this does not mean that the human ear is not among the keenest ears that hear. It definitely is. Why, at the lower end of the hearing range, man hears much better than canaries, cats or dogs. Just hit the bottom key of a piano and you will hear a sound that dogs apparently cannot hear. The truth is, then, that each creature has ears that fully satisfy his individual needs, ears that are the best for that creature’s well-being and happiness. Ail credit for ears, including the keenest ears that hear, goes not to any animal or man but to the Creator, “The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, Jehovah hath made even both of them.”—Proverbs 20: 12, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Trace </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Elements and Health</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">MONG the taunts made by certain agnostics is that if they were God they would have made health instead of disease contagious* They thereby betray their abysmal ignorance, for health and disease are not primarily matters of contagion but of cause and effect. To the extent that man intelligently cooperates with the vital forces in his body, to that extent he can expect to have health. ¥ That health is a matter of cause and effect is apparent from psychosomatic medicine* This fact is also brought home to us in another hew science, that of biogeochemistry, by which men have learned that so little as one part in a million of certain elements can mean the difference between health and disease. Thus Dr. Harry V. Warren, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Scientific Monthly,</span><span class="font0"> June, 1954, urges physicians, geologists, agronomists (soil specialists) and geographers to co-operate in ascertaining the biogeochemical possibilities for health*</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">* 8? Among other things he points out that fifteen main elements, such as oxygen, phosphorus, calcium and nitrogen, comprise ninety per cent of earth's crust* The remaining elements, because of the minute quantities in which they are found, are termed “trace&quot; elements* Today these can be measured in quantities as small as one part in ten million. Certain of these trace elements are found in a pure state in enzymes, and they play a vital role in all life processes, we are assured, from penicillium to human tissue* Growth of bacteria can be Influenced by the amount of certain trace elements present in the culture.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">* 8? Sheep require cobalt to live, although it need be present In their food only to the extent of one part in a million* Lack of iodine not only causes goiter in humans but renders the lower animals Incapable of bringing their young to birth*</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">Too little of certain trace elements makes land sterile. In New Zealand it took only two ounces of molybdenum per acre to make certain land fit for farming* A lack of it causes a viruslike disease in grapefruit. Molybdenum is an essential part of a catalyst present in all liver cells where it functions in nitrogen metabolism? Evergreens that were growing only to a height of three to four feet grew to a height of fifty merely by adding zinc and phosphorus. On </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font0"> other hand, too much of certain trace elements will produce cancer and other diseases in both the lower animals and man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">¥ According to Dr* Warren, among the reasons why supplying the necessary trace elements presents a problem are: complications due to man's scientific progress, such as the use of chemical fertilizers: modern irrigation in which the rich mineral-laden silt settles in artificial lakes and the land is irrigated with mineral-free water; growth of cities, where the waste is flushed into the rivers and the seas instead of its being returned to the ground; and the use of refined products such as white sugar and white bread. ¥ That the problem of supplying trace elements is both complex and real is apparent from the wide variations of trace elements found in various plants. Thus dried pine needles from one part of Canada contained only .1 part per million of molybdenum, whereas those from another section of Canada contained 50 parts per million or 500 times as much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">¥ &quot;Virtually all forms of life contain, respond to, and are affected by virtually all these trace elements, * * * including not only such elements as molybdenum and cobalt but also some such as cadmium, nickel, silver and gold, whose relation to nutrition has been little investigated.&quot; In times past men have stressed the need of phosphorus and lime, then the emphasis was placed on calories, then on vitamins and now, says Dr. Warren, the time has come to stress the vital role that trace elements play in health. Incidentally it might be stated that for some years a modern movement among agriculturists, known as “organic farming,” has been stressing this very thing, the need of the trace elements for health*</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">* 8? Thus we see that one of the latest recognized scientific activities, biogeochemical research, bears out that it is not so much a matter of whether health or disease is contagious, but a case of cause and effect, a matter of man’s intelligently co-operating with the vital processes in himself and in the lower animals* Truly the more man learns the more he appreciates how little he really knows and how vast, marvelous and intricate are the works of the Creator,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ELABORATE PREPARATIONS FOR DEATH</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">many re</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Egyptian</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">unlike Christendom’s ligions, the ancient</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">HE care for the dead has remained a striking and constant feature of Egyptian religion down through the centuries. From Egypt have</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font20">believed that the human body must be preserved, because the soul might desire to</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">come many theories about the state of the dead, the hereafter, burial customs, mummification, ritual, gods, sun worship, etc., so that the general consensus today is that the ancient Egyptian spent half of his life worshiping peculiar gods and the other half preparing for death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Death was the one phenomenon that did not explain itself to the Egyptian. Everywhere he saw things ever changing, but ever recurring. The sun set in the west but would rise bright in the east, after a brief spell of darkness. The Nile River would overflow its banks each year to renew the parched land. The Egyptian himself would go to sleep, but on the morrow he would rise again refreshed. Everything appeared explainable but death. Death could mean only one thing to the Egyptian: a change of life—a passing from this life into the next, which was something momentous and mysterious. Death was not the end, merely a change. The deceased would return again and again like the seasons, like the Nile’s overflow, like the rising sun, only to enjoy the next life even more. Luxuries and comforts that were denied him in the present life he would attain in the next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But how would the transfer from this life into the next be made? For convenience’ sake his religion taught that he was equipped with an immortal soul. However, return to it and therefore have need of it. In an effort to preserve the body the Egyptians became experts at embalming and mummifying the dead. But to take no chances they also placed within the tomb of each departed ruler or queen a carved likeness, usually on the lid of the inner coffin, which looked just as much like the deceased as it was possible for the most skillful worker to accomplish. On return if the soul found the body returned to dust it would enter the image and there abide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Egyptian kings spent a good portion of their lives preparing for death. They carefully designed their tombs and were concerned about making them comfortable dwelling places for their souls. Life’s necessities, comforts and luxuries were all carefully stored away for the enjoyment of the soul. Household objects, domestic utensils, the warrior’s arms, children’s toys, in addition to a large supply of good food, were all religiously tucked away for future use. Many of these ancient customs impressed themselves so deeply upon civilization that even to this day some have survived in all their ancient form both in religions of the East and in so-called Christian religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Among some of these surviving practices are the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, belief of the soul’s departure from the body after death and that it is rejoined with the body in a resurrection, the periodic visitations to the graves, the mourning, the feasting and various observances on these occasions, the prayers and invocations made for the dead or directly to the dead, the supplying of food for the departed, fear of evil spirits and appeasing them with special food offerings. These customs are </span><span class="font20" style="text-decoration:underline;">rill</span><span class="font20"> of pagan origin and have been adopted into religions of this so-called modern world. Cardinal Gibbons in his book </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Faith of Our Fathers</span><span class="font20"> openly admits that the Catholic Church accepted many pagan practices and customs into its religion. These it masquerades in the name of Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Rendezvous with the Sun</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The blazing Egyptian sun was hailed as the greatest of all gods. He was called Ra. Pharaohs dreamed of spending an eternity in the presence of Ra, following him through his day and night journey through the sky. Only Ra was worthy of Pharaoh’s worship, and only to Ra did he owe allegiance. All other gods were inferiors. At first, pharaohs alone worshiped him, but later this privilege was extended to some of their nobles and priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">On earth Pharaoh was worshiped as god, the bodily son and earthly representative of the sun-god Ra. He was the very incarnation of every local deity. Therefore every temple in Egypt belonged to him. He was shown as the equal of every god on earth, for he was himself that god in human form. So as not to offend or slight local gods by not worshiping them Pharaoh effected a compromise. He attached the name of Ra to the name of local gods, thus elevating them to high places of honor and worship. So in the new arrangement Amon became Amon-Ra, Sebek the crocodile was Sebek-Ra, and so on. The goddesses held their identification over a longer period of time, but they too were absorbed by the royal goddess lais.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">According to official legends the sun was the offspring of Nut, the sky-goddess, of whom he was bom every morning and in whose arms he died every night. Other gods also went through this same death and rebirth. In a sacred place located in “the east of the sky” were the doors to the next world. Before these doors stood tall sycamore trees on which the gods sat. Here Pharaoh found the sun-god after death and the two made their journey through the exciting world of darkness called Duat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Solar Ships for Souls</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Among the ancient Egyptians it was commonly believed that the sun passed over the earth in a boat, that it sailed along on the celestial Nile. The boat was called the “Boat-of-Millions-of-Years.” The day trip across the sky was uneventful, but the night journey was filled with adventure and danger, partly from the darkness and partly from the terrible serpent, Apophis, that lay in wait to destroy the sun-god Ra. To make this nocturnal journey with Ra was the future that the Pharaohs of Egypt hoped for. There are several versions of this nightly episode, but the main story remains the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">One version, which was inscribed on royal sarcophagi, has no Egyptian name, but is called by modern Egyptologists “The Book of Gates.” According to this version Duat is divided into twelve sections or countries, each section having its own name and being divided from the next by a gate that is guarded by a warden. Each section corresponds with the hours of the night. The boat of the sun is loaded with deities who are there to protect the sungod from all the dangers of the night, and is piloted through each section by the goddess of that hour, who alone knows the secret password for the gate at the far end of her domain. Without that password not even Ra would be allowed to pass through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Each night on this journey the monstrous, awe-inspiring serpent, Apophis, wages war with the sun-god. And each night the gods that accompany Ra in the boat leap out of the boat to battle with the mighty monster. Each night they bind him with chains and pierce him with knives. But each time night comes again he is loose, strong and well, waiting at the same place for a rematch with Ra and his protectors. As many times as Apophis is defeated, pierced and chained, yet he has never been destroyed. In fact, he cannot be destroyed, and just as tragic he cannot win. He merely gets the worst end of it. How long has this been going on? No one seems to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">At first pharaohs alone made the trip across the sky with Ra, and alone each night they battled the mighty serpent, Apophis, defeating it. This was a royal destiny, possible only to a Pharaoh. But in later years nobles and priests asserted the right to share it. At sunrise they were permitted to return to their old homes, where they could sit in the shade of their gardens and enjoy the cool breezes of the north winds. But at sunset they gathered together at Abydos, and entered the sunboat as it passed through the gap of Abydos into the regions of the night and thick darkness to war with Apophis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Another version says that the sun died at sunset, and only its corpse is passed into the realm of the night. </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Khepri,</span><span class="font20"> which means life or existence in the form of a scarab, awaits the coming of the dead sun, then the soul of </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Khepri</span><span class="font20"> and the soul of Ra are united. The soul of Ra is in this way revivified, and he passes on alive to the sunrise, his dead body being cast out of the boat before he rises on the land of Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Image of Ships Rise</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Ships like the ones built by Pharaoh Cheops, or Khufu, one of which was recently discovered by Kamal el-Malakh, near the Great Pyramid, were carefully constructed and completely furnished with all the necessities for the celestial voyage. Some were solely for soul transportation, while others were loaded with all the finery of life, such as precious jewels, clothing, kitchenware, statues of crew members and court favorites. There may be effigies of dancing girls to entertain the soul of Pharaoh. There may be a group of his friends for company. There may be a crew to sail the ship in procession behind the sun, represented in statuettes, of course, in addition to papyrus documents containing religious formulas, hymns to Ra and Osiris, and writings and charts regarding the king’s daily life and navigational science. Whatever was placed in, on or about the boat, it was believed by Cheops that the image of the same, the spirit image of the ship and all its crew and possessions would rise from its fixed position of its material form into the presence of Ra. In contrast with Cheops’ beautifully constructed boats the common people made theirs of clay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Following the invasion of Egypt by Alexander the Great in 332 B.C., solar boats slowly disappeared from the scene of Egyptian religion. Today, in the shadow of the Great Pyramid, the religious past of ancient Egypt is being uncovered and that which is brought to light reveals the past to have been an age of superstition and fear, once praised as the wisdom of Egypt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">■■</span><span class="font0">RE you thinking of having some whole-fl some fruit for the breakfast table? Then dish up the Inviting papaw! As a dessert or salad papaw also hits the spot* This is one fruit that has earned a secure place in the diet of a growing number of persons In various parts of the earth. It is reported to be healthful, and a few of its seeds are sometimes used as a laxative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The papaw </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Carica papaya)</span><span class="font0"> Is believed to be Indigenous to Central America, but today is found growing particularly well in all parts of the tropics and in many parts of the subtropics where high temperatures and rainfall promote a continuous growth* A familiar sight in the Pacific Islands is the papaw growing amidst tropical vegetation, and the weary traveler/ feeling both thirsty and hungry, can help himself to this delicious fruit* Lately, however, the natives, sensing its commercial value, now bring the papaw into the local markets-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">fjj The papaw tree itself reaches a height of fifteen to twenty feet and bears a crown of large light-green palmate leaves* A papaw plantation, a sight to behold, resembles a thick jungle area. Papaw trees have been known to have a life span of fifteen years and over, and during that period to yield upward of a hundred pounds of fruit yearly. -</span><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">*jj</span><span class="font0"> According to one authority there are three primary flower typea in the papaw tree, namely, pistillate, stamina and hermaphrodite. The pistillate flower is found on the female tree, and the stamina on the male tree. Now how do we tell the difference between the two trees? Well, the male tree with the stamina flovVers cannot produce fruit. However, not to be outdone is the male tree with the reduced hermaphrodite flower. These flowers are produced on profusely branched stalks which attain a length of three to five feet. At certain times these flowers may produce fruit, but, alas for the male, they are extremely variable In quality and have little market value. Now In existence is the hermaphrodite papaw tree with the elongate flower predominating throughout its life, and from this flower is produced a long narrow fruit popularly called the &quot;long torn?* (Queensland </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Agriculture Journal,</span><span class="font0"> <sub>h</sub>October 1951)</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The papaw is no exception to God’s law as recorded at Genesis 1:11, for fruit to produce because its seed is within itself; for one papaw alone can contain from flve hundred to a thousand seeds, and in tropical areas these will quite often germinate simply by hand broadcasting. In areas where the papaw tree has grown too tall for convenient harvesting, the farmer will cut it back to about three feet from the ground. This causes the papaw to rejuvenate itself, and it will send out numerous branches. Care is taken, however^ to cover the cut surface of the stem with a suitable covering to prevent cracking and subsequent decay</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">'s; </span><span class="font0">Great care is exercised in the harvesting of the fruit, for it bruises easily. The fruit is generally cut and not pulled from the tree to avoid damage at the basal end. Should the immature fruit be accidentally cut, a milky latex will exude from the rind and this will irritate the skin of the picker; hence the necessity, if handling the fruit for lengthy periods, to wear rubber gloves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Where the papaw is grown for commercial value we find it provides work tor tte fruiterer, the jam factory, and in the making of chutney. Now, and doubtless in the new world, the papaw will always be a delight to the palate of those who partake of this fruit provided by the loving Creator for the benefit of mankind*</span></p>

<p><span class="font31">H</span><span class="font20">OW many of you could put a finger on a map of the world and say: “This is Pakistan’’? Quite a number of you? Good! Now, to make it a little more difficult. How many of you could say: “This is East Pakistan’’? Probably not so many this time. East Pakistan is small in area but has a large population—approximately 42 million. East and West Pakistan are separated by over 1,000 miles of land belonging to India, West Pakistan being on the Arabian Sea and East Pakistan on the Bay of Bengal,</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Those persons who live in West Pakistan are mainly Urdu-speaking and wish to have Urdu as the state Language of Pakistan. Those in the East speak Bengali and, naturally, would like Bengali to be one of the state languages. There has been a great deal of controversy over this matter and some in the West vehemently oppose the adoption of two official languages for Pakistan, giving as their reason: “Urdu is inextricably linked with the history of Muslims.” “Urdu embodies Muslim culture and tradition, also Muslim history, theology beliefs, in short, the Muslim way of thinking.” The l</span><span class="font20" style="text-decoration:underline;">anguag</span><span class="font20">e question is one of the causes of trouble between East and West Pakistan and one of the causes of dissatisfaction within East Pakistan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Several months ago East Pakistan got wide publicity in the world press, very little of it favorable, because of the shocking riots that have taken place in</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Chandragona, Dacca and Na-rayanganj.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">At the end of the third week of March there was a change</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">of government in East Pakistan: the United Front came into power with an Unprecedented, overwhelming majority. Unfortunately, this change of government seemed to be the signal for an outbreak of lawlessness, and on March 22 a serious riot took place in the Kamaphuli Paper Mill at Chandragona; thirteen people were brutally murdered and many people injured. The prime minister of Pakistan, Mohammad All, stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“There is considerable evidence to show that this riot was not the result of acts committed in the heat of the moment but had been carefully pre-planned. The modus operandi of these subversive agents was simple. It was to work up hatred between different sections of the mill workers, follow it up by exploiting the ill-will created and to strike at an opportune moment This they did with considerable success. As a result the paper mill, one of the finest in Asia and an eye sore to Pakistan’s enemies, had to close down and its operation has not even yet been restored to full efficiency and production,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The next serious disturbance of the peace was on Thursday, May 6; and on Friday, May 7, the people of East Pakistan were appalled to read in the Jfominp News the sensational headlines: “Over 55 injured in Police-Crowd Clash in Dacca.” The East Pakistan government issued the following press note:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“At 5:30 p.m. to-day there took place an altercation between some shop-keepers and members of the public and certain warders of the Dacca Central Jail at Chak-bazar followed by brickbatting. It is reported that a big crowd collected near the South Gate. The jail staff raised an alarm and under orders of the Jail Superintendent some warders armed with muskets proceeded to the spot. According to the Jail Superintendent, who followed the warders, the brickbatting increased in intensity and the warders had to open fire in self-defense. In the firing and brickbatting about 40 persons including ten warders received injuries.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Soon after the incident three East Pakistan Ministers, prominent United Front leaders and high officials visited the scene. The large crowd dispersed following the persuasion of the United Front leaders. After the departure of these officials another crowd collected at the jail gate. About 10:30 p.m. the crowd threw brickbats and attempted to storm a jail barrack and the jail police fired a second time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In his radio broadcast Pakistan’s prime minister, Mohammad Ali, stated: “The significance of this incident arises from the fact that a person who led a riotous mob against the jail staff was arrested and handed by the inspector-general of police, that he was subsequently released because of his political influence with the United Front and that he was later sworn in as a minister in Mr. Fazlul Huq's expanded cabinet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Violence Near Narayanganj</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The Adamjee Jute Mill, situated near Narayanganj, East Pakistan, is the largest jute mill in the world, covering less than half a square mile of land and employing thousands of workers. Trouble is alleged to have started at the mill on Friday evening, May 14, when a clash occurred between two parties on a fire brigade, as a result of which one person was seriously injured and died the next morning. This created tension between two sections of laborers, those from East Pakistan, the Bengalis, and the non-Bengalis. Then about 9:30 on Saturday morning the clash came. The battling mobs fired the living quarters of the laborers, killing men, women and children. In the evening the army was called in and took over the mill area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The first press account stated: &quot;A large number of persons are reported to have been killed and about 300 injured, some of them seriously,” but the full extent of the riot was not at first made public. On May 16 it was reported that 206 dead bodies had been recovered and because of the tension existing and as a precautionary measure the assembly of more than five persons was prohibited in Dacca and </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Narayanganj.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Wild rumors were continually being set afloat and tension continued building up. On May 19 the government press note reported: “The situation in the Adamjee Jute Mill as well as in the cities of Dacca and Narayanganj remained quiet. No untoward incident was reported. The recovery and burial of ail the dead bodies (380) has been completed. The total of the dead in the unfortunate riot will thus amount, including those who died in the hospitals, to about 400. There are good reasons to say that both sections which clashed suffered heavily, particularly in the number of the dead which to our utter shame included 25 women and nine young children.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">All sorts of reasons have been given as to why these riots occurred, as to why Moslems should be killing Moslems, but it seems that the opinions of the different factions differ greatly. Tyeb Gilani, general secretary of the Provincial Anjuman Ma-</span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">hajerin,</span><span class="font20"> blamed </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">the rioting on “the</span><span class="font20"> unchecked preaching of provincialism,” linguistic nationalism and communism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The Pakistan prime minister, Mohammad Ali, stated that the United Front lead-era made the fantastic allegation that the Center and the Moslem League had instigated these riots to discredit the United Front. “This,” he said, “was, of course, a deliberate falsehood and a wicked attempt to mislead the people and make political capital out of a great tragedy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">According to the </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Morning News</span><span class="font20"> of May 20, the East Pakistan chief minister, A. K. Fazlul Huq, “referred to suggestions that communists were behind these disturbances and expressed the view that communists do not appear to have been behind these disturbances. He further said communists had no influence among the rank and file of the people in East Pakistan.” However, at Karachi on the 21st elderly Huq denied making that statement. Huq stated that he could not blame anybody for the Narayanganj riots as the cause was “wrapped up in deep mystery,” which nobody could find out. He added, however, that some very intelligent police dfficers might succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">The Results</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">At a meeting of Pakistan’s central cabinet the decision was made that drastic action would have to be taken to control law and order in East Pakistan. The governor of East Pakistan was recalled and a new governor was appointed in his stead. The governor-general of Pakistan proclaimed on May 29: “Whereas the governor-general is satisfied that a grave emergency exists and thei etiy he secuni of East Bengal is threatened . , , the governor-general is pleased to direct the governor of East Bengal to assume cm bis behalf all powers vested in or exercisable by the provincial legislature,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The prime minister of Pakistan told the nation over the radio that the sole aim in thus taking over the administration of the province was to save East Bengal and save the integrity of Pakistan, that the administration of East Bengal had virtually broken down and the Fazlul Huq ministry was not able to secure the lives and property of the people of the province. The </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Pakistan Observer</span><span class="font20"> said of the prime minister’s action: “It was clear that neither [Huq] nor his cabinet was fit to administer the province nor could be trusted to restore peace and confidence and work for the prosperity of 42 million people. The Center had therefore no other alternative but the dismissal of the Huq ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Since governor’s rule has come into force there have been a number of arrests of prominent agitators, bad characters, journalists and even several members of the Legislative Assembly, Up to June 3 the total number of persons arrested was 435. The situation in the province continues to remain quiet, and it is hoped that the “peace and confidence&quot; that are so easily lost in this old world will return to East Pakistan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“EXPECTING A BOY, OR A GIRL?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-variant:small-caps;">•jj</span><span class="font0"> Under the above headline the New York </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram and Sun,</span><span class="font0"> May 18, 1954, told of a simple test that tells prospective parents whether their child will be a boy or a girl. It simply consists of “a tiny paper wafer soaked in a secret chemical. The wafer is placed on the mother’s tongue for 15 seconds until It absorbs some of her saliva. Then she mails the dried-out wafer [to the manufacturer who] adds another ingredient. If the wafer turns purple, it signifies male hormones are present and the baby will be a boy. If mother draws a blank—a colorless </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">wafer— </span><span class="font0">it means she gets a girl. ‘We miss in 2 per cent,' reminds Monsieur Weibert. ‘That happens in a plural birth, or where saliva was put on the wafer before the fourth or after the fifth month.&quot; The formula was discovered by a Dr. Jean </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Reisman </span><span class="font0">of Paris.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">■■</span><span class="font0">T IS now about eight years since I con- 1 II ducted my first funeral service in Trinidad. I H It is still vividly remembered as an occa- J sion that emphasizes that the customs of na- 4 tlons of the earth </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">are</span><span class="font0"> different Since then ? quite a number of funerals have been attend- ? ed that have rounded out my knowledge and J</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">experience on the subject. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The deceased on this first experience had a 4 graveside service. The first surprise came j when upon gathering at the hospital it was </span><span class="font19">।</span><span class="font0"> learned that the mourners walked in pro- &gt;&nbsp;cession behind the hearse to the cemetery, ! which was about two miles away. A friend 4 with a car suggested driving to the cemetery j and waiting for the procession there. This was </span><span class="font19">।</span><span class="font0"> done. While en route he explained that the j talk should be short with some singing, as the ; people like to sing at funerals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;L </span><span class="font0">When the hearse and procession finally ar* } rived more unusual customs were noticed. I Aside from the immediate family of the de- j ceased no one seemed very sorrowful or even « in a solemn frame of mind. As they walked : along toward the grave they were chatting j and laughing. Men were in dark suits, and the I women wore white. One or two cars brought 1 up the rear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;L </span><span class="font0">We arrived at the grave and found it in its j naked simplicity. No effort had been made to j hide what it was. The dirt was piled in mounds j all around it. The coffin was balanced on a mound by the open grave, and our service * began. A few words concerning the dead with I the hope from the Scriptures and a short j prayer constituted the service. Now two bare- j footed gravediggers appeared and slid ropes <sub>; </sub>under each end of the coffin and lowered it t into the grave after first covering the glass J panel where the face of the deceased could I be seen for the last time. This brought on j some wailing from the near relatives, but they 4 quieted down for the singing. Suddenly, in the j midst of the song, I heard a &quot;thump, thump&quot;' and stole a glance to see what was happening. ! Yes, the gravediggers were working with a j will shoveling the dirt back into the grave as 4 fast as they could. By the time the song was j finished the grave was filled and the dirt was j being formed into a mound. That was my first * funeral in Trinidad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;L </span><span class="font0">No longer do these customs seem odd, as they have been experienced time and again in the passing years. The customs are fixed and <sup>a</sup>PPly to all funerals almost without excep* tion. Whether the service is in chapel, church or home there will be a procession. This is usually about five o'clock in the afternoon, as the weather is most reliable at that hour. Depending on sex and age of the dead the walkers line up two abreast behind the hearse and the pallbearers walk alongside the hearse. The bigger the procession the better, as every-one wants a big funeral. Many love to attend funerals just to walk in the procession. If it is a man who has died, the men are In the front of the procession. Women take the lead when a female dies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;1 </span><span class="font0">When the service is over the gravediggers are signaled and started off by some of the attenders throwing in handfuls of earth. Very few leave until the last shovelful is thrown on the mound. There is limited space in Port of Spain for burials, so two or more are buried in the same grave. The first will be buried nine feet deep and the next six feet. In the section of the cemetery reserved for the graves of poorer persons the graves are used over again after a certain number of years. I recall a recent funeral I served where this happened. Although accustomed to the procedure by now I still felt a bit shocked at seeing a considerable part of a human skeleton from a former burial being shoveled in with the earth on the newly lowered coffin. A grim reminder indeed of the destiny of sinner man!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To the observer from abroad the customs may seem somewhat crude and cruel as far as the effect on the relatives of the deceased is concerned. While this may be true, there are some compensations to those honest persons. With no tinsel to cover the burial rites and by remaining to see the dead buried, they see the evident fact that death is a dreadful enemy and that it brings sinner man to dust again, no fire or </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font0">playing on a harp but the corrupting silence of the tomb. Thus their minds are prepared for the precious truths of the ransom and the resurrection, because when they lose one in death they literally bury their dead.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">HUSBAND AND HEAD</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font31">A</span><span class="font20"> YOUNG American army officer, when asked about</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">attending a certain social function, replied that it would depend upon hew his wife felt about it. Asked, “Are you a man or a mouse?” he answered, “A man!” And how did he know he was a man and not a mouse? “My wife is afraid of a mouse!” The foregoing, a favorite story of the president of the United States, humorously points up the inconsistency of a rather prevalent situation in American homes where husbands fail to measure up as heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">However, it must be admitted that in many other lands we find husbands abusing their headship by going to the opposite extreme: treating their wives as slaves or worse; taking advantage of them by the common-law device; exercising tyranny over them by means of polygamy, easy divorces and the institution of purdali, which keeps wives veiled and secreted; or by selling them as if they were just so many cattle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The Bible sets the standard for Christians. It not only states that “a husband is head of his wife,” but also that he must “so love his wife as he does himself.” On the other hand it requires that “the wife should have deep respect for her husband.” —Ephesians 5:23, 33, New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">God’s Word also gives us examples for husbands to imitate, those of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, both of whom are described repeatedly as Husbands. And what a high ideal they provide for Christian husbands to aim at! Their course of action at all times merits the deepest respect of and evinces the greatest unselfish love for those to whom they are mar-</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">Tied as it were. Christ even gave his life for his bride.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A husband must measure up as head if he would have the deep respect of his wife. Insisting on his prerogatives as head while failing to measure up will make him seem like a pompous fool. Headship not merely involves taking the lead and having the final say but requires sound knowledge and good understanding, a self-control that is able to reason patiently and calmly when face to face with difficult situations. A</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Christian wife cannot respect a husband who is careless regarding his ministerial privileges, or who is a glutton at the table, or who imbibes too freely of alcoholic drinks, or who uses careless or obscene language, or who is dishonest, wasteful or a philanderer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">To the extent that you as a husband become careless in any of these respects, to that extent you will suffer loss of your wife’s deep respect. She may submit because she feels she has to, because of moral, economic or physical reasons, but it will make it a great deal easier for her if she wants to submit because of the deep respect she has for you due to your worthy course of action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Every Christian husband should want to make a success of his marriage by measuring up as head if for no other reason than that it vindicates God and his Word. The Bible states that marriage is to be held in honor by all, that he who marries does well, that “he who finds a wife finds a good thing,” and that because of the prevalence of immorality it is well to get married.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Proper bearing of marital responsibilities makes for mental and emotional maturity and even for physical well-being. Depending upon how we go about it, the married state can give much happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Caretaker and Provider</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A husband obligates himself to provide for his wife. That means, of course, that he will supply her needs in the way of food, clothing and shelter. It also means supplying her need for rest and relaxation, for a wife is not just a machine; in fact, it is said that even machines need rest, so how much more humans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The husband must also be solicitous of his wife’s spiritual needs and welfare, of opportunities and companionship in studying the Bible and other religious literature, in attending congregational and other religious assemblies and in opportunities for Christian service. Even if he has no religion, or one different from that of his wife, he is obligated to see to it that his wife’s religious needs are satisfied, even as he would be obligated to provide a special diet for her were she a diabetic victim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Nor is that all. To measure up as a husband you must provide for your wife's emotional needs. Many ever so well-meaning husbands fail in this respect. They overlook the fact that as men their minds work differently from those of their wives, men being more interested in things, whereas women are more concerned with persons and human relationships. A wife may wonder at times if her husband, because of the burden she represents, regrets having married her. Merely supplying her material wants, which he is required to do by law, will not reassure her, but the giving of little tokens of appreciation, flowers, sweets, compliments, etc., will, for they indicate you like to bear the burden. God loves a cheerful giver; so does a wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge and Understanding</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">'Rie apostle Peter counsels husbands to dwell with their wives &quot;according to knowledge, assigning them honor as to a weaker vessel.” (1 Peter 3:7, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,) </span><span class="font20">That means to take into consideration the wife’s vicissitudes. It might be said that a woman is more a child of nature than is man. A man’s sex interest is quite constant and uniform, but that of a woman is as cyclic as the phases of the moon, ranging from disgust to ecstasy. Knowledge and understanding of what has been termed &quot;the No. 1 hazard of marriage” will go far to make for mutual happiness, and help the husband to measure up. Research by psychologists has revealed that while many men complain about their wives’ being capricious as regards their conjugal dues, such may in fact be unconscious rather than conscious and willful. Knowledge and understanding of this fact will indicate patience and tact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In addition to physical and unconscious handicaps modem society has further complicated woman’s role as wife. Competition, women working in industry or business, all tend to rob womankind of true femininity and to make it more difficult to be submissive. And the saturation of advertising, literature and amusements with sex makes it ever more difficult for a wife to hold the undivided attention, interest and affection of her husband. Knowledge and understanding of these facts will make you as a husband patient and considerate, thus helping you to measure up truly as cherisher and provider.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Honesty, Integrity Keeping</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Because of the widespread and serious breakdown in morals, being honest with your wife presents a greater challenge than ever before—honesty as regards your money, your time and your sex interest. Measuring up as a husband therefore preeludes the spending of money foolishly. To ask your wife to pinch pennies while you throw away dollars is not being just.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">And then the matter of your time. When you married your wife you felt that she was so desirable that you would rather spend your time with her than with anyone else. It is not being honest with her to find excuses for staying away from home. She needs your company. Concentrating on making her life fuller, richer and happier will pay dividends to you. If your wife seems boring, it may very likely be your fault; love, appreciation and patience will do much to make her company a delight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Most searching of all is your honesty as regards sex interest. Plainly the Bible tells you: “Rejoice in the wife of your youth,' a lovely hind, a graceful doe. Let her affection fill you at all times with delight, be infatuated always with her love. Why should you be infatuated, my son, with a loose woman and embrace the bosom of an adventuress?”—Proverbs 5:18-20, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Stan.</span><span class="font20"> Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Just because you owe your wife affection does not mean you cannot express romantic interest toward her. Thereby you not only pay a debt you owe her but you are storing up capital, as it were, upon which you can draw in times of need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">'Loving Your Wife as Yourself</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">As with our obligations to God, those to your wife can be summed up in the one word, love. If you follow the Bible’s excellent advice along this line you will have not only a clear conscience but also a happy wife who will endeavor to make you happy: “Husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself, for no man ever hated his own flesh, but he feeds and cherishes it” (Ephesians 5:28, 29, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font20"> Do not be like Adam, either in following your wife in a wrong course or in shifting blame upon her. H* did not measure up as husband and head, if she tends to transgress, be firm; but when Hie errs, stand by her and point to extenuating circumstances if there are any. She needs your protection in times of moral stress even more than in times of physical stress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Love will make you ask rather than command; to say: “Would you want to do this, dear?” rather than, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">“Do that!”</span><span class="font20"> Love will also indicate patience and self-control when an emotional storm is brewing. Better on such occasions to raise a mental or emotional umbrella as it were than to precipitate matters by loosing verbal thunderbolts charged with emotion. Sensitive mental discernment will indicate when correction or suggestions will do the most good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Love can be shown in so many little ways: by the tone of one’s voice, by care of one’s appearance, by little expressions of thoughtfulness, by knowing when to speak and when to keep silent, when to be boisterous as it were, and when to be soft and gentle. Love will not embarrass by thoughtless actions in the presence of others; it will not ignore her nor rush off letting her tag along behind. Because of the instinctive inferiority feelings we are bom with, the need for recognition and appreciation is real and strong, and especially in woman because of her more or less restricted sphere and certain handicaps. Intelligent and sincere expressions of appreciation of her efforts on behalf of her husband and children, in the Christian congregation or ministry, as well as her efforts to make herself appealing to her man, will do much to make her happy and contented and will undoubtedly result in increased happiness to her husband. Remember, the Bible praises the deserving woman.—Proverbs 31:10-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The apostle Paul shows divine wisdom when he stresses woman’s need to be submissive and man’s obligation to love his wife as his own body; both of these pinpoint human frailty. Many a woman insists she loves her husband, but such is all in vain if she is too proud to be submissive. Many a man wants to rule as head but fails miserably because he does not love his wife as he loves himself. The wife must remember that it is difficult for a man truly and tenderly to love, cherish and want to protect a woman who is not submissive, because by her independence she proclaims that she does not need him. Likewise the husband must remember that it is difficult for a woman to submit to a husband who does not truly love her as he loves himself, for submission without love debases her to something akin to a slave or a harlot. Of course, each one is accountable to Jehovah and therefore will strive to do to others as he would have them do to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Knowledge and understanding, honesty and love would seem to be all-inclusive, but one more characteristic might be mentioned; a sense of humor. To the extent that we take our obligations seriously we are inclined to judge another seriously and to take mere trifles seriously. Ability to laugh, to view human foibles or little things that annoy or irritate in an amusing light will go far in keeping molehills from becoming mountains and breezes from becoming hurricanes. Yes, keep your sense of humor, keep smiling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Marriage is a divine institution and as such has tremendous possibilities, not only for happiness but for physical, mental and emotional well-being and for progress. Each Christian husband owes it to God first of all, then to his wife and to himself to do his best to measure up. To the extent that he sets the proper example, is equipped with knowledge and understanding, is an integrity keeper, loves his wife as himself and keeps his sense of humor, to that extent he will realize the potentialities of marriage.</span></p>

<p><span class="font31">I</span><span class="font20">T TAKES more than wishing or hoping to become truly rich. Dreamers are seldom materially rich and never spiritually strong. Jesus, foreseeing our day, counseled against heaping up material riches. Said he: “Stop storing up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal. Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” He wished his followers to put first things first, to recognize which riches were true and lasting, and to see that a lifetime spent saving only material riches is a lifetime wasted.—Matthew 6:19-21, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New 'World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Nations of this world have greedily stored up wealth for these last days. Religious organizations have done the same. But spiritually they are poor, destitute, deficient, dried up, dead. Material riches and earthly splendor and religious traditions will not save them at Armageddon. James, foreseeing what would happen, taunted the rich with these words: “Come, now, you rich men, weep, howling over your calamities which are coming upon you. Your riches have rotted, and your outer garments have become moth-eaten. Your gold and silver are corroded, and their rust will be as a witness against you and will eat your fleshy parts. Something like fire Is what you have stared up in the last days. . . . You have lived in luxury upon the earth and have gone in for sensual pleasure. You have fattened your hearts on the day of slaughter.” Material riches have no value in the sight of God. They are devoid of saving qualities. “Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness de-livereth from death.” It takes more than material wealth to become truly rich. —James 5:1-6, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.;</span><span class="font20"> Proverbs 11:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Jesus showed the superficialness of material riches when he said: “Really, of what benefit is it for a man to gain the whole world and to forfeit his soul? What, really, would a man give in exchange for his soul?” There is nothing so important to man as his soul or life. Therefore for him to gain everlasting life would be indeed to acquire great riches! Jesus in prayer to God showed how this would be possible: “This means everlasting life,&quot; said he, “their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ” This wisdom “is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.” “For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.”—Mark 8:36, 37; John 17:3, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.;</span><span class="font20"> Proverbs 8:10, 11; Ecclesiastes 7:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The source of this wisdom and enduring riches is Almighty God, Jehovah, He is “the fountain of life” and the Giver of “every good gift and every perfect present.” To become truly rich we must come to Him, this great Storehouse, in all faith and humility. “Moreover, without faith it is impossible to win his good pleasure, for he that approaches God must believe that he is and that he becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.” That faith is having a knowledge of Jehovah’s purposes as expressed In his Word the Bible and then confidently relying upon his Word as the truth, '‘Faith,” said Paul, “is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld.”—Psalm 36:9; James 1:17; Hebrews 11:6, 1, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But before one can have faith he must have knowledge. ‘‘So faith follows the report. In turn, the report is through the word about Christ.” This knowledge must be about God and Christ Jesus. The first essential thing to learn, according to Hebrews 11:6, is to “believe that he is,” that is to say, that God is, that he exists, and that he is the rewarder of all those that diligently seek him. Man can learn this by the study of the Bible, God’s message to mankind. Having received some knowledge of Jehovah God and of his beloved Son Jesus Christ, the truth seeker desires to learn of God’s purposes toward mankind. This, too, he can learn in the Bible. Next he must follow the course that the Scriptures point out that one must take in order to be in Une for the blessings of riches that Jehovah has provided for humankind. As the Bible says: “The blessing of Jehovah, it maketh rich; and he addeth no sorrow therewith.” “He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him; he also will hear their cry, and will save them.”—Romans 10:17, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.;</span><span class="font20"> Proverbs 10:22; Psalm 145:19, Am. Stan. Vet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">To receive these blessings from Jehovah that make rich, the seeker must dedicate himself to Jehovah God to do His will. He must believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as his Redeemer, Savior and Exemplar. It becomes necessary for him to study the Scriptures and find out the perfect will of God that he might continue in Jehovah’s favor and receive of his blessings. It becomes necessary, too, for such person to give some evidence that he has agreed to do God’s will, and by such evidence produced by him other persons may know he has taken his stand on the side of God and Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Paul, having this in mind, wrote: “For if you publicly declare that ‘word in your mouth*, that Jesus is Lord, and exercise faith in your heart that God raised him up from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.” Holding on to that faith, and acting upon it during this present evil world, such one will not come to an end that brings shame, but will enter into the indestructible riches of God’s new world under the kingdom of his Son Jesus Christ.—Romans 10:9, 10, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In this world’s goods Christians may not be materially rich, but they do have peace of mind and joy of heart, they have contentment, they have a marvelous hope and the promise of everlasting life. Having these is being truly rich. As the psalmist said: “A little that a righteous man hath [in the goods of this world] is better than the riches of many wicked.” The righteous will inherit the earth with all its material riches, but the day of the wicked is very short-lived. “Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.” “Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.” Seek Jehovah’s wisdom and blessing. These make man truly rich and there are no sorrows attached to it.—Psalm 37:16, 37; Proverbs 23:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Keep</span><span class="font0"> on, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">■h in All the Earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Uruguay</span></p>
<p><span class="font31">U</span><span class="font20">RUGUAY is a progressive, modernistic country, although it is the smallest one in size in all of South America. The climate is very pleasant and it never gets too hot or too cold. July and August are the coldest months, but the temperature gets down to only about 44 degrees, with a high of about 83 in January. So Uruguay never sees a frost, much less any snow for the winter sports. It has, However, a delightful 200-mile stretch of beach from the capital of Montevideo up along the Atlantic coast line, and this provides a splendid setting for beach resorts and summer pastime. Fishing is one of the popular national sports, along with sailing, tennis and horseback riding. So there is much to distract the people from the urgent Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Although Jehovah’s witnesses have been active in Uruguay since 1923 in proclaiming the good news concerning the establishment of God’s kingdom of righteousness, it has been particularly since 1945, when the first group of missionary graduates of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead entered the country, that real progress has been made. Then there were five missionaries and thirty-three regularly engaged with them in field activity, encouraging home Bible study with people of good will. Now there are over six hundred who are active in the service and the original missionary group has been strengthened to more than twenty, who are located in three cities throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The people of this land are generally dominated by the Catholic priests, who control them with an iron hand. The men, especially husbands, consider themselves masters of the house and of their wives. Often the husband maintains this &quot;superiority” by physically beating his wife into submission. Therefore, when any woman decides to branch out on her own or challenge her husband’s religious views, she is in for a very difficult time. Only women with keen minds, a deep appreciation and strong determination will stand firm for their religious convictions. Uruguay has many of these too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A missionary managed to conduct a Bible study with a young lady by arranging a meeting place in a park in Montevideo. Her husband, who was bitterly opposed, came upon them in the park while studying. He flew into a rage, tore up the literature and threatened his wife and the missionary* But as soon as he left the wife returned, a new set of Bible study aids was produced and the study continued as if nothing happened. At another place when the opposing husband is not home the wife hangs a red ribbon from a window of the house. </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">This</span><span class="font20"> means that all is </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">well to conduct the </span><span class="font20">Bible study. But when there is no ribbon the missionary knows the husband is home and that there will be no study there that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Even though husbands dominate the wives in the majority of cases, there are scattered instances where the opposite is also true* An owner of a small grocery store became interested in the Kingdom message. The wife became bitter, nagged and made life generally miserable for him. Finally, the man decided to put an end to all this unnecessary bickering, packed his bags, told his wife he was leaving town until she learned to stop interfering with his Bible study. Hardly a week had passed when the wife appeared at the Kingdom Hall requesting a Bible study of her own. After a few weeks she wrote to her husband and confessed what she had done. She would no longer oppose him, because now she herself was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Both are now happily reunited and are serving actively in one of the congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Here in Uruguay, as throughout the world, there are those who claim tb be shepherds of the flock of God, but who prove themselves false shepherds. For example: A Pentecostal pastor was invited to take part in a Bible study and prove his religious views with supporting scriptures. This religious /‘shepherd” became greatly embarrassed, not knowing the Scriptures and not being able to back up his religious views. Seeing his shame, the householder politely suggested the study be concluded until the following evening. She had been a faithful disciple of his for many years and now her faith in him was shaken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The next evening this Pentecostal “shepherd” refused to discuss the Scriptures, but desired to lecture on the virtues of the Pentecostal religion. When word spread of his incompetency to defend himself or his religion, his flock began to disintegrate. The iron grip with which he ruled them for years was broken by the Word of truth. His flock began to come over to Jehovah’s witnesses to seek Scriptural advice, because this Pentecostal “shepherd” had many strange rules and regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">He forbade the young to marry according to their choice. He insisted on arranging all marriages, even forcing some to marry contrary to their desire. He encouraged separations if one was not a believer in his doctrine. Tithing was his pet doctrine. He lived like a king and was treated like a god, until Jehovah’s witnesses spoiled his feathered nest with Bible truths. Instead of repenting of his wayward course he left his flock stranded, to practice his trade as a falsifier in another city. Jesus said a true shepherd would lay down his life for the sheep, but not so the false ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">So the Word of truth being preached is accomplishing its purpose here in Uruguay—dividing the sheep from the goats.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">The Defection of Dr. John</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">$&gt; Dr, Otto John was the head of the West German equivalent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. As chief of West German security he ferreted out foreign agents. His staff numbered hundreds. He was known as ‘'the man with a thousand secrets,” since he shared secrets on a reciprocal basis with Britain and America. One day in July Dr. John vanished. He turned up in Communist East Berlin, At a press conference in East Ben lin Dr. John announced that his reasons for defecting were threefold: the reunification of Germany, the safeguarding of his country from a rebirth of nazlsm and the prevention of a third world war. He also de* clared that his defection was unforced and that he did not intend to divulge any Western intelligence secrets. Still the Western world was stunned. So sensational were John’s de-sertion and press statements that they aroused the passions of the West Germans to a degree that no other event has since the war. The reason for consternation in Bonn was clear: in Dr, John the Soviets held a possible key to some of the most closely guarded Allied secrets. Official U. S. and Ab lied sources said that if the Reds were able to get certain information from Dr. John it would be a situation approach* ing a “major catastrophe,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">And for the West ... *</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&amp; Dr. John’s defection was clearly a propaganda victory for the East. But during the same week that the Communists exhibited their prize, the West put on display its own prize specimen. This was Yuri A. Rastvorov, a former Soviet espionage agent, who announced at a press conference in Washington that he had asked for and received asylum in the U. S. Rastvorov was a lieutenant colonel in the M. V. D. (Ministry of Internal Affairs} and the secc^d secretary of the Soviet mission in Tokyo when he came over to the West. On January 24 the U. S, army took him into protective custody. He did not emerge into the limelight again until his press conference. His public appearance, in the language of espionage agents, is known as “surfacing.” It serves to notify all interested parties that the former Soviet spy had divulged everything of value to U. S, agents. This greatly reduces the danger to the exspy's life. Though Rastvorov did not know the details of a Soviet spy system in the U. S., he did state that he knew an effective espionage system was at work.</span></p>

Portugal's star then rose in the Aslan sky as she became “lord of the Orient.” But today all that remains of the glory that once was Portugal's are Goa and two other small colonies, comprising in all about 1,500 square miles and 650,000 persons. For some time India has campaigned to annex these territories to the Indian Republic. Portugal has not been receptive to this idea. President Salazar saying that the colonies in India “must continue to be the memorial of Portuguese discoveries and a small hearth of the spirit of the West in the East.” In July it became apparent that India wanted no foreign “hearth” Indian nationalists not only demonstrated against Portugal but they even announced their intention to “liberate” Goa, largest of the settlements. Trouble began (8/15) when the nationalists forcibly captured Terekhol, a fortress on the northern tip of Goa. Portugal responded by sending a cruiser two miles off the coast to bombard the fortress. A landing party then recaptured the fortress and took down the Indian tricolor, raising once again the flag of Portugal Said Portugal’s foreign minister: 'The aggression has been avoided for now, but the sinister threat persists.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">&lt;$&gt; After Colonel Castillo Armas successfully marched on Guatemala with a band of ragged irregulars, his so-called Liberation Army was to be incorporated in the regular army. But the proposed amalgamation stirred up military rivalry. For the regulars, proud of their immaculate uniforms and professional discipline, looked with scorn upon the straw-hatted, bare-footed irregulars. The jealousy of the regulars grew to a fiery pitch when, tai August 1, a detachment of 600 Liberation troops came to the capital for a victory parade. A fight broke out between the regular army cadets and the irregulars. The regular army then rushed to the aid of the cadets with tanks and canons blazing. After a full day of street fighting, twenty-three persons were counted dead and more than a hundred Injured* Col* Castillo arranged a cease fire by promising to disband the Liberation Army. But meantime the anger of the people was kindled against the regular army, and there were demonstrations in behalf of the Liberation Army and CoL Castillo. This seemingly frightened regular army leaders, for they forgot the idea of disbanding the Liberation Army and collaborated with CoL Castillo in suppressing army rebels who had refused to obey the cease fire. Ironically, the military rivalry disturbance was believed to have Increased the power of CoL Castillo Armas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">The Conquest of K-2</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&lt;£&gt; There are twenty-three mountain peaks in Asia that tower 25,000 feet or higher. The most famous of these is 29,002-foot Mt. Everest. After the conquest of Everest in May, 1553, Mt. Godwin Austen, designated as K-2 on Indian topographical survey maps, became the world’s highest unclimbed mountain. K-2 towers 28,250 feet above the Kashmir plains in the northernmost regions of Pakistan. In May an eleven-man Italian expedition, led by a professor of geology from the University of Milan, ArdJto Desio, began to climb K-2* They succeeded (7/31). But It' took them three months to do it, two months of which were spent at altitudes above 20,000 feet. Not without cost in human life was this conquest. One member of the expedition died of pneumonia. This was the sixth person to lose his life in expeditions on Mt. Godwin Austen. Now that K-2 is conquered, the world’s highest unconquered peak is Kanchenjunga, a 28,146-foot glacial giant on the Nepal-India border.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">&lt;$&gt; Niagara Falls is receding* As the Niagara River flows over the crest it cuts into un* derlying shale so that in time projecting lips collapse of their own weight. Thus the crestline of Niagara is being forced back at a rate of about a mile every 1,370 years. This receding process was demonstrated with a crash and a roar in July when some 185,000 tons of rock, dirt and rubble from the falls and adjacent observation area broke loose and tumbled into the 170-foot-deep gorge. A huge pie-shaped chunk fell from the American Falls. But the Park Commission’s chief engineer, A. M. Anderson, said the resulting deep &quot;V” actually improved the view of part of the American Falls. Prospect Point, observation area and a favorite spot of honeymooners, lost a big chunk, but no one was injured. The rock fall was Niagara’s biggest in more than twenty years.</span></p>

What an amazing bonanza was found then in July, when British whalers recovered from the intestine of a sperm whale a piece of ambergris weighing 926 pounds<sup>r</sup>. It it one of the largest lumps on record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Mile of the Century”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&lt;$&gt; Only two runners have accomplished what had long been thought impossible: the running of a mile in less than four minutes. The first to do it was Britain’s Roger Bannister, His time was 3:59.4. But his record lasted only six weeks; on June 21 Australia’s John Landy did it in 3:58, It thus became clear that the race of races for 1954 would be one between Landy and Bannister. Scheduled for the British Empire Games in Vancouver, B.C., the race was called &quot;mile of the century /* Though eight men participated, soon after the starting gun it was a two-man race. Landy set the pace into the homestretch. On the last lap Bannister turned on lull power and pulled himself up smoothly to Landy’s heels. When they finished Bannister had gained a full six yards on Landy. Bannister's winning time was 3:58.8, eight-tenths over Landy’s 3:58 of June 21, Since Landy's time lor the “mile of the century&quot; was 3:59.6, it was a historic race: the first double running of a mile in less than four minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Death of a Quintuplet</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On May 28,1934, a multiple birth startled the world. It was the birth of the famous Dionne quintuplets. Tourists by the thousands docked to Canada to see the famous five and by the time the quintuplets were four years old the value of their trust fund from advertising, movie and other contracts ran up to $600,000. A special show yard with one-way viewing windows was constructed so that as many as 7,000 persons an afternoon paid an admission fee to watch the youngsters play. In recent years the trust fund Is reported to have run up to $1,250,000, but the quintuplets have lived quietly behind the steel-meshed fence of their estate. In 1954 Emilie, the shyest of th£ quintuplets, visited a convent, in possible preparation for joining the religious order. On August 6 Emilie died at the convent in Ste. Agathe, Quebec. According to Montreal physicians who performed the autopsy, she died following a series of epileptic seizures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Atom Ashes Deform Fish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Japanese tuna vessel Fortunate Dragon was the ship caught in a fall-out of radioactive ash that resulted from the H-bombs tests at Bikini last spring. Japanese scientists are now using the ashes collected aboard this vessel tn experiments. When they introduced atom ashes to the eggs of goldfish, they produced goldfish with “hideous deformities.&quot; Since fish with grotesque deformities usually die almost immediately after hatching, Dr. Okada of the Tokyo Fisheries College declared: “We believe we can conclude that the stock of tuna in the radioactivity-contaminated seas will decrease In the future.&quot;—New York </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font0"> 7/31,</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Protection for Trout-Eaten</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In recent years many foreign brown trout have been coming into the U. S. under false colors—“Rocky Mountain Rainbow Trout ” or “Sierra Mountain Trout.&quot; In August a levity-provoking bill, already passed by the Senate, came up in the House. It called for all restaurant menus to identify the trout according to birthplace. Penalty for serving alien trout without papers would be a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. The representatives debated. One asked about &quot;Virginia ham/<sup>f</sup> saying it never got closer home than Chicago. Another wanted protection for “our Brooklyn Gowanus Canal Guppies.&quot; Others deplored the levity, pointing to the Idaho potato and the Maine lobster. Finally, the bill, in a modified form, passed.</span></p>

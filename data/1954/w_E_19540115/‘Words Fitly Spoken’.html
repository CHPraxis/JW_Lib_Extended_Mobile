<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In the coal-mining region of northeastern France are to be found, in the main, three classes of people: staunch Catholics, Communists and those who are indifferent. There, often a Catholic will tell one of Jehovah’s witnesses: “Your religion isn’t French. It comes from America,” entirely overlooking the fact that his religion is not French either, but comes from Rome.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● In one of the towns in this region a priest asked a seven-year-old witness who was standing on the street corner offering Bible literature to passers-by if he was being paid for doing this. “Why, yes,” he replied, “of course. All workers deserve a salary. Jehovah will give me eternal life in the new world. What did you think my pay would be?” The priest left without saying a word.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● In another such town a 78-year-old witness for Jehovah was visited by his Catholic priest. Said he, “I can’t understand why you have quit your religion after having been so long in it. How did you get to be so crazy at your age?” The witness replied: “You’re very much mistaken—just the opposite is the case. I was crazy among crazy folks for seventy-seven years. Since then I have been healed spiritually. Yes, at 77 years I was still calling you ‘Father,’ when I am old enough to be your grandfather.”</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Good, wholesome work is a joy and a pleasure. When one is skilled in his work, he does it with real delight and derives great satisfaction from doing it well. Jehovah God, the Creator of heaven and earth, is the skilled Director of all good works. Did you know there is a definite work he wants all who love him to skillfully do? It is the work of making known his great and holy name to the ends of the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:16-19:83:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 83:16-18</a>) Blessed is the one who does his bidding and is ‘skilled at his work, for he will stand in the presence of kings.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:29-20:22:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 22:29</a>, <em>AT</em>) Desiring to please God, during February all of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions will derive joy and pleasure from offering a year’s subscription for the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine at the regular rate of $1. Free to each new subscriber, there will be given three booklets. As a skilled workman of God, stand in the presence of the enthroned King, Christ Jesus, by serving Bible truths to people living in your area. Testify boldly to all whom you meet.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>THE NEW WORLD SOCIETY NOW IN EVIDENCE</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Christ’s followers, living as a New World society, turn away from the strife, greed, debauchery and crime of the old world in conforming to their Leader’s expression: “I am not of this [old] world.” To help others who look forward to the time when righteousness will fill the earth, Jehovah’s witnesses joyfully carry to the homes of the people Bible study aids. Three such books and booklets will be offered on a contribution of $1.50 during December, or the <em>New World Translation </em>of the Hebrew or Greek Scriptures with a book on a contribution of $2. To share in this activity write this office.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>“THIS GOOD NEWS OF THE KINGDOM”</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We need good news today, especially good news about a righteous government. Men’s schemes for governing themselves multiply, and their failures multiply at the same rate. But there is good news about a perfect government that will never fail, that will bring peace eternal. It is the news of Jehovah God’s government, of its establishment, how it will eliminate sin and death and the Devil, and how by dedication to Jehovah persons can be ransomed to everlasting earthly life under it, surviving the approaching end of this present sorrowful system of things. This is news that is good and timely and vital. It is stated clearly, in the simplest of language, in the new 32-page booklet entitled “This Good News of the Kingdom”. You will thrill to receive this good news, and give it to others, and even study it with others. To facilitate both private and group study, questions on each paragraph appear in the booklet. Individual copies are 5c, or to supply your friends and neighbors get 7 for 25c or 30 for $1. Congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses may order supplies for use during the <em>Watchtower </em>campaign, January through April.</p>

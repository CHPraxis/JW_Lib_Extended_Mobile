<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Is there someone in the Christian congregation with whom you have a longstanding cause of contention? Have you applied the Christian principle to it, or are you still following the way of the old world—telling others about it rather than going to the one who offended you? The Christian principle was stated by Jesus in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:15-40:18:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 18:15</a> (<em>NW</em>): “Moreover, if your brother commits a sin, go lay bare his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.” If the problem is not important enough to be settled in this proper way, then why keep it on your mind, letting it separate you from your brother?</p>

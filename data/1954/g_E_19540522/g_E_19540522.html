<p><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;">The Need for a Prophet</span></p>
<p><span class="font32">T</span><span class="font23">O MANY people the world’s future looks bleak. This is not because man lack’s inventive powers, or because of economic conditions, or because man lacks strength to survive difficulties. Man has all these things in good quantity. The bleak outlook surrounds man’s inability to create peace so as to enjoy these conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Representative W. Sterling Cole, chairman of the United States Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy, said last February 17 that man is stepping into an age where one hydrogen bomb can unleash a &quot;destructive force exceeding all the TNT dropped on Germany, Italy and Japan combined throughout all of World War II” I The test of a hydrogen device in the Pacific in 1952, he said, “completely obliterated” the test island and tore a mile-wide crater in the ocean’s floor, 175 feet deep at its lowest point. This crater, he explained, could swallow all of downtown Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">According to the New York </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram and Sun,</span><span class="font23"> such an explosion could split New York’s Manhattan Island in two, linking the Hudson and East Rivers, obliterating the Empire State and Chrysler buildings, leaving Wall Street’s towers cracked and broken, windowless, gaunt and fire-singed, destroying massive bridges, tunnels and railroad stations, killing two million persons, and injuring 1.5 million. More powerful bombs have been tested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Not a very pretty picture, is it? Not a firm hope or shining prophecy. It is the sort of thing that makes some people turn to religion. But speaking a short time earlier to a Methodist Student Movement meeting in Lawrence, Kansas, Boston University’s Professor Harold A. Ehrensperger said, January 2: “We have identified our religion with the powers of this world, and there are no true prophets to sound our doom, to shock us into awareness of our sins and to stab us awake before we destroy one another.” Religion, he said, has become “a name, an institution, not an experience in life. What we lack are prophets—there are no prophets any more.” He further pointed out that if cultures are to be transformed, men must be transformed; that if a man really becomes &quot;a new crea-tiire in Christ, he begins to live a transforming life. Everything he touches will be transformed . . . Thus are cultures genuinely transformed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Can it be that there are no such true prophets today? Or is it rather that, as it was many times in the days of Israel, the prophets are in the minority and the people in general just will not recognize them as such and listen? A true prophet is usually disliked by the world, not honored by it. The true prophet, looking to the interests of those who want to do right, must show where the world is wrong. The world rarely appreciates being shown this. It wants to go its own way rather than God’s. That is proved by Biblical examples. Elijah was a true prophet. Because of his activity Jezebel threatened his life. (1 Kings 19:2) Jeremiah was a true prophet Because of prophesying truly he was smitten and jailed. (Jeremiah 20:2; 38:6) Zechariah was a true prophet. He was stoned for warning: “Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of Jehovah, so that ye cannot prosper? because ye&quot; have forsaken Jehovah, he hath also forsaken you/’ —2 Chronicles 24:20, 21, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">‘Am, Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The purpose of true prophets is to warn, not just of impending wars, but of God’s wrath, of the necessity of properly serving nim. This need is even greater today, but those who want a prophet do not want this kind. They want someone to tell them how to avoid atomic war, rather than someone who will tell them the even more important thing: how through Jehovah’s blessings to receive everlasting life in peace and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">True prophets were those sent by Jehovah; the lack of true warning in today’s religious organizations indicates these organizations are suffering from a lack of Jehovah's blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Ancient prophets that the Bible shows were true foretold the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty. That sovereignty, not politics, was foremost. Many of today’s religious leaders appear to have forgotten this. Desirable conditions will come with the vindication of God’s sovereignty; but his sovereignty comes first, man’s desires second. Today's religious prophets have the proverbial cart before the horse, and that is why their solutions have proved hollow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">While true prophets, who really put God’s will first, may be small in number, may be as John was, “a voice of a man crying out in the wilderness,” yet their voice is being uttered with ever-increasing volume. Like John’s voice it is being heard! (Matthew 3:3, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font23"> It is now a half million strong. It is not just “a name, an institution,” as Professor Ehren-sperger recognizes today’s religion is. Rather, it is a voice that calls out a warning, that is more than “an experience of life/’ but points to a </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">way</span><span class="font23"> of life, a way of living, a dedicated way, the way of Jehovah. Those who utter such true counsel do not speak on their own. Rather, they speak with the greatest authority behind them. How is this? Rather than putting forth their own ideas, they prophesy in a way that publicly tells forth what has already been stated in God's Word, the Bible. Its prophecies are sufficient. The Bible's prophecies predicted the very time of trouble earth now sees. They showed the reason for this trouble. They stated the outcome. (Mathew 24; Revelation 12:12: 21:1-4) What prophet could be expected to do more than that?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In general today’s religious leaders, as this Methodist movement’s lecturer pointed ■ out, have failed to shock the people into an awareness. But throughout the earth people who were formerly of all religious and political persuasions are awakening by the tens of thousands, and are listening to this true word of prophecy. A thousand a week are taking hold of this message of life. True prophets are sounding the old world’s doom, are pointing to the scriptures that tell of this, are shocking sincere people into an awareness of the entire world’s sin, so those persons can seek protection before Jehovah destroys this wicked system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The awakened ones face the brightest <sub>4</sub>of futures. They are creatures living new and transformed lives, looking to the peaceful conditions that further Bible prophecies show are at hand, and helping others to see these same things. Are you listening? Have you heard these prophets? Are you awake to the vital importance of their message? It will not affect your survival of an atomic attack, but it will remove the blackness of world conditions, and it may mean your very life!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BAPTISM BY BOMBS</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Japan<sup>1</sup>* reaction to the nuclear blasts in the Pacific, a* told by ''Awoke!&quot; correspondent in Japan</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">T</span><span class="font16">IE morning of March 1, 1954, looked like an early sunrise to the twenty-three sailors of the No. 5 Fukuryu (“lucky dragon&quot;) Maru. But that flashing fire in the east, followed by its rolling thunders, was an unhappy omen for the Lucky Dragon. After some hours darkness covered the real sun and a white dust started to fall, atomic dust, the “ashes of death.” Rubber equipment crumbled, and the sailors felt their bodies strangely aglow. That glow was only the preliminary of illness and aftereffects that may continue for years. One physician, a professor of Tokyo University, has even stated that the effects may show up again in freaks among the future offspring of the victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The hydrogen-bomb blast touched off at Bikini that morning did more than shatter the scientific expectations of its creators. It left 28 Americans, -236 Pacific natives and the 23 Japanese suffering varying degrees of radioactive burns. It “activated” the fish over a vast area, so that 100 and more tons of tuna fish have had to be destroyed on arrival in Japan. It has removed fish, a staple food of Japan, from the tables of millions of households. And it has torn an ugly rift in already precarious American-Japanese friendships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Japanese were the first to be baptized with atom bombs, in time of war. Now, m time of peace, they have been first to undergo baptism by the hydrogen bomb.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19540522_files/g_E_19540522-4.png" alt="" style="width:211pt;height:40pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">implications of the “Hydrogen&quot; Crisis</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">To understand the seriousness of the crisis one must understand the worsening problems of Japan. Fish has been a staple food of Japan for years, not only because Japan is an island empire, but because her teeming population cannot subsist on the produce of her land alone. There are 85,000,000 mouths to feed, and less arable land than in the state of California. As another 1,000,000 are added to the population each year Japan’s fishing trawlers plow farther and farther into the surrounding seas. The fishermen ef Japan do not generally have the seaworthy equipment of fisherfolk of other nations. It is a hard, uncertain life, braving the furies of the deep. Oftentimes they do not come home at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The people at home respect the labors of the fishermen. Hence when the crew of the Fukuryu Maru arrived home with atomic burns and a radioactive cargo of tuna, the tide of resentment was higher than mere promises of “compensation” could assuage. Whoever was responsible for the misjudgment of the hydrogen blast at Bikini will have to go far, far deeper than dollar compensations in order to win back the confidence of the Japanese people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The outcry covers not only the radiation injuries and the loss of fishing catches. The Japanese are also protesting wider issues, and principally the violation of the “freedom of the seas.&quot; This is a big issue to Japan, as she is beginning to find her fishing seas restricted on every side. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Nihon Keizai</span><span class="font18"> of March 27 pointed out that Japan’s fishing boats cannot operate freely in northern waters and the East China Sea, because of the Communists; in the Sea of Japan, because of Korea’s “Rhee Line’’;; in southern waters, because of the Arafura Sea pearl-fishing dispute with Australia; and now the United States’ “closed area” cuts off the routes to other southern fishing grounds. The newspaper </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">concluded: </span><span class="font18">“It is clear and explicit the establishment of the zone violates the principle of freedom of the high seas.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Specter of Fear</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Adding weight to the Bikini catastrophe is the Japanese memory of what happened at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The sufferings and agonies caused by those bombs of nine years ago have been publicized in Japan as nowhere else in the world, and many of the Japanese people have learned of those horrors by firsthand eyewitness accounts. Those bombs are real to them! They shudder to hear of the new bomb, 500 times as powerful as the bomb at Hiroshima! When America came to Japan following World War II and gave Japan a constitution that outlawed war, the Japanese welcomed this sign of repentance. However, Japanese nationals have again suffered from American nuclear bombs. The Japanese do not dislike Americans because they are Americans, but here is another event in a lengthening train that is building up distrust of America and endangering Japan’s alliance with the West.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The Japanese have a deep fear of radioactivity. So deep is that fear that for a month or more </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">aU</span><span class="font18"> fish, whether from the deep seas or the nearby seas, has come to be suspect. Most of this fish is free from all possibility of contamination, but fear has gripped the stomachs of the people, and for many has banished fish from the everyday diet. Sound-cars sponsored by the ship merchants tour the streets of Tokyo, and posters have appeared on the streetcars, assuring the population that it is safe to eat fish. But fear remains, and the fish trade has hit so serious a slump that it would probably take some millions of American dollars to make amends on this score alone. Certainly it would take more than dollars to compensate the Japanese gourmand for the loss of that delicacy, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">tuna o-saxhimi</span><span class="font18">. (raw sliced tuna), served with green horse-radish at banquets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Jehovah's witnesses are not people to be affected by hysterias. However, the spread of the fish crisis to all classes of the community is illustrated in the following examples. At a recent wedding of Jehovah’s witnesses all guests but two at the wedding breakfast declined the course of </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">o-sashimi. </span><span class="font18">Of the two, one was a foreign missionary and the other a doctor. At a circuit assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses, more than 30 per cent of the diners refused fish at one of the cafeteria dinners, contenting themselves with rice and vegetables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The hydrogen-bomb crisis in Japan is a big crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">What the People Think</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">There are many people in Japan who still like America for her benevolent treatment of the Japanese during the occupation. They see the widening rift and they hope that America will not become “bomb happy” to the extent of completely estranging the Japanese. What comparison *is there really to be made between a few experimental bombs and the friendship of 85,000,000 Orientals?</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The following letter was written by a schoolteacher to the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Mainichi Shimbun, </span><span class="font18">Tokyo, and appeared under the caption “The Lessons of the ‘Ashes of Death’</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">“With a worried look on her face, my wife told me when I returned home from work that she had served fish to the chil-</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">dren and wondered whether to give them a laxative. Until she heard about It over the radio, she hadn’t known about the radioactive fish. I, too, read about it in the paper on my way home in the train and was surprised and worried. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Why can’t the manufacture of the frightful atomic weapons be stopped? Can it be that the people of the world have never heard of Hiroshima and Nagasaki? It is too early yet to forget about them. Others may have forgotten, but we Japanese still remember. .'. . Let us appeal once again to the peoples of the world to arouse the conscience of those carried away by enthusiasm for atomic weapons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The AsaAi </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Shimbun,</span><span class="font16"> Nagoya, received the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“Tuna from Bikini have given us a big shock. It Is indeed a dreadful thing. Come to think of it, countless millions of fish living where the ‘ashes of death’ fell may have swallowed some of these ashes. Moreover, the radioactive ashes may dissolve and be carried by the currents of the sea to Japan. Will there not be a danger of fish in Japanese waters being contaminated?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">&quot;I realize there is no end to worrying and that we must await the verdict of specialists as to whether the fish are fit for human consumption. But if we deprive the Japanese of their fish, they will have to eat meat, which is too expensive for the poor. So they must have fish, and so there is a danger of the entire Japanese race being contaminated by radioactive food. . . . Atomic tests in the future will probably spread havoc over wider and wider areas. This will mean that more and more fish will be swallowing radioactive ashes. It is horrible to think of.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Another letter, published in the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Tokyo Shimbun,</span><span class="font16"> contained the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“I am employed at the Tokyo central fish market. Ilie day the ‘radioactive’ sharks and tuna . .. arrived, the place was truly a mad-house. It is indeed </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">dangerous </span><span class="font16">when people of no experience disturb the public by talking, without any evidence whatsoever, about the effect of eating the fish. There were no buyers even for yellowtail caught in waters off Japan, for flying fish or for fish processed in Hokkaido (northern Japan) about a month ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“If such a situation is allowed to continue, it is clear that every fish market in the country will b£ faced with a crisis. America should pay compensation not only for direct but also for indirect damage such as this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">“There is no way for Japanese fishermen to live if they are deprived of their fishing grounds by these atomic tests. Before aiming at the conservation of fish through the North Pacific Fisheries Agreement, America should ban ‘hydrogen bomb tests' in the Pacific. As the name implies, I would like to see peace and tranquillity in the Pacific. At least, the Pacific Ocean should be left open to the Japanese.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Two weeks after the first “scare” there were further jitters when the Welfare Ministry announced on March 30 that it had condemned as radioactive another 74,000 pounds of tuna, valued at $10,000. This tuna was caught in mid-Pacific after the March 1 blast, by the No. 13 Keoi Maru. At the same time, 100,000 pounds of tuna had been detained three days on a third trawler, No. 5 Myojin Maru, up Sendai way. Fish dealers were saying that they would not now handle this stale cargo even if it were released. On April 4 came the announcement that radioactivity had been found in the clothes of the crew of still a fourth returning trawler, the No. 7 Dai Maru.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Outlawing the “Ashes of Death&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Japanese government itself has taken a conservative stand. While deploring the crisis and asking for just compensa-</span></p>

<p><span class="font23">tions, it is not raising objections to further American nuclear experiments in the Pacific. Some American authorities have excused the incident in saying that American personnel were also burned. But the big question remains, Why does anyone have to get burned at all? As pointed out by the </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Tokyo Shimbun</span><span class="font23"> of March 26, the March 1 bomb was very much more powerful than it was believed by scientists to be, and the damage caused by radioactive dust was mdre extensive than expected. Does it not appear that nuclear fusion experiments may get out of hand altogether, and endanger the lives of the citizens of the entire world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">So, what to do? The </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Yomiuri Shimbun, </span><span class="font23">March 26, espoused an immediate ban on the use of atomic weapons and restriction of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The left-wing Socialist party called for the same measures. The </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Nippon Times</span><span class="font23"> of March </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">29</span><span class="font23"> said: “The wider implications of the holding of these bomb tests . . * call for international action on the broadest lines under the leadership of the best brains humankind can supply?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">“The best brains/’ says the newspaper. Whose “brains”? What “brains”? During World War I the “best brains” planned a world made “safe for democracy” and later engineered the League of Nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">However, that brain-child died an unhappy death* During World War II the “best brains” conceived four freedoms for all mankind, and other “brains” brought forth the United Nations, a sickly infant to this day. What “brains” are now to be found, better than those of the past, and capable of leading man away from the terrible destiny of a world-wide nuclear baptism? Selfish “brains” of a selfish world are caught in a dilemma of their own making. While each brain insists on being more powerful than the other, the problem will keep on mushrooming like the now-familiar mushroom of the nuclear explosion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">A prophet of 2,500 years ago put it pointedly: “O Jehovah, I know that the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.” (Jeremiah 10:23, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan.</span><span class="font23"> Ver.) Certainly it is not in man of this atom-crazed twentieth century to direct his steps* This present evil and confused world is appointed to destruction, not by a mere worldwide hydrogen-bomb baptism, but by the Armageddon baptism from Jehovah God, In that fast-approaching day the mind that created all the universe and its forces, the infinite mind of Jehovah himself, will direct the way of preservation for the </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">meek </span><span class="font23">peoples in Japan, America, the Pacific and every other part of the earth*</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">&lt;■ The following is from a reader's letter published in </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek,</span><span class="font22"> April 12: “A lot of people in this country are in a state of terror about what might happen if a bomb fell on them* At the end of World War II, when Japan was out for the count, we dropped two atomic bombs, instantly killing hundreds of thousands of noncombatants and bring’ ing about the death of hundreds more by radiation cancer* Some time later we moved the natives of Bikini away from their homes. Those that were too old or Infirm to walk were hauled into ships by cranes. We then obliterated what had been their lifelong homes and the resting places of their dead; those places that were to them just what our homes, churches, and synagogues are to us* Now we have terrified Japan again and infected 23 men with a dose of radiation that might possibly lead to a death more horrible than any by the most dreaded of natural diseases and caused fear and financial loss to thousands. Isn’t it about time that some of us stopped worrying about what might be done to us and started worrying about what we are doing to others?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">FROM PAGAN CULTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">TO MODERN SECTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awak«!'<sup>f</sup> correspondent in the Nethedondi</span></p>
<p><span class="font32">T</span><span class="font23">HE Dutchman is not slow but cautious*</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">An expression that he readily admits is applicable to himself is, “Wait and see which way the cat jumps.” He means by this that he is not too anxious to snap at something new, that he prefers to cautiously observe the trend first and then decide. The universally known traditional clothing representing various sections of the Netherlands proves this true. It shows the Dutchman rather reluctant to break away from the old. This is even more apparent in the customs upheld by the people. The Netherianders’ forefathers were Germanic and many of the Germanic religious rites and practices were sustained by the various Dutch ‘/Christian” denominations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Since that time, in the distant past, when their forefathers departed from under Noah’s patriarchal rulership they have adopted many customs and practices, forgetting, however, the true worship which their communal father Noah exercised. None brought the pure worship with them into the Netherlands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Upon the moor of Drenthe are the surviving traces of the oldest inhabitants of this land, the Hunebeds. According to</span></p>

<p><span class="font23">archaeologist Dr. J. H. Holwerda, Jr.<sub>F </sub>these must have been built about 1200 B.C, If this is true, then this all took place when the nation of Israel was under the jurisdiction and leadership of the judges. The Hunebed culture testifies to the prevalence of demon worship. Just as caves and tombs were used in Egypt and Greece by the “death cult,” so the natives of the lowlands gathered large chunks of stone and built tombs. Their concern for the dead had its origin in their belief in the immortality of the human soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In the course of time the Netherlands became the home of the Germanic tribes. Their dependence upon animals for food accentuated the undue importance attached to the fertility of animals. The fertility cult played a prominent part<sup>+</sup>in their lives. Plastic figures were found with skulls on top. In this way the worshipers believed they maintained power over the animals, that is, they possessed the right to kill them and at the same time to ensure their preservation. They worshiped many gods of earth, water and air. Their supreme deity was Wodan. In addition, there were numerous other gods that personified natural phenomena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In south Netherlands, on Walcheren island, a so-called “holy stone” was discovered bearing the image of the goddess Nehelennia, From an inscription it appears that she was worshiped during the period of Roman ruler* ship. The fortunate paid their vows to her. Also prominent in the religion of this Germanic tribe were trees. They had their “holy oak,” which,</span></p>

<p><span class="font23">according to Tacitus, became a divine symbol preserved in the forest.—</span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Winkler Prins Encyclopaedia,</span><span class="font23"> page 408.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Near the end of the seventh century there ensued a systematic &quot;Christianizing” of the Netherlands. Through a declaration of Pope Gregorius I Anglo-Saxon missionaries were encouraged to assume or adopt the customs and morals of this Germanic tribe and to give them Christian names. In other words, the same heathen customs were carried on in the name of Christianity. Even in this twentieth century there are many ancient pagan practices still in vogue. Substituting for Wodan’s pagan priests are the priests of the Roman Catholic Church, who patronize and bless these pagan fertility rites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Paganism in the Name of Christianity</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">On December 23, 1952, a Dutch radio broadcast told its listeners that the celebration of Christmas is of pagan origin; that candlelight and the ringing of bells for the purpose of dispersing evil spirits are also of pagan origin. Professor Schrij-nen, contemporary educator at the Episcopal College in Roermond, Netherlands, declares that in the seventh century at the feast of “Our Beloved Lady Lightmass” Pope Sergius had consecrated the wax candles in order to substitute the torchlight processions honoring the goddess Ceres, The halos that adorn the heads of the idols of modern-day &quot;saints” are adopt-, ed signs of paganism. The images of the old fertility goddesses have now become the images of Mary and other Catholic saints. The month of May, marked by the budding of nature, was for the ancients a month dedicated to the goddess of fertility. Today this month is dedicated to Mary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Sacrificing of animals is also not entirely extinct. In Diest, Belgium, cows are sacrificed to the honor of St. Brigitta, and in Meeuwen and Limburg pigs’ heads and chickens are sacrificial victims. In Korten-bosch a pound of butter is laid upon the altar for curing sick animals.—</span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">De Katho-lieke Encyclopaedia,</span><span class="font23"> page 156.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In the rurals of South Limburg, during the &quot;feast of our blessed woman's ascension,” the villagers’ children dedicate themselves to the church. These are provided with a supply of herbs attached to a bouquet. The herbs are blessed by the priest. Then when a thunderstorm breaks out all one needs to do is to take this bundle of </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">kroetwosch</span><span class="font23"> and burn a few twigs therefrom. The smoke is supposed to be a remarkable lightning arrester. In Kennemer-land the farmers try to safeguard their property from lightning by walking through their farm buildings sprinkling “holy water” everywhere with a palm branch. In Flanders, Belgium, every St. Stephen’s day the priest goes off on a visit of the farms, where he raps the cows with a mallet. This procedure is called &quot;Stephen-ing.” In this manner the lucky cows receive a blessing from the priest. All these superstitions originate, not with Christ, but deep in paganism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Carnival time is an exceedingly happy time in south Netherlands. Mothers bake pancakes, cracknels and fritters for the feast. The youth dress up in gay costumes. But here again the feast originates with the ancient fertility rites. The banqueting has to do with worshiping the sun god, and even the evening fires recall old pagan cults. In Meerveldhoven near Eindhoven the goddess of fertility appears in the form of Mary, hanging on a dry oak in front of the village church. In Belgium images of “Our Beloved Lady” are hung up on oaks, and, according to M. Utrecht Dresselhuis, this too appears to be a remnant of worship rendered Germanic images. The oak represented the divinity, earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In southern Limburg the fertility goddess is also named St. Brigida, patron</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">saint of cattle and horses. Every year on the second Saturday after passover she receives a May pole placed in front of the chapel, which is called St., Brigidatree. In Fosses, Belgium, St. Brigida has a chapel that is opened but once a year, the first Sunday in May. For this occasion she receives a visit from pilgrims who are all provided with a white stick that previously had been blessed by a priest. With this stick they touch the three saints, St. Brigida and two others. The stick is believed to be now endowed with the power of healing. If an animal becomes ill or diseased, striking it with this stick is supposed to aid its recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Both Protestant North and Catholic South are fond of St. Nicholas. Behind the whiskers of the &quot;jolly good fellow,” who is especially popular with children, hides in reality the Germanic chief god Wodan, the Wild Horseman. The children today offer St. Nicholas straw, which was earlier an offering for the pagan god Wodan. The chimney served earlier as a link between man and the spirits. So when the modem St. Nicholas descends through a chimney he links himself with the nature of his real predecessor, the Germanic god. After the Reformation St. Nicholas was given a hard time in the Netherlands. The reformers saw in this celebration unlawful idolatry. But the people kept on venerating him and later the Protestants became reconciled and dubbed this celebration a harmless feast for the tots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Early Christians were instructed to keep only one celebration, and that was the memorial of Christ’s death. The apostle Paul stated that he “received from the Lord that which I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was going to be harided over took a loaf and, after giving thanks, he broke it and said: ‘This means my body which is in your behalf. Keep doing this in remembrance of me/ ” No other days, months or years were they commanded to keep. Never did Christianity parade around in pagan garb. The early Christians would not tolerate pagan customs or practices regardless of how they were colored. Paul warned those interested in pure worship of the only true God, saying: &quot;No; but I say that the things which the nations sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, and not to God, and I do not want you to become sharers with the demons. You cannot be drinking the cup of Jehovah and the cup of demons; you cannot be partaking of ’the table of Jehovah’ and the table of demons.” —1 Corinthians 11:23, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">24;</span><span class="font18"> 10:20, 21, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Despite the strong hold of paganism on modern cults, pure worship of Jehovah continues to expand in this land. The cautious Dutch have seen which way the ‘cat has jumped,’ and the righteous are favoring the kingdom of God. God’s Word, the Bible, has freed them from religious superstitions and the practice of demonism. They no longer need the superficially aroused festive mood to make them happy. Their happiness is continual because it rests in Jehovah, the only true God, and in the good news of his kingdom, which is a perpetual feast. “The cheerful man enjoys a perpetual feast.”—Proverbs 15:15, </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer.

<p><span class="font23">proves that climate alone is not responsible for the desolation in these areas. In northern Syria over a hundred cities once found</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font32">I</span><span class="font23">FOUR earth was meant to be a paradise, as some claim, what, then, has happened to the land along the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, once suggestive of the Garden of Eden; rich lands, whose people lived well, built flourishing cities, established governments and developed arts and culture? Today that elaborate civilization is lost under mounds of drifting sand. Why? Where is the rich brown earth that once covered the limestone hills of Syria and the plains of North America? And where are the immense forests that enriched the lands of the Mediterranean and Palestine? What provoked the vast wastelands .of China and Asia? And why were the ancient cities of North Africa buried beneath a sea of blowing sand? Most of these lands once maintained fabulous empires, enormous cities and huge populations? Are climatic changes to be blamed for their disappearance? True, nature played its part, but nature’s forces alone are not entirely to blame*</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Recorded history shows that there has been only a negligible change of climate in China during the last 3,000 years, Syria, Asia and Palestine have precisely the same weather they had in Bible times when those nations flourished. Testifying to this fact grows a group of Lebanon cedars that have stood untouched for many centuries because men believed them to be sacred. Had the weather changed severely means of sustaining themselves; today among vast wastelands only their skeletons protrude above the denuded earth. In North Africa an olive grove encircled with desolation has stood since the days of early Rome, Their productive condition today is living proof that weathef conditions had little or nothing to do with the devastation that surrounds them. Without doubt, nature played its parts in desolating these areas, but man himself was intimately involved. In what way?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The surface of the cultivable areas of our earth is, or rather, in its natural state was, covered with a layer of productive soil. It is a most vital machinery, because upon this medium all life on earth depends. Its average thickness over the whole earth is no more than a foot. When the soil goes, men go. The earth becomes as lifeless as the moon. The soil is referred to as living, because it harbors an infinite quantity of minute living forms of plant life known as bacteria and minute animals known as protozoa. These are nature’s chemists. They convert the fallen limbs of trees and leaves of plants to rich topsoil. Without these microscopic creatures the soil becomes dead and barren. Their life has been provided for by Jehovah God the Creator, who in his infinite wisdom delicately balanced the relationship of all things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Men in relationship to the earth were to be not only benefactors and consumers but</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">these trees would not have survived, which also cultivators and protectors of the soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">They were to work in understanding with nature, rather than in conflict. By thus co-operating this great delicate system of things created by God would work to the benefit of man and to his everlasting blessing. Rains would fall at the proper seasons, crops would grow luxuriously, the soil would maintain its richness and stability and men would prosper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Even the Israelites who were to take possession of the Promised Land, “a land,” as Moses stated, “that Jehovah your God is caring for,” were to abide by the laws of nature. The Creator provided that one full year in every period of seven the land was to rest: nothing should be planted, nor sown, nor should the soil be worked. This would allow' the soil to recuperate, build up its productive strength and regain its normal stability. The soil was not to be selfishly exploited. It was not to be a means to wealth, but a mode of life. The object was to live on the land and not off of it. But selfish men of the past as well as those of the present fail to recognize this principle. They see the soil as a means to wealth instead of a mode of life. Their objective is to live off the land rather than on it. Under mismanagement nature reacts violently, even to the point of expelling man from the soil. When the nation of Israel failed to give the land its proper rest God evicted the Israelites and the land was not worked for seventy years, enforcing his Sabbath law upon the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Nature’s Course Vindicated</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The wastelands of China, India, Asia and Africa are not to be blamed on nature, because nature’s laws are set. Man must learn to co-operate with these laws. The interdependence of all elements is a set law. The sun, for example, makes all life on earth possible. It is responsible for our rainfall and vegetative growth. The sun is nature's free “irrigation system.” It governs the hydrologic cycle—the movement of water from the air to the land and eventually back to the air, usually by means of evaporation from rivers, lakes and oceans. It manages to soak up some 80,000 cubic miles of water each year by this method and then it returns it by rainfall. If the sun were negligent the least bit, rivers would cease to flow, lands would freeze or dry up, plant and animal life would perish. Both the sun and water are essential parts of nature’s machinery. Without them no life on earth would be possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">While an abundance of water falls on earth it does not always fall in habitable areas. To maintain a regular and adequate water supply the Creator prepared extensive forests in watershed areas, where the streams and rivers have their sources. These are natural dams and an ingenious method of draining water in. a regulated flow to habitable regions. For example: When it rains, the forest duff, a vegetable mulch, absorbs the rain water and releases it downward slowly by gravitation. The vegetation shades the soil and slows down evaporation. Roots bind the rich clay tightly together, permitting none to be carried away with water. Erosion is brought to a standstill. Rivers in their natural state ran clean. The open plains and prairies were provided with a thick sod on which grasses grew waist-high, shielding the soil from blistering winds, torrential rains and a scorching sun. The rich prairie soil held moisture over long periods of time. Dust bowls were unknown under these natural conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Upsetting Nature’s lialanee</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Water scientists have proved that when nature is left undisturbed there is a “natural balance between the re-charge of water and the discharge of water.&quot; But what has man done? He entered these watershed areas and indiscriminately cut</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">down the trees and brush; with his plow he ventured to the prairies and turned un* der the grasslands for bigger money profits; and sections unsuitable for cultivation he overgrazed. He disrupted or destroyed the hydrologic cycle, the natural water control system, with devastating results to himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">With the natural protection of the soil gone, the mulch of vegetation accumulation begins to disappear. The uncontrolled rain water rushes downhill carrying productive topsoil with it to streams and rivers. The fine silt and clay cause rivers to rise. Small streams once beneficent to organized life become menacing torrents. The hills stripped of their trees become gashed with fissures and gaping with chasms. Grasslands exposed to the sun and wind lose their stability and the wind carries away the lifeless soil. Dust bowls form. It has been proved that with the disappearance of topsoil and natural vegetation the effectiveness of rainfall is permanently reduced. And while erosion continues the effective rainfall decreases until the land is reduced to an arid waste, Man is forced to irrigate his land and to pump water to towns and cities, with the result that he pumps out more water from rivers and lakes than the clouds bring back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In the United States in 1948 “the pumping of water from ground water sources had jumped to 20 billion gallons every single day from only 10 billion ten years before that,” And the greater part of this water is not fed to the land but to industry, “After the Korean War started, the excessive pumping of water all over the country further weakened this essential natural resource. For example, in Louisville, Kentucky, in making chemicals, synthetic rubber, etc,, it was found after the Korean War started that the industrial plants were pumping from along the Ohio River basin the tidy sum of 60 million gallons of water every single day.” One manufacturer In upstate New York uses, for example, a total of 25,000,000 gallons of water each day. More than 260,000 gallons of water are consumed in the manufacture of every ton of steel. This excessive pumping has caused many large rivers to run dry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The Rio Grande was a navigable stream fifty years ago, steamboats went upstream regularly as far as Rio Grande City and sometimes even as far as Laredo. Today you can walk across the river bed without getting your feet wet. The municipal and industrial use of water in Texas has increased almost thirty times what it was in 1890, and that together with increased irrigation has caused the river to dry up. To further aggravate the situation are man’s industries. Studies by Dr. Gilbert Plass of Johns Hopkins University reveal that heat is greater in the vicinity of industry, thus causing a rapid evaporation of moisture in the air. He found that industries add six billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. And he asserts that the location of industry means less rainfall and more cloud cover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">It is quite obvious that greed and selfishness, plus misunderstanding and mismanagement, have brought about the wastelands, the “creeping deserts,” of the world. The natural deserts, which the Creator made, have a distinct beauty, and he gives his word that he will cause these to blossom like a rose. But man-made wastelands are weird oceans of desolation without meaning. Even with present knowledge these desolations increase. The Yellow River transports an annual load of 2,500 million tons of soil to the sea. American conservationists estimate that over “three billion tons of soil material are washed or blown away each year.” If this soil were spread out in a blanket twelve inches thick, it would cover more than 1,500,000 acres. It takes man but a moment to cut down a</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">tree that would preserve some of this soil, but it takes nature from fifty to a hundred years to replace it. It takes nature, under the most favorable conditions, including a good cover of trees, grass or other protective vegetation, anywhere from 300 to 1,000 years or more to build a single inch of topsoil. Man through carelessness can remove that much in a year or even in a single day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Van </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Not a &quot;Rain Maker”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">To overcome some of their blunders men have tried to make productive soil and rain. But so far they have found productive soil impossible to make in any large quantities. The best they have been able to do is to make fertilizers. But these are supplements and no more. They merely aid in restoring certain elements to depleted soils. As “rain makers,” here, too, they have proved themselves to be miserable failures. </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Look</span><span class="font18"> magazine staff writer William H. White shows that the matter of making it. rain is not a simple one. He writes: &quot;Strange as it seems in this age of atomic research and miracle drugs, science does not know how it rains. Meteorologists have found that a water cloud is composed of tiny droplets—so small that 10,000 of them could fit on the head of a pin. Raindrops, however, are roughly two million times larger. Thus, for rain to fall, two million cloud droplets must somehow be brought together to form one raindrop.” Instead of being “rain makers” W. Baxter says they are “rain stealers.” They hasten precipitation by chemical methods, causing moisture to fall on an immediate area when nature itself would have carried the moisture to a more distant spot. Meteorol*. ogist Irving P. Krick admitted that they “cannot make rain unless it’s going to rain anyway, but if the right clouds are there, we can increase the amount of rain.” However, he said, “we can’t whistle up rain clouds when we want them.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">To outsmart nature man has built mammoth dams and irrigation projects. But meteorologist Tikhomirov says, according to one authority, that the use “of the waters of the Volga for dams and irrigation means that the Volga has less water to contribute to the Caspian Sea, so that the area suffers what the irrigated area gains. In effect, then, it is something like the work of the ‘rain makers’ who really only ‘steal’ precipitation from the area where nature intended it to fall and send it elsewhere. We | America] are finding out the ‘hard way’ that, by damming up rivers like the Colorado River, and using it for irrigation, other areas suffer.” So, nature leaves man pretty much in a dilemma. Scientists who were out to outsmart nature have outsmarted themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">In drought areas men bewail the explosion of atom bombs and brand them responsible for the drop in rainfall. Others believe that a few atom explosions would create rain. But the truth is that “even a moderate rainstorm . . . releases energy at a rate equivalent to several hundred atom bombs a minute. And the great dust storms of the Thirties raised clouds with a billion times the dust concentration of an atomic cloud without perceptible effect on rainfall anywhere in the country.... Close study of test blasts shows that they'do not even produce local rainstorms.” It is quite apparent that only God can make a tree and only God can make it rain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Soil </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Increases Its Fertility</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The experience Western European farmers have had with their soil proves the soil durable and lasting if managed properly. European farmers have for centuries been tied to the soil by necessity or affection. They regarded the land as an inheritance to be handed on to the next generation in</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">at least as good condition as when they received it. Therefore the soil was well cared for. In spite of being subjected to the most intensive cultivation in history the soil has enormously increased its fertility, to such an extent that today “the agricultural production of even such a small and industrial country as Britain equals in value that of all Canada.” This demonstrates that under proper management and care not only man but also the soil flourishes. It argues that if the lands of China had been properly cared for man-made deserts or wastelands would not be. The forests of Asia, Syria and Mesopotamia would still be standing, acting as natural watersheds, slowly feeding waters to their fertile valleys. Like the redwoods of the High Sierras and Olympic Park, the cedars and forests of the Mediterranean area and Palestine would add their beauty and service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">With the virgin forests stripped from the earth and much of her topsoil exhausted or washed away, man must turn to God. God made the soil. He can make rain. He makes the trees grow and the flowers bud. This earth is his, he created it, it belongs to him. He has promised to make it a paradise. How will he do it? By and through his King Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Under his kingdom rule the land will be properly distributed as it was when Israel entered the Promised Land. There will be no great land barons around to hog the land and crowd the common people into smoky cities. Families will have entrusted to their care a piece of land to beautify and make productive. It will be tax-free. No one will take it away as long as it is properly tended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The hills, no doubt, will again flourish with stately trees and resume their job of controlling the waters that fall from heaven. The plains will be covered with grass on which animals will pasture. The cultivated soil will be guarded from erosion, Jehovah gives his word that he will make it rain at the proper seasons and that the land will prosper. Want will disappear off the land. There will be no poor. As the population increases and spreads over the earth, so it will be beautified. At the close of a thousand years men and angels will witness a paradise earth in full vindication of the One who said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">“For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven, and retumeth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, and giveth seed to the sower and bread to the eater; so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.” “For thus saith Jehovah that created the heavens, the God that formed the earth and made it, that established it and created it not a waste, that formed it to be inhabited : I am Jehovah; and there is none else.” —Isaiah 55:10, 11; 45:18, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Why the Growth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">♦ In discussing what New Zealand's census showed about that land's religion the Auckland </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font22"> said, December 31: &quot;The increase in Immigration is reflected in some of the totals. The Dutch Reformed Church, for example, had only 37 followers in New Zealand in 1945, but by 1951 it could claim 264. No such simple reason can be found for the increase of Jehovah’s witnesses from 650 to 1756 in the same period/' The reason for this growth was a better one than immigration. It is that many New Zealanders have, like the young Presbyterian who is told of on page 206 of Jehovah’s witnesses’ 1954 </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font22"> learned more about the Bible right in their homes in a few weeks’ study with Jehovah’s witnesses than in years of going to the various churches.</span></p>

<p><span class="font30">T</span><span class="font18">ORONTO now takes its place among the cities of the world whose inhabitants travel the subterranean. Sophisticated Torontonians can be whisked from place to place in underground style. British-built subway ears can be shuttling north and south under Toronto’s Yonge Street. Downtown traffic of this congested metropolis can be stepped up from its present snail’s pace as Canada’s first subway makes its debut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Interest of the citizenry in this project has been very keen; “sidewalk superintendents” have watched the progress and patiently endured torn-up streets and rerouted traffic. Automobile ownership in Toronto has reached the amazing density of one car for less than four persons. With an estimated 200,000 cars daily competing with slow-moving streetcars on narrow streets, there is little wonder that traffic painfully inches along during “rush hours.” Provoked commuters are prepared to blame everything and anything on a transportation system that “rushes” them home at a pace little better than walking. The solution ? A subterranean route to relieve the overtaxed surface system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Sample digging for the Yonge Street subway first took place in 1944, although construction did not start on a large scale until 1949. Con-</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font15">Canada</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font18">struction of the project has extended over five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The major problem confronting engineers was sinking a horizontal shaft 4.57 miles long through the heart of this bustling metropolis. Toronto Transportation Commission decided it was more practical to have the subway as close to the surface as possible for economical and convenient transfer to the streetcars and buses on the surface. This brought them face to face with a maze of gas mains, sewers, water lines and telephone services. No small problem to avoid damage and keep these utilities in operation!</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The method of excavation used is known as “cut-and-cover,” being just as the name suggests. As a preliminary step trenches are dug along the edges of the street to locate utilities. Long steel piles are then driven down into the earth at regular intervals along these trenches. Earth-moving machinery is then brought in and the road is excavated between the rows of piles. This excavation is carried down to a respectable depth so that equipment like power shovels and drag buckets can work under a temporary' decking of twelve-by-twelve timbers. When the timbers are in place the normal traffic is resumed and the balance of the work finished out of sight of surface traffic, to the chagrin of would-be sidewalk superintendents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Mechanical behemoths</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">moved in on the jon ana proceeaea to gouge out a big hole in Toronto's main street, excavating some 1,710,000 cubic yards. A small mountain of earth! Part of the hole was filled in with some 400,000 tons of concrete, which required more than one million bags of cement. A whole “forest” of lumber, fifteen million board feet, was used in the project! The road is supported and concrete reinforced by nearly 30,000 tons of steel. Months grind into years; power shovels gnaw away at the earth; trucks shuttle back and forth; stations crop up; cars- arrive from England; and Toronto’s citizens watch with close interest as the subway steadily takes shape. By completion more than fifty million dollars will have been poured into the “big hole” on Yonge Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The finished subway presents a very clean and modern appearance. The fifth on this continent, it has benefited from the experience of other cities. The starting point on the south is located opposite the main railway depot, Union Station, From there it stretches north, swerves under buildings, sometimes underground and sometimes open-cut, and reaches its northern terminal 4.57 miles from its origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Of the twelve stations along the route some are located underground, others are separate modernistic structures on the surface. Colored glass was adopted for the modem interior walls because of its “public proof” qualities. Subway walls take a beating from those who seem to be seized with an uninhibited urge to display their artistic skills; this easily cleaned surface will help workmen keep them free from scribbled messages and mustachioed ladies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The subway cars, built by an experienced English firm, are connected in pairs to form two-car units operating in off-peak hours. As traffic increases additional two-car units can be added and a maximum train oi eight cars (four two-car units) can be accommodated at the 500-foot plat* fonns. The operation of eight-car trains can accommodate some 40,000 passengers per hour in each direction. Maximum speed of an empty train on level track will be fifty miles per hour and it is hoped that an average speed of twenty miles per hour will be maintained throughout the length of the track during rush-hour operation. This will be at least twice as fast as the present surface system. Safety is a feature that has received considerable attention. If an operator fails to stop at a red signal a mechanism automatically brings the train to a halt</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Toronto subway riders are not subjected to the deafening, boiler-factory clatter generally asso ci ate d with u ndergr ound travel. Every rattle and vibration is usually amplified to ear-splitting volume by the long, hollow tunnels, but the Toronto Transportation Commission engineers have given the subway special treatment to minimize the noise. Under the tie plates on which the tracks are mounted are placed rubber pads which act as cushions for the rails and insulate the tunnel from the rattle and clatter of the underground rolling stock. Even the cars themselves have sounddeadening material in the body, to reduce noise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Whether or not this subterranean shuttle service will be adequate to carry away the volume of traffic that funnels into Toronto and bogs down on its Yonge Street will remain to be seen. Even before its operation the Toronto Transportation Commission envisioned a 10-year plan for a network of subways, costing more than 113 million dollars, to supplement the Yonge Street subway. The Yonge Street subway is far from the world’s biggest, but it does hope to earn the reputation of being the cleanest and quietest subway on the North American continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Right to Teach Bible Upheld</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awake!&quot; corraipondent in Italy</span></p>
<p><span class="font31">B</span><span class="font17">IKE many other towns and villages in Cath-olie Italy, Loreto Aprutino, located in the region of Abruzzo in central Italy, is steeped in religious customs that, though called “Christian” by the worshipers, actually stem from paganism. One of these customs, openly practiced in Loreto Aprutino, is described for us by a popular weekly magazine known as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">La Settimana Enigmistwa,</span><span class="font17"> issue of November 1, 1952.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">€, On page five of this particular issue a picture of this town of 8,000 inhabitants is shown and the following question is asked: “What strange custom is practiced here?” Then in a separate paragraph on the same page the answer is given: “The day of the feast of the patron saint, San Zopito, an ox mounted by a child dressed in white is brought into the church. The ox is made to kneel before the statue of the saint. From the excrement of the ox the farmers receive their hopes for the future harvest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">C, Bible truth would free these people from such false superstitions and pagan customs. But in Loreto Aprutino, as elsewhere, there are a handful of unscrupulous individuals who are not anxious to have sincere people break away from such pagan rites. They prefer to keep the people in Ignorance of God’s Word and allow them to practice pagan customs as long as they remain “good Catholics.&quot; These religious pastors not only fail to provide the people with sound Bible teachings, but they even oppose those who do bring Bible truths lo the people, namely, Jehovah's witnesses. €, Such opposition was manifested in Loreto Aprutino when the “gentlemen of the cloth” put pressure on the police to stop the work of Jehovah's witnesses in this locality. A </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">briga-iliere</span><span class="font17"> was sent out to get the witnesses, who were tracked down to a private home while explaining the Scriptures to some people of good will. The two witnesses who were preaching the good news of God’s kingdom from house to house, even as Jesus preached, were two young ladies. According to the false charge brought against them by the police </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">brigadiers,</span><span class="font17"> they were accused of distributing literature in “public places,” &quot;exalting their religion (Jehovah’s witnesses) without author-g ization.” In cases of misdemeanor the judge g may apply a fine even without a hearing, if it 3 appears that the law has been violated. On g the other hand, the accused have the right to S a trial and can refuse to pay the fine. The j two witnesses were fined 1,000 lire (about</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">$1.50) plus the costs of court. But they refused</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">B to pay and demanded a trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">g &lt;1, The two young ladies knew that the § charges against them were false and that the 5 law of God as well as the highest law of the § land gives them the right to carry on their S house-to-house work without a license from 5 the police. So, even though it would cost them J more to request the assistance of a lawyer, = Jehovah's witnesses prefer to do this rather = than pay an unjust fine. The principles in-E volved and the liberties to be defended are of E far more value, and the freedom that God’s = Word would give to the honest people of Lots reto Aprutino cannot be measured in mone-E tary values.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">=</span><span class="font17"> &lt;L After a number of months the court trial = of the two witnesses was held and the judge s weighed the charges and the evidence. It did </span><span class="font17" style="text-decoration:underline;">E</span><span class="font17"> not take him long to make a decision, and ± this time in favor of the freedom of religion. E It was a victory for true worship! On May 5, g 1953, the judge supported his decision with g the following explanation: &quot;The activity of E the accused is fully lawful, and it is to be 5 noted that authorization from the police is E necessary only when written matter is dis- ■ = tributed in public places. Certainly such are E not to be considered the private dwellings g where the accused had carried on their propa-= ganda.&quot; (The word “propaganda&quot; in Italian = does not carry the distasteful meaning that E the English word has.) The two witnesses of = Jehovah were declared innocent because their E activity was within the rights granted to E every citizen of the Italian Republic. Conse-= quently the good work goes on in Loreto E Aprutino. Those who want to break away E from superstition and pagan customs can do = so by coming over to Jehovah’s' side of pure ± worship proclaimed by his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">g &lt;1, Decide for yourself what will do the people E of Loreto Aprutino more good: Catholic teach-= ings that compromise with paganism or Bible = teachings that sweep away all falsehoods.</span></p>

<p><span class="font32">T</span><span class="font22">HE Bible Is an inexhaustible storehouse of knowledge and wisdom- To the extent that a person is familiar with it and understands it, to that extent he will find in it so much truth, beauty and comfort that he will not be easily disturbed by the attacks made upon it by “scientists,” agnostics, deists, etc. Such a person also knows that while the Bible does not pretend to be a book on materialistic science, it is nevertheless scientific in the truest sense of the word. Another instance in which the Bible has been proved to be truly scientific even though it went counter to prevailing opinion concerns the serpent's ability to be charmed. Concerning this the New York </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font22"> January 21, 1954, had the following to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">€, “Are Snakes 'Charmed' by Music? Cartoonists often show a monstrous reptile weaving to and fro in front of a snake charmer who is fingering a musical instrument- Zoologists have scoffed. Snakes do not have a highly developed sense of hearing, some said. Others have maintained that snakes are stone deaf, How could serpents be 'charmed' by music? they ask.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">(I “Support for the effectiveness of snake charming, and the auditory acuteness of serpents in general, appeared last week, in, of all places, the </span><span class="font22" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font22"> of the American Medical Association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&lt;r &quot;Dr. David I, Macht, research pharmacologist of the Mount Sinai Hospital in Baltimore, is one of the world's leading authorities on cobra snake venom. (Cobra venom is an accepted medication, in blood disorders, for instance.) Dr. Macht reported that in working with cobras and cobra venom he became acquainted with a number of Hindu physicians, well educated, and from different parts of India. All agreed that cobras respond to some musical tones, from musical pipes or fifes. Some forms of music excite the animals more than other forms, the physicians reported. Indian children, playing in the dark in the countryside, are even warned not to sing lest their sounds attract cobras, he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">&lt;1 &quot;Dr. Macht commented that Shakespeare, who repeatedly referred to serpents as deaf (as in 'King Henry VI,’ part 2, act 3, scene 2: &quot;What, art thou, like the adder waxen deaf?’) merely repeated a common misunderstanding. On the other hand, Dr. Macht said, the psalmist was right who implied conversely, in Psalm 58, Verse 5 [4 also! that serpents can hear: 'Their poison is like the poison of serpents; they are like the deaf adder that stop-peth her ear; which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.' &lt;■ “Contrary to the claims of some naturalists, Dr* Macht said, snakes are 'charmed' by sounds, not by movements of the charmer. Revise the textbooks, the physicians recommended.”</span></p>

One day last October the python ambitiously decided to swallow 4he elephant and, seizing the animal by the hind leg, moored itself to a tree and began a fight to the death* The elephant, of course, had no intention of being swallowed without a fight, and for hours the two struggled, smashing fiat the nearby undergrowth. Matters came to a deadlock when the python finally &quot;swallowed” the elephant's leg. The elephant could no longer move and the reptile could swallow no more* Villagers from miles around had watched the long struggle, and some now stepped in to bring the ambitious python to an unhappy end, hacking him to pieces and freeing the elephant* Seventeen years ago villagers in the same forest are reported to have watched a three-day tug of war between one of these reptiles and a full-grown elephant.

<p><span class="font32">T</span><span class="font23">IE marvelous human nervous system, from a structural standpoint, is divided into three great parts* These are (1) the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, (2) the peripheral nervous system, which brings impressions to the brain and directs the muscles, and (3) the autonomic nervous system, which regulates such bodily functions as breathing, the circulation of the blood and digestion*</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In this article, however, we are ment, facial expressions and hundreds, yes, thousands of other stimuli, but the interpretation is made by a small portion of the brain in the occipital lobe*</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The brain also interprets what we hear* The external ear and the ear canal collect or funnel the sound waves and these are amplified by the eardrum and the bony mechanism of the middle ear* But it is the auditory portion of the brain that interprets what these sound waves actually mean* The thou</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">concerned with only the central nervous system and a few of its many functions, chiefly how it is affected by the sensory nerves that bring the outside impressions in to it. As we contemplate this marvelous mechanism and its structure and function, even the most factual scientist is forced to recognize the wisdom, power and majesty of the Creator* The great Architect, Jehovah, has protected this most vital of all organs by a masterpiece of armor plate second to none in the human body, the skull* What a wise provision this is! For here residing in this inconspicuous organ are the sources of the functions that go to make up every human activity. Yes, the functions of the brain spell life itself, with all its variables and complexities* The brain is the great receptor of stimuli from the outside world. We see with our eyes, but it is the brain that interprets what we see: the various colors, the brilliance of autumn foliage, the variety of colors of flowers, the colors of sky and water, of the nearby blades of grass or the purple of distant mountain peaks. The eye detects movesands of different sounds of human voice, the songs of the birds, the musical strains of the violin, the noise of metropolitan traffic—whatever the sound—the human brain unerringly determines its source, implications and meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Have you ever stopped to consider the hundreds of different aromas or odors that we experience daily? These aromas are carried to the nostrils in the air we breathe* They are picked up by the organs of smell, the olfactory nerve ends in the back of the nostrils* These stimuli are then transmitted to the brain by way of the olfactory tract. Here again it is the brain that interprets what the aroma is* Is it the fragrance of a rose, the perfume of the night-blooming jasmine, the pungent scent of musk, the exotic odor of an oriental perfume or the odor of burning leaves? Yes, it is commonly said that your nose knows, but actually it is your brain that knows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The same analogy exists in the sense of taste. In fact, these two special senses, taste and smell, are so closely related that they are sometimes indistinguishable. For</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">example, we frequently think that we smell a food that we are eating, when actually we are tasting it, or vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">At the back of the tongue are numerous small, round, raised-up protrusions called taste buds. These are arranged in groups, forming an inverted V. They are the end organs of taste. Actually, a minute chemical reaction takes place to bring about the stimulus of taste. Moisture is necessary for the completion of this reaction and that is why there is no sense of taste in a completely dry mouth. Of course, this chemical reaction varies with the many different substances which we take into our mouths. The taste buds receive the stimuli, but the gustatory nerve transmits the impulse and the brain receives and interprets it. Here once more it is the brain that knows whether we are eating a luscious apple or an acrid onion, a delicious peach or an astringent persimmon, the sweetness of honey or the sourness of vinegar, the smooth mellow flavor of a ripe banana or the tart sour taste of a lemon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The fifth and final sense is the sense of touch. How difficult it is to describe the many variations of this important sense! We recognize by our fingertips whether an object is smooth or rough; whether it is hard or soft, sharp or dull, round or square, hot or cold, heavy or light; we determine its position relative to other objects, and whether it is stationary or mobile. These are only a very few of the many stimuli that are received by the end organs of touch, located in the skin all over the body, and transmitted to the brain for interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">The Human Brain at</span><span class="font18"> JForA-</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">So we see that the brain is the great receptor of stimuli from the outside world. After it receives these stimuli and interprets them, does its function stop there? No, it really only begins at this point. The brain not only receives and interprets these stimuli, but analyzes them, catalogues them, compares them with previous stimuli, memorizes them and acts accordingly. The composite of all these various functions results in reason and intelligence. This is the brain at work, and the brain at work is the mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The mind of man differs widely from that of the lower animals. He has a better memory and power of reasoning and is equipped to analyze and catalogue his various sensations by referring to his great storehouse of knowledge, his memory centers and pathways. This produces what is called experience and enables man to come up with wise decisions and intelligent answers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">These are the attributes of man’s mental processes, which make him higher in the scale of creation than the lower animals. These are the mental factors that endow man with the divine attributes, wisdom, justice, love and power; and which attributes set man apart from all other earthly creation, a creature made in Jehovah’s own image, having the same divine attributes as Jehovah has and being able to exercise these attributes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">But you will note the word “able” is used here. Not all men are able to exercise these divine attributes. Training, mental training, is necessary. Just as the athlete must train his muscles to bring himself to the peak of physical improvement, so it is necessary to train one’s mind to be able to exercise one’s highest mental faculties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">To Act Intelligently</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Because of a lack of proper mental training the untrained individual finds it difficult to act wisely or intelligently. And some persons even allow their mental processes to take a downward course. This is particularly noticeable in the world today. We see all about us those whose minds are</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">so warped by wrong thought training that they are constantly pursuing certain unhealthy patterns of thinking. To illustrate, we see individuals constantly thinking in terms of self; every thought, every conversation, every motive, reverts to self. They are the self-centered introverts of this degenerate old-world society. Then we see others whose minds are continually focused on matters of sex. Their minds are like a compasls, which always points in one direction. They revel in filth and become slaves to their own unhealthy states of mind. And finally, we see those minds that always think in terms of greed and money. They are the dollar worshipers. Their foremost motivating thought is, ‘How much is there in it for me?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">But proper mental training can and does bring beautiful thoughts, inspiring thoughts, elevating mental experiences. Just as careful training enables the musician to execute a beautiful, harmonious production of Ludwig Beethoven or Franz Lizt, so the properly trained mind may imitate the wisdom, justice and love of the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">One is never able to reach the pinnacle of success by virtue of self-training. He must have an instructor and a textbook. He must diligently apply himself to his task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In like manner, the individual seeking to improve his mental processes should select the most competent Instructor, the greatest Teacher of all time, Jehovah God, and his great Textbook, the Bible. Here within the pages of this grand Book the Creator has conveyed his purposes, his wisdom, his many provisions and his love for his creature man. Why not take advantage of this great Textbook, and not only train your minds in proper pathways but save your life for everlasting living in the hew world of righteousness?—John 17:3.

<p><span class="font15">&lt;L Nagging is usually considered obnoxious. But a special form of it is now being recommended by men for use by the women: “enlightened nagging.&quot; This is the recommendation of an official of the American Cancer Society, who recently said: “We would like to see women—history’s most effective medium of communication—turn their talents to saving their husbands from early death by lung cancer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">. . . They should insist that men with persistent coughs see the doctor. Because most men are notoriously insensitive to seemingly minor symptoms, the job will not be easy. In most cases it may entail some nagging. But I believe most women will agree that it is better to have a live and healthy husband, however harassed he may be, than to allow him to go complacently to an untimely grave.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">&lt;L Anyone who has visited a country where a different language is spoken knows the difficulty of making himself understood. But the same difficulty is also evident in different nations that speak the same language. Tooting a hooter at the roundabout while driving a saloon on the verge, and blowing a horn at the traffic circle while driving a sedan on the road shoulder, both mean the same thing, depending on whether you are in Britain or the United States. Road diversion and dual carriageway in Britain become detour and divided highway in the United States. The American trunk is the British boot, and the fenders are wings. The British bonnet is the American hood, and the caravan is a trailer. Thoroughly confused? Then so would those in the other country he after listening to you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">O YOU know that well-trained dogs are H vital to some industries? Especially in £</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">New Zealand is this true. Here, dogs are the JJ sheep I aimers’ constant companions. These </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font22">obedient dogs bring the sheep, often num- <sub>H </sub>berlng many thousands, to yards for shearing, g dipping or sale to market. Often the dogs M work so far away that the shepherd's voice <sub>H </sub>falls to reach them. On such occasions the * dog's master gives semaphorelike signals with </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font22">hip arms or uses a shrill whistle. If the dogs </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">h </span><span class="font22">move beyond sight of their master, they move the sheep from experience, knowing what is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">h </span><span class="font22">required of them. If in doubt they will bring </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font22">the sheep to some vantage point where they can see their master and thus receive further « directions, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">h</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">V There are occasions when thousands of sheep are moved from the East Coast to the fertile lands of North Island's Waikato River, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font22">a distance of over 400 miles. Of course, mobs </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font22">of sheep on the highways are not regarded J] with favor by passing motorists who abhor </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">h </span><span class="font22">delays. Driving toward a flock presents no <sub>H </sub>hazards, provided one proceeds slowly. Auto-matically, the sheep will split for the car to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">h </span><span class="font22">pass through. But approaching a flock from </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">h </span><span class="font22">behind is something else- Obliviously, the sheep just move slowly in front of the auto. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font22">So if the driver is impatient and speeds up. H he will likely run over some of the sheep. On a word from its master, the dog will run alongside the sheep ahead of the auto to clear </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">h </span><span class="font22">a passage. So amazing is the sagacity of the <sub>H </sub>dogs in clearing the roadway that the motor-ists’ annoyance usually gives way to keen </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font22">interest, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">V A leading dog will often work the whole day through at the head of a flock or &quot;drive&quot; </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">h </span><span class="font22">without direction from his master. The lead- </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font22">ing dog's duty is to restrain the forward sheep from traveling too fast, thus outstripping the * weaker ones that fall to the rear. The lead </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">m </span><span class="font22">dog must also guard the entrance to byroads until the leading sheep have traveled far enough on the desired route that the flock </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">h </span><span class="font22">will follow. Then the dog leaves his byroad post of his own accord and resumes hlg place at the head of the flock*</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">Cattle dogs do not differ greatly from sheep dogs. On dairy farms the dog la unleashed early In the morning, Without a word of command he trots away to round up his fifty to a hundred cows* bringing them to the gate nearest the milking shed. Meanwhile, his master is performing preparatory chores. He has only to open the gate, when the cows are brought in,</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">, On run country, where cattle are grazed, a more aggressive dog is used. His work is similar to that of the Long-range sheep dog. A tendency to bite or nip the heels of a beast is a decided asset, particularly so in bush or partly cleared country* A beast will often hide out There is nothing that will make him move more quickly from his hideout than a nip or<sup>1 </sup>two on the heels. The dog's marvelous agility enables it to escape serious injury,</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">/ Fascinating is the teamwork of a well-trained pack of rabbit dogs* These packs may contain up to twenty dogs. They often include a motley collection of breeds from greyhounds to fox terriers. Besides his dogs, the rabbiter's equipment includes a spade, a pack horse and two or three trained ferrets. What happens when a rabbit warren is found? Leaving his horse within thirty to fifty yards, with a trailing rein, the rabbi ter places his dogs around the warren like a football team* Each dog knows his place. On the outer rings are the fast greyhounds, the short sharp sprinters half way, and the little fox terriers around the mouths of the warren. The rabbiter releases his ferrets. Immediately they invade the rabbit realm* Scared from their burrows, the rabbits scoot to the surface only to be snapped up by the first ring of dogs, But if a rabbit evades this hazard it faces the second ring. If still elusive, it is practically certain to fall to the fast greyhounds. Superb teamwork! But cruel? No, for the prolific rabbits, destroy tremendous amounts of food and threaten to force the farmers off the land. So rabbit control is essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">V Yes, these dogs are more than pets. They arc faithful servants, vital to many farmers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Righteous World Without Decologue CAN </span><span class="font16">you visualize a righteous new world without the Ten Commandments? The very thought of such a thing would horrify many self-righteous persons, who would think it meant that all morality would be thrown to the winds. Still, you ask, how would it be a righteous world without the Mosaic Decalogue to keep it straight? How could it be any better than the world we now live in? Of course, it must be admitted that this world does not observe the Ten Commandments; in fact, the world in general was never under the Ten Commandments. The majority of earth’s population today has never seen or heard of the Ten Commandments. But the mere absence or lack of knowledge of these commandments is not the reason for the world’s wickedness, any more so than the mere presence and popular knowledge of the commandments would keep the world from being sinful. Christendom professes to know the Ten Commandments, but her crimes are equal to if not greater than those of nations not recognizing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Just recall that the Ten Commandments were a part of the law that God gave to the Jews by Moses. The mere declaration and publication of that law to the Jews did not make that nation righteous or keep them from sin and wickedness against God. The hearing of God’s commandments declared from Mount Sinai did not remove the Jews from the sinful level of the rest of the world and transform them into a righteous nation. The apostle Paul assures us that “the Ijearers of law are not the ones righteous before God, but the doers of law will be declared righteous.”—Romans 2:13, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">The Jews had been nine hundred years under the Mosaic law when Jehovah God said by his prophet Ezekiel: “I gave them my statutes, and showed them mine ordinances, which if a man do [and not merely hear], he shall live in them.&quot; In place of carrying out God’s righteous law, including the Ten Commandments, the Jews rebelled against him and his law and imitated the heathen world around them, God forewarned the Jews that, for breaking his law covenant, he would deliver them over into the hands of their heathen enemies. But the Jews would not be warned.—Ezekiel 20:10-12] </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Since the Jews persisted in disobeying Jehovah’s law he let them go their own way. He gave them over to the statutes and judgments of the heathen, which were not good, and by the keeping of which they could not gain life. Psalm 81:11, 12 declares: “My people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me. So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.” And the apostle Paul writes: “Therefore God in keeping with the desires of their hearts gave them up to uncleanness, that their bodies might be dishonored among them, even those who exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the One who created, who is blessed forever.” Thus the Ten Commandments did not transform the Jews into a righteous nation, nor did they convert the</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">world. The Ten Commandments alone cannot produce a righteous world, despite the righteousness of those commandments. —Romans 1:24-28, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">That the new world </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font23"> God’s promise can be righteous without the reinstatement of the Ten Commandments is demonstrated by Christ’s faithful footstep followers. “Reinstatement” of the Ten Commandments, we say, because the Bible makes it plain that the old law covenant with the Jews, including the Ten Commandments, was taken out of the way by </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">virtue of Christ’s </span><span class="font23">death on the tree. (See Ephesians 2:11-18 and Colossians 2:13-17; and </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font23"> issue of November 1, 1945.) Hence the followers of Christ are not under the law covenant and its Ten Commandments. Nevertheless, their righteousness with God is a fact. They are not trying to be righteous before God by doing the works of that old law covenant. They accept God’s Word, namely, “that a man is declared righteous, not due to works of law, but only through faith toward Christ Jesus, . . . because due to works of law no flesh will be declared righteous?’ (Galatians 2:16; 3:11-13, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.}</span><span class="font23"> Yet, despite not being under the commandments, ordinances and statutes of the old law covenant, true Christians do not pursue a course of sin like the world and its nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">To these Christians who are under God’s new arrangement by Christ Jesus Paul writes: “For sin must not be master over you, seeing that you are </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font23"> under law but under undeserved kindness?’ By walking in union with the living Christ and following the spirit or active force of God the Christians are not under the condemnation of the law covenant. They are not under the law covenant and its Ten Commandments. Many false religionists, frightened at this stark fact, ask, How can Jehovah’s witnesses who believe this be held back from sinning without the restraining commands of the Ten Commandments? Are they not tempted to give themselves over to a loose abandon to sin and wickedness? The apostle Paul answers their questions and shows that true Christians dare not selfishly use their liberty for committing sin. Notice how Paul reasons it out to make it plain to us that God’s undeserved kindness is no occasion for anyone to yield himself freely over to the desires of the flesh.—Romans 6:14; 5:20, 21; 6:1, 2,12,14-18, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Another thing, too, those Ten Commandments</span><span class="font23"> had not always been in existence toward men, not even toward the Jews. Moses, the mediator of the law covenant with Israel, plainly says so, at Deuteronomy 5:1-21. The Ten Commandments had their beginning, not with the forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Jacob’s twelve sons, but with the Israelites who were alive and present at Mount Horeb when Moses mediated the law covenant with them. Hence, it should arouse no fear and dismay in us if those Ten Commandments have been abolished since Christ’s death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Being free from the yoke of the law covenant and being made free in Christ his followers are manifesting in a positive way their love of Jehovah with all their mind, heart, soul and strength. (Jeremiah 31:33) This they manifest by following the course of righteousness and rendering to him the service that he requires of them as His witnesses. God’s spirit in his dedicated people is powerful </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">enough to produce legal </span><span class="font23">fruitage of righteousness without the Ten Commandments.—Romans 13:8-10; Galatians 5:4, 6, 13-23. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Thus, what God is accomplishing in the case of tens of thousands of Christians without the Ten Commandments he will also accomplish for all obedient men in the new world, not with the Ten Commandments but by his undeserved kindness through Christ the Wonderful Counselor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah's Witnesses Preach in All the Earth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Nyasaland</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">T</span><span class="font16">IE posters and guide books that te.l of Nyasaland say that it is “darkest Africa In fairest mood.” Only 4.000 white people live in Nyasaland, to compare with an African population of 2,250,000 of Bantu stock. Therefore the affairs of the country revolve chiefly around these Africans, their customs, habits, mode of life and work. Their houses are made of mud thickly plastered over a sturdy framework of wooden poles, and the roofs are thatched with grass gathered from the surrounding bushland. There are persons in these homes who understand Jehovah’s purposes and want to tell others of their God and religion. In fact the country is literally swarming with Jehovah's witnesses. There are now more than 60C congregations divided into twenty-eight circuits, and applications for new congregations and for the full-time ministry come in faster than they can be handled by the branch office. Jehovah’s witnesses in Nyasaland have doubled their number since 1949!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A typical congregational Bible study in Nyasaland Is held on the baked mud floor of a private home. Hie men are dressed in old shirts and in shorts that were once khaki colored. They have an open Bible among them. A visitor might be wearing a Heavy overcoat despite the heat. He is from a northern tribe. He will wear that overcoat and maybe a woolen scarf and gloves in all kinds of weather, for that is his custom. In the large pockets he wif. carry his mimeographed copy of </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span class="font16">Watchtower in his dialect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Pockets or even pocketbooks are not needed by the women of Nyasaland, for they carry everything in their customary manner: on their heads. Whether it is a heavy earthenware pot or just one small booklet, the woman will carry it on her head. Tied to her back will be her baby, and it will stay there even when the mother is working or chopping wood with an ax!</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Illiteracy among the Africans runs high in Nyasaland. Protestant and Catholic missionaries have been established in Nyasaland for many years, but their fight against illiteracy has been very feeble. Jehovah's witnesses have organized special classes at least once a week to teach their fellows to read and write and thus be more proficient in their Bible-education work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">It is interesting to note how well organized Nyasaland witnesses are in their preaching work. A group of ministers has met together ar.d all are ready to go. They form a line behind the captain of the group. At a given signal, off they walk in single file. A route has been planned around the village that will enable them to walk close to every hut. As they pass the first house the one at the head of the line separates himself and approaches the owner, who has been attracted to his doorway by the sound of the singing. Then follows a brief conversation on the Bible, an offer of a Bible aid. and if no interest is shown the brother bids him farewell and off he runs to catch up to the line, takes his place and awaits his turn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">A woman is seen pounding maize, the staple food of the African. The grain is in a large mortar or stamping block and she</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">is pounding it with a wooden pestle weighing about thirty pounds. Hard work for a woman, but she is used to it and her baby sleeps soundly on her back in spite of the violent exercise its mother is doing. A sister will leave the chain of singers to discuss the good news of God’s kingdom with hen When she has finished, she too runs to catch up with her fellow ministers* In this way, walking, singing, preaching and then running in turn, this happy band of Jehovah’s witnesses cover their territory systematically, and some of the people in the village have been started on the road to everlasting life* They lay no claim to being well educated from the worldly standpoint but they do know the Bible and can use it effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Public meetings are an important part of the ministry of the Word in Nyasaland, and there is no trouble in searching for suitable accommodations* The leafy shade of a mango tree is often all that is required. No booking in advance or signing contracts, just a word to the village headman and everything is arranged* If he disagrees, there is always plenty of room in the bush outside the village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A national assembly presents many problems, the greatest of these being transportation* Few can afford to pay for transportation. District assemblies held in four different places provide a better opportunity for the African brothers to assemble together, but even then some have to walk for seven days, or a distance of some 200 miles, to reach the assembly place and then the same distance home again. The first of the 1951 district assemblies held in September was the biggest assembly ever held here* More than 4,100 attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To prepare for an assembly represents much work. The ground must be cleared. An amphitheater must be prepared* Bamboo fences and grass booths must be constructed in which the brothers may sleep* Firewood for cooking must be gathered* No other organization goes to the trouble of preparing for such assemblies, and people come from afar to inspect what<sup>&lt;</sup> is built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nyasaland may be backward in many ways, but that cannot be said of the Kingdom message in these parts of the world. The truth of Jehovah’s Word is spreading rapidly and Nyasalanders are showing their faith by their works.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">The Indo-Chlna Dilemma</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">One of the West’s major dilemmas has centered around Tndo-Chir.a, a 285,640-square-mile area of about the size of Texas. Seven years of fighting there has coat France 150,000 casualties and $5,000.000,000. Though the U.S. has virtually taken over the war's expense, this year paying 78 per cent of the cost, the dilemma has only heightened. ‘Ilie lum for the worse was sudden: in February President Eisenhower stated that he was bitterly opposed n ILS. involvement in a hoi war; ye1 two months later the Senate was face to face with the prospect of what some responsible members regarded as likelihood of U.S. involvement on a major scale. What caused this ominous prospect was the disclosure by Secretary Dulles that the Chinese Communists were “coming awfully close” :o aggression and that now the situation was “fraught with danger.” Also there was the attack on the French fortress Dkstfcienphu, significant for this reason; for seven years the Communists have been kmited to guerrilla tactics, but at Dienbienphu they launched full-scale warfare for the first time. That the dilemma had in-iRnsifled was clear when President Eisenhower explained .4/7'1 that the loss of Indochina would lead to the loss of Burma, Thailand, the Malay peninsula and Indonesia, and would place Japan, the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand in a threatened position. Amid this tense situation the feelings of some statesmen were summed up by Democrat Stuart Symington: “Apparently we are getting closer to entering the wir in Indo-China.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Vietnam Intensifies Struggle $&gt; The struggle against the Communist-led Vietminh in Indo-China has been fought by French Union forces. Including North Africans and Foreign legionnaires as well as Vietnamese troops. However, the Vietnamese government, during the seven years of the Indo-Chinese conflict, has never ordered conscription on a broad scale. In April i* did. The war cabinet decided to mobilize all Vietnamese male citizens between the ages of 20 and 25. “In principle'' the decision means that no Vietnamese citizen between the ages of 18 and 45 years Is permitted to leave the country. The broad conscription,'among other things, illustrated how far away the French were from winning the war.</span></p>

Robert Oppenheimer is known as '“the man who built the atom bomh.” In recent months'this famous U.S. physicist has been the nucleus of a political atom bomb; for when the Atomic Energy Commission suspended him as a security risk, on December 23, 1953, he became the most important government official ever seriously accused of Communist sympathies.Some of the charges against him: (1) that he contributed to Communist causes in 1940-42; (2) that he had married a former Communist and (3^ that he opposed the H-bomb “on moral grounds” and “by claiming that it was not feasible.” To these charges the scientist respond*^: “I never accepted Communist dogma or theory: in fact, it never made sense to me.&quot; Thus his suspension has stirred up intense resentment between many leading scientists and the Eisenhower administration. Since other top scientists agreed with Oppenheimer’s opposition to the H-bomb, they are now appalled to find that this opposition is one of the main pieces of “derogatory information” against him. Eminent scientists by the score uphole. Oppenheimer. Said Nobel Prize Winner Har old C. Urey of Oppenheimer’s suspension: ‘'{This is] one ci the most unjust things that 1 have over heard of.” The Now York Ti?nes (4/14) editorialized: “It is essential that there be no implication of disloyalty because a scientist expressed his honest opinion, which later turned out to be unpopular and erroneous.” Tn far-off Japan, Tokyo’s AsAot Sftimbutn said: &quot;The situation now definitely reminds one of the Inquisition .”</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">&lt;$&gt; Four prospective European Defense Community members. West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, have ratified E.D.C. But in April the possibility that France would also do so was bleaker than ever. Strong opposition came from seven-ster Marshal Alphonse-Pierre Juin, France's highest-ranking mili</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">tary figure. Marshal Juin demanded that E.D.C. be replaced by a pact that would give France more control over her own forces. For publicly condemning E.D.C* and fcr refusing to answer's summons to appear before Premier Lanie] to explain his actions, Juin </span><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font26">removed as vice-chairman of the Supreme Council of War- Then on April 7 two-star General do Gaulle joined the attack on E.D.C. He denounced it, saying that &quot;if ratified 'E.D.C.] would wrest from France her sovereignty for 50 years, which means forever,” and there would ensue </span><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;a </span><span class="font26">state of permanent revolt’* in France.

He created a sensation by revealing a Soviet espionage ring in Canada. It was the Canadian way of living that appealed to Gouzenko. Tn April a case closely resembling Gouzenko’s occurred in Australia. The third secretary of the Soviet Embassy at Canberra, Vladimir M, Petrov, deserted the Soviet foreign service. Australia granted him political asylum, Petrev is said to </span><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font26">the most important of all the Russian officials who have deserted the Soviet foreign service. Petrov was ro ordinary diplomat; he was a.so an officer of the M.V.D.<sub>t</sub> the </span><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Russia </span><span class="font26">secret service. His being the M.V.D. representative in Australia explains his relatively junior standing in the embassy. Documents that Petrov gave the Commonwealth government are said to name 30 to 50 Australians as being involved tn espionage and to disclose an extensive Communist network for fomenting industrial strife. Petrov^ reason for abandoning all ties with Russia: ‘T no longer believe in</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">communism since I have seen the Australian way of living.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Q</span><span class="font26"> A fishing vessel 2,200 miles from the location of the H-bomb blast of March 26 has been found to be radioactive. This was revealed (4/10) by Japanese authorities who checked the vessel with a geiger counter, They found a moderately high radiation count among crew members. None of the crew were seriously injured, and the vessels catch of tuna was released for sale However, radioactivity on a vessel so far from the blast prompted the government Fisheries Bureau to announce that jt would begin a search for now fishing grounds &quot;secure from the hydrogen bomb.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font26">C-Bomb: A Frankenstein f &lt;g&gt; The cobalt bomb is a theoretical weapon that would use cobalt instead of steel for a casing to enclose a hydrogen bomb. Cobalt, a lead J ike metal that absorbs radioactivtty, would permit the winds to carry it to the far corners al tbc earth, annihilating all lite in its path. It could easily wipe out continents. But could such an alldestroying bomb be built? An authoritative answer came (4/11) when U.S, Assistant Secretary of Defense Donald A. Quarles said that C-bombs were scientifically possible. Ho indicated that a war model cobalt bomb would actually lie a Frankenstein, for he called it a <sup>,f</sup>fiuicido weapon/ ore that would ind.scriminately kJ] friend and foe. Of this weapon Professor Leo Szilard, one of the principal architects of the atomic bomb, has estimated that 400 one-ton deuterium -cobalt bombs would release enough radioactivity to extinguish all life on earth. This brings to mind the words of Albert Einstein, uttered early in 1950 before the H-bomb was a reality: &quot;If successful, radioactive poisoning cf the atmosphere, and hence annihilation</span></p>
<p><span class="font26">of any Jfe on earth, will have been brought within the range of technical possibilities.” (New York Times 4/7/54) Since the C-bomb is merely an IL bomb with a different shell, the successful H-bomh tests in March have brought Professor Einstein’s prophecy into the realm of fact. Also brought in-* to bold relief is Jehovah's promise to &quot;bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” This he wir do at Armageddon.-- Revela Jon 11:18, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">New</span><span class="font26"> World Tnnu.</span></p>

For the speedy, smooth-riding Comets enjoyed a meteoric rise in popularity. But then came January', 1954 The Comet that made the historic maiden flight to Johannesburg crushed into the sea not far from Rome, killing 35 persons. After that disaster the Comets were grounded.

Airlines immediately grounded their Comets, and Sir Miles Thomas, chairman of British Overseas Airways Corporation, declared that the Comets, would not fly again “until It has been completely demonstrated to us . . . that the causes of the disasters have been established and rectified” Sir Mlles called lhe crash &quot;a very great tragedy/’ but the Tttnes of London expressed even more grimnoss. calling it “the tragedy of an enterprise.”</span></p>

Since bands Of Moslem rebels virtually control the area in question, the government has been unable to take action against the terrorists.

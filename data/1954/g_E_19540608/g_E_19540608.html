</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">The Churches and Political Morals</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">C</span><span class="font14">AN the solution to the bad climate of today’s political morals be found within the churches? Some people think so. Yet in many lands many of the very politicians who have not always considered honesty the best policy are regular church members. This contradiction caused New York </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font14"> columnist Dorothy Schiff to ask in January: “Why have the institutions of religion so frequently failed to instill in their memberships the high moral standards they so patiently preach?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Her question was prompted by a stirring and remarkably courageous speech given by U. S. politician James Farley, a speech that was ignored by a large percentage of newspapers that apparently thought it too controversial, best to steer clear of. Discussing “The Role of the Catholic in Politics,” Roman Catholic Farley said: “Unhappily, Catholics in power have been as prone to abuse their trust, if not more so than their non-Catholic brethren ... In recent scandals involving men in public life the identification of Catholics among the betrayers of trust came so often as to bring us a heavy sense of shame . . . We should be something less than honest if we did not recognize that many of the most notorious political machines in America have been built and operated by Catholics.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Immediately let it be observed that politician Farley would also have been justified in attacking the political morals of those of other religious faiths. Agreeing with what Farley says, Miss Schiff also shows that others are involved, saying: “Protestants and Jews also too often check their morals at the door when they leave their churches and synagogues.” She refers to a psychiatrist to learn why religions do not produce higher morals and ethics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But if there is an Authority on religion, would it not be best to go to it for a really accurate explanation? There is such an Authority. It is the Bible, which is the guidebook, road map or book of instructions regarding true religion. All will have to admit that it at least shows what Christianity was when good morals and zeal filled the lives of the early Christians, who would even die for right worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Scriptures firmly state these principles of honesty. The Christian must follow them. How can one who does not follow them claim to be Christian? Following the same line of thought, and since it is the members that make up an organization, how can an organization claim to be really Christian when it provides the world with leaders who do not follow the Scriptural principles? Something is amiss. From where does the weakness come? Why do neither Catholics nor Protestants succeed in the duty they have taken upon themselves? If you cannot imagine the apostles’ being involved in political scandals, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">disciples’ developing power-hungry political machines, or the early Christian converts' betraying a trust that was put in them, then why should these things be evident among those who claim the name “Christian” today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Perhaps it is because the‘patient preaching’ about which Miss Schiff speaks has been too patient, the example too weak. Today’s religious leaders are not really following the Authority, the guidebook for religion. Modern-day religion has broadened out to encompass almost everyone who will come and sit. While this is good for attendance, it is bad for principle and disastrous to those who are led to think that merely attending a church puts them in the right way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">True worship, as practiced in Jesus’ day, was not just a “come and sit” religion; it was a &quot;get out and do” matter. This fact is made very pointedly in Jesus’ statement at Matthew 7:13, 14, 21-23, that the right way is a &quot;narrow way,” and that it does not water down its principles just to take in everyone. True religion encourages others to raise their standards to God’s standards, but the churches have failed to instill in their memberships the high moral standards that the Bible sets for true Christians, because they have reversed this principle and lowered their standards toward the standards of today’s generally apathetic world. The individual who recognizes this need not despair, however. He has the right to reject this broad way of ‘patient preaching’ and to associate with those who zealously do the works of true Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Greatest Discovery”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Under the above title the New York </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune</span><span class="font18"> (January 3, 1954) carried the following condensation from the book </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Of Flight and Life,</span><span class="font18"> by Charles A. Lindbergh:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">&quot;To me in youth, science was more important than either man or God. I worshiped science, I was awed by its knowledge. Its advances had surpassed man’s wildest dreams. In its learning seemed to lie the key to all mysteries of life,</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">&quot;It took many years for me to discover that science, with all its brilliance, lights only a middle chapter of creation. I saw the science I worshiped, and the aircraft I loved, destroying the civilization I expected them to serve, and which I thought as permanent as earth itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">&quot;Now I realize that to survive, one must look beyond the speed and power of aircraft —beyond the material strength of science. And, though God cannot be seen as tangibly as I had demanded as a child, His presence can be sensed in every sight and act and incident. Now I know that when man loses his sense, he misses the true quality of life—the beauty of earth, its seasons and its skies; the brotherhood of men; the joy of wife and children. He loses the infinite strength without which no people can survive—the element which war cannot defeat or peace corrupt,</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">&quot;Now I understand that spiritual truth is more essential to a nation than the mortar in its cities’ walls. For when the actions of a people are unguided by these truths, it is only a matter of time before the walls themselves collapse,</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">&quot;The most urgent mission of our time is to understand these truths, and to apply them to our Way of modern life. We must draw strength from the almost forgotten virtues of simplicity, humility, contemplation, prayer. It requires a dedication beyond science, beyond self—but the rewards are great and it is our only hope.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Is Organized</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font27">I</span><span class="font14">N A thirty-nine story, glass-framed, marble skyscraper overlooking New York city’s East River, sixty nations regularly meet together to conduct their business and iron out their problems for the avowed purpose of promoting peace and security in the world. These are sovereign nations, independent nations meeting face to face on terms of equality. They are called “United Nations” principally because of their stated aim to bring harmony and peace in the world. Since this organization is dedicated to enhancing the general welfare of the people, it should be of genuine interest to all to know how it operates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There are six main organs to the United Nations’ machinery. They are: the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, the International Court of Justice and the Secretariat. Each unit of the Secretariat functions under the secretarygeneral’s direction and supervision, and at the head of each is an assistant secretarygeneral. These units are established to service all other organs, ensure co-operation between nations in the interest of maintaining international peace and security, increase education, promote human progress, guard the well-being of humanity, watch over matters of peoples who do not govern themselves, and take care of legal problems. Delegates to the United ed Nations can affect the lives and destiny of the majority of the world’s population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The key figures, for the duration of the organization, 'are the president of the General Assembly, the president of the Security Council and the secretary-general. In case of an emergency any one of these three, either separately or jointly with the other two, may set the machine in motion. The organization went to work on the cold, drizzling afternoon of January 10, 1946, when the first General Assembly met in London. With three raps of the assembly president’s gavel, the world body came to order. The United Nations charter, a most complex constitutional machinery, became the blueprint of a living, working organization. Its avowed purpose is well represented in the preamble to the charter, which says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“We, the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind ... and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women, and of nations large and small . . . and to promote social progress and better</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font23">standards of life in larger freedom *. * and for these ends ,.. to practice tolerance and live together In peace with one another as good neighbors.*. and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security . . . and to ensure that armed force shall not be used save in the common interest , , , and to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples, have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish thete aims.” These are the high ideals that have fostered and inspired the United Nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">General Asaembly</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">'The charter provides for a General Assembly In which every world problem within the scope of the charter may be considered. This assembly is made up of the sixty member nations. Each sends five representatives and five alternates to sit with them, and as many advisers and experts as they need. Their salary is paid by the nation that sends them. Each member nation also contributes to the annual budget of the United Nations. The amount is decided by the General Assembly and depends on each country’s ability to pay* Each year the General Assembly elects its own president and seven vice-presidents, all from different countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The assembly meets annually, unless it should be called into special session. Every aspect of international legal, cultural, political, social and economic affairs may be covered in this assembly, This is the “town meeting of the world,*’ as John Foster Dulles so aptly termed it. The assembly merely discusses Issues. It recommends. It advises. It thinks up plans for settling problems, but settles none itself. It cannot </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">make laws. </span><span class="font23">It cannot tell the people what to do. Nor can it use force. After its discussion the assembly votes that certain things be done. Then its work is finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The other branches of the United Nations move to carry out the decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Most of the work done by the General Assembly is done by a dozen or more committees. There is a committee for each important part of the United Nations. These committees argue out the details and make recommendations in writing to the General Assembly. The assembly considers the t'ecommendations and votes on the matter. Each nation has only one vote. There is no ‘‘veto?’ For almost all the important issues the assembly considers, a two-thirds majority vote is needed before any action is recommended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Security Council</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">According to the United Nations Charter, the work of maintaining the peace and security of the world rests almost solely on the Security Council* Eleven members comprise this Council* There are five permanent members, whose names appear in the charter; they are China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, The remaining six are chosen by the General Assembly for a period of two years, after which they may not serve again immediately. For security reasons the Council is in continuous session* theoretically speaking. It investigates international disputes, and it can take action against aggressors if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The Council, however, cannot make any decision, except on question of procedure, if one of these five permanent mefnbers is against it; this is called the “veto” of the unanimity rule. The United Kingdom or any of the other permanent members can always veto the use of military force against itself. When the council is recommending measures for peacefully settling a dispute, a council member, if it is a party to this dispute, may not vote. Voting is done by a simple show of hands. Each council member has but one vote. The veto</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">cannot be used to stop discussion, nor can it be used when the council votes cn the election of judges for the InternationalCourt of Justice. It can prevent any nation from joining the United Nations or from being expelled or suspended because of bad behavior.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Economic and Social Council</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">The Genera I Assembly and Security Council might be called “the peace-keeping and peace-making agencies of the United Nations.’’ There are other agencies operating within the United Nations that also seek to promote peace, but in other ways. The Economic and Social Council tries to get the nations to work together to improve living standards and to extend observance of basic human rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The eighteen members that make up this council meet regularly at. least three times a year. All decisions are made by a simple majority vote. There is no veto in the council. The assignment is so great that the charter provides for commissions and specialized agencies. Some of the commissions working in conjunction with the Economic and Social Council are these: The Human Rights Commission, which is now at work drafting an “International Bill of Rights.” The Commission on the Status of Women endeavors to gain equal rights for women. The Social Commission works on prevention of crime, better public housing, old-age pensions, workmen’s compensation laws, etc. The Transport and Communications Commission works for better laws for ships, airplanes, bus lines and railroads. The Economic and Employment Commission studies how to get work for the willing and prevent depression. And there are the Fiscal Commission, the Statistical Commission, the Narcotic Drugs Commission and others. Each commission consists of a dozen or more experts. Besides the commissions the council has specialized agencies to assist it in its work. Briefly some of these agencies are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“The. International Labor Organization (ILO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Monetary I'und, the World Health Organization (WHO),the Universal Postal Union (UPU), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).” Hie council has to co-ordinate the work of all these commissions and agencies. It receives their reports and hears their representatives, then it votes as to what recommendations it will make. The council cannot make laws. It just recommends, and most of its recommendations are heeded. Its primary objective is “to make the world a safer, pleasanter, and more comfortable place for all to live in.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Trusteeship Council</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">One of the principal organs of the United Nations and the last to begin its work is the Trusteeship Council. This council assists the General Assembly in looking after t rust t erri tones. Trust territories are lands that have been placed under the International Tnisteeship System. They are iands that do not govern themselves. The countries that govern them have placed them under the trusteeship system. The idea of the trusteeship system is to look after the welfare of the peoples of the territories and to help them to develop, that they may govern themselves. There are at present eleven such territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Trusteeship Council is made up of slates administering trust territories, of the five permanent members of the Security Council, and of “as many other mem-</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">bers (elected for three-year terms by the General Assembly) as may be necessary to ensure that the membership is equally divided between administering and non-administering states/' The countries that administer trust territories must send annual reports to the United Nations stating the progress made in such territory toward self-government. The council has the right to send committees to all the trusteeship territories to look and to ask questions. The council then reviews the findings, studies the reports and writes its comments on them and passes them on to the General Assembly or to the Security Council, whichever is in charge of the trust territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">International Court of Justice</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Article 102 of the charter states that every member nation that makes a treaty with another nation must send copies of all its treaties to the Secretariat of the United Nations. These accepted treaties become international law. When a nation violates a treaty it can be tried before the International Court of Justice, which sits at The Hague in Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The court is composed of fifteen Judges, each elected by the Security Council and the General Assembly. They serve for nine years and no one can remove them until that term is up. If a judge becomes too ill to do his work and will not resign, or if a judge becomes untrustworthy, the other judges can vote him out, if they all agree. But no one else can remove him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Any member of the United Nations can bring a case to this court Nations that are not members can also bring their cases to this court, if their governments agree to abide by the decisions of the court. The court tries only nations, not individuals. It can call experts to answer questions. It can ask for papers, treaties or evidence it desires, but it has no power for seizing witnesses or evidence. The majority vote decides the case. In case of a tie, the judge who was appointed president of the court votes twice. The decision is put in writing, together with the reason for it. Each decision is read aloud in the courtroom. Then copies are printed. The court has completed its job. It cannot enforce its decision. Each nation that signs the charter of the United Nations agrees to abide by whatever the court rules. Neither the Security Council nor any other part of the United Nations has power to force a nation to accept a decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Secretariat</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The Secretariat takes care of all the administrative matters of the United Nations. It does the office work of the organization. It works all year round, serving all parts of the organization and </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">carrying out the programs</span><span class="font23"> and policies laid down by them. It is made up of about 4,500 international civil servants who serve under the head of the Secretariat, the secretary-general. These men and women are not allowed to take orders from any government, political party or church. “The Secretariat serves as the permanent liaison between the different branches of the United Nations and between the specialized agencies within the organization itself. It prepares every session of the Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, and the Trusteeship Council/'</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">While this</span><span class="font23"> review barely </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">scratches the </span><span class="font23">surface of the amount of agencies, work, problems and expense entailed in operating the world organization, yet it should be enough to show that the task is great. Is it too great for men to handle? Many think so. They question the United Nations’ </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">workability* They are dubious of its future. </span><span class="font23">What has the United Nations accomplished? they ask.

<p><span class="font27">HANDICAPPED</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">M</span><span class="font14">IRACLES never seem to cease in the realm of the, handicapped. Mastering the seemingly “unbelievable” appears commonplace among the disabled. There are legless dancers, mountain climbers, swimmers; armless musicians, composers, typists; blind doctors, teachers, instructors; mute musicians and special agents. Virtually nothing appears too great for them to surmount. Therefore, it is not surprising that some of these cases should be classed as miracles. But despite their achievements, certain fact's show the difference between God’s miracles and these human accomplishments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Take, for example, the case of Kenneth Porter. He received, spinal injuries while serving with the Marines in the Solomon Islands. Doctors left him with a choice to make: to remain in a standing position for the rest of his life or to remain in a sitting position. Porter chose to stand. His active mind soon taught him how to live without bending. He used crutches to walk, an elevated table to eat from and a raised bench to work at. But he did everything standing up. Despite his handicap, Porter leads a normal life. He is employed, is married, and has three children. As remarkable as this case may be it still could not be termed a miracle, because Porter remains wrapped in a rigid cast; he needs crutches to help him get around, and even though he may lead a normal life it is not a natural one. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">—Life,</span><span class="font14"> February 4, 1952.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Hope for Disabled</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">The restoring of the mentally and physically handicapped by Christ and his apos</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">tles should be a source of great comfort and joy to those who have been born handicapped or who have been</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19540608_files/g_E_19540608-6.png" alt="" style="width:113pt;height:69pt;">

<p><span class="font14">because these miraculous </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font14">cures pointed forward to // the new world now at hand, ff when Christ will restore $ all mankind to perfection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Meanwhile, however, great advances are being made in a human way in the realm of the handicapped, though it is not easy for the disabled to overcome their difficulties. Simple things that a normal person might think anyone should be able to do without much thought become unbearable tasks for the paralytic. The truth is that most handicapped persons have to learn even simple things all over again. And if a patient has suffered a stroke, it might be necessary for him to learn an entirely new pattern of action, which might take weeks, even months, to accomplish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To roll over in bed might not seem much for a normal, healthy body, but it becomes a tremendous task for a paralyzed one. Walking with crutches might appear easy for one who has never tried it, but many times a patient has banged his face on the floor while learning to use them. A simple daily routine, such as combing one’s hair, tying one’s tie, eating by oneself, calls for hours of practice, courage and patience on the part of both instructor and patient alike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Watching a paralytic try to get up from a chair for the first time is like watching a man trying to lift something ten times his own weight, but with a little help over a period of time, sometimes weeks, he will do it. After each </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">apparent success there is </span><span class="font14">a glow that shines through the sweat* covered face. Not a miracle, but hard work. Once the “routine activities” of daily living are mastered by the handicapped, all the other activities, regardless of how great or small, fall into place less strenuously.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Size and Shape of Problem</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">Over the centuries there has been an aversion toward hiring the handicapped. However, in the last few years much progress has been made toward giving the disabled both opportunity and self-sufficiency. This progress is mainly due to a better understanding of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">handicap</span><span class="font14"> problem by employers and the advances made in vocational rehabilitation centers. During the fiscal year ending June, 1952, the United States Office of Vocational Rehabilitation reported that some 67,000 disabled persons were rehabilitated through the federal-state vocational rehabilitation programs. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">One out of every five was placed into successful</span><span class="font14"> employment. More than 10,000 went into skilled trades and essential occupations. But these figures scarcely reveal the true problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A recent United States Public Health Service survey estimated that there were some 28,000,000 persons suffering from some kind of disability, if one would include everything from a minor heart condition to a broken toe. In the period between the attack on Pearl Harbor and Japan’s surrender there were some 1,250,000 civilians reported physically disabled, to compare with 260,000 of the armed forces. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">For every disabled soldier there were five </span><span class="font14">disabled civilians. During World War II the American armed forces had 2,500 paraplegics, but in the same period of time there were 15,000 in civilian life. There were 19,000 war amputees; 120,000 in civilian life. Some 350,000 persons are permanently disabled every year in automobile and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">industrial accidents.</span><span class="font14"> Eveiy </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">year an</span><span class="font14"> estimated 48,000 hands or arms are lost by American civilians. This number is several times more than were lost by soldiers and sailors during the last war. There are about 350,000 children with cerebral palsy. A Yale survey disclosed that 121 out of every 1,000 population studied were suffering from chronic illness, and that forty of these, or four in each 100 population, were totally disabled. Governmental authorities believe at least a million of these could become employable if they received proper care and training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">During the definite man-power shortage the disabled were selected to fill the gap. One employer, Albert Hubschman, president of the Roller-Smith Corporation of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, stated; “We hire people for their minds, not their muscles. We call them handicapped persons. The truth is, they are handicapped by the fact that American industry makes virtually </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">no effort to use their talents.&quot; An</span><span class="font14"> instructor at the Paraplegic Manufacturing Company remarked that “there’s nothing the fellows here couldn’t do around the average factory, except get up the steps into it.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">However, not all handicaps are rehabili-table to physical employment. Nevertheless, their thinking and their lives can be greatly improved by a positive, forwardlooking program. Those closely confined should read every day, or have someone read to them. The reading should be selective, something positive, constructive, uplifting. Spiritual strength and encouragement are required. The mind must be fortified with the right kind of thoughts. There can be no better thoughts than those found in the Bible. Put it at the top of your list of reading material. It gives comfort and</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">hope and shows the way to health and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">The apostle Paul advised: “Whatever things are true, whatever things are of serious concern, whatever things are righteous, whatever things are chaste, whatever things are lovable, whatever things are well spoken of, whatever virtue there is and whatever praiseworthy thing there is, continue considering these things. The things which you learned as well as accepted and heard and saw in connection with me, practice these; and the God of peace will be with you?<sup>1</sup>—Philippians 4:8, 9, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Focus your attention not on what is gone but on what is left. Ask yourself: What can I do? Can I walk? Use my hands? Write? Can I make things? Can I design, mend or sew? Make a list of things you can do, and then do them with all the cheerfulness you can possibly muster. To bring happiness to others is to bring happiness to yourself. Most of all, do not let your disability prevent you from serving God. You can talk of his goodnesses. Many ministers of Jehovah's witnesses who, because of their handicap, are confined to wheel chairs do street work or prfeach in the business sections of their community. Those confined to beds write letters or use the telephone, and in this way make known the glorious hope of the Kingdom. It is first in their minds; their disability, second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Whatever the handicap, the mind can be trained to think upward and outward, but never train the mind inward or on oneself. Because one is disabled does not mean that he is helpless or that he cannot enjoy life. Franklin D. Roosevelt, despite being paralyzed from his abdomen down, becartie the president of the United States. Major Alexander P. de Seversky lost a leg in an air battle during World War I, yet went on to become one of the world's foremost aeronautical authorities. Harold Russell lost both hands during World War II, then became an expert with artificial limbs. Hollywood chose him to play the leading role in “Best Years of Our Lives,” For his memorable performance he won the Oscar award. Helen Keller, one of the most outstanding women leaders of the century, has neither seen nor heard since she was a child. Dr. Arthur Abramson, paraplegic veteran, became a top-flight specialist in orthopedic medicine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">These examples show that persons with handicaps can do much. But those who do the most are the ones whose handicaps do not prevent them from properly serving their God, either as part-time or even as full-time ministers. And in the ranks of Jehovah's servants today there are many such ones. Their lives are a real service, spent in helping others to see the truth of God’s Word and to receive his blessings. Their eyes are forward, toward Jehovah’s established kingdom and the true miracles it will bring to this earth. He will cure all handicaps, and men will live everlastingly on earth, without illness or disease or death. Yet, even now there is no obstacle that cannot be surmounted by such servants of God, for they face their obstacles, not through the might or power of men, “but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts.” —Zechariah 4:6, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Am.

<p><span class="font18">stated* that &quot;Jehovah's Witnesses are liv-mg proof of the fact that even m this nation, conceived as it was in the ideals of freedom, the right to practice religion m unconventional ways is still far from secure. Theirs is a militant and unpopular faith, pursued with a fanatical zeal. They have suffered brutal beatings; their property has been destroyed; they have been harassed at every turn by the resurrection and enforcement of little used ordinances and statutes/*</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">U. In 1940, in a period of but one week, hundreds of attacks upon Jehovah’s witnesses were reported to the United States Department of Justice. Investigation by the FBI revealed many incidents of serious violence. At Kennebunk, Maine, the Kingdom Hall was burned. At Rockville, Maryland, the local police assisted a mob in dispersing a Bible meeting. At Litchfield, Illinois, practically the entire town mobbed a company of some sixty Witnesses and it was necessary to call on the state troopers to protect them. At Connersville, Indiana, several Witnesses and their attorney were beaten and driven out of town as they appeared in court to answer a charge of riotous conspiracy. At Richmond, West Virginia, the chief of police and deputy sheriff forced a group of Jehovah's witnesses to drink large doses of castor oil and paraded them through the streets tied together with a Police Department rope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font30">I</span><span class="font18">&lt;£ This is a picture of the situation as it existed during the war years. It may be assumed that there has been a substantial improvement since then. The newspaper reports and comments on the recent world conference held by the Witnesses at Yankee Stadium In New York indicate that the sect is beginning to acquire a degree of respectability and ac* ceptance by the community. But the extent of the improvement is uncertain. The Witnesses still remain the principal victim of substantial impairment of religious liberty in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">&lt;£ This conclusion is substantiated by the fact that, in both of the decisions on religious liberty decided by the United States Supreme Court during the past term, the constitutional rights of Jehovah’s witnesses had been infringed. Undoubtedly, there are many other instances of infringements of the Witnesses’ constitutional rights that never reach the Supreme Court or indeed any court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Religious liberty is meaningful only if It gives the same protection to the respected and revered and to the despised and obnoxious. The Witnesses are an unpopular sect, with few sympathizers and fewer friends. The extent to which they are protected in their rights has been and will probably be for sometime a measure of the strength of our constitutional guarantee of freedom of conscience.</span></p>

From this small area of ten square miles at Banff, Alberta, set apart in 1885, the parks system has been extended until it embraces twentyeight separate areas totaling more than 29,000 square miles, an area almost as large as Ireland. Established primarily for the preservation of the unspoiled natural landscape and for the protection of the native wildlife, they are to be “maintained and made use of so as to leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations,” according to an act of parliament.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Among the great scenic attractions of the world is Banff National Park in Alberta, the oldest of Canada’s national parks, and the best known. It is visited annually by thousands of travelers from all parts of the world, who come by air, train and car. Included within its boundaries are the main ranges of the Canadian Rockies east of the continental divide for a distance of 125 miles. The Rocky Mountains form the great watershed of the North American continent and rank third among the great mountain ranges of the world.

<p><span class="font14">lumbia ice field—more than 100 square miles in extent—a remnant of the Ice Age. This ice field is the source of three mighty rivers: The Athabasca, which empties via the Mackenzie River into the Arctic Ocean, the Saskatchewan flowing into Hudson Bay, and the Columbia, which cascades its way through scenic gorges, into the Pacific Ocean. The park also contains the two world-famous resorts of Banff and Lake Louise. On the slopes of Mount Norquay the visitor can rise through a vertical distance of more than 1,300 feet on a spectacular chair lift to the 7,000-foot level. The beauty of the surrounding panorama is breath-taking: snowcapped peaks glistening against a blue sky, lacy mountain streams dropping into tiny lakes, and colorful forest-clad mountain slopes where Bighorn sheep, Rocky Mountain goats, moose and deer are frequently observed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Banff and Jasper National Parks, encompassing more than 6,700 square miles in the heart of the Canadian Rockies, offer the greatest variety of natural phenomena. Both have hot mineral springs, glittering glaciers, deep canyons, roaring cataracts and a vast assortment of majestic mountain peaks. One of the most exciting motor trips in the world is over the Banff-Jasper highway, an interpark mbtor road built along the trench immediately east of the main chain of the Rockies. The road follows, in turn, the Bow, Mistaya, North Saskatchewan, Sunwapta and Athabasca Rivers, and, for its entire length of 185 miles, it commands some of the most breath-taking and majestic scenery in the Canadian Rockies, which places it among the great “high-roads” of earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Other Western Parks</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">The environment of dense green forests, blue lakes and glistening sand beaches is far from the popular conception of a park in the prairie provinces, but in Manitoba and Saskatchewan there are two national parksof outstanding beauty: Riding Mountain and Prince Albert National Parks. Riding Mountain National Park is situated on the fringe of the Great Plains </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">region </span><span class="font14">that extends northward from the Mississippi Valley into Central Canada and occupies the vast plateau of Riding Mountain, which rises to a height of 2,200 feet above sea level. On the east and northeast the park presents a steep escarpment, towering nearly 1,100 feet above the surrounding country and affording magnificent views of the fertile plains below. Sweeping westward for nearly 70 miles, the park contains an area of 1,148 square miles, heavily forested and set with numerous crystal lakes, some of which are several miles long. The park is the natural home for species of big game native to the region, including deer, elk, moose and bear. Wild fowl are numerous, songbirds and birds of brilliant plumage enliven the forests, beavers live along the streams, and a herd of buffalo, descendants of the great herds that once roamed the western plains, feeds on the rich meadows near Lake Audy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Northwesterly from </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Riding Mountain </span><span class="font14">National Park, and almost in the geographical center of the province of Saskatchewan, is located Prince Albert National Park. Set in a vast region of rocks, woods and water, still rich with the memories of fur trader and trapper, of nomadic Indian and explorer, the park lies just thirty-six miles north of the city of Prince Albert. It contains an area of 1,496 square miles, and, extending far beyond the haunts of man into the unspoiled wilderness, is typical of the lake country bordering the northern park of the great plains of western Canada. Surrounding the lakes of the park are heavy growths of jack pine, white and black spruce, white birch, trembling aspen or white poplar, and black poplar. Wild animals and birds are numerous. Big game most often seen by visitors are moose, elk, white-tailed or Virginia deer, mule deer and black bear, while woodland caribou, beaver, muskrat, mink, fox, wolves and coyotes are plentiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">One hundred years ago over the great interior plains of the continent and through the open areas of the adjoining forest regions roamed the mighty bison. Its numbers are believed to have reached millions; in fact, some of the great herds are recorded as extending twenty-five miles in width and fifty miles in depth. However, the white man and Indians slew them by the thousands and by the turn of the twentieth century there was reason to believe that not a single buffalo remained on the plains of Canada in a wild state. Today under careful supervision more than 1,000, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">among the most magnificent specimens of </span><span class="font14">their kind existing in North America, live in the 75-square-mile fenced area forming Elk Island National Park in central Alberta. Buffalo, however, is not the only big game in the park, for elk, deer and moose also flourish there under sanctuary conditions. Elk Island </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">National Park is also </span><span class="font14">one of the most important bird sanctuaries in western Canada. In early , summer the lakes are literally alive with waterfowl, many of which breed along the reedy shores. More than 200 species of birds, including common residents and migrants, have been identified.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Parks in Eastern Canada</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">While western Canada has its parks on the prairies and high up in the mountains, there are many parks in eastern Canada that are worthy of our consideration. Among the outstanding scenic regions in Canada, the Island of Cape Breton presents attractions that are unique in North America. In the soft roll of hill and vale the scenery is reminiscent of the highlands of Scotland and, mounted against the everchanging background of the ocean, it has a solitary grandeur peculiar to itself. Except for the high interior barrens, which support only shrubs and moss, the landscape is clothed with mixed forest, and when the foliage takes on its autumnal colors the diffused shades of green, gold, crimson and russet combine to provide a magnificent spectacle. Three hundred and ninety square miles of this beautiful island have been set aside to form Cape Breton Highlands National Park. This park stretches across the northern part of the island from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Along the western shores steep hills rise almost precipitously from the gulf to a height of 1,500 feet, The island is rich in historic interest and is linked with the earliest days of exploration in the Western world. Perpetuating the memory of the Cabots, who made their first landfall on the North American continent along the shores of Cape Breton Island, is the famous Cabot Trail encircling the park.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Those who are accustomed to thinking of Canada in terms of the far north are surprised to learn that Point Pelee National Park in the province of Ontaria is almost in the same latitude as the northern boundary of the state of California. The park forms the most southerly extension of the mainland in Canada. Located within an hour’s drive of such industrial centers as Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan, it is a source of pleasure to thousands of city dwellers who love its thirteen miles of broad, silvery beaches. In its boundaries students of natural history have identified plant life which is usually to be found only in more southern areas, among which is prickly pear, a cactus rare in Canada, which grows in open fields in the park. Because of lying within one of the main routes followed by waterfowl and other birds on their northern and southern migrations, it is one of the most interesting bird sanctuaries in eastern Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In a story of this length it is not possible to describe all the national parks in Canada, but some of those mentioned are among the most outstanding and well known to Canadians and visitors from other lands. Other famous parks in Canada are: Yoho, Glacier, Mount Revelstoke, Kootenay, Waterton Lakes, Fundy and Prince Edward Island. A comparative statement of visitors to the national parks during the period April 1 to October 31, 1953, reveals that almost 3,000,000 persons visited the parks and registered at the park registration sites. If numbers can be considered as proof of popularity, then Banff Park outranks all others, for 584,702 enjoyed its superb scenery during the seven months. Glacier Park, in the heart of the Selkirk Mountains of British Columbia, was the least visited of all, only 479 registering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To Jehovah God, the Creator and Maker of all things, are glory and honor due for the parklands of Canada and other countries. “For Jehovah is a great God, and a great King above all gods. In his hand are the deep places of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also. The sea is his, and he made it; and his hands formed the dry land.”—Psalm 95:3-6, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>

<p><span class="font27">H</span><span class="font14">AVE you never seen a flightless bird run swifter than a race horse? Animals as large as man that stand erect? Nor covered your ears from the raucous screeching of a wheeling, dipping cloud of birds? Then you surely have not seen the emu or the kangaroo, nor heard the gray, pink-breasted galah of the Australian outback. Would you like to see this vast land of seemingly limitless horizons? Then come with us. We shall be pleased to take you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Before we leave the coast here is a small fishing village. Shall we stop and tell of God’s promises concerning this earth? We visit a small shack. No one home? Turning to go we notice a tall, barefoot young fisherman limping from the water with his day’s catch. He listens quietly, invites us inside, looks over the Bible aids we show him and selects five books. “You must be very much interested in the Bible, sir,” we venture. “I am.” “For how long?” “Two months now.” We are puzzled. “But why since then?” “Well, two months ago my wife and I moved into this shack and when cleaning out some rubbish we found these books.” And from a table he hands us two tattered, salt-stained Bible </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">aids, Government</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Life.</span><span class="font14"> Earnestly he continues: “They have the truth and I want to learn more about it. These books you have contain the same information.” He had studied those two old books through while out in his boat fishing. Readily he accepts our suggestion that we help him that night to learn how to study, and it is then a real joy to see by lamplight his and his wife’s expressions as they learn of the waters of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We are moving inland now and as we travel we shall tell you a little about this “outback” </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">country. The word is really a </span><span class="font14">colloquial term describing the area some distance from the more populated parts that are concentrated in a fairly narrow belt around parts </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">of the</span><span class="font14"> coast line. Inland the population decreases as the rainfall figures drop, so that the main reason for the outback’s being that way is lack of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Now you see your first emu. You will not catch him though, for the name of his family in Greek is </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Dromaius,</span><span class="font14"> “swift footed,” and that he is. However, he is very curious and we may be able to play on that to attract him so you can get a closer look. We shall get out of the car slowly, get down on our haunches and whistle softly while bobbing up and down. Several more birds appear, run up a little, then away and, finally, run right up close so you can see their beady eyes and hear their bellies rumbling. Now, on our feet, clap our hands, watch those birds run!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">That movement of gray in the bushes, </span><span class="font14">watch it! There it goes! A startled kangaroo is hopping along the roadside and we can pace it quite easily, for there is a fence between it and the open country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Our speedometer registers 30 miles per hour; we can almost touch it as we pace together. Then, over the fence, high in the air, it bounds away. These animals have been known to jump timber ten and a half feet high. You have seen only one, but later you will see them and their young by the hundreds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Entering Dingo Country</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Our driver has stopped the car. Another gate. This one you notice is higher and stronger than most These are dog fences, erected to keep back the marauding dingo (native wild dog), a despised killer of sheep, with a bounty on his head. His eerie howling may make you shudder with fright.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“By the way,&quot; you ask, “what is the attitude of people generally toward religion out here?” Weil, the lady at our next call succinctly answers that question for you. She is overjoyed to receive something practical to help her train her children and wistfully says concerning the religion with which she has been associated so long, &quot;You know our church is so spiritual, so lovely, but oh so very unsatisfactory.” Why this attitude? It appears to be caused by the religious leaders themselves. Let us call on this mission house. Kindly they invite us for lunch. Happily we begin to speak to them about the Bible. You are astounded when they say, “Look, you are welcome to our hospitality, but please don’t talk about these things.” Is it any wonder, then, that the people in this dry land are thirsty for Bible truth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I see you are noticing the change in vegetation now. .That stunted bush is known as saltbush. It and other droughtresistant herbage are edible to stock and produce the greatest quantity of merino wool per sheep in the world. Sheep bred in the outback areas are keenly sought after because of robust constitution, and they come to the more fertile and closely settled areas in hundreds of thousands. But </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">you </span><span class="font12">are. indeed privileged to be here now, for the outback has had a rare fall of good rain and you can see the “desert blossom.” As far aS your eye can see in this clear atmosphere is a sea of flowers; the snowlike everlastings, the yellow of the billy-buttons—not shy blooms these, but hundreds of miles of color. Reds, yellows, pinks —colors run riot on what, In a few months, will be sandy, waterless wastes. But what is that patch of blood red? We pick some of these glorious blooms, and think that had Isaiah been in Australia he probably would have written, “and the desert shall blossom as the pea,&quot; for this is the Sturt desert pea. When the desert blossoms this pea is one of its first products. Its handsome, glaucous, feathery foliage covers large areas of ground with great rapidity, and within a few weeks the noble blossoms, three to four inches in length, deep red with an almost black patch at the base of the keel, appear. These do not &quot;waste their fragrance on the desert air,” for they are a joy to us and, no doubt, a pleasure to Jehovah as he contemplates the whole earth soon to blossom forth like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A colorful hill covered with the dull-red wild hops catches our eye on the right, but just at present we must concentrate on getting our car through this cane grass. Higher than we are tall, it hinders our view for a while, but soon we are through. Our camp and evening meal excite your curiosity and soon the paldte-tempting aroma of grilling meat brings you to the fire. Your hand falters as you reach for the meat. “Kangaroo steak? Weil, I’ll try it.” The tail, when next day made into soup, takes your vote too for the nicest soup you have ever tasted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Civilization Creeps In</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Mark the ways the outback has of overcoming its isolation. Single t</span><span class="font12" style="text-decoration:underline;">elephone wires</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">string occasionally from tree to tree; in more remote places the pedal wireless is used. Some properties own private planes, small towns have aerial taxis, even the doctor comes by plane here. Mechanization has pushed the horse into the background, jeeps and motors being used on rapidly modernizing properties. Ingenuity is displayed in obtaining and conserving that all-important water. Large shallow V-shaped galvanized-iron structures close to the ground catch for underground tanks what little rain there is, and the brackish artesian water is familiar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In a small settlement where we have stopped to tell the people about the time when this land will be plentifully supplied with water, one of our party comes out of a house to say: “You’d better come in and see this fellow, he is very interested in the Bible.” “Are you Jehovah’s witnesses?” he asks. “I thought so, look.” And he shows us many familiar old Bible aids, studied and marked. We are glad to meet him and when we study together he is pleased to learn that he too can help in dispensing the water of truth. This man was educated in a convent and it seems that he lived next door to one of Jehovah’s witnesses who practiced his public speaking in the bam. The only audience he could get was the small boy next door, but that small boy grew and remembered what he had been told. Today, he rejoices in his knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Truly, we have been fortunate in seeing this land at its best, beautified by that essential to life, water. Once in the memory of living man a total transformation has taken place in the &quot;dead heart” of Australia, with great salt pans converted into an inland sea, surging with waves whipped by the wind. Today these waters are evaporating and the myriads of birds, the swarms of ducks and swans, are diminishing. High overhead the carrion-eating birds, soaring on outstretched wings in their ceaseless spirals, bear mute testimony to the work they perform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When we see the beauty brought to this land by chance water, we reflect on what Jehovah’s promise of ‘rain in due season will mean. (Ezekiel 34:26) But it also makes us deeply thankful that, even now, the waters of truth bid the seeds of life to germinate in the hearts of men. By seashore, by lakeside, in desert and by campfire, joyful faces shine as honest-hearted ones have the opportunity to learn of Jehovah’s new world. Flowers of rarer beauty than even those of the desert are these “trees of righteousness,” who bear fruit that Jehovah may be glorified. Their eyes light up when we assure them that this “glowing sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water.&quot; —Isaiah 61:3; 35:7, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font14"> is a grand privilege to work among these people. See the lazy spiral of smoke betokening another human habitation? They are waiting for us. Coming?</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CHURCHES: DEN OF SINNERS?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;[ An hour before her execution December 18 for the kidnaping and murder of a small child, Bonnie Brown Heady told religious leaders who called at her Missouri State Prison death cell: “I used to go to church.” Why did she quit? Because in church were married men “who’d had a date with a blond the night before.” &quot;Hypocrites,” she called them. The Associated Press’ report of the minister’s reply shid: “Hypocrites? asked her minister. Why—church is the place where sinners belong. Christ came to redeem all sinners.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">(IpHiong Kong's r Christmas Bonfire</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">By <sup>u</sup> Awoke I” correipondant in Hong Kong</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">B</span><span class="font14">RITAIN’S colonial outpost, Hong Kong, had its worst fire ever on December 25, 1953. The evening festive program was getting well under way when searing flames swirled around the bowl of a great and ugly squatter area, reducing it to ashes in a few hectic hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Before the wall of flame a tide of 60,000 people fled. Streets were choked for blocks around, as this huge army shifted camp: every family elbowing the other to peg a claim on some sidewalk whereon to dump its gear, and, leaving younger members on guard, fighting their way back through the living stream to retrieve belongings not yet gobbled by the fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The area that went up in smoke was roughly heart-shaped, and, except for one side, ringed around by steep, bare hills. There were only about four outlets on the open side. All converged on to a main arterial road, and through these bolt holes swarmed a double stream of struggling humans. The uncanny sound that arose from this mob and mingled with the tearing, hissing surge of the fire registered a unique and unpleasant memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Squatter areas are like ulcers. On the mainland peninsula of Kowloon, where this fire took place, illegal structures, mainly composed of light timbers and tar paper, had dotted the open spaces in valleys adjacent to built-up sections. They had eaten their way over the surface levels, bit by bit encroaching on the hillsides, climbing tier on tier up the slopes till there was not an opening left. Here were no roads, only narrow, winding passages; no running water, just unsanitary wells. For drains, filthy ditches stagnated around the squalid structures. On seeing such a sight one wonders why the fires and epidemics are not even more prevalent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Hong Kong’s squatter problem is a product of this “age of the refugee.” When the red terror of communism sent in a floodtide of refugees, any kind of old house assumed an amazing new value. Hong Kong’s families tightened up in their quarters and made room for an incredible number of others. But the poor and unfortunate just spilled over into squatter areas, creating a prize headache for an area that had already had its town-planning and waterconservation schemes snarled by Japan’s bid for Eastern domination. With 2,221 persons to the square mile Hong Kong became the most densely populated country in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Calamitous fires were inevitable. Five major ones struck during 1953, the first four destroying 3,011 huts and rendering 12,589 people homeless. But their total was to be completely eclipsed by a tremendous conflagration that came at the year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">While the small &quot;Christian” minority were busy singing of the blessings of Christmas day, and while the so-called “pagans” were burning their fragrant incense to the gods that guard their doors, a small kerosene lamp fell from its nail, setting afire a rubber solvent, inflaming the bedding and destroying the hut. Alarm was raised, but the fire leaped from hut to hut along the northern slope, and the day long feared was here! The long expectation almost robbed the event of its appalling seriousness.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19540608_files/g_E_19540608-13.png" alt="" style="width:226pt;height:132pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">The flaring mass created for itself what has been termed a “fire storm,” a swirling vortex of flame that was due to encompass the whole circle of adjacent villages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Unable to cope with the blaze in the jungle of huts, the fire fighters concentrated on saving the nearby city buildings, but, when the swing of the wind blinded the neighborhood with heat and smoke, even this was no small feat. Sometimes the dense curtain would lift and send the scorching radiant heat clear through the back windows of the Watch Tower Society’s Kowloon missionary home, on the main road adjoining the area; but when there was only one line of houses between us and the flame, the fire storm moved around in the basin. The intervening line of homes had to be abandoned, but except for blistered paint and melted putty they suffered little, being of concrete construction. It was the wood and tar of the huts that seemed to draw the fire, and being mere frame structures they did not last long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In about five hours the area, estimated at about fifty acres, was a reeking uninhabited wilderness, and its more than 12,000 families—comprising 60,000 homeless persons—cluttered every available foot of pavement in the surrounding streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Street sleepers—and these are a pathetic sight at any time—have long been common in Hong Kong’s thoroughfares, but seldom could there have been an occasion here when so many have been thrown out in one night. Soon a new kind of squatter area, little booths of bags, wicker, tar paper and pressed board, was set up along the sidewalks of one street after another. The gutter, close at hand, was of the utmost utility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Social welfare and relief organizations went into action while the fire still burned. Clothing and blankets were distributed, free meals were arranged and gifts of money were handed out. Donations came from several lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As for sanitary measures, it is said that living on the streets is more hygenic than living under squatter-area conditions. On the streets a cleansing service can regularly wash down the pavement, during which time everyone is required to take up his belongings; but in the streetless squatter area no such scheme can operate. Down the center of one wide thoroughfare hundreds of public latrines and washhouses were erected; squatter areas are bereft of any public facility. Even temporary camp hospitals were set up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The site of the fire now became a bustling hive of activity. Earth-moving equipment bit into the hillocks and leveled the hollows while sites were prepared for row upon row of cheap but substantial two-story blocks of houses built of standardized, prefabricated fireproof materials. The area rebuilds, but the problem remains. Only more inviting conditions in China would set the ebb tide flowing out of the colony. Every city service is taxed to the limit. The water supply has three times the number drawing on it that was originally intended. Housing is short, business is slack, and even without the fire loss Hong Kong’s street sleepers were on the increase. How immense the problem is is evident when you walk among the street dwellers. A great number are home all day; they</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">have no work. They seem quite content to remain-camped where they are, so impervious to their woe-begone plight that it is not easy to kindle a spark of interest in the heartening news of a new world of righteousness now at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The age of the refugee creates a horrible plight, but it is not a problem without a solution. As with the other difficulties earth faces today, this problem, too, will be abolished under the righteous blessings of Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Ct'T’HE works of Jehovah are great, 1 sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.” (Psalm 111:2, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font12"> Among the most amazing works of God with which man is becoming ever more acquainted is man's own mind. His physical systems, such as the circulatory, respiratory, endocrine, etc., marvelous though they are, are extremely simple, to compare with the wonderful workings of his mind as situated in his brain. In his efforts to understand his mind man has developed what he calls the science of psychology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The term “psychology” is formed from two Greek roots, which are familiar to all students of the Bible: </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">psy-che',</span><span class="font12"> meaning “soul, mind or life,” and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">log'os,</span><span class="font12"> meaning “word or discourse.” Man’s knowledge concerning the workings of his mind was largely in the nature of a philosophy or was dependent upon religion until the latter part of the eighteenth century, although it is only within the last seventy-five years that psychology has begun to emerge as an experimental science. However, it still has a long way to go before it becomes as uniform, exact and dependable as, say, chemistry, physics and biology. What might, help it along this line would be for it to stop trying to usurp the field occupied by religion. It is partly due to this propensity on the part of psychology that we find such a variety of schools, theories and contradictory opinions in it that we are forcibly reminded of the confusion found in organized religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">-Yes, in the sphere of psychology it seems that there is hardly a theory advanced by a psychologist that is not qualified, limited or contradicted by other “authorities.” Because of this it might be said that much of psychology is still in a state of flux, and that its truths are relative rather than absolute. In fact, we are blandly advised that what is truth today may become error tomorrow, and that what is error today may become truth tomorrow. Such a state of affairs would seem to indicate that high-mindedness and dogmatism are out of place in psychology; but not so, the psychologists merely do not know how to blush.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Psychology covers a wide area. By it men seek to understand the mental abilities, the emotions, the memories and the motives of man. Because of the wide field it covers it is broken up into many subdivisions. Among those we shall consider at this time are physiological psychology, comparative psychology, genetic psychology, abnormal psychology, child psychology and applied psychology. Others are social psychology, differential psychology,</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">academic psychology and the psychology of personality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">In addition to these fields or areas of psychology, there are different methods, avenues of approach, known as schools of psychology. The four main ones are the existential or structural psychology, the Gestalt psychology, the behavioristic school of psychology and the psychoanalytical school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Physiological Psychology</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Physiological psychology deals with the relationship of the body to the mind, and just how the sense organs, the muscles, the nervous systems and the ductless glands affect and are affected by the mind. It concerns itself with just where the various mental faculties are located in the brain, and by means of many painstaking experiments much knowledge has been gained as to just how sensations reach the mind, and to what degree the mind can discriminate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Thus the eyes have been found to have four receptors, which are susceptible to the wave lengths of red, green, blue and yellow, reminding one of the way color TV works. The retina of the eye has two kinds of endorgans, “cones,” which can distinguish color and fine kinds of form, and “rods,” of which there are more and which respond only to light intensities, white, gray and black.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">The inner ear has been found to have tiny fibers on its membrane, each fiber corresponding to a different pitch and being set in motion by it, similar to the way the strings of a piano would be set in motion by corresponding tones. Differences in </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">timber,</span><span class="font19"> such as between a violin and a flute, are accounted for by different sets of overtones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">As for the sense of taste, it seems that only four or five basic taste qualities exist: sweet, salt, sour, bland and bitter. Regarding the sense of smell there are several theories. One holds that there are nine basic odors with several subdivisions in each, while another has demonstrated that basically there are only six: fragrant, fruity, resinous, spicy, putrid and burned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Physiological psychology does not limit our senses to five. In addition to the four senses of hearing, seeing, tasting and smelling it lists four cutaneous or skin senses, of warmth, cold, pressure and pain; it also knows a muscle sense, a balance sense and a movement or motion sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Responses to externa! stimuli (our movements caused by outside factors) fall into one of three classes: either they are unconscious movements that depend upon the spinal cord and are independent of the brain, and known as reflexes; or they are semiconscious; or they are conscious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Extensive tests have been made showing the effect upon the mind and nervous system of alcohol, tobacco, caffeine and other drugs. All such come within the purview of physiological psychology. It has also concerned itself with the way the ductless glands affect personality; some even term these glands the “creators of personality.” Among other aspects of this field of psychology are tests determining the ability of man to judge weights by his pressure and muscle senses; distances by comparison; the speed with which we respond to certain sensations, in which connection it has been ascertained that we respond quicker to sounds than to lights, quicker to pressures or electric shocks than to other forms of stimuli. All such come within the field of physiological psychology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Genetic and Abnormal Psychology</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Genetic psychology endeavors to ascertain to what extent we are what we are because of heredity and to what extent because of environment. Much of what is known in this field psychologists owe to that pioneer in genetics, the Austrian</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">monk Mendel. Genetics concerns itself with chromosomes and genes. Each cell of the human body has forty-eight chromosomes, except the matured germ cells, which have only twenty-four each. When the male and female germ cells unite at conception they form one cell that again has the full fortyeight chromosomes. To the extent that the genes in these chromosomes are dominant, to that extent they will determine the characteristics of the individual to be born. The genes are the carriers of physical, mental and emotional characteristics, and are so small that it is said that the genes of the some two and a half billion of the human race could all be contained in a thimble!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">That heredity plays a vital role in mental health has been proved by much research. Thus of 480 descendants of a French, mentally deficient, illegitimate son of a feebleminded mother, 143 were feeble-minded and only 46 were of normal mentality. The effect of heredity has also been demonstrated by research with identical twins. These have been found to be so much alike that by knowing how one responded to certain tests one could accurately predict how the other would respond. Yet, indicating that environment is a factor was the evidence that identical twins reared in different homes were somewhat less similar in responses than those reared in the same home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Because of this fact, and others of a similar nature, we find strong disagreement as to the importance of heredity. Indicating the importance of environment are the examples of children that had been abandoned in forests and grew up with wild animals. Brought into civilized surroundings, these jungle or “feral” (wild, undomesticated) children found it extremely difficult to walk on two feet instead of crawling on all fours, to eat like humans instead of like the brute creation, etc. However, some insist that there are no truly “feral” children and that what appeared to be such were imbeciles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Abnormal psychology, as its name implies, deals with abnormal mental and emotional states. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Psychiatry</span><span class="font14"> and the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">psychiatrist</span><span class="font14"> are concerned with the cure of those thus abnormal. Abnormal psychology recognizes two general divisions, those whose problem is intellectual, the feeble-minded, and those whose problem is essentially emotional, the insane. The feeble-minded are divided into three groups, the moron, whose mental age is between eight and eleven; the imbecile, whose mental age is between four and seven, and the idiot, with the mental age of three or less. By proper supervision the moron can be made useful to society, especially on farms or as a laborer, etc., and even the imbecile can, by others’ exercising patience with him, be trained to be useful to a limited degree. Both of such classes, however, should be in small communities or on farms rather than in big cities where existence becomes too complex for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Insanity is divided into two general groups, constitutional and functional. The difference has been illustrated as follows: When a part in an automobile engine gets broken or lost, such is a constitutional flaw; but when the carburetor or the spark plugs need adjusting, or the gasoline line is clogged, that is a functional flaw. There are several types of each of these two groups of insanity. The constitutional responds less readily to treatment than the functional, although its most common form, general paralysis caused by syphilitic infection, has responded to artificially induced fevers and other forms of treatment concerning which there is much debate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The most common form of functional insanity is dementia praecox or schizophrenia (meaning a splitting of the personality, actually a breaking away from reality). Other common forms are manic-depressive psychoses, marked by alternating states of elation and depression; and paranoia. In general, such conditions represent the culmination of failures to make successful adjustments to one's environment. As to the treatment of these, here much also can be said pro and con; in fact, their treatment generally can be termed the most disgraceful aspect of modern civilization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Other Fields of Psychology</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">By comparative psychology is meant the study of and experimenting with the lower animals in order to ascertain information that would apply to humans. Based upon the evolution theory and seemingly spearheaded by those who have little faith in God, their theories have often done more harm than good. Typical of this type of unsound reasoning is the observation said to have been made by a self-constituted authority on sex to the effect that man must adjust his notions as regards sexual morality in view of the behavior of the lower animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Child psychology deals with children from birth to twelve years of age, and its confusing theories must bear no small part of the blame for present-day juvenile delinquency. Ridiculing the Scriptural rule that “foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him,” they have proceeded on the theory that to inhibit a child will stunt its genius. But instead of a crop of geniuses, they have harvested a crop of delinquents and vandals.—Proverbs 22:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Indicative of the many uses to which psychology can be put is the field known as applied psychology. It is used in business, for advertising and personal relations; in industry, to procure more production, such as by instituting rest periods; it is used by doctors and lawyers; by it the observation has been made that women are more conscientious automobile drivers, break fewer laws and figure in fewer accidents, but men are more skillful drivers. In politics it has been demonstrated that the emotional appeal will procure more votes than the well-reasoned one. And perhaps in the field of education applied psychology is used more than in any other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To help appreciate the difference between the fields and schools of psychology we might use farming for an analogy. The location and the nature of its crops would correspond to the fields of psychology, whereas the methods the farmer employs, organic farming, mechanized farming, rotation of crops or use of commercial fertilizers, might be likened to the schools of psychology. Concerning this please see the article &quot;Psychology—Its Schools” in a succeeding issue of this magazine.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Could There Be a Parallel?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">The March 1 issue of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek</span><span class="font13"> reported that the First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, &quot;the biggest Baptist church in the world,” is “bigger now than it ever was.” Accompanying pictures showed members playing basketball, engaging in woodworking, bowling, and the like, on the church's equipment. Other church facilities include a roof garden for socials, a commercial parking garage and a 10,000-square-foot roller-skating rink. Perhaps this will draw even more members. The book of John, chapter 6, records that after Jesus had fed the 5,000, he said disapprovingly to those who again the next day followed him: “Most truly I say to you, You are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate from the loaves and were satisfied.” Could there be a parallel?</span></p><img src="g_E_19540608_files/g_E_19540608-15.png" alt="" style="width:303pt;height:72pt;">
<p><span class="font0">One Hope for Jew and Gentile</span></p>
<p><span class="font29">T</span><span class="font19">IE one hope for both the Jew and the Gentile lies in Jehovah’s promise of a “new heavens and a new earth?’ The Hebrew prophet Isaiah wrote of it in the sixty-fifth and sixty-sixth chapters of his book, and the Jewish Christian the apostle Peter expressed this same hope at 2 Peter 3:13 </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">(New World Trans.),</span><span class="font19"> saying: “But there are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell?’ Thus Peter shows that Christians and the faithful prophets looked forward to the fulfillment of the same promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">The new heavens and new earth that Peter and Isaiah wrote about are Jehovah God’s arrangement for the vindication of his name and for the blessing of all the families of the earth. Both the Jew and the Gentile are of a common father, Adam. Since both are descendants of Adam, both, then, are under sin and condemnation of death. Both, therefore, must accept Jehovah's provision for their redemption. Both of them must look to the one God who makes all of this possible. For the both of them there is but one hope, the kingdom of Almighty God Jehovah, ‘For there is no partiality with God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">The hope of the Jew and the Gentile at this time rests in Jehovah’s purpose and power to establish a new earth by means of his kingdom. The new earth does not mean a new planet, but a new righteous system for the beautifying of this earth, ipaking it what God purposed it to be in the first place, a glorious footstool under his feet Through his prophet Isaiah, Jehovah says: <sup>?t</sup>Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool”; “and I will make the place of my feet glorious.” The earth is not “a glorious footstool” today, with its crime and corruption, poverty and death. Totalitarian rulers with their slavelabor camps do not make this earth a glorious place either. Nor do any of the filthy cities with their slums and crowded living conditions, nor do the eroded wastelands and mismanaged farms contribute any glory to this footstool, earth. It is quite obvious that this promise of God to make this earth a glorious place is yet to be fulfilled. Even though centuries have passed since Jehovah made this promise, we can still trust implicitly in it, because Jeho-vah God’s words are sure. He renews man’s faith in his promises with these words: “I have spoken it, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it?’ He reassures man: “So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it?’—Isaiah 66:1; 60:13; 46:11; 55:11; 45:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">With this positive assurance from Jehovah God the Creator, all mankind can look ahead with hope, knowing that God will not allow man to desolate the earth with his atomic or hydrogen bombs, nor will God permit man to ruin the earth through other means of selfishness. Instead he says that he will “bring to ruin those ruining the earth.” His purpose of a glorious new e^rth for the plac<sub>p</sub>e of his feet will be fully realized in his due time, we can depend upon that.—Revelation 11:18, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">In the Garden of Eden and during Solomon’s reign in the Promised Land God</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">gave man a taste of what the new earth would be like. Eden was a paradise, a perfect home. Map was perfect ip body and </span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font14">d. There was </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">no</span><span class="font14"> sickness, sorrow or death. Crime and corruption were unknown in Eden. The earth prospered and man was happy, thoroughly content. It was God’s purpose that through the fulfillment of the procreation mandate, to multiply and fill the earth with perfect offspring, this paradise would be spread until it covered the whole earth. It would have been a glorious, paradise earth. That was God's original purpose and it is still his purpose, because Jehovah says of himself: “For I, Jehovah, change not.’’—Malachi 3:6, zlm. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Stan. Ver.;</span><span class="font14"> Genesis 1:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It was Satan’s rebellion and man’s disobedience that halted for a time the fulfillment of this divine purpose, but it was not thwarted. God immediately assured man that through the seed of the woman the promise of a new earth would be fully realized. This assurance from Jehovah inspired men down through the ages to look forward to that day in faith. Because of this promise Enoch was moved to prophesy against a wicked generation. Abraham left his country and relatives behind, and was content to dwell in the land of Canaan as a temporary resident so that he might some day see the fulfillment of Jehovah’s purpose in respect to our earth. Moses “refused to be called the son of the daughter of Pharaoh, choosing to be ill-treated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin, because he esteemed the reproach of the Christ as riches greater than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked intently toward the payment of the reward.” All of these faithful men were “awaiting the city having real foundations and the builder and creator of which is God.” This “city,” of course, is the kingdom of God, the hope of all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">—Hebrews 11, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.;</span><span class="font14"> Jude 14,15; Genesis 12:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Do the Christians also look forward to the full realization of this kingdom and its blessings? Yes, they do. In fact, they pray for it continually. In the words of Jesus, they say: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth.” Christians are commanded to keep on &quot;seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness.” They believe even as the faithful prophets did that the head of this kingdom would be of the tribe of Judah, a descendant of David; that his name would be called “Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace,” and that “of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end.” Christians also believe as did the faithful prophets that this One would be born in Bethlehem, of a virgin, that his life would be one of ministry, that he would be falsely accused, impaled on a tree, buried with the rich and raised without seeing corruption. As the prophets of God taught, so Christians believe that this One would be not only a prophet but a king; that in his kingdom “all families of the earth” would be blessed; that he “will judge between the nations, and will decide concerning many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” —Matthew 6:10, 33, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.; </span><span class="font14">Isaiah 9:6, 7; 2:4, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This hope of a Messianic kingdom is what the prophets proclaimed' and it is also what Christians declare “in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” (Matthew 24:14, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans.)</span><span class="font14"> It is the kingdom of God by the promised seed, the seed of Abraham, Christ Jesus.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">Indonesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">I</span><span class="font14">NDONESIA is an island nation with great wealth, picturesque volcanoes and a cheerful people. It is a tropical land of rice fields, banana fronds and coconut palms. It is a young nation, only recently having obtained freedom from colonial rule, and it successfully provides for its vast population without the abject poverty of many Asiatic lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In recent years, however, some Indonesians have found a greater, true freedom, the freedom that comes from hearing and following the Word of God. It is to such ones and the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Indonesia that our attention is attracted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Most Indonesians are Moslem by religion, though the people often know very little about their doctrines. Most of these people still have a strong belief in evil spirits which must be propitiated in order to ward off disease and evil. Magicians are prominent in the villages, and black magic is prevalent. In fact, we might say that Islam religion has merely been superimposed over the original animistic beliefs. Even a great proportion of those professing Christianity also engage in forms of spiritism. The professed Christians, to counteract the influence of black magic, which they believe comes from the Devil, still practice what they call white magic, which they think comes from God. So despite the fact that the so-called Christian religion has been established in some parts for four or five generations or more, the people still sadly lack basic Bible knowledge. The work of Jehovah’s witnesses is now filling the need for a complete understanding of God’s Word, the Bible, in many of these parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Organized preaching by Jehovah’s witnesses was done in Indonesia as early as the year 1931. During the time of the Japanese occupation the work was broken up and numerous brothers were put in prison. Some died in the concentration camps. In 1947 the work got under way again when ten persons began going from house to house to preach the good news of the now-established kingdom of God. In 1951 the Watch Tower Society was able to send fourteen Gilead-trained missionaries to Indonesia, and this helped to expand the work further. Today there are 170 persons actively preaching the good news to their fellow men in Indonesia. They are organized in five congregations and five isolated groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Here in Indonesia, as throughout the world, the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is increasing by leaps and bounds. In the four months previous to this writing some sixty persons have been baptized, many of whom were previously Moslem. A Seventh-day Adventist missionary recently lamented that they had given up trying to interest the Moslems, because in all the time the Seventh-day Adventist mission has been working in Indonesia they have converted only one Moslem. However, we find many Moslems now taking an intelligent interest in the message of the Kingdom and quite a number have become zealous witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Working from house to house in a tropical country is no easy job. The glaring sun makes things very uncomfortable at times. So many conclude that door-to-door preaching is only for the young and strong. But not so. AH can do it, as proved by the following example: In the city of Surabaja there is an old sister of 83 years who regularly, without fail, every week works from house to house and conducts Bible studies with interested people. Two years ago this little old lady was the only preaching witness of Jehovah in the city of Surabaja, but now the congregation there numbers fifty-seven and is growing every month. She was very happy to receive the assistance of the six missionaries whom the Watch Tower Society sent to that city about eighteen months ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Before the missionaries arrived in Surabaja, she had contacted a young girl of 19 years in a town about sixty miles away. This girl accepted the truth and began a study with her younger sister, who also became a witness. From the missionaries they learned of the importance of the house-to-house work. Although having no previous training at all in door-to-door preaching, they began to work their own town systematically. They now have Studies with eight families in the town, and hope soon to </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">become full-time pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Visiting the town of Padang, the circuit servant called on a man who said that he too was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Some twenty-five years ago he obtained the book </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><span class="font14"> and some other publications from one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He was a preacher in a church at the time, but upon learning the truth of Jehovah’s Word he quit his job as a preacher. He was offered a job teaching theology in an Indonesian seminary and then was offered a job as chaplain in the Indonesian army, both of which offers he refused. He was overjoyed to come into contact again with Jehovah’s witnesses and to learn all the latest truths and obtain the latest books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There is no doubt that the Word of Jehovah is a living word, a powerful word that is able to effect great changes in the lives of those who receive it into a good heart, and to provide true happiness and the real Christian freedom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The “Uncivilized” Murder Plot</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$■ What promised to be the richest intelligence defection won by the West since World War II turned up in February, though not publicly known until April. It was the case of Nikolai Khokhlov, a captain in the dread M.V.D. (Ministry of Internal Affairs), Russia’s secret police. In early 1954 Khokhlov was sent into West Germany to assassinate an anticommunist Russian. Instead of carrying out his mission, the M.V.D. captain disclosed the plot to his intended victim and then turned himself over to U.S. authorities, requesting political asylum. Khokhlov then revealed a wealth of information to U.S. Intelligence about Soviet espionage and Russia’s secret spy laboratory. One of the products of the M.V.D. laboratory was enough to send chills down the spine of the most robust mystery-story lover. It was a false cigarette case containing a silent, battery-fired pistol that shot dumdum slugs smeared with a mixture of potassium cyanide and gum into assassination victims. Why had Khokhlov defected? He told authorities that his conscience and the urgings of his wife combined to convince him not to carry out his mission. Officials felt that there was another factor involved: that he feared liquidation since he was a former underling of the purged Lavrenti Beria. Though thankful for the gold mine of information that Khokhlov brought, the U.S. sent a note to Russia protesting the “outrageous and uncivilized” murder plot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The Extraordinary Escape</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When Vladamir Petrov, M.V.D. chief in Australia, fled the Soviet Embassy in Canberra and received asylum, his wife apparently remained loyal to the Communists, since she told newsmen: “My husband has been kidnaped.” But five days later, as two Soviet couriers were putting her aboard a Russian-bound airliner at the airport in Sydney, some persons claimed she screamed in Russian: “Save me, I do not want to go!&quot; So at Darwin, the last Australian stop, police boarded the plane, disarmed two Russian couriers and gave Mrs. Petrov an opportunity to escape Communist control, if she so desired. When the plane left Australia Mrs. Petrov stayed behind, Moscow quickly demanded that Australia surrender Petrov and his wife. When Canberra refused, Moscow recalled its whole fifty-man embassy staff. The diplomatic rupture did not disturb Australia, since relations with Moscow had been unproductive anyway. However, economic trouble appeared in the offing when Russia announced its Intention to stop buying Australian wool. This may result in a serious drop in wool prices. Meanwhile, the Soviet Embassy in Canberra sold its cars and equipment, and in Moscow the Australian Embassy closed up indefinitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">U.S.: “Off-the-Record”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">•$&gt; Vice-President Richard Nixon is known as a man who is careful of what he says. He sits in with the top-level National Security Council, attends Cabinet meetings and knows inner secrets. Speaking off the record to the American Society of Newspaper Editors on April 16, Mr. Nixon said that the U.S. might have to send troops to Indo-China if the French quit fighting there. This remark, from such a well-informed source, touched off world-wide diplomatic commotion, alarmed congressmen and mothers of soldiers, and caused the newspaper dignitaries to criticize Nixon’s statement. Declared Chicago publisher Colonel McCormick: “He talks like a gibbering idiot.” Later, to calm commotion, Nixon explained that weakness leads to war, so the U.S. has decided to get tough. This policy should prevent, he explained, the temptation for Communists to start a bigger war. When Secretary of State Dulles was asked about Nixon’s remark, he said the vice-president “answered a hypothetical question in terms of his personal opinion on an off-the-record basis.” “Do you agree with Mr. Nixon?” newspapermen asked Dulles. He responded: &quot;[Nixon] answered a hypothetical question on an off-the-record basis. I prefer not to answer a hypothetical question on an on-the-record basis.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Japan: Narrow-Margin Votes</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; In 65 years no Japanese premier has ever survived a vote of “no confidence” in the Diet (Parliament). But this pattern</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">changed (4/24) when the Socialists offered a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote against Premier Yoshida, whose government has been engaged in a furious political battle over charges of corruption in high places. As the Diet convened to decide Yoshida’s fate, demonstrators showered legislators with Yoshida-must-go leaflets. Despite the furor Yoshida sat impassively, twirling his silverheaded cane. When voting was completed Yoshida proved that a premier of Japan could survive a “no confidence” vote: he won by a vote of 228 to 208. &quot;Narrow but safe,” sighed a relieved Yoshida supporter. This victory for Yoshida's conservative government assured the ratification of the long-debated Mutual Defense Assistance Treaty with the U.S. The upper House of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">National </span><span class="font13">Diet approved the treaty, but the vote was unexpectedly narrow: 124-68, with 58 abstaining. With 250 members in the upper House this meant that the treaty was ratified with one fewer than an actual majority. Thus the voting spotlighted the deep division still existing in Japan in regard to an alliance with the West.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Aid for Iraq</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">♦ In its program to erect a Mid-East defense system the U.S. is sending arms aid to Turkey and Iran. For two years Egypt has sought to obtain similar aid from the U.S., but , because of the Anglo-Egyptian dispute over the Suez Canal Washington has not granted Cairo's requests. Hence Egypt has endeavored to keep the Arab world aloof from defense arrangements with the West until her demands on the Suez Canal are met. But Egypt’s hopes to keep Iraq in line with this policy were shattered recently when </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Baghdad</span><span class="font13"> requested aid from the U.S. In April Washington decided to grant Baghdad's request. When an Iraqi announcement termed the arms aid &quot;unconditional,” there was grave anxiety in Israel. But the U.S. State Department explained that the war materiel would not be delivered If there was </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">an</span><span class="font13"> indication it would be used against Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Mexico: A “Painful Measure” </span><span class="font13"># When a government decides to devalue its currency, the action rarely comes as a complete surprise. But Mexico kept its secret well. So when the government devalued the peso by 30 per cent (4/171, both citizens and foreign observers were taken by immense surprise. This was because Mexico still had cash reserves in excess of $200,000,000 and an unused emergency credit fund of $100,000,000. Why devaluation ? Flight of capital is given as the primary reason. And as the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">secretary of the treasury</span><span class="font13"> explained, the only alternative to “this painful measure” was cumbersome controls on foreign exchange. Mexico hopes that devaluation will discourage nonessential imports, increase exports, reverse the flow of capital, stimulate internal investment and attract more tourists. For the American tourist it means that his dollar will go farther. But for the Mexican it means that a U.S. item, formerly costing $10.00 or 86.5 pesos may now cost him 125 pesos. Nor are foreign investors enthralled by the action. Declared a French banker visiting Mexico, when devaluation broke into his survey of investment possibilities: &quot;If Mexico is to be known as a land of devaluation, Europeans will look elsewhere to place their money.&quot; Mexico’s over-all devaluation in the past seven years now comes to about 61 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Argentina’s No. 2 Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Since his term lasts until </span><span class="font13">1958, President Juan Peron was not up for re-election. Yet in April’s elections Per6n vigorously campaigned for his hand-picked candidate for vicepresident, Rear Admiral Alberto Teisaire. Also at stake were half the seats in Congress —made up of 175 Peronistas and 14 Radicals or oppositionists. The campaigning was not uneventful. When Peronistas disrupted Radical rhIlies by .jeers, fights, knifings, gunfire and tear-gassing broke out, all of which resulted in 62 persons being injured and one being killed. On election day three more persons were killed. Election results: the Radicals lost one or two seats in Congress, giving Perdn a clear-cut victory. Elected vice-president was Perdu's choice, Alberto Teisaire, who now becomes the No. 2 man in Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A Nitrogen Bomb?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&amp; In April Japan's scientific world was agog over rumors </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">that the Soviet Union had detonated</span><span class="font13"> a &quot;nitrogen bomb.” What the effects of such a bomb would be can well be imagined from the statement of Osaka University physicist Tsunezaburb Asada, who observed that 30 of these weapons could annihilate all life on earth within five years. When the N-bomb rumors reached Britain and the U.S., the reaction was everything from dignified doubt to hearty laughter. But in theory an N-bomb should be possible by fusing nitrogen atoms and by triggering the device with an H-bomb. Since the air is 78 per cent nitrogen, would it be possible to stop nitrogen fusion, once started? The general view was that the nitrogen bomb would be too much like a “Frankenstein bomb” to invite scientists to make them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">ILS.: The Salk Test Begins</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">On April 26 a nationwide test of a vaccine that is hoped will provide immunity against </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">infantile paralysis (poliomyelitis)</span><span class="font13"> began. About 900,000 children throughout the U.S. will participate in the test. Only 600,000 will receive the actual vaccine; the other 300,000 receive &quot;false” injections of a sugar or a salt compound. This latter group, called the control group, will serve as a standard of comparison. According to the normal incidence of poliomyelitis, 360 children in a group of 900,000 will develop the disease. So if the vaccine works, the number of cases among them should be reduced to 120, with all the cases occurring among the group that received ‘‘false’<sup>1</sup> injections. The vaccine was developed by Dr. Jonas Salk of the University of Pittsburgh. Describing the vaccine the New York </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font13"> (5/2) said: &quot;It is a culture of live polio germs grown in a test tube containing monkey tissue and then combined with formaldehyde, a powerful antiseptic, which kills the culture’s disease-producing properties. The theory is that the vaccine, upon injection into the blood stream, will stimulate the growth of polio antibodies conferring permanent immunity against all three known types of the disease.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The Solar Battery</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; Man has learned to harness a river by building a dam. Will he ever be able to harness the sun by building some device to convert the sun’s rays into electricity? Numerous attempts have been made in the past to utilize the sun’s power by building huge reflectors that amplified the sun's rays. But this method was impractical, since an enormous reflector is required to produce just one horsepower of energy. So in April when the Bell Telephone Laboratories successfully demonstrated a new device to harness the sun, it was indeed electrifying news. The new device is a solar battery that consists mainly of silicon. The sun’s rays displace the electrons in the silicon, causing thqm to form an electric current. Since the device can store current it can be charged by day for use at night. In the demonstration the solar battery turned a toy ferris wheel and provided enough power for a telephone conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Dutch Nab Culprit No. 3,320</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; The Netherlands has an unusual kind of public enemy. The first of its type was officially captured in 1941. In April officials caught culprit No. 3,320. Who are the culprits and what have they been up to? They are tiny marauders called muskrats, rodents that make their homes within the banks of streams or canals. Now since concrete may come loose when rodents burrow beneath it, Dutch experts insist that the dikes must be protected from the onslaughts of the rodent underminers at all costs. Present cost to the government; the wages of four musk-rateers and a fee of five guilders ($1.30) that is given to any private person who nabs a muskrat marauder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">A Divine Requirement</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">fl, Jehovah God has a people on earth today. They arc his people because they do his will, follow his instructions. One requirement, contained in his Word, the holy Bible, is that they assemble with others of like mind for spiritual strengthening and godly instruction. This was true when Moses led the nation of Israel; it was true at the time of Christ; it is also true today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What does this mean to you? That today you should gather for Scriptural instruction with others who likewise keenly desire knowledge $nd are anxious to teach others. Where will there be such a group, such instruction? At the forthcoming assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses in twenty-one major cities throughout the United States and Canada. What will you gain from attending? An added knowledge, of Jehovah's Word, a further appreciation of his great goodnesses and an understanding of genuine Christian unity among all kinds of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Your local congregation of Jehovah's witnesses will provide you with information about the nearest assembly, or write to</span></p>

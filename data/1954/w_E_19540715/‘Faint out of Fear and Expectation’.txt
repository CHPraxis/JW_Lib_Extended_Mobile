‘Faint out of Fear and Expectation’
● The hydrogen age has already ushered in a new phase of fear: the abandonment of civil defense. Reports the New York Times of April 7, 1954: “The Laborite City Council of Coventry, one of Britain’s most damaged cities in World War II, decided tonight that civil defense was a waste of time and money in view of reports about the devastating effects of the hydrogen bombs. The council voted 32 to 13 to tell Home Secretary Sir David Maxwell Fyfe of its decision and proposed steps to disband the local civil defense committee.” Again intensifying evidence of a feature of the “last days” sign parades before our eyes: “On the earth anguish of nations, . . . while men become faint out of fear and of expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth.”—Luke 21:25, 26, NW.

Bishop Decries Losses
● Madrid, March 18—The Roman Catholic bishop of Barcelona has urged adoption of stern measures to repress what he termed proselytizing by United States Protestant sects in Spain. . . . In a circular letter to the parish clergy in which he explained the functions of the secretariat, he warned, “We must undertake a real crusade.” . . . The Protestant denominations especially guilty of violating Spanish laws that regulate the activities of non-Catholics are the Seventh-day Adventists and Jehovah’s Witnesses, Bishop Modrego continued. . . . The Jehovah’s Witnesses, who are the most active among non-Catholic denominations in Barcelona, according to the bishop, are “canvassing homes and leaving propaganda leaflets and handbills even inside Catholic churches, where they have been found on chairs and faldstools.”—Quoted from New York Times, March 19.

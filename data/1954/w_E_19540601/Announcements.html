<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>GREAT THINGS AT HAND!</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Before the month of June is over three of Jehovah’s witnesses’ 1954 district assemblies will already be history—but what history they will make! New World society gatherings are always outstanding, and this year’s district assemblies can be looked forward to with keen anticipation by all who put God first.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">While the New World society’s tremendous international gatherings impress the world, its smaller district assemblies, held throughout the land, make provision for an even greater number of new ones to personally witness the unity and godliness of this working Christian organization. So, whether newly acquainted with the truth, or many years in its service, do not fail to carry out your plans to attend this mighty spiritual feast to be held in twenty-one major cities of the United States and Canada between now and August 22. Cities where these assemblies will be held on June 24-27 are listed below:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Boston, Mass., Fenway Park. Cincinnati, Ohio, Cincinnati Gardens, 2250 Seymour Ave. Richmond, Va., Mooers Field, 1700 Roseneath Rd.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>WORK WITHOUT LOITERING OR COMPLAINING</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Do not loiter at your business” of preaching, is Jehovah’s wise counsel. Rather, he tells us at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:11-45:12:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 12:11</a> (<em>NW</em>) to “be aglow with the spirit. Be slaves to Jehovah.” That is the attitude of all Jehovah’s witnesses rejoicing in the grand Kingdom hope. They serve God without any desire to loiter or complain as they present the good news to all they can reach. You also can serve. During June present the book <em>“New Heavens and a New Earth”, </em>together with the booklet <em>After Armageddon—God’s New World, </em>on a contribution of only 50 cents. Ask any of Jehovah’s witnesses about this activity, or write to the Society.</p>

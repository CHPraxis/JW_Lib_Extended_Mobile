<p><span class="font35">Needed—A Marshall Plan for the Na</span><span class="font35" style="font-style:italic;">vajos</span></p>
<p><span class="font38">G</span><span class="font28">ENEROUS Uncle Sam, the great United States government, which has posed as the “Great White Father” of the American Indian for over a century, literally spent billions of dollars in a Marshall Plan (European Recovery Program) to save Europe from total collapse. Asia and the Pacific area, Latin America, the Near East and Africa all received of his hand. But for the destitute and needy of Uncle Sam's own ward, the American Indians, the “Great White Father” has nothing to give* His heart has been stone toward them for the past hundred years. Instead of giving, he </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">now schemes</span><span class="font28"> to take away what little is theirs through treaty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">No wonder the minister of welfare of one of the Middle East nations, who recently visited the United States to study the nation's health and welfare programs, remarked, after visiting several reservations of American Indians of the Southwestern States: “I know why conditions are as they are in the rural areas of my country,” he said. “But I can't understand why there is so much poverty and disease among your Indians. You are the strongest, wealthiest and healthiest nation in the world. You spend millions of dollars help* ing improve conditions among the poorer peoples of the world. This is a basic tenet of democratic living and also tends to prevent communism, but you permit these same conditions to exist among your own</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Indians. Why?” Questions like this the “Great White Father” finds difficult to answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conditions in Navajoland</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">The Indian certainly could use some of Uncle Sam's generosity. When the Nation* al </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">Committee</span><span class="font28"> on Indian Health of the Association on American Indian Affairs met in New York in the summer of 1953, the following report was issued, according to Howard A. Rusk, M.D.: “Pulmonary tuberculosis death rates among Indians are about five times higher than those of the rest of the population. Brain tuberculosis, especially in little children, is seven to twenty times as great. Pneumonia death rates run five to six times higher among Indians* In some Indian tribes, one-fourth to one-half of the school-age children have impaired vision resulting from the scars of preventable eye infections. The enteritis death rate among the Navajo and Papago children in Arizona is twenty times that of white children in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Dr. James R. Shaw of the interior department's Bureau of Indian Affairs revealed that the average life span of Navajo Indians was “less than twenty years.” Whereas the statistics from the United States </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">Public</span><span class="font28"> Health Service show that the life span in the white population of the United States now averages 68.4 years* Dr. Shaw further declared that “deaths from tuberculosis among Navajos in 1952 ran to 9.3 times the rate for whites; those from dysentery, 13 times; from measles, 29.5 times, and from gastroenteritis 25 times/’</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">The United States government boasts of its loyalty to treaties and peace pacts and of its willingness to uphold these treaties. But its treaty with the Indians it has never kept* In 1868 the “Great White Father” made a treaty with the Navajos, and in Article VI of that treaty guaranteed to them a teacher and classroom for every thirty children of school age* Today after these many years *'fifty per cent of all Navajo children receive no formal education whatsoever”; “seventy-five per cent of the Navajo Tribe is illiterate, as compared to Negro illiteracy of 16*1 per cent, foreign-born white illiteracy of 9.19 per cent and native white illiteracy of 1*5 per cent*” Reportedly “there are only fifty-three Government schools on or adjoining the Navajo Indian Reservation, with an attendance of 12,730 Navajo children and that approximately 12,000 Navajo children do not attend schools because the Government has failed to provide them/</span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">'—The Cowl</span><span class="font28"> for June, 1952.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">This same authority states that “the. average per capita income for the Navajos is approximately only $81 per year, as compared with the national average of $861 per year”; that, including the value of home-grown products, food consumed by the Navajos is only about “$1 weekly for each person”; that over “one half of all Navajo deaths occur among children under five years of age,” and “that in spite of the extremely high rate of disease among the Navajos, there are only six Government hospitals, nineteen doctors, eighty nurses and three dentists serving the 65,000 Navajos spread over 30,000 square miles of desert land.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">The “Great White Father” might publicize his high standards of education to the rest of the world and boast of his bounties* But in his own land exists a people whose needs surpass those of many foreigners who have asked and received and some who have not asked but still receive of his aid and abundance* On account of the shameful neglect of the Navajo, his education and health, the unfulfilled treaty promises and provisions, any unfriendly nation might well say: “Why, then, do you look at the straw in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the rafter in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother: ‘Allow me to extract the straw from your eye’; when, look! a rafter is in your own eye? Hypocrite? first extract the rafter from your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to extract the straw from your brother’s eye.” The “Great White Father” claims to be Christian* To Christians the apostle Paul said: “Certainly if anyone does not provide for those who are his own, and especially for those who are members of his household, he has disowned the faith and is worse than a person without faith.”—Matthew 7:3-5; 1 Timothy 5:8, </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">New World Trans,</span></p>
<p><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">White Man Out to Scalp Indian</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Instead of providing for his own, the “Great White Father” took away first the forests and farm land from the Indian and forced him into desolate reservations, which Will Rogers, Jr., called a “vast concentration camp of desert and nonirrigable land*” Next it was oil that the white man wanted. Now it is uranium. Various proposals are being presented before Congress of the United States to “emancipate” the Indian, “to remove his ‘ward’ status under Government trusteeship and send him into the white man’s society to compete.” Dorothy Bohn, chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee of the Cascade County Community Council, Great Falls, Montana, termed the proposals “another ‘land grab’ in the guise of ‘emancipation*’ ” What the</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">white man wants is not to free the Indian but to turn the reservations over to private exploitation. The day that this happens will mark the greatest scalping the Indian has received in a hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Representative Michael J. Kirwan of Ohio said that the Indian situation “is something America should be ashamed of.” But there are no signs of shame, and no doubt the Indian has little expectation of mercy and kindness. These are for others, but not for him. The Indian must wait on Jehovah God, who will rid the earth of all greedy persons and restore the earth to a paradisaic state. Then not only the Indian but all lovers of righteousness will rejoice!</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">What the United Nations Done</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font34" style="font-variant:small-caps;">E</span><span class="font25" style="font-variant:small-caps;">xperts</span><span class="font23"> say the popularity of the United Nations is definitely on the wane. Skepticism about its future is voiced. People are demanding to know what the United Nations is doing to justify its existence. “Why hasn’t it done more?’’they ask. “Nine years have passed since it went into operation. That should be sufficient time for it to prove itself. But what has it done besides talk?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Many persons were led to believe that the United Nations would be some sort of a “cure-all&quot; exercising magical powers that would in a sensational way transform this world into a Utopian dream. These individuals became disillusioned and disappointed in the United Nations. Commenting on this very point, ambassador to the United Nations Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., said: “The U. N. was oversold in 1945. Exaggerated claims for it led to exaggerated disappointments. The U. N. was presented to the American people as a panacea for all ills, as something which would bring about the millennium overnight. There is, of course, no panacea,’’ said Mr. Lodge, “and no manmade device can bring about the millennium.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Despite the wide publicity given to the activities of the United Nations, opinions differ violently as to its value, especially in the United States. For example: Former United States President Truman called the United Nations ‘the best hope for peace.’ He further said that “we can win the peace only by continuing to work for international justice and morality through the United Nations.” But Governor J. Bracken Lee of Utah disagrees with Mr. Truman. He calls the United Nations “a snare and a delusion.” Now President Eisenhower comes along and says that the “U. N. has become a sheer necessity.” While representative Burdick of North Dakota warns his fellow Americans to “watch well the United Nations for, as now constituted,” he says, “it is Enemy Number 1 of free America.” Another sour note about the United Nations comes from the former national commander of the American Legion, who went so far as to say to a'cheering national Legion convention at St. Louis that “the United Nations is dead. It was a fraud in its inception, a hypocrite in its operation.” These are but a few of the contradictory statements made</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">by those in public office, Is it any wonder that the people are confused?</span></p>
<p><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Changed World</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">It would be an untruth to say that the United Nations is today everything the nations hoped it would be at. the time of the signing of the Charter in San Francisco in 1945* The world is not the same today as it was then* It has taken on a definite change for the worse. When the United Nations was conceived it was believed that at the close of World War II the major nations would write peace treaties with the defeated nations, and that these peace treaties would become the possession of the United Nations; that she would take over the peace thus made and maintain it. But what happened? Only one peace treaty was made and that was with Italy, In 1952 another one was made with Japan, but Russia refused to honor it with her signature. None others materialized. No peace treaty has ever been signed with Germany or Austria. Instead of peace treaties, the United Nations was handed a divided world filled with suspicion and -fear. This was its abnormal beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Nevertheless, the United Nations has done more than just talk—it has accomplished many things. For example: In 1945, at the time of the signing of the United Nations Charter, there were an estimated 800 million persons living under some form of government in which they had little or no part—mandate, colonial status, or the like. Of those 800 million Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt declares that.&quot;670 million now have their own governments —Indonesia and Pakistan are examples.” The United Nations helped accomplish this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font29" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World War</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">There have been other successes too. Shortly after the second world war all nations that had their troops in Iran withdrew them, that is, all but Russia. Russia Insisted on keeping her forces in Iran. Iran means oil. Oil is what Russia needs badly. Iran is far </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">too weak to cope</span><span class="font28"> with the situation. The rest of the world, especially the Western nations with interests in Iran, Persia and Arabia, felt very uneasy. Suppose Russia were to take possession of Iran and her oil fields, what was there to stop her from moving on into Persia and Arabia, and even on into India? Nothing. That is why the presence of Russian troops became a threat to the peace and security of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">But what did Iran do? She appealed to the United Nations. The United Nations told Russia that under the terms of the Charter she had no business in Iran. Within five months Russia withdrew all of her troops from Iran. But what if there had been no United Nations to appeal to—then what? It could have meant a shooting war, a beginning of World War III.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Down in the Dutch East Indies, where the Dutch have ruled for more than 300 years, some seventy million Indonesians demanded </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">their independence The Dutch </span><span class="font28">flatly refused to grant it. Dutch soldiers began to move in to enforce law. War appeared inevitable. But the Indonesians took their case to the United Nations. Patiently, over conference tables, the explosive issues were ironed out. The Republic of Indo nesia was established. The Dutch army returned to Holland, War once again was averted. But what if there had been no United Nations to turn to, to mediate, to negotiate, to conciliate—then what? War? As Dr. Ralph J. Bunche, director, United Nations Division of Trusteeship, said about the United Nations: “There is endless talk, there is acrimony and anger, but there is also often agreement. But in any case, who would question that the babble of many tongues in heated, even angry debate, is a heartening substitute for the deadly</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">thunder of war? Better always to argue than to shoot.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">StiU another instance is mentioned where the United Nations was instrumental in averting war. In 1948, India and Pakistan argued over the rich lands of Kashmir. Skirmishes broke out for its possession. Both sides began to draw up armies for a showdown. An appeal was made to the United Nations. The United Nations ordered a “cease-fire.&quot; A truce line was drawn. While the situation is still unsolved, better a stalemate than an actual war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In Palestine a war was in progress between the Arabs and the Israelis when the United Nations stepped in. It hammered out the series of armistices that stopped big-scale fighting. The situation in Palestine is still extremely tense and a long way from being solved. But is not a truce a great deal better than a shooting war?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“What about Korea?&quot; you ask. The United Nations provided for a North and South Korea—the North was to be communistic and the South democratic, according to choice. The dividing line was the 38th parallel. When North Korea invaded South Korea, the United Nations took immediate steps to repel the aggressors. After three years of bloody fighting a truce was finally worked out. A cease-fire was ordered. The North Koreans are back where they started. Millions of people have been made homeless. The casualties on both sides have been many. But even at that, the war could have been worse. It could have spread to Japan, Formosa and the Philippines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">No doubt, Dr. Ralph J. Bunche, Nobel-prize-winning educator and head of the United Nations department of trusteeship, had these happenings in mind when he said that the United Nations can stand on its record and needs no crusade to “sell” its benefits to mankind. Dr. Bunche added: “I feel quite strongly that had there been no U. </span><span class="font3">N. in </span><span class="font20">this difficult </span><span class="font3">postwar period </span><span class="font20">since 1945 </span><span class="font3">we </span><span class="font20">almost certainly </span><span class="font3">would have </span><span class="font20">been tn an atomic World War </span><span class="font20" style="text-decoration:underline;">TIT</span><span class="font20"> long ago.&quot; We also have the expert opinion of United States secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, on this matter; Mr. Dulles stated that despite the “weaknesses” of the United Nations he believed that “we would be in, or committed to, another world war if it had not been for the United Nations.” On at least six occasions it is claimed that the United Nations’ actions have “reduced the threat of World War ni.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Other Accomplishments</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But war and the threat of war are not the only concerns of the United Nations. In fact, the activities of the United Nations can be likened to a giant iceberg, with only a tenth of its works rising high enough for many to see, while the other nine tenths remains below the surface of sensational headlines. For example: Through its third major organ, the Economic and Social Council, the United Nations grants humanitarian, technological and financial assistance. Afghanistan has experienced an economic revolution because of a little technological knowledge made possible through the United Nations. Technical advice has increased the vanishing protein diet among the Haitians, produced more rice for the Asians, built new roads in Greece and modem airfields in Iran. It has also paved the way for low-cost housing in Israel. Since July, 1950, technical knowledge and skills have been made available in a variety of ways to some 110 countries and territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The World Health Organization </span><span class="font3">(WHO) </span><span class="font20">is leading a global fight against disease. It conducts specific aid projects in more than fifty nations, the most widespread health program in all history. It fights tuberculosis, malaria and venereal disease, the kill-</span></p>
<p><span class="font30" style="font-weight:bold;">era </span><span class="font28">that destroy ten million people every year. It has wiped out cholera in Egypt, which for centuries had had periodic epidemics; it fights typhus in Afghanistan, infantile paralysis in India, yellow fever in South America and yaws in Thailand. It has brought malaria under control in Greece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">To millions of poverty- and disease-stricken children throughout the world the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) gives aid. In its brief history it has vaccinated “50 million European children against tuberculosis; has supplied leather for million pairs of shoes; has shipped 200,000 blankets to children in Greek refugee camps. Every day UNICEF gives an ‘extra’ meal to nearly 8,000,000 children and expectant and nursing mothers. It has provided cotton for dresses and suits for 250,000 children in Japan, and in the Philippines it is supplying milk and other protein foods for 146,000 children.” It has examined nine million youngsters for yaws, a disfiguring tropical disease, curing two and a half million with penicillin. It has also protected ten million children from malaria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Along this same line of aiding the stricken peoples of the world the United Nations International Refugee Organization (IRO) supplied food, clothing, medical care, schools and vocational training to refugees and their children. “Aboyt one and three-quarter million refugees have been resettled in some 40 countries; 100,000 have been returned to their homelands; and some 250,000 still are receiving assistance. . . . The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is working to increase food production 110 per cent in the next 25 years. In one country alone—Egypt—it has doubled production per farmer. To devastated and underdeveloped countries FAO has introduced, among other things, hybrid corn and other improved seeds; the latest veterinary techniques; deep-well irrigation and swamp drainage; quickfreezing and refrigeration to reduce food waste; forestry development and conservation; and technical assistance to increase production and quality of food, particularly rice, the staple food of about half the human race.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">This is just a small part of the United Nations’ story. “A complete description of UN accomplishments,” said Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., vice-president, American Association for the United Nations, “would fill thick volumes.” But perhaps even this brief outline will demonstrate in a small way the power, influence and scope of the United Nations in the world today. The charges that it is a “has been,” is “dead” or is just a “debating society” can be disproved by its past record, despite its many failures and shortcomings. The fact that twenty-one nations are applying for membership in the United Nations and none of the sixty want to get out should be sufficient to disprove the charge that it is a “white elephant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">But it has not brought peace. The fear of war still hangs heavily over the earth. As one of the United Nations’ able representatives stated: “It has not brought— and will not bring—the millennium.” The millennium awaits the action of Jehovah God. That millennium will come. It will not be plagued with internal strife, will not be limited in its scope, and will solve all of mankind’s ills, because it, rather than the United Nations, is man’s only hope.</span></p>

<p><span class="font38">H</span><span class="font28">OW many of us would be willing to travel half way round the world to behold a spectacle for a hundred and fifty seconds? Not many of us would. No doubt even a lesser number would be willing to spend thousands of dollars to witness this occasion without some assurance that the spectacle would take place and be visible to the eye. But many scientists have done just that. They have traveled half way or more round the globe, and have spent thousands of dollars without even getting a good glimpse of the leading performers in the drama. But those who have been fortunate enough to see the performance say that it is “unquestionably one of the most magnificent spectacles offered by nature.'* That spectacle—a total eclipse of the sun!</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">As far back as the summer of 1952'astronomers were examining maps for a suitable spot to get a glimpse of this rare phenomenon, which is not due to be seen until June 30, 1954, and then only for a few brief seconds and over a very restricted area. Tons of equipment, cameras, telescopes, etc., are being moved to a suitable location in the center of the path of the moon’s shadow. Buildings have been erected along</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19540622_files/g_E_19540622-7.png" alt="" style="width:353pt;height:242pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font28">the shadow’s pathway for scientific research and study. Scientists desire to measure the effects of the eclipse on radio transmission, weather and cosmic radiation. They also want to check the effect of the eclipse on th&amp; mysterious aurora borealis. There will be studies of skylight, of fluctuations in the earth’s magnetic field, and measurements of radio waves that come from the sun. The usual spectrographic observations will not be neglected. The United States Air Force hopes to measure the width of the Atlantic Ocean by watching the solar eclipse on June 30. The Air Force and the scientists want to be certain they will not miss this eclipse, for it will be “the last one that crosses North America and Europe until the year 2151.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Each year there are at least two eclipses of the sun, but neither of them need be total. It may be three or four years before a worth-while eclipse makes an appearance on the earth. And since eclipses have a habit of traveling over oceans or uninhabited areas, astronomers must travel if they wish to see them. And, of course, if there are clouds during the crucial moments of totality, the trip and effort are wasted. Tons of equipment and instruments must be dismantled andsent back home unused. The average duration of total eclipse a. year may be only a minute, but at no</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">time is it more than’ seven minutes and forty seconds. Even for .those situated in the umbra or total shadow of the approaching eclipse the entire </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">spectacle</span><span class="font23"> will be over in two and three-quarters hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The unusual thing about the coming eclipfce of the sun is that it will be an international eclipse, seen by many peoples the world over. Russians as well as Egyptians will be looking up as the bright sun slips behind the moon. Cubans and Canadians, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Alaskans</span><span class="font23"> and Finns will all </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">be able to witness</span><span class="font23"> at least a partial eclipse. Almost everyone in the United States will be able to get a glimpse of the sun partly hidden by the moon, provided, that is, they awake early enough. The eclipse will have its beginning at sunrise in northeastern Nebraska and the moon’s total shadow will race swiftly across the southern tip of South Dakota at about 2,000 miles an hour, then enter Minnesota and the upper peninsula of Michigan; on it will race across the center of Lake Superior into Canada, and over to Labrador. From there it crosses the North Atlantic Ocean, southern Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Lithuania, Russia, the Caspian Sea, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and will end near Jodhpur, India, as the sun sets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Those in the path of the total shadow will behold one of nature’s most glorious spectacles, that is, if there are no clouds to obscure the view. The corona, or the sun's outer shell of gas, normally invisible t0‘ the human eye, will burst into view, exhibiting brilliant colors—red near the sun’s surface, yellow and pearly white farther out. The landscape will be deep red, fading into orange and yellow above the horizon. Trees will appear leaden, the faces of observers livid. Fringed by the corona, the moon will hang in the sky, an immense ball. The sky will darken, bright stars and planets will become visible at midday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Birds will flock together as at evening time. Chickens will hurry to roost. Even the wind will appear to quiet down as at sunset. Out in all directions from the black disk of the moon will stretch the irregular streaks of the sun’s corona. Some of these streaks reach out over five million miles. The corona is so delicate and so breath-takingly beautiful that almost all who see it for the first time gasp with surprise and delight. Neither words nor photographs </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">can describe its awesome beauty. One</span><span class="font23"> admirer declared that “if it were possible for us to maintain life on earth without the sun’s bright rays, no civilized person seeing the corona would ever want to let it go.” A few brief minutes of totality, and then the corona fades as suddenly as it came. The silver rim of the sun creeps out from behind the black moon. The earth slowly becomes its natural self again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">On the moon the corona could be seen for two weeks at a time, because the sun is above the horizon that long. By simply hiding the sun behind a finger or other obstruction the corona could be viewed with all its brilliance. But on earth where we have atmosphere to beget a bright sky, a professional astronomer can hardly hope to see and observe the corona for more than thirty minutes in all his professional life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Two weeks later, on the evening of July 15, 1954, another spectacle will take place. This time the earth will come between the sun and the moon, although the moon will not enter completely into the earth’s shadow. Thus we shall see a partial eclipse of the moon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">What causes an eclipse of the sun or the moon? Primitive people of days gone by believed that the sun was being viciously attacked and swallowed by a dragon. As recently as February 25, 1952, in the Khartoum, Sudan, the Africans beat drums and slit the throats of bulls as sacrifices dur-</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">ing the total eclipse, which for them “was a manifestation </span><span class="font3">of God Of devils.” Among </span><span class="font20">the less credulous and more informed, eclipses are known to be caused by shadows. When a dark object is brought into the vicinity of a source of light, it will cast a shadow. This is what takes place in our solar system. The sun provides the light. The planets and their satellites are the dark objects that east shadows away from the sun. Our earth is so situated that it comes at various times into the shadow cast by the moon; when it does, it is then that we have a solar eclipse. However, if the moon’s diameter were decreased a scant hundred and forty miles a total eclipse of the sun would be impossible! But when the moon plunges through the earth’s shadow there is then an eclipse of the moon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The first necessary element for a solar eclipse on earth to occur is that the sun, moon and earth form a straight line. This rarely happens, because the paths of the earth around the sun and the moon around the earth are constantly changing. This influences the length of the shadow of the moon and also its direction with reference to the earth. If the sun, earth and moon were all moving in circular paths in the same plane and at uniform speeds, then our eclipses would all take place at regular intervals and be visible as total or partial in fixed localities. Though progress has been made, there still exists an element of uncertainty in determining the exact time of the totality of the eclipse, as well as the place and the duration, because as yet an exact determination of the path of the moon is not known. The moon's course poses one of the most complicated problems known to the astronomer. There are times when the moon's shadow may extend 18,000 miles beyond the earth’s surface and again at other times its shadow may fall short of the earth’s surface by more than 20,000 miles. The diameter of the moon’s shadow path intercepted by the earth may vary from its maximum of 163 miles to a vanishing width when the shadow is just long enough to reach the earth’s surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">It is when the moon is nearest and the sun farthest away that the moon’s shadow is longest and the path across the earth is widest. Only those who are inside this narrow strip across the earth will on June 30 witness a total eclipse of the sun and receive the full impact of nature’s magnificent spectacle.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">The day the blue budgerigar fluttered on to the lactory chimney started an embarrassing fortnight for bricklayer Frank Whittingham. For Frank, 45, took it home to Mum in Brookwood-road, Wandsworth. One breakfast time it chattered: “Pudding and pie, kiss the girls, made them cry.” Frank was amazed and told his work mates. For days he turned up at work with stories of the Incredible things said by the blue budgie. But they just laughed. When Frank announced: “He's told me his name and phone number. He's Joey Myers, from Renown 2961,” it was too much for them. “Getaway,” said his mates. But all day long Joey kept chattering, “Renown 2961, 2961/’ in such a posh voice. For peace and quiet, Frank phoned the number. Mrs. Kathleen Myers, Joey’s owner, of Hurlmgham, Putney, answered. And Frank laughed: “1 don't have to ask you if you have lost </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Joey. </span><span class="font19">You sound just like him.” So yesterday Joey went home.

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Australia's Underground Lakes</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awakal&quot; cOrrMpondsnt in Auitralia</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">iHROUGHOUT Australia there are many mighty underground lakes known as the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">|</span><span class="font3"> Artesian Basins. Almost anywhere on the land above them useful and continuous supplies of water can be obtained by sinking boreholes. Outback life would be virtually impossible without them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Murray River Basin is estimated to have an area of 107,250 square miles. The intake area covers about two million acres and receives an annual rainfall of twenty-three inches, none of which runs off even in the j wettest season. It is absorbed by both the mio- </span><span class="font22">।</span><span class="font3"> cene limestone and the underlying sands and grits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the Grippsland Basin a borehole tapped <sup>1 </sup>a flowing supply of 350,000 gallons a day in ] coarse gravel at a depth of 1,780 feet. Others </span><span class="font22">।</span><span class="font3"> include the Swan Coast Plains Basin of 11,200 square miles, the Eucla Basin of some 68,460 square miles and the Desert Basin of 129,000 square miles. The Great Australian Basin is <sup>1 </sup>believed to be the largest in the world, occupy- <sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font3">about one fifth of the whole continent, or 1 some 600,000 square miles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Few people appreciate how underground | water is stored and replenished. Artesian ba- </span><span class="font22">।</span><span class="font3"> sins do not have to be replenished by local </span><span class="font22">।</span><span class="font3"> falls of rain, as they have vast catchment j areas sometimes hundreds of miles from the j site of the bore. The former government geologist of south Australia says: “The very com- <sup>1 </sup>mon popular belief in underground 'streams of water<sup>1</sup> occupying narrow channels com- <sup>1 </sup>parable with the beds of surface streams is <sup>1 </sup>almost wholly wrong. In general other condi- 1 tions exist and it is fortunate for those who 1 have to rely on subterranean supplies that such J is not the case, since a small restricted chan- | nel would be depleted rapidly by an artificial </span><span class="font22">।</span><span class="font3"> draught. The storage of water in earth’s crust </span><span class="font22">।</span><span class="font3"> is effected by the filling of cavities, spaces, j or openings of different kinds, which owe their </span><span class="font22">।</span><span class="font3"> form, size and continuity to the textural and structural features of the particular rocks present at each locality. The general term ' applied to these water-bearers is 'aquifer.'” <sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Underground Water in Australia,</span><span class="font3"> page 10, * by L. Keith Ward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font3">i &lt;[ Much of the credit for the discovery of Australia’s subterranean water supplies must go to T. E. Ravleson. He expressed the view that rain and river waters would be proved to be stored in the interior of Australia. First proof of the accuracy of his predictions was provided when, in 1880, a borehole sunk between the Darling and Paroo Rivers yielded flowing water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;[_ An investigating committee in 1945 pointed out that the quantity of water discharged from all of the bores in Queensland since the first hole was drilled in 1884 would be enough to lower the water level in the 30,000 square miles of Queensland’s intake beds by only five feet, even if there was no rain during the sixty years between 1884 and 1945 to replenish the supply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;L The temperature of the water in the deepest parts of the Great Basin is very high. At several places it gushes out at boiling point accompanied by hissing jets of steam. In his article Mr. Ward describes the conditions necessary to provide a good flow of water from an artesian bore: “1. There must be an adequate rainfall to supply water to the aquifer. 2. The relatively porous rocks constituting the aquifer must be so disposed as to admit the water and allow its passage. 3. There must exist less porous rocks or relatively impervious rocks, so disposed as to confine the water within the more porous beds, 4. The porous beds must be so inclined that the intake is sufficiently high above the level of the bore site to compensate for the loss of pressure due to frictional resistance, leakage and the artificial draught. 5. There must be no easy escape for the water at a lower level than that of the bore site.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;_ Undoubtedly, Australia’s system of underground lakes numbers among the provisions of a bounteous Creator. Thoughtful persons thank him for this precious supply of water. They thank him, too, for the life-giving water of truth that flows even out into these isolated areas, wetting parched throats that will also join in the happy chorus of praise to a wonderful Provider.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">HELL</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awakd&quot; correspondent in Norway</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font38">N</span><span class="font28">ORWAY has a very literal Hell. It is a little station town to which English-speaking tourists used to buy round-trip tickets. Surely something to show when coming home!</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">The place does not arouse any associations among Norwegians, however, their word for “hell” being </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">helvete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">And this </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">helvete</span><span class="font28"> is the hell Norway has been talking of for the last year, the fiery, sulphury lake of fire and brimstone belonging to the revivalist preachers. Does it exist or not? Is it a place of anguish and torment for souls of the deceased, or is it a big lie used by old Egyptian priests as well as by modern fanatics? And should the national broadcasting be used for hell-fire preaching or not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Such have been the questions asked and debated in the press and among clergy and laity. A bishop has been “investigated” and “cleared” on account of his view on hell-fire, and the position of Norway’s state church has been weakened, so much so that voices from both fighting camps were heard talking of separating Church and State in this country where they have been closely united for 900 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">It all began when radio listeners all over the country suddenly had cold shivers go up and down their spines as the sharp and unpleasant voice of 74-year-old theology</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font28">professor Ole Hallesby was </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x* </span><span class="font33" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">L*-/</span><span class="font28"> heard crying out: “How</span></p>

<p><span class="font28">whether you will wake up in your bed or in hell?” “You know that if you fell dead onto the floor in this very mo-ment, you fell right down into hell!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">This was said during a religious service transmitted from the Grand Hall of Nor-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font28">way’s Inner Mission House on Sunday, January 25, 1953. Such material is, of course, served at any revivalist meeting, and orthodox Professor Hallesby has been preaching it during a long life, but these gruesome threats of death and hell being sent through the radio was something new. Norway was shocked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">And for the next days and weeks Norway said so. The press was flooded with indignant protests. A psychiatrist was quoted from a book he had written on mental disorders: “Hell-fire preachers . . . are pathologists. The hell-fire preacher is a most able torturer.” The anticlerical Oslo paper </span><span class="font28" style="font-style:italic;">Dagbladet</span><span class="font28"> interviewed the Dean of Oslo Cathedral, J. 0. Dietrichson, who said: &quot;Development has reached the point when we no longer are able to preach the belief of a hell with eternal torment in a physical sense.” Evidently hell has undergone a change in the mind of some liberal clergymen!</span></p>
<p><span class="font28">Giving some of the background on hell, Egyptologist Peter Bendow told of another change, belonging to the dim past. The ancient Egyptian religion at first had no place of torment for the dead, but later the priests saw to it that their religion was changed so as to contain such a hot place. Their motive: They wanted an effective means to scare people into donating values to the priests!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font33" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bishop</span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"> Is </span><span class="font33" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;Cleared”</span></p>
<p><span class="font31">Then one of Norway’s bishops made a new sensation. Six days after Professor Halles^y’s threats of hell over the air Bish’ op Schjelderup of Hamar, in a newspaper article, stated that the dogma of hell was most problematic, and said: “The Scriptural basis of the doctrine is very disputed, and it is a fact that the origin of the doctrine is neither Jewish nor Christian . . . it came into later Judaism, probably from Persia. . . , Jesus may at times have used the expression ‘gehenna’ to emphasize the seriousness of life and the ‘possibility of perdition’ . . . But Jesus certainly never meant to teach of an eternal hell. . . . According to my opinion the teaching of eternal punishment in hell does not belong to the religion of love.<sup>1</sup>’</span></p>
<p><span class="font31">This in fact constituted a declaration of war against the powerful Inner Mission Society, of which Professor Hallesby was president. And the orthodox Inner Mission leaders confidently began fighting. They had taken scalps of liberal-minded clergymen before, and now they were to take a new one. Or so they thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font31">Taking to the warpath in their traditional fashion they sent word to their numerous members in the diocese of Bishop Schjelderup to begin a disloyalty campaign against the bishop. At the same time Professor Hallesby wrote in </span><span class="font31" style="font-style:italic;">Aftenposten:</span><span class="font31"> “I am a personal friend of Bishop Schjelderup, Therefore, it is hard for me to write this . , . but during the last 150 years no Norwegian bishop has publicly denied the Confession of the Church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font31">One of his faithful disciples, the rector of the Inner Mission Bible School, followed up with a statement in the religious daily </span><span class="font31" style="font-style:italic;">Vdrt Land:</span><span class="font31"> “He [Schjelderup] has placed himself outside the society of the confessional Church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font31">All this, of course, was the same as saying that Bishop Schjelderup should be dis-fellowshiped from the church, and the bishop as a consequence of this wrote a letter to the Department of Church and Education demanding to know whether a bishop in the state church had to preach hell-fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font31">Why write the department? Why turn to politics as an authority on religious doctrine? Because Norway’s church is a state church, with the king as the head of the church. And in this constitutional monarchy the king means the government, which in turn means the department. So it came to be that the pressed bureaucrats of the Labor government were to determine what should be taught as the pure and genuine doctrine of hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font31">The anticlerical newspapers demanded that hell should be abolished. It was a disgrace for a civilized nation to believe in such nonsense, was their theme. And be sides, was not the king, that is, the government, head of the church? Why not use its power now and change the doctrine of the church as well as “clear” the bishop? Professor in law Frede Castberg wrote a learned treatise to the effect that the state might change the doctrine and ceremonies of the church any time it wanted. And anticlerical </span><span class="font31" style="font-style:italic;">Dagbladet</span><span class="font31"> backed him up, angrily saying that the Inner Mission wknted the state to pay the expenses of the church but have no authority! What the government did was to ask the opinion of the rest of the bishops and of the two theological seminaries of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font31">On February 19, 1954, the result of this “investigation” of hell and the bishop was published. The two theological seminaries disagreed openly, which was to be expected, as Professor Hallesby during some thirty years taught at the one of them and Bishop Schjelderup is a graduate of the other. Of the bishops, only one thought that Schjelderup had broken his vow of office and taught contrary to the confession. Result: The bishop was “cleared.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The state so decided. And hell was not abolished in Norway. It was only “watered down,” so that one might believe anything about it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Hell-preaching and Tax Evasion</span></h3>
<p><span class="font23">So Professor Hallesby did not get the scalp of the bishop. Instead, through a-strange chain of circumstances, he lost his own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">By his recent actions he had become an item of public interest. The newsmen were after him. When he, for instance, during a talk in the church at a little fishing village on Norway’s west coast pointed toward the churchyard and declared, “Out there lie 10,000 people who have gone to hell!” this was dutifully reported in the newspapers. The public reaction was strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Then the Oslo paper </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Verdens Gang</span><span class="font23"> began taking an interest in the fiscal affairs of the professor. On October 7, 1953, the paper carried the sensational headline: “Hallesby Uncovered as Tax Evader.” At first the professor tried to explain away his economic irregularities as sheer trifles, but subsequent articles in </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Verdens Gang </span><span class="font23">brought out that he had given false declarations to the revenue authorities during a period of ten years, deducting 11,724Norwegian crowns more than entitled to do. On November 12, 1953, Professor Hallesby “voluntarily” resigned as president of the Inner Mission Society. The fight was over. He had lost his scalp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">It made quite a Scandinavian sensation! Especially shocked were the tens of thousands of religious people in Norway who had regarded this man as their spiritual leader, much in the same way as Catholics would be inclined to view their pope.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>As </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">for Hell</span></h3>
<p><span class="font23">Most people in Norway no longer believe in it. “Hell is here on this earth, if anywhere,” is the common saying. In fact, that is not so far from the truth. The Bible teaches hell to be the same as the Common grave of mankind: &quot;There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave Fhell, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Douay</span><span class="font23"> Version], whither thou goest. . . . The dead know not any thing.” —Ecclesiastes 9:10, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The only Greek word translated “hell” in the Norwegian Bible, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Gehenna,</span><span class="font23"> is a symbolic expression of total destruction, as modern doctrinal research of the Bible has clearly shown. It could not carry a meaning contrary to everything the Bible elsewhere teaches on the condition of the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The Bible, however, was very little mentioned during the past year’s debate on hell in Norway. Even the clergymen said little about God’s Word. Instead, most of their discussions were on what the dogmas of the Nicene Creed and the Augsburg Confession said and meant. But clergymen and anticleriqals alike could have profited by a simple study of the Bible on this question. Had they undertaken such a study they would have discovered that Norway need not abolish hell-fire after all, as such a thing never existed. Never, that is, except in the imaginations and tales of false religious leaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, sayiny: “Why is it -your disciples overstep the tradition of the men of former times? ...” In reply he said to them: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. you have made the word of God invalid be</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">By &quot;Awdkel&quot; correspondent In Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font38">r</span><span class="font3">[ Solomon’s day, the Bible relates, the 1 timbers from Lebanon used in building the | temple were floated southward as huge | rafts. (1 Kings 5:8, 9) This age-old method of g water transport is still used in Canada to | bring millions of logs to the mills and facto- 1 ries where they are made into products of all 1 sizes, shapes, weights and properties—into | plastics and papers, toothpicks and pit props, 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and, </span><span class="font3">not the least in importance, into strong Is and durable plywood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;il</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">TJ No newcomer is plywood, for one authority l| reports that a process of holding together thin layers of wood was known as far back as the S </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">days of </span><span class="font3">Egypt’s Pharaohs. Today, though, ra </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Canada’s </span><span class="font3">plywood is made chiefly of Douglas a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">fir </span><span class="font3">from the forests </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">British Columbia, as- » sisted by mahogany from Africa and the S Philippines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tg Plywood, as the name designates, is a S wood product constructed in layers running H at right angles to one another and bonded </span><span class="font22">■</span><span class="font3"> together with a durable adhesive. The center g layers are known as the core; the two out- S side layers, for which only the better grades S of wood are used, as the faces. Plywood’s S value is that it comes in larger sheets than^ M do regular boards, is stronger in relation to I its thickness, and resists wood's natural ten- g dencies to shrink, swell and warp- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font22">■</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A puny </span><span class="font3">human, taking a peep inside a ply- n wood factory, is amazed to see the mighty ma-chines that handle monstrous logs with ease, </span><span class="font22">■</span><span class="font3"> producing from them the fine veneers used w in plywood manufacture. The most common || method of producing these thin layers of wood </span><span class="font22">■</span><span class="font3"> is the rotary cutting method. The log is secure- ra ly clamped horizontally in a massive lathe, 1 then rotated against a sharp knife, which S moves gradually forward to shave off sheets § of veneer of a predetermined thickness. The S knives, varying in length from three to over § twelve feet, can tackle giant logs up to 110 s inches in diameter and with unerring ease S shave off smooth veneers as thin as one sixty- g fourth of an inch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The veneer is then clipped automatically 1 to various sizes, and defects are removed. The &amp;&nbsp;veneers are dried, sorted and then glued to- * gether. To glue them the inside layer or layers are coated with adhesive and placed inside the two outer layers. This “sandwich” is then dried under pressure. Various types of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">glue </span><span class="font3">are used. A cold-setting type fixes things firmly in four to six hours. A hot-setting type sets in four minutes, and another kind, phenol formaldehyde, is used under temperatures as high as 340° Fahrenheit </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to*</span><span class="font3"> produce a bond that is resistant to alcohol, oils, gasoline, and either salt, fresh or even boiling water. Plywood bonded with this type of glue is used in boat building, aircraft manufacturing, and by the builders of prefabricated homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The plywood is usually cut to standard measurements of up to four feet in width and up to eight feet in length, though special pieces have been provided that were longer than a railroad boxcar! Thickness, too, can vary, from a thirty-second of an Inch to two and a quarter inches. Generally plywood is from three to seven plies, but sometimes it is made with as many as fifteen plies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is truly an inspiring experience at the beginning of spring to be near one of the rivers used for transporting such logs downstream to the sawmills. The logs are piled during the winter, and as soon as the ice melts they begin their long, hazardous journey. Inspiring? Indeed! Think of. the wisdom of the Creator who made this material that is strong enough to withstand severe strains, yet light enough to float on water! Truly a wonder plant he made, part of which you eat, part you use as medicine, part of which provides you shelter and even clothing. It beautifies the landscape, holds the soil together, shades from the sun, and protects and feeds the animal friends. It provides the tone to music, the oxygen you breathe, and provides, through the paper that is made from its pulp, the medium for the recording of pure thought and the dissemination of true knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Man manufactures much from trees, but this is possible only because a material provided so liberally by the Creator lends itself so readily to man’s use. And plywood is merely another useful by-product to add to the long list of benefits derived from this one of Jehovah’s masterpieces—the tree. To him goes the credit!</span></p>

<p><span class="font34">B</span><span class="font23">REAST feeding is a difficult and monotonous task for many mothers. Others, however, find it an indescribable joy. For the first few months the nursing mother becomes the slave of the child, who must be fed every three or four hours. At the same time she has to look after her household duties. She has less time for recreation, social activities, traveling and outside work. In exchange, she has the priceless opportunity of becoming intimately acquainted with her baby, the joy of giving him more health, strength and beauty. On the other hand, the technique of bottle feeding is well developed and its results can be excellent. It is admittedly more convenient for the mother, and advantageous to the doctor. So mothers and expectant mothers inquire, Why breast feed? What are the advantages? Is it worth the effort and inconvenience incurred by the mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Doctors everywhere are unanimous on this one point, that breast* feeding, like childbearing, is an essential organic function. They all agree that every mother should feed her baby, as her own milk is far better for the infant than any manmade substitute. Breast feeding makes for a happier mother and a stronger and healthier child. The famous New Zealand specialist, Dr. F. Truby King, states: “There is a special and intimate relationship between the milk of the mother and the needs of her offspring.” The New York health commissioner for good reason referred to mother’s milk as the “baby’s birthright.” Herman Bundesen, health commissioner of</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font23">Chicago, called the breast-fed baby the best fed. Here is why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The elements in breast milk are perfectly balanced to promote proper development of the infant. It contains proteiiis of the same nature as those constituting the body of the child. Breast milk is much easier for the infant to digest than cow’s milk; it is of exactly the right temperature and without harmful bacteria. Mother’s milk is an absolute preventive against constipation, because mother’s milk is a liquid food and cannot solidify in the intestinal tract, while cow’s milk is a solid food within the infant’s stomach. The breasts also adjust with marvelous accuracy the precise quantity and the composition of the milk to the changing needs of the infant and the requirements of growing human tissues, bones and blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Cow’s milk is adjusted to the needs of the calf, not the human. It contains too large an amount of protein and inorganic salts, and it lacks iron. It is not so easily digested, contains many bacteria and it is pasteurized, which destroys some of its good qualities. However, cow’s milk when mixed with water and milk sugar is an excellent food for children, in spite of its defects. Even the tiny body of an infant has the remarkable ability to adapt itself to an unnatural diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Dr. C. Anderson Aldrich, director of Rochester Child Health Institute, asserts that mother’s milk “has definite preventive and therapeutic value.” Colostrum, mother’s milk during the first five days of her infant’s life, contains three to four times as many antibodies and antitoxins as breast milk secreted later. This shows that Jehovah the Creator designed colostrum to give the infant a good start in life. Not to nurse the infant is to deprive it of this healthy beginning. Consulting nutritionist Adelle Davis counsels mothers: “If you do not wish to nurse your baby at any other time,” she says, “be humane enough to nurse him during his first five days of life.” Dr. Alexis Carrel adds: “If your baby is breast fed, it has from three to ten times a better chance of surviving that dangerous first year!”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Fewer Diseases, Lower Mortality</span></h3>
<p><span class="font23">For mothers who are not convinced of the superiority of breast feeding, perhaps a comparison of a few statistics might be helpful. Studies show that the breast-fed infant is by far healthier than his bottlefed brother or sister. He has fewer allergies, a longer immunity to many diseases, notably fewer skin and digestive disorders, fewer respiratory infections, better muscular development and a greater resistance to cancer and polio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Dr. Charlotte Naish of Cambridge analyzed a hundred cases. She had delivered these babies and kept track of every call made on them for sickness during their first year. She reports that ‘bottle-fed babies required more than five times as many doctor’s calls for sickness as the breast fed. Moreover, 73 per cent of the breast fed did not require any visit at all, to compare with only 91 per cent of those bottle fed.’ In a group of 46 bottle-fed babies born with a stomach obstruction, five died. Of a hundred breast-fed babies with the same disease, none died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">This doctor, a practicing pediatrician, also investigated a series of infants suffering with enteritis and “found that almost 75 per cent of the babies who had been breast fed for a month or longer recovered from the illness, whereas more than 60 per cent of the infants who had never been breast fed failed to recover.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Dr. Clifford G. Grulee’s studies show that of all the babies suffering from infections over 66 per cent had been completely bottle fed and only 6.7 per cent wholly breast fed. Of babies who died of respiratory infections, ‘96.7 per cent had been wholly or partially bottle fed and only 3.3 per cent completely breast fed.’ In his survey of 20,000 children “the mortality of the artificially fed children was ten times greater than that of those breast fed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The Jefferson hospital in Philadelphia is reported to have kept the newborn child near the mother, who feeds him on demand. In the first ten months that this plan was in operation there was not one case of illness among these babies. These statistics, however brief, should suffice to provoke serious concern in expectant mothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Besides reducing the mortality rate, breast feeding strengthens a deep bond between the mother and child. The breastfed baby associates food with love and cuddling. It enjoys to suck, nuzzle and root for its food. Rubber nipples generally used do not have the same formative influence on the face and the throat as mother’s. Mother’s nipples are “perfectly adapted to the lips and tongue of the baby. Most rubber teats,’’ says Dr. Carrel, “are nothing but caricatures of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Suckling is described by the doctor as “a hard task” for the infant. “It is the first physical effort to which man is subjected. This effort brings about the optimum development of the jaws; the nose, and the roof of the mouth. It enhances the beauty of the visage and the quality of the voice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Other authorities assert that artificial feeding is partly responsible for the protruding upper jaw, recessed chin, ill-formed nose, flattened mouth arch, which many children have today. They say that these malformations along with bad tonsils, teeth, pharynges, ears and sinus may all some day be traced to artificial feeding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Many doctors believe that breast feeding gives to children greater bodily endurance and nervous equilibrium. A revealing study on how significant infantile happiness might be in later life was made in London and analyzed by Frieda Goldman in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Journal oj PersonaMi/.</span><span class="font20"> More than a hundred &quot;average” persons participated in the tests. The group that had received breast feeding were found to show “a pronouncedly optimistic jiersonality' with a positive interest in the world and people about them. The group deprived of breast feeding were likely to be pessimists. They were typified as &quot;quarrelsome, unsympathetic, more apt to take the attitude that ‘the world owed them a living.' ” Eric H. Erikson, Margaret Mead and R. Money-Kyrle in their studies of primitive tribes found that “generous suckling and late weaning are related to generosity, optimism and co-operative, peaceful behavior, whereas ungenerous suckling and early weanings coincide with arrogance, aggression and impatience, a tendency to collect and hoard food, competitiveness and quarrelsomeness, attitudes of acquisition and retention, love of property, hostility, suspicion and nostalgic sadness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nursing Benefits Mothers Too</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Babies, however, are not the only ones that benefit from suckling. “Breast feeding contributes to achieving physical and mental development of women” as well, says Dr. Carrel, There are fewer eases of 'maternity blues” among nursing mothers. .Mothers of bottle-fed babiep often complain </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">June</span><span class="font20"> gr, tsr.; of feeling dissatisfied, nervous and </span><span class="font3">de</span><span class="font20">pressed. But this feeling does not occur so often among mothers who nurse their young. “When mothers have proper food, rest, and exercise, their health is distinctly improved by nursing their baby,” reports Dr. Carrel. “After childbirth, the contractions of the womb brought about by suckling prevent the occurrence of hemorrhage. Also they hclj'i the </span><span class="font3">organ </span><span class="font20">to return to its norma] condition. As menstruation ceases, breast activity gives a period of rest to the ovaries. . . . While feeding their babies, mothers learn a great deal about how to live. Also about the ill effects of tobacco, alcohol, and coffee, which enter the blood and directly affect the child. They have to lose many bad habils. They cannot afford to be nervous or temperamental. An intelligen t woman derives great profit from suckling in connection with her present and future health.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In addition to these many advantages there is the a'most unbelievable fact that mothers who &quot;nurse their babies are very much less apt to develop breast cancer than women who do not—particularly those who have had numerous miscarriages or who have not nursed their babies.” Hiis expression was made by Columbia University's College of Surgeons and Physicians through Dr. Fredric W. Bancroft. &quot;It would seem to us,” said Helen Kitchen Branson, consulting psychologist, &quot;that this factor alone would cause every serious-minded expectant mother to consider very deeply before she decides not to nurse her child.” Continuing, she says, &quot;breast feeding. particularly of the very young infant, is so vital to the health of the mother and baby alike, that r.o woman should consider it ‘too much trouble' if she is able to give her baby even a small part of his daily feeding.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">And besides all these benefits, mothers say that to breast feed is to experience a</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">“deep and almost indescribable joy,” A young mother added: “You feel as if you were handing on something precious and priceless, some special kind of love that human mothers have given their babies for thousands of years. It is the most peaceful, joyful feeling I have ever had.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Why More Mothers Do Not Nurse</span></h3>
<p><span class="font23">One might wonder why more mothers do not take advantage of this precious privilege. One report declares that “50 per cent of American mothers today ‘don’t want to.’ ” And that “half of those who do try, fail.” According to Dr. Carrel, Dr. Henry Dietrich of Los Angeles considered some fifty different reasons as valid excuses in 370 cases for depriving children of their mother’s milk. &quot;Some of the reasons,” said Dr. Carrel, “were insufficient or defective milk, failure of the baby to gain weight, weakness of the mother, cracked nipples, and ‘social duties.’ As a matter of fact, these excuses are not valid,” said he. “Ninety per cent of mothers are able to nurse their babies. Only pregnancy, tuberculosis, cancer, and a few other diseases absolutely prevent breast feeding.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">“The true reasons for giving up breast feeding,” said Dr. Carrel, “are both physiological and moral. Modem women are not prepared by their education and habits of life for maternity and its consequences. They are not taught the functional significance of the breast. They are allowed to contract absurd dietary habits. Thus, during pregnancy and lactation, they do not absorb the food indispensable for abundant milk production. No scientific care is taken of nipples and breasts, which should have gentle applications of lanolin from time to time all during pregnancy. Mothers .., are ready to be humored by overzealous pediatricians into bottle feeding. Many mothers believe their work, their career, their social pleasures are more important than the care of their children. They do not understand that their primary duty is motherhood.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Mothers who contend that nursing would tie them down by the regular demand of a hungry baby do not appreciate that nursing is not only cheaper but so much easier than bottle feeding that there is no comparison. There is no trotting around on cold nights, no fussing with sterilizers and slippery nipples, no lugging a whole drugstore with you wherever you go, no formula preparation, sterilizing bottles, no refrigeration necessary, no warming up or transportation difficulties. Nature takes care of all these things. Mothers who fear developing heavy sagging breasts from nursing betray a lack of knowledge of their own anatomy. It is not nursing that is responsible for the sagging breast; more often it is lack of nursing. “Sagging breasts are the result of insufficient care and defective nutrition—</span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font23"> of the actual suckling of the young. If trained by wise physicians, women keep their beauty even after having suckled several babies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">And as for mothers who say that they are “too nervous” or “too civilized” to nurse. Nonsense! exclaim the experts. Every woman comes equipped to nurse her babies. All she needs is the conviction that she can do it. “The modern breast,” says Dr. John Parks of George Washington University, “is as functional as it ever was.” Dr. E. G. Lawler of Chicago, a pediatrician, declares: “Nearly every healthy mother can nurse her baby if she makes up her mind to do so. It has been found that at least 90 out of every 100 new mothers can give their babies breast feedings if they have the right attitude and are encouraged to do so.” In England it is reported that 80 per cent of the babies born in hospitals</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and 95 per cent of those born at home are entirely breast fed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“A baby is tiny such a short time that it is a shame not to enjoy nursing him,” said a mother. And in view of the immeasurable good that it does for both mother and child, it would be unloving on the part of the mother, unless absolutely necessary, to withhold this blessing from herself and the child. Today, it is safe to say that even ‘the finest bottle-fed baby would be finer still if he had been breast-fed.’ For the breast-fed babies are the best-fed babies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font32">J</span><span class="font20">UST as we have various denominations in religion and many divisions within each, such as many different kinds of Baptists, Methodists, Lutherans, etc., so we have certain main schools in psychology and different divisions within each school. However, at this time we shall content ourselves with considering just the four main schools, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Structuralism,</span><span class="font20"> Behaviorism, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Gestalt</span><span class="font20"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Psychoanalysis. As</span><span class="font20"> will appear from our description they each differ radically from the rest, and all have at least some elements of truth in them; some more, others less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The pioneer school of psychology was begun in 1879 in Germany and became known us structuralism. As its name indicates, it concerns itself with the structure of the mind and concentrates on its sensations, on mental Images, thoughts and simple feelings. It sought to learn how the mind functions, and so in its experiments it concentrated on perception, on imagery and on the avenues of approach to the mind, the various senses. Because of its seeking to determine the nature of existence it has also become known as existential psychology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">As far as structuralism was concerned, whether the mind was intelligent or not, whether there was an abnormal condition or not, and what the motives were, were all beside the point. It was simply a study of what may be termed the anatomy of the mind. Revealing is the fact that the best-known work of its founder is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Physiological Psychology,</span><span class="font20"> the name of a field that deals with the manner in which the senses inform the mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Behavioristic Psychology</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Going to the opposite extreme is the American school of psychology known as behaviorism, which is the logical outgrowth of the school of “functional psychology.&quot; It claims the proper field for psychology is not consciousness, sensation, thinking, mental images, etc., but behavior. Since what goes on in the mind cannot be demonstrated except by behavior, all that matters is to study behavior. Bad intentions not translated into</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">actions do no harm; good intentions not translated into actions do no good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Expose subjects, men and animals, to certain stimuli, note the reaction, and you have real scientific evidence. Imagery (of the mind), hopes, ideals, etc., are taboo in behaviorism. All that matters is muscular and glandular actions. Behaviorism seems to have been spawned in the field of comparative psychology and keeps specializing therein for the simple reason that it is easier </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">to experiment with animals than </span><span class="font23">with man. As to the accuracy of their conclusions, that is another matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The behaviorists complained that structural psychology is not an exact, objective science; but neither have their efforts succeeded in producing an exact science. Had they done so, they would not be so divided among themselves, for truth is not divided. As one authority expresses it: “For a psychologist to identify himself as a behaviorist reveals relatively little until he specifies the precise kind of behaviorism he supports. In other words, behaviorists differ so among themselves that we have to speak of varieties of behaviorism. ” While arguing that psychology should be an exact science, they themselves have split into more varieties, and that in a shorter period of time, than have other schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The eventual goal of behaviorism was to be “a body of tested evidence so complete that the behaviorist could predict what a person or animal would do when given stimuli were presented or so that he could tell one what to do in order to bring about desired changes in behavior.” The folly of this kind of thinking was recently highlighted by one of the foremost authorities on the subject in the United States, Dr. Charles W. Mayo, of the Mayo Brothers clinic and alternate representative for the United States at the United Nations. In commenting on the forty Americans who had kept integrity to their country in spite of Communist torture, to compare with those who had compromised, Dr. Mayo observed that “the spirit of man can run deeper than the reflexes of Pavlov.” Pavlov was a Russian psychologist who became famous for his conditioned-reflex theory based on his experiments with dogs.—New York </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font23"> January 28, 1954.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;">“Gestalt” </span><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Psychology</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Gestalt</span><span class="font23"> psychology represents modern </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">German reaction to both structuralism and </span><span class="font23">behaviorism. The term is German and is not translated, because it cannot be adequately translated. However, indicating somewhat its meaning are the attempts to translate it with such terms as “form,” “figure,” “pattern” and “configuration.” This psychology proceeds on the theory that the whole is more than the sum of the parts. A beautiful landscape is more than just the sum of a house, trees, grass, a walk, etc. There is organization, arrangement, harmony, involved in a beautiful landscape. So Gestalt argues that mental life is to be understood in terms of directly experienced wholes, and that to break consciousness down or analyze it by dividing it into its various aspects is to gain an incorrect and incomplete picture. In Gestalt the whole has the priority and the part is always with functional significance, as it relates to the whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Gestalt reminds us that there is always </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">a background, a setting:</span><span class="font23"> a good dinner is not just good food; it is certain kinds of -good food, properly prepared, served in a certain order, with congenial surroundings, friends, beautiful home or restaurant, music, and also—a good appetite. Music is not only melody, but harmony and rhythm, and to enjoy it requires not only the skilled performer but also ability to appreciate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Emphasizing the Gestalt viewpoint is the tendency of the mind to fill in the whole upon hearing or seeing a part; hear</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">one or two jneaaurea of a familiar melody </span><span class="font20">and the mind </span><span class="font3">reconstructs the whole song. </span><span class="font20">Just a partial glimpse of the object of his affections and the lovesick swain reconstructs her whole image.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Emphasizing that the whole is more than or (more correctly) different from its parts is the illustration of a heap of round stones in the shape of a pyramid. The heap is not round, the stones are not pyramidal in shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Gestalt may be said to furnish the most common-sense viewpoint of human nature, although in fairness to structuralism it must be added that the thought of Gestalt appears also in the writings of some of its advocates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Psychoanalysis</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Psychoanalysis represents a decided departure from the other forms of psychology. In the first place, rather than being the product of institutions of learning and psychological laboratories, it is the result of observations, practice and experiments of a practicing neurologist, or nerve specialist. Further, while the other schools of psychology have based everything on the conscious mind, this school, psychoanalysis, places the emphasis on the unconsciousmind; a most strange expression, since we had been taught to think that mind and consciousness were identical. In view of its emphasis on sex and dreams it might be termed as a sex psychology or a dream psychology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Among its outstanding characteristics are its emphasis on the libido or sex drive; its interpretation of dreams to discover what is in the unconscious mind; its dividing consciousness into the conscious, the preconscious and the unconscious; the Oedipus complex by which it holds that man instinctively is incestuous; its dividing human personality into the superego, the ego and the id; and, finally, the classifying of all human drives, instincts or motivation into two general divisions known as the &quot;life instinct” and the &quot;death instinct.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Psychoanalysis, more than any other one school of psychology, has evolved a theory that explains our mental processes, and therefore it is not surprising to note how much of it has been widely accepted: and adopted by doctors, psychologists and psychiatrists. Because some of its interpretation of dreams and stress on sex cannot be scientifically corroborated, however, many have rejected it altogether. Yet, It would seem that the main charge to be made against psychoanalysis is that its advocates, in advocating or condoning free rein as regards the sex instincts, have followed the lines of least resistance and gone far beyond what its discoverers intended. Its sex theory has aroused a storm of criticism, especially as regards exaggeration and overgeneralization, a striking example being Emil Ludwig’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Doctor </span><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freud.</span></p>

<p><span class="font39">D</span><span class="font27">4VA is a land of picturesque volcanoes and cheerful people, A land where life moves to the tempo of the-tropics, A land of everpresent rice fields, banana fronds and coconut palms. It has rich soil, abundant agriculture, a teeming people, and yet appears able to provide for them without the abject poverty of some Asiatic countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">Like many Asian lands it has seen much trouble during the past few years, but in this visit, rather than dwelling on its political problems, we are concerned with its customs and people. The ash from Java's more than 100 volcanoes (eighty-five of which exceed 6,000 feet) has added richness to the soil, and for centuries the Javanese farmers have made good use of the land's rivers in an advanced form of wet rice cultivation. Today forty-two per cent of all the farm land is irrigated, A constant supply of water, channeled from the slopes of the mountains down through the successive steps and stairs of the </span><span class="font27" style="font-style:italic;">sawahs,</span><span class="font27"> or rice paddies, makes rice growing possible the year round. In fact, there is no one harvest-time for the whole island, but a harvest Is in progress in some part of the island almost every week of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">Everywhere can be seen the water buffalo that draws the wooden plow for cultivating the </span><span class="font27" style="font-style:italic;">sawahs.</span><span class="font27"> When not working he will probably be found in his favorite place, deep in a stream or waterhole with just his nose, eyes and horns above the water. These are gentle animals, and frequently small, naked boys can be seen riding on their backs,</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">Java is a land with a great past. Relics of. the great Madjapahit empire are still evident in the old cities of centraPJava, like Solo and Djogjakarta. Here the word “Javanese” is a limited term, applying to the inhabitants pf middle and east Java, and not to the Sunda-nese of west Java. Sunda and Java were originally two kingdoms, and as such had their periods of glory under various Hindu dynasties from the ninth to the twelfth century, £ This is a crowded land. Its fifty million inhabitants, 1,000 to the square mile, make it one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Due to the limited space, farmers are being encouraged to move, at government expense, to undeveloped areas of nearby Sumatra and Borneo, In some cases whole villages have been moved, though not everyone is satisfied in the new surroundings,</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">'V Seventy per cent of the Javanese are engaged in agriculture. They are usually Moslem by religion, but many know very little about their doctrines, A strong belief in evil spirits prevails, magicians are prominent and black magic is common. Despite the prevalence of Islam many of the earlier animistic beliefs still prevail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>t</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font27">7 The farmers live in </span><span class="font27" style="font-style:italic;">kampunga,</span><span class="font27"> or villages, and according to the </span><span class="font27" style="font-style:italic;">adat<sub>s</sub></span><span class="font27"> or customary law, mutual assistance prevails. The villagers cooperate together, assisting each other in planting, harvesting, building, irrigating and the like. All land is under communal ownership. Members of the community are entitled to use the land under certain prescribed conditions, and this right may be hereditary, but there is no right of ownership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">t Customs surrounding births, marriages and death reflect a mixture of Moslem practices and original, ancestral superstitions. During pregnancy a woman must observe strict physical cleanliness, must not wear jewels or flowers, must make offerings to ward off evil influences, After the birth it is thought that evil spirits are hovering around awaiting an opportunity to attack the baby. Offerings are made to put any wandering spirits in a friendly mood,</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">V At burial the body is laid on its right side, with the head toward Mecca, Since it is Believed that while in the grave the dead undergo an examination of their beliefs and be<sub>? </sub>havior while on earth, a set of questions and answers is chanted before the grave is filled in, to equip the dead for this examination. On the third, seventh, fortieth, hundredth and thousandth day after the funeral, offerings are made and prayers said for the repose of the soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">This is a land with a great past, and on our visit here we find that Jehovah's witnesses are showing the way to a far greater future, one blessed by the true God, the Creator of all things. Though their cheerful work is relatively new to this island, it is growing rapidly, providing a way of liberation from binding traditions, pointing to real truth. Happy is the Javan who listens and understands.</span></p><img src="g_E_19540622_files/g_E_19540622-11.png" alt="" style="width:152pt;height:91pt;">
<p><span class="font32">F</span><span class="font20">ROM ancient times to the present, sectarian marks have been put upon the foreheads, arms, or other parts of the body among the Hindus and other'devotees in India. By this mark it is plainly shown who is a follower of the god Vishnu, who of Siva, who of Brahma and who of some other of the multitude of gods. It is an old custom for the worshipers of a particular idol to have their idol’s mark upon a part of the body plainly seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In Bible times it was also customary to set marks on servants and slaves, to distinguish them from others. Now, you may not mark yourself or submit yourself to being marked with such literal marks on your person, but, just the same, you cannot escape being marked, in the Bible sense, to a certain destiny. In fact, this very moment you are wearing a mark. It is your mark of destiny, and your opportunity for life in a dean, righteous new world depends upon it. To God, the Judge of your destiny, this mark is just as plainly visible and decipherable as was the mark he set or prescribed for Cain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But how can we be marked to a destiny of a prosperous life in the righteous new world? It is by being devoted servants of the God of the new world; by identifying ourselves to all we meet as new-world ambassadors. Our choice must be between Jehovah God’s new world of righteousness and Satan’s present system of wickedness. Our words, our conduct and our life course </span><span class="font3">show the choice we have made and how we are being marked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Being marked as a person of good will in the eyes of God is what counts. That there would be a great crowd of such persons on earth as we approach the new world of righteousness the Scriptures indicate. It has pleased Jehovah God to identify and locate his people of good will now on earth by the prophecies of his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In the Bible book of Ezekiel, chapter nine, God shows that a separating work would be conducted by him shortly preceding the battle of Armageddon, and in this prophecy he clearly identifies the people of his choice. Jehovah commands: “Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof.” An abomination to Jehovah is hypocrisy, false religion or Devil-worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Millions of persons righteously disposed toward God see the cruel, unjust and wicked things done in the religious sects and cults of Christendom, counterpart of unfaithful Jerusalem, that “city” which God will wipe out at Armageddon. These goodwill persons seek Jehovah’s help. They desire to know Jehovah and his provision for their salvation and blessing. They have been held in subjection to the false religious organization and have remained with it because they know nothing better. They are described by the prophet of God as ‘the men that sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done in the midst’ of the religious organizations, which organizations claim to serve God. The prophet then shows that God hears their cry and commands his witnesses to go through &quot;the midst of the city,” that is, amidst the organization and the people that constitute the same, and give them an opportunity to hear the truth. They were to ‘set a mark</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">on the foreheads of those that cry and sigh over the abominations done therein.* —Ezekiel 9; 1-6, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Being marked</span><span class="font23"> in the forehead means having the truth of God’s purposes impressed on their minds. The forehead is the seat of intelligence. This publishing work of Jehovah’s witnesses is impressing persons of good will toward God. It is causing them to accept this knowledge and make it their own. They are moved by such knowledge to dedicate themselves to </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">God's </span><span class="font23">will. This knowledge has brought a great change in their lives. They are not conformed to this world of Satan’s, but they have transformed their minds by a study of God's Word. The change is easily recognized by old acquaintances. It is as though they were literally marked, because their lives are so different from their previous conduct that others cannot help but notice the difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The apostle Paul explained this change in these words: “If, however, you were raised up with Christ, go on seeking the things above, where the Christ is seated at the right hand of God. </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Keep your minds </span><span class="font23">fixed on the things above, not on the things upon the earth. . . . Deaden, therefore, your body members which are upon the earth as respects fornication, uncleanness, sexual appetite, hurtful desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. On account of those things the wrath of God is coming. In those very things you, too, once walked when you used to live in them. But now really put them all away from you, wrath, anger, injuriousness, abusive speech, and obscene talk out of your mouth. Do not be lying to one another. Strip off the old personality with its practices, and clothe yourselves with the new personality which through accurate knowledge is being renewed according to the image of the one who created it.’’—Colossians 3:1-9, New </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">World Trans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The mark then identifies one as a true, genuine Christian, a follower of Jesus Christ, it shows that he not only intelligently understands Jehovah’s purposes, but Ilves a life In harmony therewith. It identifies him as ope of Jehovah’s witnesses, a minister who goes from house to house informing the people of Jehovah’s purpose. As long as he abides within Jehovah's organization he no longer sighs and cries; instead he rejoices. He clearly understands </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">the reasons for the present turmoil </span><span class="font23">in the earth, that God is not responsible for it. He has Jehovah’s assurance that this old world will be destroyed, but those righteously disposed toward Him will be preserved to everlasting life in His new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">These “marked ones” join the remnant of God’s witnesses in the search for those that sigh and cry. In God’s due time this witness work, that is to say, the work of ‘setting a mark on the forehead’ of those that want the truth, will be done. This finish is shown by the words at Ezekiel 9:11: “Behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhom by his side, reported the matter, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">saying,</span><span class="font23"> I </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">have</span><span class="font23"> done as thou </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">hast </span><span class="font23">commanded me.” When the work of witness is done and completed by those pictured as the man with the writer’s inkhorn and clothed with linen, then will follow the work performed by God’s executioners, pictured by the six men with slaughter weapons.—Ezekiel 9:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">However, the marked ones are spared. This mark shows that they have obeyed God and that they have performed the conditions named in his Word. The conditions are that they associate with Jehovah’s theocratic organization, work in harmony with it and refuse to compromise with this old world. They must show love for God by obeying his commandments. It is the privilege and duty of all persons to inform themselves thus and be marked with his mark in their forehead to life eternal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Witnesses Preach in All the Earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Bolivia</span></p>
<p><span class="font32">B</span><span class="font20">OLIVIA'S capital city, La Paa, is the highest capital in the world, over 12,000 feet above sea level. Though high above sea level La Faz is located in the bottom of a deep, narrow gully and entirely surrounded by mountains. It is a city of steep streets and many steps. Here, too, in this land of thin air we find Jehovah’s witnesses going from house to house announcing Jehovah’s kingdom as the only hope for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Eight or ten miles outside the city of La Paz might be termed as isolated territory to missionaries. But in these out-of-the-way places Jehovah’s witnesses have found the people keenly interested In learning of God’s Word and his way to salvation. When these small towns are worked with Bible literature a Bible lecture is first arranged to be given to acquaint the people with the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In the mining town of Pulacayo near the Chilean border a Watch Tower missionary was invited into a Protestant church to discuss Bible doctrine. The group of Protestants that met there was without a preacher. The preacher of the church left some years ago when the Catholics became indignant after one of his Bolivian followers destroyed the effigy of the Bolivian Copacabana virgin and a shrine he had built for her on his own place. These Protestants had many questions to ask the Watch Tower missionary about what the Bible had to say about the soul, the destiny of the earth, death, resurrection, hell, etc. After the meeting was dismissed, several of the group accompanied the missionary back to his place of lodging. They remarked happily: “Everybody went home contented tonight. We have heard things tonight that we have never heard before.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Recently one of the Watch Tower missionaries from Oruro and another from Cochabamba went for a trip into the jungles of Bolivia, which lie in the eastern part of the country. There they had the unusual experience of having the police chief in a small village offer to help distribute the Bible literature to those interested. For a good portion of a day the police station was the center of distribution of literature for the villagers, plantation owners and workers. One man stocked up on thirty magazines to take back with him and distribute among his neighbors. There are times and places that the people are so eager to take Bible literature to read that before getting to their territories the missionaries are completely out of literature. People follow the missionaries on the streets and ask for whatever they have. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">One of the greatest obstacles to the spreading of the good news of the Kingdom in Bolivia is the high percentage of illiteracy among the poorer class of people. The language barrier is also a great problem. A large part of the population speaks the principal dialects Aymara and'Quechua, which dialects have not been committed to writing in a general way or practice yet. Helping us to overcome this barrier in Bolivia is a one-time secretary in the local Lutheran church. He is now one of Jehovah’s witnesses. He is acquainted with the Aymara Indians and knows their dialect. Recently he has applied to be a</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">general-pioneer minister so that he might be able to devote all his time to preaching. This is a remarkable show of zeal because this man has a wife and child to support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The people here in Bolivia want to tell their neighbors about God’s kingdom. A missionary who had studied a few weeks with a family was hesitant about inviting them to join him in the preaching work. But he forgot his bag of literature at their home one day. To his surprise when he returned to get </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">it a week later it was</span><span class="font23"> almost empty. The lady of the house had taken most of the Bible literature and placed it with people in isolated towns and villages where she had accompanied her husband in his business. She was overjoyed with her experiences. Now she continues regularly in teaching and preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The La Paz congregation of Jehovah's witnesses accepted the invitation by the Association of Mutilated and Disabled Veterans of the Chaco War to give a series of Bible talks in their hall. The Association advertised these lectures by having notices printed in local newspapers, and they even arranged for spot announcements on various radio stations, inviting the public to attend. All the lectures were well attended and as a result more new faces began to appear at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">At an army post where about fifty men, soldiers and officers, were present, a very animated discussion followed with one of Jehovah’s witnesses. A priest happened in and interrupted with a question. He was handed a Bible and told where to find his ansiver. After </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">fumbling and thumbing </span><span class="font23">through the Bible it became obvious that he was unacquainted with the Scriptures. He was promptly told that a priest, of all people, should know his Bible so that he can teach truth to the people. The soldiers present were quite amazed at the priest’s inability to answer simple Bible questions. From this group of fifty soldiers four of them requested a study be held with them-: in their section of the city so that they too could learn Bible truth. This has been done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">So in Bolivia as elsewhere Jehovah’s witnesses preach and teach. And they find that people everywhere are turning tb Jehovah’skingdom as mankind’s only hope.</span></p>

<p><span class="font27">Forty per cent cl the public school pupils in the U.S. Eve in areas where laws require segregation. In these areas, 17 states and the District of Co* Iiimbia, colored children must attend schools separate from the white children. This system of segregation has its foundation on the ^separate out equal&quot; doctrine laid down by the Supreme Court in 1896, But ever since the end of the Civil War most of the 17 states have had segregation. With This background one can begin ro understand what a momentous decision was handed dewn by the U. S. Supreme Court on May 17. By a vote of 9 to 0 it outlawed racial segregation in public schools, jr effect stamping &quot;unconstitutional&quot; on the public school systems cf 21 states permitting or requiring .segregation, 'Tn the field &lt;3 public education/ Chief Justice Warren said, “the doctrine of ‘separate but equal' has no place. Separate education facilities are inherently unequal/' The derision does not. apply to private schools, railroads or other carriers. When the Supreme Court returns in October for its 1954-1955 session, it will decide when and how the practice now outlawed will be ended. The May 17 decision is noteworthy not only because it was one of the very few major rulings of the Supreme Court that have been unanimous but also because no court since the Dred Scott case of 1857 has ruled on so vital an issue in the fle.d of racial relations. Thus the director of the U. N. Trusteeship Division, Dr. Bunchc, declared: &quot;This decision appears to tie an historic event in the annals cf American democracy/’</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;">Fall of a Fortress</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">When the Kronen established the fortress of Dienbien-phu in northern Vietnam, their theory was that the Communis t-led Victminh would never da re launch a major attack on the well-fortified position, and that if they did they would he defeated, Yet the Reels attacked. The French relied on the mon* soon rains to halt Communist operations. But the French miscalculated both rains and Communist strength. For eight weeks the fortress was besieged. When the Red’s all-out assault came on May 2, each charging Communist soldier was a living arsenal, carrying a Ivelc of high-explosive containers. a submachine gun, a dozen grenades, a rifle or pistol and a long-blade knife. French, machine guns mowed down the Reds like a scythe. But being outnumbered four to one and squeezed into an area about the size of a baseball field, the 14,000 French Union defenders were unable to withstand the onslaught. The fortress fell. Dienblenphu, said Premier Laniel (5/7), had been &quot;submerged&quot; by the human sea of Red hordes. It was the worst defeat the French suffered since the Indo-China war began in December, 1946.</span></p>
<p><span class="font26" style="font-weight:bold;">The Four-Minute Mile</span></p>
<p><span class="font27">As Mt, Everest was for long the goal of mountain climbers, just so the four-minute mile was for long the goal of runners, The closest anyone came to this goal was 4:01.4, the record set by Gunder Haegg of Sweden in 1945. More than eight years passed. Still no one bettered Haegg*s record. But to 25-year-old Roger Bannister, a medical student at Oxford University, the four-minute mile seemed possible. He was so convinced of this that he carefully studied the mechanics cf cuxicimR, knew, too, that scientists had predicted that the four-minute mile was not possible unless conditions were perfect: a windless day and a track of dry clay located in Scandinavia where ozone gives the runner an added lift. But at an Oxford University meet one day (5/6) Bannister decided to make an all-outbid for the long-dreamed-of goal- Conditions? Far from perfect’ The meet was being held in a latitude same 10 degrees south of what the scientists pre bribed. The day chilly, with a ftfteen-nuie-an-hour wind blowing, TTie track was damp cinders. In spite of this handicap, Bannister conquered the Mt. Everest of runners by sprinting the mile in 3 mmutes, 59.4 seconds. AU Britain was exultant. For now the world record belongs to Britain's Roger Bannister, who said afterward: “I had no idea that it was so hard&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">coast&quot; by the construction of a seaway from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. All that prevented the dream from being a reality was a 114-mile stretch between Ogdensburg and Montreal, where canals are only 14 feet deep. Most seagoing freighters draw 20 or more feet of water. So for decades the U. S. and Canada have toyed with the idea of joining hands to make the canals deeper, about 27 feet. But opposition appeared. Powerful lobbies, representing big port cities of the eastern seaboard and eastern and southern railroads, blocked progress. Finally </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font3">opposition crumbled and in January the Senate approved U. S. participation in the seaway.

<p><span class="font3">“Last Pocket of Resistance”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;$&gt; Ever since Egypt’s revolutionary government deposed King Farouk, it has been slowly but effectively eliminating its enemies. Just before May Day, Egypt’s premier, Gamal Abdel Nasser, became convinced that army and civilian enemies were plotting to overthrow the revolutionary regime. In a night emergency session the premier met with the Revolutionary Command Council Quickly the government dispatched jeeploads of police to round up the suspects: 12 army officers and 40 civil-fans. Behind bars the army officers confessed, the government said, that they planned to overthrow the regime and set up Communist rule.

<p><span class="font3">The Precarious Presidency</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&lt;$&gt; Paraguay, a landlocked country in the heart of South America, has a precarious presidency: the nation’s presidents have a habit of suddenly going out of office, but not because their terms expire normally. Thus in 1949 President Federico Chaves came to power after a series of revolutions that produced four different presidents within one year. It appeared that Chaves, who ruled with a strong hand, was to be an exceptional president. But in May a burst of military power also ushered President Chaves out of office. The revolt by the army ended with an estimated 25 persons killed, 100 wounded and an eight-man junta in power. Leading the revolt was General Alfredo Stroessner. Until formal elections Tomas Romero Pereira was appointed provisional president. Why the revolt? Expresident Chaves had decided to militarize the police force similar to the Argentina federal police. Apparently this decision did not please the army. Also Chaves had displayed a strong pro-Argentine trend, and whenever any Paraguayan leader appears to go along with Argentina beyond a certain point, he is ousted. Chaves’ downfall was Paraguay’s tenth revolution since 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pakistan: 3 Official Languages &lt;$&gt; The problems of a multilingual state are many. But Pakistan has come to the conclusion that not recognizing a language spoken by large numbers of people may create even greater problems. Thus Pakistan’s Constituent Assembly has passed a resolution authorizing the use of Bengali as an official language. Bengali, the most popular language in east Pakistan, is a modern Indian dialect. It uses peculiar but beautiful characters derived from the Sanskrit alphabet. The other official languages, English and Urdu, will continue. Since Urdu and Bengali are not closely related Ian-guages, the language cleavage in Pakistan is very real.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Atom Pool: A Dim Hope</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After President Eisenhower .proposed an international stockpile of nuclear fuel for peacetime purposes at the U. N. last December, there was widespread hope that at last a way had been found to end the atomic arms race. Now the atom pool plan as such a hope is growing dim. In May Bernard Baruch, author of the plan for international inspection of atomic activities that the U. S. submitted to the U. N. in 1946, gave a dim view of Elsenhower’s proposal. He declared: “Such a pool, in il-self, cannot solve the basic problem of atomic control. Whatever is allotted this international pool, different nations would still hold back the larger part of available fissionable weapons for developing atomic and other nuclear weapons. . . . The atomic arms race would not slacken.”—New York </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font3"> (5/4).</span></p>

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Greece J Quake Takes Heavy Toll </span><span class="font19">&lt;$&gt; Less than a year ago Greece suffered Its worst earthquake in that country’s modern history, Now Greece has been hit again (4/30) with a major earthquake. The stricken area was central Thessaly, to the north. Pharsala, a tpwn of 1,800 inhabitants, was almost wiped out, in that about 80 per cent of the houses tumbled down. Pharsala is the site of the battle of Pharsalus in 48 B.C., when Julliis Caesar vanquished Pompey the Great. Almost blotted out, too, was the town of Sophades, population 4,000, with 98 per cent of its homes damaged. About 75 per cent of the houses collapsed at. Karditsa, a town of 14,OTO population. Rural areas also suffered when hundreds of houses tumbled down in a cloud of dust. Because the earthquake came on a religious holiday, observed in commemoration of the finding of a &quot;miraculous” aprlng A.D. 559, there was difficulty in getting labor for emergency repair work. When Greece counted up the toll it was heavy: at least 31 were killed, 160 injured. Some 2,200 buildings collapsed and 2,722 were so heavily damaged they were uninhabitable. The homeless numbered 10,000. Reporting on the disaster, Greece’s interior minister said that the earthquake was comparable to the tremors in the Ionian Islands last August that killed 600 to 1,000 persons and left in its wake 120,000 homeless victims.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">A variable star is one that changes in brightness. Some variable stars have a single burst of brightness and then fade to comparative ob_, .a,. This type Is known as nova, exploding star or temporary star. When a temporary star reaches an extremely great pitch of brightness, It is known as supernova. Supernovae often attain a brightness about one hundred million times that of the sun. The last recorded supernova observed In the earth’s galaxy, the Milky Way, was in 1604. So the supernova la a rare astronomical event, said to appear in the average galaxy only about once every 500 years. The discovery of a new supernova was reported in May by the California Institute of Technology. Discovered In a photograph made by Mount Palomar Observatory’s Schmidt telescope. It is in a faint spiral galaxy in the constellation of Virgo designated as “NGC 5668.” The star 'is said to be about 100,000,000 times as bright as the sun.</span></p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The expression “the New World Society” is becoming more and more prominent with each passing day. Just what is it? The New World society is a group of people, Christian people, organized and working together in a common work, meeting together regularly and worshiping the one true God, and striving to live according to a common standard, God’s standard. Being located in 159 different lands its members spread beyond the bounds of any one nation or empire. But regardless of their individual location, one and all look to and serve Jehovah God. During December Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions in all 159 lands will work together, well organized to call at the homes of as many people as they can with Bible truths and aids to Bible study. Three books and three booklets will be offered on a contribution of $1.50, or the <em>New World Translation </em>of the Hebrew or Greek Scriptures and one book on a contribution of $2. The placing of this literature will enable many more to start learning and living for the new world.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Though it seems almost no time since Jehovah’s witnesses gathered for their 1954 district assemblies, it is already time to lay your plans for the 1955 gatherings. Such cities as Chicago, Vancouver, Los Angeles, Dallas, New York, London, Paris, Rome, Nuremberg, Stockholm and The Hague will be scenes of theocratic rejoicing, Christian fellowship and spiritual encouragement. Thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses will attend four, five or more of these assemblies, especially those in Europe. Will you join this enthusiastic group of conventioners traveling to Europe, benefiting from the rich spiritual feasts that will be provided? being stirred to greater activity through the zeal of the brothers you meet in other lands? and being a strength and encouragement to them by your presence there? If you have not yet decided which assemblies you can attend and how you will get there, then now is the time to talk to your local congregation servant and make definite plans. Do it now! June is only six months away, and the first convention will be under way.</p>

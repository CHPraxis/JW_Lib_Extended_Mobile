<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>FINDING THE GREATER HAPPINESS IN GIVING</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In giving to others our desire should be to give that which we treasure most. This presents no problem for even the materially poor of God’s servants, for their greatest treasure is the truth. It was freely given to them and they, in turn, give it freely to others. As this is obediently done in accord with Jesus’ instructions they become happier and richer, for “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>, <em>NW</em>) All the gold and silver in the world will not buy life. The truth makes everlasting life possible. No wonder, then, that all of Jehovah’s witnesses and persons desiring to be happy during May will arrange to spend many hours enjoying the greater happiness of giving the truth to others. The Bible study aid <em>“New Heavens and a New Earth”, </em>along with the booklet <em>After Armageddon—God’s New World, </em>will be presented on a contribution of 50 cents. Enjoy the greater happiness during May by giving what you treasure most—the truth.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>SEEKING EVERLASTING LIFE?</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Just what is required for obtaining everlasting life? The answer is found clearly stated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:1-20:2:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:1-5</a>: “My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding; if thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasure; then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.” To aid seekers of everlasting life to “understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God,” the Watchtower Society has published the 384-page Bible study aid book <em>“New Heavens and a New Earth”. </em>A copy of it and the most interesting 32-page booklet <em>After Armageddon-God’s New World </em>may be obtained on the small contribution of 50 cents. Inquire at the nearest Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses or send your order to us.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">All of Jehovah’s witnesses like to make plans for coming assemblies, and the big assemblies for the United States and Canada will be held in various cities during the months of June, July and August. The Society recommends that you go to the nearest assembly, but you are welcome to attend any one of your choosing. The reason the Society has selected the twenty-one cities throughout the United States and Canada is so it will not necessitate that Jehovah’s witnesses and people of good will travel great distances. Think about it now, arrange for your vacation, plan to be there.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Note that all the district assemblies are for four days, except Toronto, which will be five. The program at all the conventions will be the same. The exception will be Toronto, with one day more, so there will be time to graduate the 23rd Class of Gilead at Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">You may write now for rooming accommodations. Address your mail to the Watchtower Convention. Be sure to send your letter to the rooming address. Do not send any mail to convention halls.</p>

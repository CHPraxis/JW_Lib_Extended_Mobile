Finding Hearing Ears in Thailand
FROM Watch Tower missionaries in Thailand comes the following letter: “To reach the village of Pe Pong we had to travel some twenty-four kilometers (approximately fifteen miles) by bus, which took four hours, and then we had to wade through flooded rice fields several more kilometers. We were received well by the villagers, and after a few minutes of rest we proceeded to advertise the Bible lecture to be held that evening.
“The lecture began at 7 p.m., with all of us seated on the floor. Never had we seen an audience give such careful attention as did that one. Many of them had brought along big Bibles and from time to time they would check what the speaker said with their Bibles. By the time the lecture was completed we found that more than seventy had come through darkness and flooded and snake-infested rice fields and roads, and some from long distances. But they did not want to go home after hearing just one lecture; they wanted more. So other lectures were given and after that their many questions were answered. It was one o’clock in the morning before everybody was satisfied and content to go home.
“The next morning at ten o’clock the villagers gathered again, wishing to hear another lecture, and they did. Three young men wanted to see how Jehovah’s witnesses carried on their preaching activity and they went along with us.
“In the evening at seven o’clock we had a Bible study with the aid of The Watchtower, and some of our new friends answered as well as did our own brothers. Then another Bible lecture, which was attended by sixty villagers. They asked questions until twelve o’clock and would have kept us there longer but we told them we were going to sleep. After the final talk the elder of this congregation expressed himself as follows: ‘We have opened our doors to everybody who has come with the Word of God and to every religious group that we have in Thailand. But never have we had people like you Jehovah’s witnesses.’”

Apology Accepted
● The January 15, 1954, issue of The Watchtower published an article entitled “Do You Respect Plagiarists?” It exposed repeated plagiarism of articles from our publications by a Churches of Christ minister and a Churches of Christ editor, these plagiarized articles appearing as their own in the Gospel Broadcast, a Churches of Christ paper published in Dallas, Texas. When this practice of plagiarism was made public in The Watchtower a written apology was received by us from the minister and the editor, which we accepted. The February 11, 1954, issue of Gospel Broadcast published the exchange of letters.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● The January 15, 1954, issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>published an article entitled “Do You Respect Plagiarists?” It exposed repeated plagiarism of articles from our publications by a Churches of Christ minister and a Churches of Christ editor, these plagiarized articles appearing as their own in the <em>Gospel Broadcast, </em>a Churches of Christ paper published in Dallas, Texas. When this practice of plagiarism was made public in <em>The Watchtower </em>a written apology was received by us from the minister and the editor, which we accepted. The February 11, 1954, issue of <em>Gospel Broadcast </em>published the exchange of letters.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>THE SECRET OF HAPPINESS</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Happy are those who are conscious of their spiritual need,” said Jesus, “since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.” One conscious of his spiritual needs is made happy by studying the Bible and learning the glories of God’s kingdom. Then he is in position to enjoy the secret of happiness—giving. Giving? Yes, giving the blessed information to others, for Jesus said, “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>, <em>NW</em>) Jesus gave the truth freely at all opportunities and instructed his followers to share the life-giving truths with others. During the month of May, Jehovah’s witnesses and all persons of good will toward God will enjoy this happiness by going from house to house sharing the truth with others. The book <em>“New Heavens and a New Earth” </em>and the booklet <em>After Armageddon—God’s New World </em>will be offered on a contribution of 50 cents. If properly used they will help many to start enjoying the secret of happiness.</p>

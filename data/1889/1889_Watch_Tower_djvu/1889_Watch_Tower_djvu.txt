MILLENNIAL DAWN. 
VOL. II. 

"THE TIME IS AT HAND." 

Cloth Bound Edition, 366 pages, now ready. Price $1.00--to 
TOWER subscribers 75 cents (TOWER one year and book 
$1.25). 

Back orders have all been filled; any who ordered and have not 
yet received it, should communicate at once. Any mistakes 
cheerfully corrected. 

A Paper Bound Edition will be published, as soon as we receive 
pledges for 5000 copies, at 35 cents per copy. Send no money 
for these now; merely say how many you desire, if published. 

A perfect deluge of letters and orders followed the 
announcement in our last issue, that DAWN VOL. II. in cloth 
binding was ready for mailing. Such an evidence of interest is 
very refreshing and encouraging to us; for though we labor not 
for the visible results, but for the Master's approval, whether 
men will hear or whether they will forbear, yet none are so 
strong that fruit of labor will not serve to still further strengthen 
them. All have need to remember, however, that their efforts 
accomplish more than appears on the surface, and to remember 
well the apostle's words, that "Our labor is not in vain in the 
Lord," lest we should become weary or faint in our minds. Seeds 
of truth like natural seeds germinate out of our sight. It is only 
when the sprouts and fruitage appear, that we can appreciate, 
"what God hath wrought" by our feeble efforts. 

The additional office work connected with VOL. II., coupled 
with the fact that many of you would be busy reading it, and the 
lateness of the December TOWER, led us to make but one issue 
for January and February. It will count, however, as only one 
number. As twelve papers constitute a year's subscription, this 
change will be of no financial loss to any one. 

We bespeak for VOL. II. very careful study. Some have written 
us, that they have read VOL. I. three and four, and some even 



eight and ten times, with increasing interest and profit. We 
assure such, that in our opinion VOL. II. will require no less 
study. 

The knowledge that eternal torment is not the wages of sin, and 
that because of Christ's sacrifice all men must sooner or later 
come to a full knowledge of the truth and a full opportunity of 
everlasting life, may have tended to decrease the zeal of some in 
the great present work of preaching the gospel— especially where 
they have met with great opposition, before they had caught the 
spirit of the plan of the ages, or seen that present opposition is 
permitted to test, develop and discipline us, and to prove our 
love of and faithfulness to the truth. Relieved from the false 
strain of error and from unholy sectarian zeal and rivalry, some 
sink into a spiritual lethargy and may readily become swallowed 
up in the maelstrom of business, etc., with the majority, and lose 
the very spirit of the truth which set them free. God has provided 
"meat in due season" to give needed strength to his saints, to 
enable them to withstand this tendency of the present day rush 
and ambition, in the knowledge he provides of the hour in which 
we are living. The evidences which God gives us of the time in 
connection with the plan, tend to redouble our zeal in his 
service, showing us clearly that the time is short, in which we 
may make our calling and election sure, by faithfulness to the 
light given us. In a word, the realization, that the Time is at 
Hand-that we are even now in the "harvest" of the Gospel age, 
will not only quicken to double service, but also diminish the 
burden. As we realize that we are now in the eleventh hour, and 
that soon the rewards will be given, we may cheerfully lift up 
our heads and rejoice, knowing that our redemption draweth 
nigh. The day is probably not far distant, when opposition to the 
truth will be so intense, that the trial will be too great to be 
withstood by any not strengthened by a clear understanding of 
the times and seasons of God's Word. Be assured, that no part of 
the Scriptures were prepared for us in vain. Give this subject, 
then, not only careful reading, but more— careful study. 

One brother wrote that he staid up all the first night after the 
arrival of VOL. II. and read it through. This, as an evidence of 
interest, is excellent; but it is not the best way. A more excellent 
way would have been to read one chapter carefully and 
critically. Cramming is as unprofitable with spiritual as with 
natural food. To obtain the greatest nutriment and richest flavors 
from either kind of meat requires careful and thorough 
mastication. 

Many have written expressing the hope that VOL. II. will be 
published in the cheaper, paper, binding. And a line 

page 1 

from Brother Adamson says:— 



DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-It is late at night and I must go 
to work in the morning and yet must acknowledge with joy and 
thanks, MILLENNIAL DAWN VOL. H.-The Time is at Hand. 

I have read but a few chapters yet, but I am carried away with 
you and John the Revelator, to a very high mountain— the 
Kingdom of God established and blessing mankind through Him 
(Christ), to whom all the prophets bear witness. 

I do hope and partly believe, it will have a large circulation- 
many times what you expect. 

I have from the first assumed that we must have a cheap paper 
edition-many of them I hope. And now that you call for 
pledges, I am sure some will expect me to take one fifth of the 
5000 to be pledged, but I think it best to make it 500, or one 
tenth of the amount. I will see what others do— or leave room for 
them to do— and endeavor to do many times what I have 
promised before Vol. III. is ready. I expect, strange as it may 
seem, three classes to want Vol. I., because of having bought or 
seen Vol. II. 

1st, Those who buy from curiosity; 

2nd, All classes of Adventists; 

3d, The mass of the groaning creation -the world, awaiting 
deliverance and expecting it in some way. 

Received the December TOWER also- another bomb in the 
centre of the besieged N.C.-a good number. If I did not have 
full confidence in the justice and love of God in casting off both 
the stumbling houses, I would shudder at the length of apostasy 
and rejection to which they will go, or indeed have already gone 
as a mass. Wait awhile, before you call me "an enthusiast," 
because I say Vol. II. will in some cases sell Vol. I. But directed 
by the spirit we shall all do the very best thing to be done-all 
things considered. In Love, Faith, and Hope, fellowship and 
service, 

J. B. ADAMSON. 

Brother Rogers, who has been doing a great work with DAWN 
Vol. I., in paper covers, in Michigan, writes, that if a 35 cent 
edition is gotten out, he will with the Master's aid become 
responsible for the sale of 1000 copies during the present year. 
These and other similar expressions, 

R1089 : page 1 

with pledges for smaller quantities, seem to indicate that the 
desired number will come to hand, and the cheaper edition 
become a fact. We strongly advise and urge, however, that 
Volume I. be considered the book for all new readers; and that 
Vol. n. be loaned and sold only to those who have read Vol. I. 
carefully. No one is really ready to know the time of the 



fulfillment of God's plans, but the consecrated; and they not 
until they first see clearly, what is to be fulfilled- in the plan. 

VOL. HI., the title of which will be "Thy Kingdom Come," is in 
course of preparation, as we have opportunity. You will need to 
have a clear understanding of Vol. II., before you will be ready 
for the next, which will be a continuation of the same subject. 
Therefore give diligence to make its arguments and proofs your 
own, by tracing every statement to its source— God's Word.

VIEW FROM THE TOWER. 

THE CAUSE IN AFRICA. 

The following information on Missions is furnished by the 
Church Missionary Intelligencer: - 

"Forty additional missionaries bound for Eastern Equatorial 
Africa received their final dismissal in the Cathedral of Algiers, 
Africa. Cardinal Lavigene presided in person, and, after the 
usual addresses, each missionary knelt down at his Eminence's 
feet, and received the kiss of peace and Episcopal benediction. 
After this the missionaries took their position in front of the 
altar, and stood in a row. The Cardinal, the bishops present, and 
all the clergy and seminary students then knelt down and 
humbly kissed the feet of each missionary, in memory of the 
passage of the Scriptures, 'How beautiful are the feet of those 
who bring good tidings.' [A miserable exegesis. -Editor.] 

"Some ardent Protestants may see in all this nothing but 
opposition to Protestant missions, and a determination 'to fight a 
hand-to-hand battle with Protestant missionaries of all 
denominations.' But we think there need be no apprehensions of 
this sort, because even if there were any likelihood of an 
ecclesiastical fight between these good people, Bishop Taylor, 
the Methodist, is already on the ground with a large band of 
missionaries, and expects to establish a line of missions in the 
opposite direction, from the western to the eastern coast, across 
the continent. 

"Fortunately, as it would appear, there can be no such hand-to- 
hand battle with any of our Protestant missionaries, for Cardinal 
Lavigene informed the writer in the Intelligencer, as far back as 
1882, that his orders were that no Roman Catholic establishment 
was to be fixed within sixty kilometers of a Protestant one, and 
it seems that, up to this moment, this rule is still enforced. " 

Thus we see, that Protestants and Roman Catholics are 
recognizing each other in a practical manner; each thus 
recognizes the other as a good and proper teacher of religion; 



and each leaves the other in quiet possession of whatever part of 
the field it may enter upon first. How evident it is, that 
Protestants have lost sight of those doctrines, to which the 
"unchangeable" church was once so opposed, that she 
anathematized as heretics all such and burned many of them at 
the stake. She now calls these "separated brethren"-no longer 
separated much in doctrine, but chiefly now in name and forms. 
She waits to welcome them back to her communion, well 
pleased to hear some of their representative ministers declaring, 
"Every doctrine which we hold dear we received from Rome, 
our Mother." 

But now note the difference: While all denominations can and 
do respect each other's views, what is their attitude toward the 
free, unsectarian teachings of 

R1090 : page 2 

God's Word as presented in Zion's Watch Tower publications, 
without fear or favor except toward God? As the apostle foretold 
(2 Tim. 4:3), They cannot endure sound doctrine; though they 
are willing to make any sort of combination and union to oppose 
the truth. An illustration of this is furnished by recent reports 
from Liberia, on the West Coast of Africa, -the very land in 
which Protestants and Catholics, we are told above, so 
harmoniously co-operate. 

It is now about two years since Brother Seaton, under the Lord's 
providence, by some means unknown to us, receiving some of 
the Watch Tower publications, was led out of sectarian darkness 
into the Bible light. Too noble to attempt to preach covertly the 
Bible doctrines, while under pay to preach for an "ism," the 
doctrines of men, and anxious for the spread of the "good tidings 
of great joy," as well as for the great reward in heaven for those 
who suffer in its service, Bro. Seaton boldly renounced his 
pulpit, salary, etc., and explaining his reasons to his flock began 
to teach and preach the Bible only. As a result of his labors quite 
a number-natives and foreigners- received the truth and are 
rejoicing in it. 

The interest may be judged from the fact that upwards of two 
hundred copies of DAWN VOL. I. and thousands of copies of 
the Arp Tract have gone to two of these mission stations, and we 
now have over fifty regular subscribers to the Watch Tower 
there. 

As might be expected the Episcopal bishop there, Bp. Ferguson, 
was highly incensed against the Bible teacher and teachings 
which led men more directly to the fountain of truth-the Bible- 
and consequently exposed some of the absurdities, pretensions 
and false doctrines of sectarians. Forthwith the bishop formed a 
union of all the denominations represented there-Episcopalian, 
Methodists and Baptists, -to withstand the unsectarian Bible 
Teachings of Bro. Seaton and the TOWER. 



A meeting was held in the Baptist church, in which ministers 
and officers of five churches (three Episcopalian, one Baptist 
and one Methodist) were present to the number of forty-four. 
Here resolutions were passed unanimously, by men who 
probably had never read Millennial Dawn, denouncing it and the 
Watch Tower and the Arp Tracts, as the doctrines of Satan; and 
requesting the prayers of all Christians that the Lord would 
deliver them from their false teachings. A four paged tract 
embodying these resolutions and warnings, and bearing the 
signatures of the aforesaid forty-four ministers and officers was 
printed and scattered; a copy of which is before us. 

Truly, it is wonderful, how Satan does blindfold some of the 
Lord's children; for we have no doubt, that some of these are the 
Lord's, and that if prejudice could be removed long enough for 
them to get a glimpse of the questions really involved, some 
would gladly receive the truth. This union of all the sects against 
the truth reminds one of the union of the Pharisees, Sadducees, 
etc., against the truth in the early church. It reminds us too of the 
prophet's words, "Why do the heathen rage and the people 
imagine a vain thing. The mighty ones of the earth and the rulers 
set themselves in opposition to the Lord and his anointed. " 

Peter said to the Jews, who had crucified the Lord, "I wot that in 
ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers;" and our Lord 
declared of the same, "They know not what they do. " So 
ignorance, blindness, is still the real cause of most of the 
opposition to the truth. The time will come when those who now 
despitefully use and persecute the truth, and its advocates, will 
be brought to a knowledge of the truth, and be ashamed. Thank 
God there is forgiveness for such ignorant opposition to his 
Word. Ere long the mornlight of the grand new day will enable 
all to discern truth from error. Bro. Seaton's last letter tells that 
already prejudice is giving way to some extent. The church there 
requests your prayers and sympathy.

ORIGIN OF SUPERSTITION. 

Archbishop Trench calls words, "the indestructible vesture of 
thought." 

The original thought may have become corrupt, obscured, or 
obsolete; but the word remains "indestructible, " and by it we 
may recover the thought. Superstition is such a word. It 
originally meant something standing over or above— something 
that remains or has taken the place of something else. It is, 
therefore, akin to supersede and superimposed. So the tree 
stands over or above the root of which it has grown; so other 
subsequent cities have stood over and buried out of sight the 



genuine Homeric Troy. But as the something to which the word 
refers is always false or delusive in distinction from the true, so, 
(we may say) does the fungus "stand over" the fallen and 
decayed tree in whose substance it is rooted. Nature and the 
world, like wheat and the corn field as well as religion, are full 
of such false parasitic outgrowths, bred from the decay of higher 
organisms which only exist in lower and degraded forms- 
superstition. 

The word superstition, thus gives us an important thought, of 
which it is the "indestructible vesture." Something previous, and 
in a purer and better form, was before superstition. What was it? 
A comparative history of the oldest religions, such as those of 
Egypt and Persia and India and China, surprises us with many 
likenesses to the Bible faith. Trench has beautifully illustrated 
this idea in his Hulsean lectures, "The Unconscious Prophecies 
of Heathendom, " under such headings as these: "The 
Vanquisher of Hades," "The Son of God," "The Perfect 
Sacrifice," "The Redeemer From Sin," etc. These things were in 
the oldest religions, anticipations of the true and obscured by 
myth and superstition; but how did they get there? The idea of a 
suffering God was not unfamiliar to the Eastern mythologies — 
one who, like the Egyptian Osiris, also descended into Hades 
and there judged the dead righteously. And in their worship 
these religions were all originally monotheistic. The inference 
is, of course, the one suggested by the word superstition. It is an 
independent peep into the Eastern world, far up under the dawn. 
Outside the Jewish nation and uninfluenced by it, before 
Abraham's day, before the evolution of superstition, there was 
among the scattered nations a purer religion, and one received, 
apparently, from the same general reservoir of truth. Nor, if 
Moses was inspired to record for us the true history, need this 
surprise us. And Christ must in some way be got rid of, before 
skeptics can get rid of "Moses and the prophets." According to 
the Mosaic chronology Abraham was fifty-eight years old when 
Noah died: he lived to be one hundred and 

R1091 : page 2 

seventy-five, and even then died thirty-five years before Shem! 
Up to that time these two patriarchs of the flood were living 
somewhere among those Eastern nations. They are not 
mentioned, nor any of the nations except Egypt, because they no 
longer touched the onward historic stream. But, at the dispersion 
of Babel, some two hundred years before Abraham's birth, these 
two must have gone with some of the descendants, carrying with 
them, as they had already made known, the true religion, and 
something of the earlier civilization. 

This fact of an earlier religion, however soon and widely it may 
have become corrupted, explains some things which the brevity 
of Scripture has left obscure. When Abraham, himself a 
monotheist from the Euphrates in the East, was in the vale of the 



Jordan in the far West, there came to him and blest him, 
Melchizedec, "Priest of the Most High God; " whilst not far off 
there was Abimelech and his people, with whom still dwelt "the 
fear of the Lord." This in Canaan itself, and in the very 
neighborhood of Sodom! But from beyond that same distant 
Euphrates, 470 years later than Abraham's time, came Balaam to 
confront Moses and Israel; a man who worshipped the same 
God with Moses, and by the same name: "I cannot go beyond 
the word of Jehovah, my God;" the man who, when the king of 
Moab, in his terrible extremity, proposed to "sacrifice his first 
born," uttered those sublime words, recorded only by Micah: 
"Jehovah hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth 
the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and 
to walk humbly with thy God!" "Hath showed thee" -where, 
how, in what early record known to both Balaam and the king as 
the word of the "Lord?" Moreover, of this Balaam from the far 
Euphrates it is said, that he "knew the knowledge of the Most 
High"-the very word used for God by Abraham and 
Melchizedec in the valley of the Jordan. Except once in 
Deuteronomy, we do not meet it again till the history gets back 
to the Euphrates, to Daniel, to the Chaldeans, to 
Nebuchadnezzar the Assyrian, and to Cyrus the Persian. They 
all use it, as evidently the earliest and the descended term for the 
one God. It brought Cyrus, as belonging to a common 
monotheistic worship, into sympathy with the Jews. It is known 
to-day among the mountains of Tibet; and in the form of Shang- 
Ti, is the one missionaries in China have adopted to express the 
idea of God. 

This word (in its different forms), Most High, the Highest, the 
Lord God of Heaven, is, indeed, itself pregnant with thought. It 
indicates a process of thought and a conviction in the earliest 
men as they looked up to heaven; a conviction of a One God 
who was above all in power and glory, and to be worshipped. It 
was a source of conviction independent of any other source of 
knowledge, as, for instance, Noah and Shem; and how strongly 
it impressed them is crystallized in the word they used and 
handed down to indicate God. David felt precisely the same 
when he exclaimed: "The heavens declare the glory of God, and 
the firmament showeth his handiwork. " And this has an intimate 
bearing upon some present discussions about the heathen. Paul 
declared them "without excuse." Why, upon what ground? Upon 
the ground that "the invisible things of him from the creation of 
the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that 
are made. " Their lapses into idolatry and superstition, with the 
consequences, were purely willful-they "did not like to retain 
God in their knowledge. " Up the stream of universal history 
there was that knowledge, "clearly" to be derived, in all ages, 
from the same overspreading testimony, the heavens. The power 
of that testimony and its effect upon the earlier men, lives in 



many languages, in that "indestructible" word, the Most High 
God. --A. G. Vermilye. 

REMARKS BY THE EDITOR. 

The above observations are valuable, considered in connection 
with Paul's inspired account of how ignorance and superstition 
came to be so wide-spread throughout the world, as detailed in 
Romans 1:18 to 3:23. Deplorable and dense as the ignorance and 
superstition of the world is, it is well that all should see that it is 
not the fault of God, that it is not because God made men 
degraded and vile. It is necessary that this be fully recognized as 
an offset to the growing idea that God did a very imperfect work 
in the creation of man, and that present progress from darkness 
and superstition, to light and reason and civilization, is merely 
human development— evolution. 

Be it noted, that the Scriptures everywhere give one harmonious 
account of the origin and cause of evil and ignorance in the 
world, and show that God is not guilty; they tell that "God hath 
made men upright but they have sought out many inventions" 
(Eccl. 7:29); and that it was when and because man was not 
desirous of retaining a knowledge of God in his heart that God 
gave them over to a reprobate mind. (Rom. 1:28.) Thus sin, 
which entered at Eden (Rom. 5:12), manifested its tendency to 
be continually downward, except as God introduced "the salt of 
the earth" (those exercised by his truth- led of his spirit) whose 
influence has been to keep the social mass from utter corruption. 
Thank God for the blessed assurances of his word, that though 
the world has been thus left largely to its own course, that both 
angels and men may see the real tendencies of sin, yet, that 
when this severe lesson has been well illustrated and deeply 
impressed, then He will through his anointed ones, Christ Jesus 
and his Bride the overcoming church, arrest the sway of 
ignorance, and sin, and superstition, and cause the knowledge of 
the Lord and his perfect plans to fill the earth. Thank God that 
his promised kingdom (the glorified church "a royal priesthood" 
—rulers and teachers) shall re-establish righteousness and give to 
the billions of earth (who, as inheritors of sin and weakness, 
have never known or been able to appreciate righteousness, 
purity, and their attendant joys), an opportunity to taste and see 
that the Lord is gracious and that wisdom's righteous ways are 
ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. 

When thus the right is known, and its results appreciated, all will 
be permitted to choose good or evil, right or wrong, 
righteousness or sin, obedience or disobedience to God; and 
according to their choice, they shall receive their final and 
lasting reward; according as it is written, "The wages of sin is 
death [extinction, the withdrawal of all life], but the gift of God 
is eternal life through Jesus Christ, " to as many as truly accept 
of him as their Lord and Master.

ALL THINGS NEW. 

The world is old with centuries, 
But not for these she bows her head; 
Close to her heart the sorrow lies, 
She holds so many dead! 

Sad discords mingle in her song, 
Tears fall upon her with the dew, 
The whole creation groans— How long 
Ere all shall be made new? 

Yet brightly on her smiles the sun, 
A bounteous heaven delights to bless; 
Oh, what shall be that fairer one, 
Wherein dwells righteousness? 

Oh, happy world! Oh, holy time! 

When wrong shall die, and strife will cease, 

And all the bells of heaven chime 

With melodies of peace. 

No place shall be in that new earth 
For all that blights this universe; 
No evil taint the second birth, 
'There shall be no more curse.' 

Ye broken hearted, cease your moan; 
The day of promise dawns for you; 
For He who sits upon the throne 
Says, 'I make all things new.' 

We mourn the dead, but they shall wake! 
The lost, but they shall be restored! 
Oh, well our human hearts might break 
Without that sacred word! 

Dim eyes look up, sad hearts rejoice, 
Seeing God's bow of promise through, 
At sound of that prophetic voice: 
'I will make all things new.'" 



R1091 : page 3 



THE DESIRE OF ALL NATIONS. 

"We know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in 
pain together until now,. ..for the earnest expectation of the 
creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God." "And 
the Desire of all nations shall come. "-Rom. 8:19,22; Hag. 2:7. 



Thus the apostle and the prophet refer to the woes of earth and 
the great remedy which God has provided, and which is soon to 
be applied. None, experienced in life or acquainted with history, 
will dispute the correctness of the apostle's statement. And the 
declaration of the prophet, that God will eventually establish a 
reign of righteousness in the earth which, when realized, will 
indeed be the desire of all nations, is borne out by the testimony 
of every prophet and apostle (Acts 3:19-21), and cannot, 
therefore, be disputed by any who acknowledge the inspiration 
of the Bible. 

The cause of all creation's groaning and pain is sin; for all the 
moral as well as the physical degradation which directly or 
indirectly causes the pain and groaning of humanity, is part of 
the wages of sin. Humanity is thus under a blight and suffers 
both individually and as a whole. Its own imperfect and often 
unjust governments, as well as its aches and pains of body and 
mind, are the natural consequences of its imperfect, fallen 
condition. And though men can do something toward general 
improvement, their efforts are at best, but feeble and spasmodic; 
they are utterly incapable of releasing themselves from their 
difficulties. Their varying success, but on the whole futile efforts 
for the past six thousand years, prove this conclusively. 

They have never yet, in all the centuries they have had for 
experiment, succeeded in establishing a perfect government; nor 
have they silenced the groans and wiped away the tears of the 
race, or lifted it up physically, or mentally, or morally, to the 
image of God in which they were created, as represented in 
Adam. Diseases of every description still prey upon them 
physically. There are still burning fevers, wasting ulcers, 
frightful cancers, 

R1092 : page 3 

loathsome skin and poisonous blood diseases; and there are 
sightless eyes, deaf ears, dumb tongues, broken backs and limbs, 
and other physical disorders and deformities. Mentally, their 
condition is still worse: some are crazed; others are partially so; 
and in all the race not one is perfectly balanced. Morally, their 
condition is no less deplorable; selfishness, and greed, and pride, 
and love of display, and hatred, and malice, and evil speaking, 
and deceit, and envy, and contention, and war, and bloodshed, 
wring agonizing groans from the lips of millions; and desolate 
widows, and helpless orphans, and broken-hearted mothers, and 
grief-stricken fathers, and disappointed friends still weep over 
the graves of buried hopes and fond ambitions. 

Truly, it is a groaning creation still; and yet, as the apostle 
suggests, they are not hopeless; they are waiting for something, 
they know not exactly what— a panacea for sickness and pain 
and sorrow and death, and a just and righteous government, 
which will lift up the poorest and meanest from the mire of 



ignorance and squalor, to comfort and happiness and a share of 
life's luxuries. They are looking forward to "a good time 
coming," "a golden age," of which even heathen poets and 
philosophers have dreamed in glowing terms. And some, 
catching a strain from the divine inspiration, though unconscious 
of how it will be brought about, sing of a blessed millennium- 

When man to man united, 
And every wrong thing righted, 
The whole world shall be lighted, 
As Eden was of old. 

But what heathen poets and philosophers, and all mankind have 
longed and vaguely hoped for,— but have proved themselves 
utterly incapable of bringing about, with all their state-craft and 
priest-craft, and multiplied religious ceremonies and forms of 
godliness without the power,- God, through his prophets, has 
clearly and definitely foretold, will come. And further, he has 
shown exactly, how it is to be brought about,— that it is to come 
to pass through the agency of the Lord Jesus Christ, the 
messenger of Jehovah, who nearly nineteen centuries ago 
redeemed the world, giving his life as the ransom-price for the 
life of the world; and who will shortly set up his Millennial 
kingdom and establish his authority over the redeemed world. 
He will not oppress the people and exalt himself, as human 
rulers generally do; but will "bless all the families of the earth" 
through a wise and righteous administration. Having "tasted 
death for every man," and thus secured the right to give 
everlasting life to all who shall prove themselves worthy of it, 
the object of his Millennial reign will be to so instruct, train and 
discipline men, as to enable them to become worthy of lasting 
life, on the original conditions-perfection and obedience. To 
this end, he will first "rule with a rod of iron" (Psa. 2:9) -with 
power and force, causing in the overthrow of present imperfect, 
selfish, proud and unjust systems, "a time of trouble such as 
never was since there was a nation" (Dan. 12:1); and then he 
will "fill the earth with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, 
as the waters cover the sea." (Hab. 2:14.) He will restrain and 
humble the wicked and selfish, and bless and lift up the humble 
and those seeking righteousness (Zeph 2:3; Matt. 5:5); finally 
making an end of sin and all its train of evils, by destroying 
(finally and forever) all who then, with full knowledge and 
appreciation, still love sin; and by bestowing upon all who shall 
then love righteousness "the gift of God," everlasting life.-Rom. 
6:23. 

OBSTACLES TO FAITH IN 
CHRIST'S MILLENNIAL KINGDOM. 

All this would seem reasonable to thinking people but for two 
reasons. One is, that another, and an unscriptural view has for 
centuries predominated, and the people have been instructed 



from infancy in that direction. The second reason is, that so long 
a period has elapsed, before the establishment of this kingdom 
as the remedy for sin and its disorders. Yet so convinced are 
people of the propriety of such a divine rulership, that regardless 
of facts and Scripture, some claim that Christ is reigning over 
and ruling the world now. And yet, if posted in the world's 
history, and candid, all must admit that it has been a 
monstrously bad rule; and all might well pray that it be 
discontinued. Humanity, if given the entire control, certainly 
would not do much worse than has been done in the way of 
misgovernment. 

As we look backward our hearts are sickened with the injustice, 
misery and oppression we behold. If this be God's kingdom and 
ruling, let it end; it is far from what sane people want. But it is 
not God's kingdom. On the contrary, as the Scriptures declare, it 
is the dominion and ruling of Satan, "the prince of this world" 
(John 14:30), and will cease with the introduction of Christ's 
Millennial Kingdom, for which his servants have long prayed, as 
some still do, "Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as 
it is done in heaven. " 

People naturally wonder that God has not long since exerted his 
great power (his kingdom power and authority) to suppress sin, 
and to lift mankind out of its present state of ignorance, 
superstition, groveling depravity, disease and death. But since 
six thousand years have passed without such an interposition, 
they reason that God's future dealings should be judged of by 
the past. And hence they think, we cannot expect such a rule or 
kingdom in the future, believing that all things must continue as 
they now are and have been from the foundation of the world. —2 
Pet. 3:4. 

But what reply can be made to this objection? We answer: It can 
be shown that the Scriptures teach that God not only has 
promised such a kingdom for the purpose of blessing the world, 
but that he also foretold the long period intervening, in which 
evil has been permitted. And they show good and sufficient 
reasons for the six thousand years' delay. This, clearly seen, 
should remove every obstacle to faith in the promised Millennial 
kingdom. Yet, in examining the reasons for the delay of the 
reign of righteousness, let us not forget that it is only as 
measured by the shortness of present life that six thousand years 
seems very long. With God, "a thousand years are but as 
yesterday. "-Psa. 90:4. 

WHY THE LONG DELA Y. 

The long delay and its purposes are clearly marked in the 
Scriptures. Over four thousand years after the first promise of 
deliverance, the redemption was accomplished; and nearly two 
thousand more fill the measure of the Gospel age for the 
selection and development of the Gospel church to be the bride 



of Christ and joint-heir with him of the coming Millennial 
kingdom; while the long six thousand years were designed to 
give the race a necessary experience with the dreadful effects of 
sin, its exceeding sinfulness, and the firmness of that justice 
which will by no means clear the guilty violators of God's just 
and holy law— an experience which will be of inestimable value 
to all, for all eternity. By contrast, it will lead to such an 
appreciation of righteousness, during Christ's Millennial reign, 
as to make it, when realized, what the prophet predicted— "The 
desire of all nations." 

The delay, from the time of the redemption to the Millennial 
age, while it served this purpose to the world, served also a 
further purpose— the development of the Gospel Church, a "little 
flock" of believers in and followers of Christ, sharers of his 
reproach in the present time, and thus selected to share his 
Millennial work and glory,-to reign with him as joint-heirs of 
the long promised Kingdom of God for the blessing of all the 
famiHes of the earth. -Gen. 28:14; Gal. 3:16,29. 

The selection of this company, as individuals, has been in 
process during the entire Gospel age now closing, though as a 
class they were foreknown from the foundation of the world. 
(Eph. 1:4.) That is, God predetermined to exalt to this kingdom 
honor and restitution work a certain class, each of whom should 
meet certain predetermined conditions; and the Gospel age of 
nearly two thousand years was appointed as the time for 
developing, testing and selecting the individuals who should 
compose that class. The election of these individuals is not 
arbitrary, but according to fitness; the qualifications being, first, 
justification by faith in Christ; then meekness and devotedness 
to God's service, at the cost of self-sacrifice. 

Many (justified believers) were "called" or invited to share these 
kingdom honors, but only the above mentioned, a faithful few, 
will be selected or chosen; the majority even of professed 
Christians, we are informed, will fail to make their calling and 
election sure; and hence will fail to share those kingdom glories 
as joint-heirs with Christ their Lord-though with the world they 
will be blessed and disciplined under this kingdom. During the 
Millennial age, Christ's power will be exercised to prevent 
deceptions, to clear away ignorance, to strengthen the weak and 
lead and restore to sight those now blinded by the god of this 
world. (2 Cor. 4:4.) A thousand enticements to sin, which appeal 
specially to the depraved appetites of the fallen race now, will 
not be tolerated, when the new, heavenly rule is established. But 
the Gospel church— the kingdom class— is called and tested 
during this age, while evil is permitted to hold sway, in order 
that their testing may be like that of gold tried in the fire. This 
company will be complete when the present age ends, and the 
control of earth will then be entrusted to them, under and in co- 



operation with the Lord Jesus, then the King of kings. — 1 Cor. 
6:2. 



LOOKING FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD. 

No student of the Bible can have overlooked the fact that the 
constant theme 

R1093 : page 3 

of our Lord and his apostles was the coming Kingdom of God. 
The Jewish people, as a nation, had for centuries expected 
Messiah's coming, to be the ruler of the world; and they 
naturally expected that as he was to come out of their nation, 
they would be his soldiers, co-workers, and joint-heirs in that 
kingdom. They knew themselves to be the natural seed of 
Abraham, and inferred that they were indispensable to God's 
plan. They saw not, that spiritual children of God, of the faith 
and loyalty of Abraham, were meant by the promise. 

But the real greatness of the promised kingdom and its work of 
blessing were not appreciated by Israel: they expected a 
kingdom similar to the kingdoms of this world; that Messiah, as 
a fleshly being of the seed of Abraham, would establish his 
kingdom at Jerusalem, and that his glory would be the earthly 
glory of purple 

R1093 : page 4 

and fine linen and gold and silver and the usual accompaniments 
of earthly royalty. And their pride and ambition longed for the 
time when this promised king should exalt himself above the 
Caesars, and them above all the nations of the earth. Hence their 
rejection of him who came humbly, born in a manger, with no 
assumptions of titles, or earthly honors, or influence, or even 
friends; and yet he came proclaiming the kingdom of heaven at 
hand and himself the promised king. 

So thoroughly impressed upon the Jewish mind, was the 
thought, that Messiah's coming meant the establishment of a 
kingdom of righteousness, that several times the "common 
people" would have taken Christ by force to make him king; but 
he withdrew, that their ardor might cool, knowing that they who 
shouted "Hosanna to the Son [and heir] of David" were not the 
class whom the Father designed should be the joint-heirs with 
him of that kingdom. He knew too, that the Father's time for his 
exaltation to power had not yet come, and that first he must die 
to purchase those whom he was to afterward reign over,— to 
whom he might therefore restore the original blessings and 
favors lost for all through Adam's failure. -Rom. 5:12-19. 

Like others, the twelve apostles held this hope of the kingdom, 
and believed Christ to be the promised Messiah, or King of 
kings. And our Lord Jesus, so far from ever contradicting their 
ideas, always encouraged them, and told them that they should 



yet sit with him in his throne. But, he explained that "first he 
must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation" 
[people]. To the same class he explained that, as it had been 
written in the prophets, -"thus it behooved Christ to suffer and 
to rise from the dead;" and said to them: "O, slow of heart to 
believe all that the prophets have spoken; was it not needful for 
Messiah to suffer these very things and to enter into his 
[kingdom] glory?" 

One of our Lord's parables, given just before his crucifixion, 
was for the very purpose of teaching them that the expected 
kingdom would be deferred until his second coming. It is 
introduced thus: "And he spoke this parable unto them because 
they were near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the 
Kingdom of God would be manifested immediately. " (Luke 
19:1 1-27.) That parable represents the Gospel age as the period 
in which Christ, "the Nobleman," went "into a far country" 
(heaven), to receive for himself a kingdom— to be invested with 
authority. The parable also shows that during the absence of the 
Nobleman, the opponents of his rule are in the majority and hold 
sway; they even declare that they do not desire him to come and 
establish his kingdom, preferring to be let alone as they are- 
"They sent an embassage after him, saying, 'We do not desire 
this man's rule."' 

The parable shows, too, the proper attitude of those who love the 
Nobleman. Obedient to his command, "Occupy till I come!" 
they are to use their various talents to forward the interests of his 
coming kingdom. And finally, the parable shows that the 
Nobleman will surely return with full power, and how he will 
use it, to reward those faithful to him with a share in the 
kingdom, and to destroy all opposed to his rule of righteousness. 
Thank God, there is good reason to believe that many now 
enemies to the King of kings will not be such, when present 
misconceptions are cured by the increased knowledge of the 
King's character, plan and kingdom, then to be afforded to all. 

A SCRAP OF HISTORY. THE BEGINNING OF 
PRESENT, SO CALLED CHRISTIAN KINGDOMS. 

During the first century of its existence the church held firmly 
to the Apostolic teaching and waited for the second coming of 
the Lord Jesus, and the establishment then of the long-promised 
kingdom of God and its rule of righteousness, by which triumph 
all overcoming Christians were to share with Christ. The period 
of that reign, it was generally understood would be a thousand 
years.-Rev. 20:2-4. 

Chamber's Encyclopaedia says, "In the first Century of the 
church, Millennarianism (the Greek equivalent of which, 
Chiliasm from chilioi, a thousand, is the term employed by the 
"fathers") was a widespread belief.. ..The unanimity which early 



Christian teachers exhibit in regard to Millennarianism, proves 
how strongly it had hold. " 

This was the period of the church's purity and fervor, before she 
left her first love. But, as time passed, and the expected Lord 
came not, the love of many waxed cold and their hopes turned in 
other directions. Then, as Christianity became formalistic, 
Grecian philosophers came into the church, and the doctrines of 
Christ became blended with heathen mythologies, producing the 
great apostasy, or falling away from the true faith, foretold. (2 
Thes. 2:3.) Nevertheless, there was always a faithful, though 
small minority, which clung to the truth; for the Lord has never 
left his truth without witnesses. 

It was at this time, that the degenerated Christian system 
conceived the view commonly held since, that the Church was 
to establish Christ's Kingdom upon the earth, without waiting 
for the Young Nobleman's return, and that Christ would come 
after the Millennial reign of the Church had ended-to approve 
her work. This is styled the post-millennarian view of the Lord's 
coming. This view introduced into the nominal church an 
aggressive political policy; and thenceforth the Church sought 
influence with the civil power,— and that successfully, though to 
her injury and apostasy. It was not long until Christianity was 
recognized by Constantine, the Roman emperor. Soon, from 
among several aspiring chiefs, or bishops, the bishop of the city 
of Rome rose to prominence and influence in religious matters, 
and finally to influence in the empire. In 534 A.D. the emperor 
of Rome, Justinian, recognized the Bishop of Rome as chief 
bishop, or POPE-the head of the religious affairs of the Roman 
empire, which for centuries had ruled the world. 

This great success, though accomplished by cunning, trickery 
and scheming political intrigue, wholly foreign to the spirit of 
true Christianity, and in opposition to the express counsel of the 
Lord and the apostles (Matt. 20:25-28; 23:8-12 and 1 Pet. 5:3), 
was hailed as the beginning of the establishment of Christ's 
kingdom in power. By this time, be it remembered, the nominal 
church numbered millions who were Christians in name merely, 
and totally ignorant of the doctrines of Christ; for the clergy had 
gradually lowered the true standard, amalgamated errors, and 
exalted themselves, to gain popularity and to draw the people, 
through fear and superstition, to their support. And when the 
imperial authority began to recognize the apostate church, and to 
concede its false claims, the unregenerate heathen millions 
rushed into her bosom, adding to her defilement their 
uncircumcised views and heathen superstitions. So fast did they 
come, that the original form for symbolizing consecration by 
immersion, was abandoned as no longer practicable, and the 
multitudes were sprinkled. 

But though nominal Christianity had now gained freedom from 
persecution, civil recognition, and finally religious jurisdiction 



as Papacy, her ambition, sustained by her post-millennial error, 
was far from satisfied. Scheming, plotting, etc., continued, under 
the theory that the end justifies the means, until the power, 
authority and crowns of the civil rulers of Europe, were 
subjected to the popes. The beginning of this temporal power 
was gradual, from A.D. 539, but it was fully established in A.D. 
800, when Charlemagne, king of France, was crowned by Pope 
Leo III., and accepted from him, and by his supposed divine 
authority, the title of Emperor of the West. There, really, what 
was afterward known as the "Holy Roman Empire," had its 
beginning. 

Thenceforth it was boldly claimed and generally admitted 
(except by the Lord's faithful few, who discerned the apostasy 
and waited for the establishment in righteousness of his true, 
promised kingdom) that the (nominal) church was God's 
kingdom in the world, and that the popes successively 
represented Christ as King of kings, while as his joint-heirs, 
cardinals and bishops filled the places promised to the 
overcomers. In support of these claims, the universal authority 
of the popes in matters both secular and religious was claimed 
and admitted; and kings and emperors representing the greatest 
nations of Europe and the world (even England and Germany) 
prostrated themselves at the feet of the pope, acknowledging 
him as King of kings. Every title which the Scriptures apply to 
the true Christ, and every prophecy describing his future 
kingdom and its glory has been applied by the popes to 
themselves and the kingdom thus introduced, which was none 
other than the kingdom of Antichrist, the counterfeit of the true, 
predicted by the prophets and apostles. (See 2 Thes. 2:3-7; Dan. 
7:25,26; Rev. 13:4-8.) The deception was so 

R1094 : page 4 

great and magnificent that all the nations of Europe were 
deceived; and as the Lord himself foretold, had it been possible, 
the very elect [faithful] would also have been deceived by it. 

But the inevitable came: the reverence and flattery of the people, 
the pride and power of the clergy, and especially of the higher 
dignitaries, gradually sunk the doctrines and practices so low as 
to excite the disgust and open the eyes of the honest and blinded 
souls connected with the system. It was nearly a century after 
the invention of printing, when men were beginning to think for 
themselves, that the public sale of indulgences by the authority 
of the pope for the purpose of raising money for the completion 
of St. Peter's Cathedral at Rome, and particularly by one John 
Tetzel, a Dominican monk of notorious character and shameless 
effrontery, that general indignation was aroused; and under the 
bold leadership of Luther, Zwingli, Carlstadt, Melanchthon, and 
others, a Reformation movement set in, which, though beset by 
many hindrances, thank God, is not yet extinct. It is progressing 
steadily toward the utter repudiation of priestcraft and the 



various superstitions and errors of the dark ages, back to the old 
landmarks of primitive simplicity and purity which 
characterized the apostolic church, both in life and doctrines. 

Luther, Knox, Melanchthon, Zwingli, Calvin, and others of their 
time, though still befogged by the errors of Antichrist, which for 
so many centuries held the world as under a mesmeric power, 
made remarkable progress out of the darkness toward the full, 
clear light. When all the circumstances of their time are realized, 
it cannot be denied that they were remarkable men, and that they 
not only took a courageous step, but a long one in the right 
direction. The trouble is that those who since have followed 
these leaders, have taken their names as sects, without having 
their spirit of reform. So far from continuing the reform 
movement, each party or sect set itself against all light, truth, 
and reformation in advance of what its leader had seen and 
advocated. Hence reform almost ceased with the reformers of 
the sixteenth century. What progress has since been made, has 
been in opposition, not only to Papacy, but to professed 
Protestants as well. 

But the course of the reformers was not a wholly 
uncompromising one. They soon saw that the masses of the 
people were so steeped in ignorance that they could not 
appreciate the Scriptural teaching that God is no respecter of 
persons; and that in his sight all men are free, and that king, 
peasant and slave are on a common footing before God. So long 
had people been taught that the pope and church dignitaries 
represented God, and must be obeyed as God; so long had they 
been taught that kings and princes, when crowned and 
commissioned by the pope, were God's appointed rulers, 
reigning by God's authority in matters civil, as the "clergy" by 
the same authority reigned as princes in matters religious; so 
long had they been taught that to deny or oppose such pope- 
sanctioned authority, was to deny and oppose God and his 
kingdom, that (under this ignorance and superstition) to have 
declared the whole truth, would have involved all Europe in 
anarchy and lawlessness. Stepping out of such deep slavery of 
mind and body, into full liberty, the masses were far from 
prepared to use it wisely. 

This, indeed, was the basis of the conflict between the early 
reformers. Zwingli in Switzerland, was a representative of some 
who took their stand for full liberty; he not only denied the 
authority of the pope to rule the church, but denied also his 
authority to appoint civil rulers in the name of God. He claimed 
for the people the right to elect their rulers, as we do in this great 
Republic. Here, Luther wavered for a time as to what course to 
pursue, when he saw that the reform, fully carried out, would 
not only take away the authority of the pope, but also the 
authority of all the princes and kings of earth appointed by him. 
While retired for ten months in Wartburg Castle under the 



hiding and protection of Elector Frederick, Luther reflected on 
the situation carefully; then he came forth to oppose Zwingli, 
Carlstadt and others under whose preaching the images in the 
churches were being dashed to pieces and the Mass abolished. 
His plea was moderation. He cooled the rising ardor of the 
Germans, and with Melanchthon turned the German 
Reformation into the channel which it finally took. The German 
princes on the one hand glad to be freed from their abject 
bondage to Papacy, and on the other hand glad to escape the 
growing tendency of teachings such as Zwingli's, recognized in 
the teaching of Luther and Melanchthon a way of escape from 
both, which would still preserve their powers, and even increase 
them. From policy, therefore, many of 

R1094 : page 5 

the German princes embraced the Lutheran cause, which 
prospered, while the yet more thorough reformers and their 
works went down. 

Why did not God forward the greater and purer views? it may be 
asked. Because it was not then due time, we answer. But slowly, 
after three centuries, thinking people will admit that Zwingli and 
Carlstadt were much nearer the truth, much more thorough 
teachers of reform than Luther. D'Aubigne (Hist. vol. 3. p. 243.) 
upon this subject, cautiously but forcibly remarks: 
"Notwithstanding his opposition to Papacy, Luther had a strong 
conservative instinct. Zwingli, on the contrary, was predisposed 
to radical reforms. Both these divergent tendencies were needed. 
If Luther and his followers had been alone in the work, it would 
have stopped short in its progress; and the principle of 
reformation would not have wrought its destined effect. " 

Luther, though he had denounced the Papacy as Antichrist, and 
declared that the popes had no right or authority whatever to rule 
the world in the name of Christ, was led by his course of 
moderation into doing the very thing he had condemned in 
Papacy. The princes who remained in harmony with Papacy, 
were forward to claim its sanction as the true basis of authority 
over the people; and, those who espoused Luther's side, of 
course looked to him who claimed to represent the true reformed 
Church, to pronounce in their favor-as the choice of the true 
church, and hence the divine choice. Having taken the stand he 
did, escape from the dilemma was impossible; and there was 
considerable truth in Luther's joke, when, later on, he called 
himself 

"THE GERMAN POPE. " 

Thus it came that Protestantism continued the very error which 
lay at the foundation of the great apostasy-the very error it 
started out to remedy. Instead of advocating freedom- 
government of and by the people-it arrayed itself on the side of 



these false kingdoms of God whose rulers were glad to have 
assistance in holding the control which Antichrist had given 
them over the people. They desired to hold forever, for 
themselves and their families, the fat positions already attained. 
Hence, the various governments of Europe are wedded to some 
religious system, which they support, and at the hands of whose 
officers, with religious pomp and ceremony, titles and offices 
are entered upon. No matter how villainous, or imbecile, or 
insane, or opposed to both the letter and spirit of God's Word, 
these announce their authority to perpetuate wrongs under the 
hypocritical mask (authorized first by Papacy, and since 
conceded by all Protestant sects)— king, or queen, or emperor, 
"by the grace of God. " 

Thus we find to-day, many so-called Christian kingdoms in the 
world, as well as many churches, though our Lord only 
established one church, which in due time was to be completed 
and glorified to constitute the one kingdom of God promised. In 
the light of God's Word, we must deny that kings and emperors 
now reign by the grace of God, or that God is in any degree, 
responsible for their misruling, though he predetermined to 
permit these various experiments at self-government for an 
appointed time- "until He come, whose right it is." (Ezek. 
21:27.) The facts of history corroborate the testimony of the 
Scriptures, that present governments are under the control of 
"the prince of this world." (John 14:30; Eph 2:2.) To deceive 
the people he assumes a garment of light, and authority is given 
not in his own name, but in the name of God, at the hands of the 
apostate church. —2 Cor. 11:14,15. 

How much of the spirit of Christ do they manifest? Hear louder 
and louder down the centuries the clash of arms, the thunder of 
artillery, the tread of mighty armies, and the groans of the dying, 
in the strife of these so-called kingdoms of God to annihilate 
each other; and remember, that at no period of the world's 
history were there ever, as to-day, armies numbering eleven 
millions of men, thoroughly equipped and trained, ready at a 
moment's call to rush to battle, armed with weapons of carnage a 
hundred fold more dreadful and destructive than were ever 
before known, which make them equal to a hundred millions in 
former times. 

Remember too, that these eleven millions must soon be called 
into action, if for no other reason than that the great expense of 
their maintenance is rapidly bankrupting these various kingdoms 
of Christ (?). Remember too, that when the tocsin of war shall 
sound, the various pulpits will support the various thrones with 
words of burning eloquence and prayers to God for help, each to 
consume the other. And with the army corps shall go chaplains, 
to cheer the dying soldiers of God's (?) kingdom; to assure each 
host that its cause is just, and that if they fall it is in support of 
the Lord's anointed representatives. 



Mark the oppression, and injustice, and tyranny, and misrule; 
and behold how giant evils are licensed to enslave and oppress 
mankind; and say not that these are Immanuel's kingdoms. 
Surely, 

R1095 : page 5 

they bear little resemblance to the character of that kingdom 
promised under the "Prince of Peace. " Verily, if these kingdoms 
of Europe are Christ's kingdoms, free America wants none of 
them. Away with Christ's kingdom, if such be its character; and 
welcome to this free soil the poor oppressed refugees from 
European "Christendom. " 

When Christ's kingdom has come, it will indeed be "the desire 
of all nations." It will be just what all men need. At first it will 
rule with a rod of iron dashing the now tottering kingdoms of 
this world in pieces like a potter's vessel (Psa. 2:9), breaking up 
every civil, social and religious system of tyranny and 
oppression, putting down all authority and power opposed to it, 
humbling the proud and high-minded, and finally teaching all 
the world to be still and know that the Lord's Anointed has taken 
the dominion. (Psa. 46:10.) Then the blessings of its peaceful 
reign will begin to be experienced. Truth and equity will be 
established on a sure and permanent footing; "justice will be laid 
to the line, and righteousness to the plummet" (Isa. 28:17), and 
the great restitution work will progress grandly to its glorious 
consummation.— There will be sweeping moral reforms, great 
educational and philanthropic enterprises, wonderful faith-cures 
from every disease and deformity, mental and physical. There 
will be awakenings also from death, and a grand re-organization 
of society under the new order of the Kingdom of God. And all 
the world's bitter experience during the six thousand years past 
will prove a valuable lesson, on the exceeding sinfulness of sin; 
helping them to appreciate the new rule of righteousness, and to 
live in everlasting conformity to the perfect will of God, and 
thus to accept God's gift of everlasting life, designed for all who 
will receive it on his conditions of love and loyalty and 
obedience to him. Then, "Whosoever will, let him take the water 
of life freely. "-Rev. 22:17. 

Such being the grand object of our Lord's return and the 
establishment of his kingdom, we believe with the prophet, that 
it will be "The desire of all nations;" and with the apostle that 
the earnest expectation of the creature longs, though ignorantly, 
for this coming revelation of the Sons of God-the overcoming 
Church exalted with their Lord. 



R1095 : page 5 



COMING FROM EAST AND WEST. 

"Many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down 
with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven. But 
the children of the kingdom shall be cast into outer darkness: 
there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."- Matt. 8:11,12. 

Israelites were "the children of the kingdom, " the natural seed 
of Abraham, to whom God had promised that Millennial 
kingdom whose power in all the earth shall, under divine 
arrangements, be instrumental in spreading truth and 
righteousness, and restraining evil, so that all the families of the 
earth shall be blessed. In the words above quoted, our Lord 
foretold the change of dispensation by which the natural seed of 
Abraham were cast into outer darkness— as outcasts from God's 
favor, and from the special light of prophecy which for eighteen 
hundred years had enlightened them and given them "much 
advantage every way" above the world in general. 

Those from the east and west who come and sit down with 
Abraham and the faithful of the past age, are faithful ones from 
among the Gentiles, called to be the bride and joint-heir of the 
true and only heir of all things-Christ Jesus. The Jews in 
general, and even the disciples, could not have digested meat so 
strong, as this, and hence our Master left this among other of his 
"dark sayings," unexplained; merely saying to his disciples, I 
have many things to tell you, but you cannot bear them now;— 
the spirit of truth shall guide you into all truth and bring to your 
remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you. The Jews 
resented sternly any suggestion, that any except their own elect 
nation could share the kingdom honors. Even when, after his 
resurrection, our Lord commissioned his disciples to go teach 
and baptize all nations (Matt. 28:19), they seemed to understand 
that he meant, -every Israelite scattered throughout all nations; 
and it was not for some years after that they learned, that the 
Gentiles were to be fellow-heirs of the same promises. — Eph. 
3:6. 

As during the Gospel age honest Gentiles heard the "call," and 
came out of darkness into marvelous light and great privilege, 
by accepting and following Christ, so the Jews, because of pride, 
rejected Christ; and during this age they have been left with the 
heathen world, in darkness, shut out from divine favor. There 
they have had trouble, distress, perplexity and persecution, well 
described by the metaphor "weeping and gnashing of teeth. " 

The elect Gentiles (chosen through sanctification of spirit, by a 
belief of the truth), are coming to the Kingdom; coming it is 
true, by a narrow thorny path of trial; but they are not downcast, 
"not in darkness;" because the light of the glory of God as it 
shines in the face of Jesus Christ hath shined into their hearts 
dispelling the darkness. Not with weeping and gnashing of teeth 
do they come; for though they suffer, it is as good soldiers — 



rejoicing in tribulations, and that they are counted worthy to 
suffer reproaches for the name of Christ. 

And now the coming ones have nearly all passed over the 
"narrow way:" a few more are to come by the same route, and 
then all shall sit down in the Kingdom, with Abraham and all the 
faithful of the natural seed of the natural Abraham,-as sharers in 
the joys of the Lord, and in the promised work of blessing all 
nations. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and the faithful prophets, 
will share in that blessed employment as well as Christ Jesus 
and his bride,— "his body." But there are last which shall be first, 
and first which shall be last. Those first called will receive all 
that was promised them, and more doubtless than they ever 
appreciated or expected, when they obtain the earthly phase, or 
human department, of the Millennial Kingdom. But the Lord, 
the heir of all things, and his chosen faithful bride and co-heir, 
will inherit what Abraham and the prophets never knew of; that 
which was not even made known until the Gospel age (2 Tim. 
1:10), namely, the spiritual phase or department of the 
Kingdom; "God having provided some better thing for us [the 
"last" called-the Gospel church], that they [the "first" called, 
and all others] without us should not be made perfect. "-Heb. 
11:40.

THE CHRIST LIFE. 



The expression has been made to me by a returned missionary, 
that in China and Japan they are getting to find the difference 
between Christians and the friends of Jesus. For a time they 
were deceived by the name Christian. Every sailor and foreign 
resident in these parts called himself a Christian, as 
distinguished from heathens. And so as the natives found many 
of these men so outrivaling heathen corruption, they became 
disgusted. They said if these drinking, blasphemous sailors and 
grasping merchants are Christians, we do not want Christianity. 
He told me that they were calling true Christians "Jesus' people, " 
and all the others were merely Christians. They meant that these 
were Christ's friends, and had his resemblance in person and 
character. This is the distinction I would bring before you- 
nominal Christianity and the Christ- life. There is all the 
difference between them that there is between a system of truth 
and a living person; all the difference there is between ideas and 
living, loving hearts. Christian is a name used by many, 
committed to certain principles. But the Christ-life is a living 
thing, and a divine thing. 

The first thought that comes up in connection with Christ is the 
thought of personality. The things we value in history are not the 
records of events, the geographical and historical information; 



but what they reveal of the men and women that have lived. 
That which makes a country great is not its lofty mountains and 
beautiful plains, its magnificent scenery and Eden-like climate; 
for many of the fairest scenes of earth may claim all this, and yet 
they are waste and desolate for want of men. That which makes 
a country great is glorious men and women, far more than things 
or events, resources or incomparable advantages. That is what 
we cherish in our annals, -not our art, poetry, traditions and 
memories, but our heroes. And, if we come down to the nearer 
realm of our own life, what do we value most? Not our houses 
and lands, our commerce and wealth, nor our earthly 
advantages. You would give everything on earth for one frail 
little life that others would not give a farthing for. There is more 
to you in one human heart, than in all the world. Your treasures 
are in your friends, those that have become in some sense your 
own. 

R1095 : page 6 

Personality, then, is the dearest and most precious thing in the 
world. And if this be so in secular and historical things, how 
easy it is to rise to the thought of personality in God. I am so 
glad He is revealed to us as a person and 

R1096 : page 6 

not a doctrine— a living being that we can touch somehow with 
the susceptibility of our spirit, that we can take in the arms of 
trust and love, that we can know in the depths of our 
consciousness, a good, and glorious, and divine reality, even 
more than any other individual. The other day in Minneapolis, a 
dear friend just recovering from that terrible snare of Christian 
Science, who had been under its power until her heart and spirit 
had been almost drawn away from Christ, "How strange, " she 
said, "that I never thought; they taught me that Christ was a 
principle. I have been trying to love a principle. I might as well 
try to love a grapevine on my wall as to love a principle. " And 
with gladness and joy she added, "O, it is a person, he is my 
blessed Saviour." Read the story of his life, and back of the 
events shines out most vividly the man Himself; alone the 
character so beautiful; alone that crystallization of all that was 
wise, and gentle and lovely, the living One, whom our 
consciousness can grasp and gather out of the story. Even 
infidelity has been compelled to say that the most remarkable 
thing in the Bible is the Christ,-the hardest to explain away. -

POLITICS OF THE SAINTS. 

A Brother who has been growing in the truth for about a year 
encloses to us a copy of a letter sent by him to a friend, on the 
subject of politics. As it may interest others we publish it below: 

DEAR FRIEND:-Being desirous that you understand my 
position regarding politics, and my reasons for it, I have decided 
to write you at some length in the premises. 

I believe that Jesus is the Son of the Living God, that after his 
death He was raised up a Divine being, and that now "All power 
in heaven and on earth" has been given him. I further believe 
that all "who name the name of Christ" are invited to the high 
calling of following his footsteps on earth, and then being raised 
to the same nature he now has, and joining him in the 
establishment of a coming kingdom, "wherein dwelleth 
righteousness." I also believe that the coming of this Kingdom 
on earth is delayed for the purpose of selecting the "bride, the 
Lamb's wife," which will be the "Body" and he the "Head," in 
the holy temple which is being prepared for the habitation of 
God. (Eph. 2:21-22.) I do not believe that this kingdom has yet 
been established on earth. Its foundations are to be in "justice 
and righteousness," and "They shall not hurt nor destroy in all 
my holy mountain [government]; for the earth shall be full of the 
knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. "— Isa. 1 1 :9. 

These conditions do not obtain now, and though this United 
States' government is undoubtedly the best on earth now, its 
machinery is generally used-in results-for the benefit of the 
comparatively few, and actual justice or equality is rarely, if 
ever realized. This is but a new demonstration of what every 
other human government has proven, and of what must continue 
to be until he, whose right it is, shall come and take the 
government to himself. -Ezek. 21:27; Rev. 11:17. 

Our Father has given repeated promises that this Kingdom shall 
be established on earth, and the Lord has joined in the assurance. 
God alone is capable of setting it up, and bringing humanity 
from its present blind, depraved condition, up to the standard 
where they can maintain it. It is specifically stated that this 
Kingdom will come "down from God out of heaven. " We, who 
are following Christ, are now considered members of this 
Kingdom, and when it is set up, will be God's agents in its work. 
A brief study of the subject has enabled me to present the 
following Scripture texts:- 

"For he [Abraham] looked for a city which hath foundations, 
whose maker and builder is God.... For they that say such things 
declare plainly that they seek a country, and truly if they had 
been mindful of the country from which they came out, they 
might have had opportunity to have returned; but now (as it is) 
they desire a better, that is, a heavenly [one from heaven]: 
Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he 



hath prepared for them a city.. ..And these all having obtained a 
good report through faith received not the promise, God having 
prepared some better thing for us, that they without us should 
not be made perfect.... Let us go forth, therefore, unto him 
without the camp, bearing his reproach. For here we have no 
continuing city, but we seek one to come. ...For our conversation 
[country or polity] is in heaven from whence we look for the 
Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change [transform] our 
vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, 
according to the working whereby he is able to even subdue all 
things unto himself.... Now, therefore, ye are no more strangers 
and foreigners, but fellow-citizens of the saints and of the 
household of God. "-Heb. 11:10- 14-15-16-.-39-40; 13:13-14; 
Phil. 3:20-21 and Eph 2:19. 

Thus finding "exceeding great and precious promises" for those 
who are "new creatures in Christ Jesus who walk not after the 
flesh, but after the spirit," it behooves us to "prove all things" in 
every matter, and "hold fast that which is good. " Our Lord prays 
that while we are in the world, we may not be "of the world." 
We are admonished by Paul to "be not conformed to [fashioned 
after] this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your 
mind, that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and 
perfect will of God" (Rom. 12:27), and by John to "love not the 
world, neither the things that are in [of] the world. If any man 
love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is 
in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and 
the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the 
world is passing away, and the lust thereof, but he that doeth the 
will of God abideth forever." (1 John 2:15,16,17.) Jesus himself 
says, "No man can serve two masters: For either he will hate the 
one and love the other; or else he will hold to the one and 
despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon. " -Matt. 
11:24. 

Those who are not running in the Christian race are at full 
liberty, and doubtless in duty bound, to labor and study on the 
present political problems from human standpoints; but we who 
have consecrated our lives to God, and are striving to fulfill our 
vows, must be about our Father's work, and devote all the time 
we can honestly spare from the vocations necessary to enable us 
to "provide things honest in the sight of all men, " to the work 
and study that will enable us to be "vessels unto honor, 
sanctified and meet for the Master's use, and prepared unto 
every good work."— 2 Tim. 2:21. 

The blind and deaf leaders in the world are thus left to do their 
best, and if all "fall into the ditch," it will be but to fully 
demonstrate their inability to accomplish what God says he 
alone can do, and prepare them in due time to accept from God 
his free and gracious gift. In the "Regeneration [a literal 
translation of "Regeneration" is "New Birth Day." How 



significant!], when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his 
glory" (Matt. 19:28), and the instruments the "Potter" is now 
preparing, (who are a "peculiar people zealous of good works,") 
shall be elevated to the Divine Nature (2 Pet. 1:4), the time will 
be ripe for the founding of this wondrous and longed for 
Kingdom. Until then, we must "make straight paths for our feet, 
lest that which is lame be turned out of the way."— Heb. 12:14. 

By going into politics never so little, we enter one of the very 
"crookedest paths" the enemy has presented to this generation, 
and are liable to become "lame" or "turned to one side," before 
we are able to realize it. 

However much these views may impress you as either truthful 
or Scriptural, you can readily see that, as they are mine, I cannot 
honestly do other than voice them, and take neutral ground, 
standing to one side, and waiting for the manifestation of the 
glory of God. 

Very truly your friend, 

W. E. P.

AS BECOMETH WOMEN 
PROFESSING GODLINESS. 

NO. 3. 

CHRISTIAN WOMEN AS MOTHERS. 

Since a large proportion of those called to be saints are already 
charged with the care of families; and since God does in no 
sense release them from those cares and responsibilities, it 
behooves such to carefully study how they may best fulfill them 
according to the divine directions. 

In searching the Scriptures we do not find full and complete 
directions as to methods and plans for the training of children, 
but we do find principles laid down which we are expected to 
study and work out with care, and which we are assured will in 
due time develop the desired results. Solomon said, "Train up a 
child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not 
depart from it." (Prov. 22:6.) Parents are exhorted not to 
provoke their children to anger, but to rebuke and punish when 
necessary, and to train them up in the nurture and admonition of 
the Lord, etc. And then we have the example of our heavenly 
Father set forth for our study and imitation. 

R1097 : page 6 



A little reflection upon these simple rules, together with a close 
observation of God's methods of training and discipline, will 
supply all the needed instruction on the subject. 

In the first place, if we would govern others properly, we must, 
God- like, govern ourselves: We must be just, benevolent, kind, 
thankful, patient and loving, remembering always that our most 
effective lessons are given by personal example. If you teach 
only by word, you are constantly condemning yourself and 
pointing out your weaknesses, and the ready perception of 
childhood will quickly draw the inference that you should first 
practice what you preach; and all your preaching will be in vain, 
unless you do so. Here, then, is the first rule for Christian 
parents —So far as possible, be what you would have your 
children be; Never for a moment forget that you are a teacher, 
and that from morning till night you are being studied and 
copied. If you are peevish, fretful, and complaining, disliking to 
do this duty, and despising that, wishing the lines had fallen to 
you in pleasanter places, coveting your neighbor's wealth, or 
health, or ease, etc., etc., do not be surprised, if you find the 
same dispositions cropping out in your children. And if it does, 
its constant friction and interference with the home duties, will 
necessitate force and pulling and driving and punishing, and 
thus greatly increase your burdens and cares. 

If, on the other hand, you are cheerful and happy, regarding the 
duties of life as your greatest pleasure, yes, even what many are 
pleased to style the menial offices of home service; if you are 
thankful for such things as you have in the present life, and 
anxious and helpful in relieving the cares and lightening the 
burdens of your less favored neighbors, the little ones around 
your feet will quickly discern and catch your happy, thankful, 
energetic and helpful spirit; and thus half the victory in the 
matter of home training will be accomplished. 

Dear mothers, never let the little ones hear you say, "I dislike to 
wash dishes," or "I dislike to cook," or that you dislike to 
perform any other duty that devolves upon you now; and never 
allow such an expression from them to pass unreproved. Rather 
say, "My dear children, if you will think again, you will see that 
you are very unthankful when God has so generously filled your 
plates, to be too indolent to wash them, that he may fill them 
again. " Perhaps if we continue such ingratitude he may some 
time refuse to fill them, to bring us to our senses and show us, 
how mean we have been. Never give them the idea, by word or 
look of yours, that pleasure is to be sought for elsewhere than in 
the line of duty. Then you will be preparing them to find 
happiness all day long in the kindly offices of love and duty, 
instead of stolidly toiling all day at irksome tasks, and 
impatiently waiting for a little diversion or frolic at the end of 
the day or week as compensations. In the cheerful performance 
of duty is the highest form of happiness, with which an 



evening's diversion, a picnic, etc., are not worthy to be 
compared. And yet such innocent pleasures, when they come 
without special seeking— i.e., when they are not looked for, and 
longed for, and sought after, as the chief end of existence— are 
pleasant, healthful and happy episodes which may add greatly to 
the happiness especially of young life, particularly when they 
come not too frequently, and as pleasant surprises from loving 
parents or friends. The habit of some, of paying children for 
what they do, detracts from their sense of duty in the matter of 
home service and substitutes a selfish and independent spirit. 
Better far let any gift be understood as entirely independent of 
remunerative considerations. 

Our second rule should be, never by word or example to 
encourage idleness. Idleness is the mother of vice and a fruitful 
source of every evil; for Satan finds some mischief still for idle 
hands to do. Nature itself teaches plainly that idleness is not the 
normal condition of any healthy human being. You cannot 
punish a child more severely than to require perfect idleness. 
The human mind is never idle except when asleep, and 
sometimes not then. And it is almost an impossibility for the 
human body to be inactive, unless disabled by disease. 

To release a child, therefore, from all the restraints of duty, is 
not always to rest him. If no duties or responsibilities are placed 
upon him, he will spend the time and effort in doing as he 
pleases and in learning from other willful and untrained children 
what you may afterward find it impossible to eradicate or fully 
counteract. Children are better for having some responsibility 
and some care, though, if possible, they should not be 
overburdened. They will also develop more perfectly, if they 
have some time and opportunity to work out their own original 
ideas. Boys will be well and happily employed with carpenter's 
tools and other constructive implements; and girls with dolls and 
needles and pins, etc. But do not give them too many or too 
complete a set of toys, or you will leave no room for ingenuity. 
A rag doll of Katie's own make and on which Johnny has 
displayed his art in penciling features will often be more 
precious than one you might purchase. And economy and 
carefulness can be taught by very special care of the finer 
Christmas doll. And as they acquire skill, let it be applied to 
things useful, and let them see that you appreciate their skill by 
giving them this liberty to utilize it. Play should always be 
secondary to real service. Nellie must drop the doll quickly to 
heed the cry of the 

R1097 : page 7 

real baby; and Johnny must leave the interesting hammer and 
nails to run the necessary errands. If taught to do so from 
infancy these habits will grow, and they will be both useful and 
happy in so doing. 



Prompt, cheerful, loving obedience should be expected and 
enforced— not by repeated urging to duty, but by a simple 
showing of duty, and a penalty of some kind for its non- 
performance. Do not lower your dignity, work yourself into a 
nervous excitement, and disturb the peace of the rest of the 
family, by continually upbraiding and urging a refractory one. 
Rather give some one else the privilege (for so they should be 
taught to regard it) of doing that duty, and let that one feel that 
he missed both the privilege and the approval that comes with it. 

And this gives another suggestion, namely, to train children to 
be sensitive to the approval of parents, of God, and of their own 
consciences. If conscience is unheeded, if God is unknown or 
unloved, and if parents are only regarded as servants, nothing 
but brute force will compel submission to authority; and that 
submission will be an ignoble one, and at best only temporary. 
How can this be done? Well, it cannot be done in a day; and 
listless, heedless parents cannot do it at all. This is one of the 
fine points that will require skill and ingenuity. You will need to 
study the disposition of your child, to watch for the 
opportunities to instruct and impress him, and to let none of 
them slip. You will need to watch the little things in his 
deportment, to express your affectionate approval of his good 
points (when expedient, but not always, lest it cultivate vanity) 
and your pain and displeasure at his errors and failures. Let him 
feel that your eye and God's is ever upon him, just as we feel 
that God's eye is upon us. (2 Chron. 16:9; Psa. 34:15; 1 Pet. 
3:12; Prov. 15:3.) Do not let him sit by your side at the table and 
eat like a savage who does not know the use of a knife and fork; 
do not let him be mean enough to grab the best of everything for 
himself and pay no attention to the wants of others. Teach them 
to be generous, to prefer one-another, and to be watchful for 
one-another's interests; and the table, however plain be the meal, 
is one of the best opportunities for inculcating such lessons. Let 
good manners and good principles be the frequent subjects of 
conversation at such times. In fact no other opportunity so 
favorable and so frequent presents itself. Make good use of them 
all, and study to do so. Remember, too, that your children come 
into the world ignorant of everything, and even the commonest 
civilities must be taught them by both word and example. 
Therefore be patient, careful, watchful and wise both in teaching 
them good and in counteracting evil. 

Cultivate the acquaintance of your children; enjoy their society 
and let them enjoy yours. Be young with them, but give them 
the advantage of your years of experience; and to this end never 
let your dignity descend to the level of frivolity or foolishness. 
Hold your own standpoint, but sympathize with theirs, and do 
not forget your feelings and experiences at their age. Invite their 
confidence and never make light of their troubles, but comfort 
and advise them as your love and experience enables you to do. 



Never speak slightingly of one to another, nor allow them to do 
so without correction. 

Watch for the first outcroppings of wrong principles and talk to 
them seriously about them. Show them the mean principles in 
some very small actions and what their miserable fruits are 
when a little more matured. Talk freely, not always to them, but 
before them of the wants and sufferings and trials of others, and 
let them see you planning and active in efforts to relieve as 
much of it as possible. Send them or take them with you on 
errands of love and mercy; and let them see that you prefer to go 
to the house of sorrow and mourning to comfort those that weep, 
rather than to the house of mirth. 

Be cheerful, do not wear a long dejected face, even if you have 
trouble, or if you are sympathizing with others in trouble. Let 
the sunshine of Christian peace and joy illuminate your 
countenance at all times, and you can carry that 

R1098 : page 7 

sunshine not only into your own home, but into all the homes 
you enter. 

Be generous, no matter how poor you are, and teach and talk of 
generosity and show by word and action, how it needs to be 
balanced by frugality, and what extremes both run to, when not 
rightly balanced. 

Let your children have access to good books and encourage 
them to read for information, and to report what they read. 
Endeavor to give them broad ideas; do not let them think that 
the little home circle and their immediate friends and relatives 
are the largest and most important part of the world. Show them 
that the human race is one great family, children of one father 
and mother, and that as brothers and sisters they should love one 
another; that the dead as well as the living were part of this one 
family, and that history shows how they lived and what they 
accomplished, how good and great some were, and how wicked 
others were. This will serve to awaken interest in a very 
instructive line of reading and prepare the way for further 
instruction of prophecy which reveals the future destiny of the 
race. Instructive reading of various kinds will crowd out bad 
company and its attendant evils. 

To these suggestions we might append the following useful hints 
which some one terms— 

THE SCIENCE OF CHILD-TRAINING IN A NUTSHELL. 

1 . When you consent, consent cheerfully. 

2. When you refuse, refuse finally. 

3. Often commend. 

4. Never scold. 



5. Beware of making an issue with your child, but when an issue 
is forced carry it out. It is with children as with men, few of 
whom, says Goethe, are open to conviction, but the majority of 
whom are open to persuasion. 

In other words-Rule yourself before attempting to rule your 
child. 

All of these points good and wise worldly parents have observed 
and profited by; and even without the restraints and power of a 
religious training, they have raised sons and daughters to honor 
and to comfort them in their declining years. And yet, in 
addition to all the nice points and the fine points of wise and 
careful training, there is a mightier power than all else in a 
decided religious training. If the little ones are taught from 
infancy to know and love God as the wise and loving provider 
of every blessing they enjoy, as the rewarder of righteousness 
and the punisher of evil doers (not always now, but in his own 
due time); if they are early taught to bring their little troubles to 
him for sympathy and help, and their little joys and blessings to 
him in thankfulness and praise; and if they are taught the plan 
and purposes of God as they are able to comprehend it, the 
instruction thus received in the plastic period of childhood will 
never be effaced. "Train up a child in the way he should go and 
when he is old he will not depart from it. " He may stray from it 
in youth, but by and by under the chastening hand of God, (for 
God will not forsake them, but will watch over them for your 
sake), a mother's prayers and counsel and love will be freshly 
recalled and heeded, -perhaps long after she has been laid to 
rest. 

Since such carefulness and watchfulness and constant attention 
to the physical, mental and moral wants of children demand 
almost all of a mother's time and strength, and sometimes more 
than she has to give, but little can be expected of her beyond the 
family circle in the earlier years of motherhood. Her faithfulness 
here, therefore, will show the measure of her desire and 
willingness to be faithful in the greater work; and verily, she 
shall not lose her reward, either in the Master's approval, or in 
the love and respect and reverence of her family. Even if for a 
time wayward and thoughtless as some children seem to be 
naturally, they also will by and by rise up and call her blessed. 

The work of Christian parents for their children now should be 
regarded as part of the great restitution work of the now 
dawning restitution age. And if the children of the saints are 
carefully trained and instructed in the plan of God, and the great 
work he is about to accomplish in the great time of trouble and 
after it, doubtless God will be pleased to make special use of 
them as the world's instructors, to point men to the real and only 
remedy for all their woes. 



Work, dear Christian mothers, with this end in view, and God 
will in due time show that your labor has not been in vain, in the 
Lord. Humble and obscure though you may seem, you have a 
blessed mission to fulfill. God bless you all and give you 
wisdom, and patience, and constancy, and prudence, and faith, 
and hope, and love, and grace in every way sufficient to act 
nobly your part, while you walk humbly with God casting your 
care upon him knowing that he careth for you and yours 
specially, for your sake.

THE POWER OF THE TRUTH. 

The Lord seems to lay hold by his truth upon a variety of 
characters, in his call to joint-heirship. The following letters all 
showing excellent spirit, represent some of these. They serve to 
show that the power of the truth extends to all classes and that 
the Lord accepts of and is willing to bless and use all who accept 
of his righteousness and desire to render him service. 

The first is from an ex-convict, recently released from the House 
of Correction in Detroit, where he served a long term for 
highway-robbery. We know not how the truth reached him 
there, but it made him free from his old master Sin. Since his 
release he has started into what he says shall be his life-work, 
preaching the truth by selling DAWN, and he meets with good 
success. The TOWER goes to three other convicts, one in Joliet, 
Ills., one in Detroit and one in Allegheny. 

The other letters explain themselves. 



House of Correction, Detroit, Mich. 

DEAR BROTHER:-... When I got into trouble, I did not wish to 
have my people exposed to the disgrace that a knowledge of my 
situation would be sure to bring upon them; and I adopted an 
assumed name and have not written to them nor heard from 
them since. 

This pride that prevented me from writing to my people, and 
receiving of their assistance, would also hinder me from going 
home, if I did not have suitable clothing, and sufficient money to 
satisfy it. But I was thinking, if my parents are still living, they 
still have affection for me, and how much greater their joy 
would be to have me come home clothed in the rich robes of 
Christ's righteousness, than to come clothed in the scarlet and 
purple of sin, or soft raiment of my own provision, which would 
be but as filthy rags in comparison. Besides, if I am seeking not 
my own glory, but the glory of my Master, and if His 



righteousness may be clearer seen through my humiliation, it 
will but leave me greater cause for rejoicing. I have long 
endeavored to render cheerful obedience to all men have 
required of me. But now I should much more endeavor to yield 
grateful submission to my Father's will whose loving care 
guides and protects me, and nothing is allowed to befall me 
without His permission. He also assures me, that all things are 
working together for good for me. So, if it is his good pleasure, I 
may still hope to get home at the holidays. And I can be 
contented with Christ's righteousness as a covering, instead of 
fine clothing, and the gold and silver of spirit and truth, instead 
of money, and bearing a precious message whose value is 
beyond rubies. And although I may not be skillful in telling this 
glad message, I hope that its affect in me may be clearly 
manifested, as some one has written:— 

Gladly in the dust I would lay me, 
That the world my Savior might see. 
Hoping to see you soon. Yours in the faith, 



New Haven, Conn. 

MY DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL, BELOVED IN THE 
LORD:-While in Boston I was told of a sister at Winchester, 
about seven miles from Boston and I went to see her. Some 
eleven years ago she was a lawless Roman Catholic rumseller 
there. Her conversion (a most remarkable one) occurred in the 
prison, where she was confined for repeated violation of the 
liquor laws. When she was released, she poured to waste all of 
her liquors and renounced the Roman Catholic Religion. As she 
lived in the midst of an Irish Catholic community, her 
persecutions were terrible. Her children were hooted, pelted 
with stones, and abused in every conceivable manner. She was 
cursed and slandered before her face and behind her back. 

They even soaped the stairs of her dwelling to cause her to fall 
and maim or kill herself. The priest visited her, and when he 
found that she was firm in her determination to serve Christ 
rather than the devil, he cursed her and persuaded her husband 
to abandon her and declared that she should never have a 
Catholic dollar, and said they would drive her from her home. 
They broke the window panes in her house, and for two years 
she was obliged to keep them stuffed with rags, etc., being too 
poor to afford to replace the glass. She united with the Baptist 
church and was most zealous in her missionary efforts to bring 
others into that "communion. " She soon ceased to have her 
hunger satisfied with the husks of the less popish branch of 
Babylon and longed for 

R1099 : page 7 



more truth, for she saw and deplored the same spirit in 
Protestantism as in Romanism. About nine years ago, hungering 
and thirsting for the Word of Life, she heard that there were a 
series of meetings held at Lynn. You were the preacher and she 
was so well fed that she eagerly inquired, where she could 
continue to hear you. A friend told her that she could hear you 
through Z.W.T. every month. Ever since that God has fed her 
through your paper. When she was rejected by every body, that 
spoke peace to her heart. All was written in such a sweet spirit. 
The very pages seemed illumined by the spirit of God. She 
cannot write at all and can not read writing. 

She has grieved because of her inability to tell you the great 
comfort and joy you have been to her, under God. She expressed 
her belief in the fact that there must be so very much of which 
you have never known that would so greatly encourage you, did 
you but know. When her boy lay dead in her house, a crowd 
collected opposite and cried that they wished it was the old devil 
that was dead, 

R1099 : page 8 

instead of the young one, or she along with it. Well, the next day 
after that she got the TOWER. For all the sorrow she had had, it 
brought great joy, and she felt lifted up. She could not describe 
the gladness God sent her through it. The Lord anointed her 
eyes, and she came out of the Baptist church, and her 
persecutions at the hands of the Protestant religionists were 
harder to bear than those of the Roman Catholics-a refined 
cruelty. She attempted to reason with them out of the Scriptures, 
but was called an ignorant Irish woman and was rebuked for her 
insolence in presuming to teach them who had been studying the 
Scriptures all their lifetime. But she knew she had the truth, and 
counted it all joy- even her severest trials-for they brought her 
nearer to God, and taught her dependence upon Him. She was 
overjoyed at the thought that at last you should know of her and 
of the joy you had been the means of imparting to her. 

Yes, dear Brother, you'll find out concerning many a weary 
heart comforted and cheered and helped in the struggle against 
the world, the flesh and the devil, when you reach the end of 
your faith. Rejoice! Your affectionate brother in Christ, 

S. I. HICKEY.

DEAR SIR:— As I am one of the many readers of your valuable 
paper and have been for about seven months, I write to tell you 
how I came in possession of it, and that grand book M. DAWN. 

Before I had seen DAWN, the Plan of Salvation was as greatly 
mystified, as could be imagined, according to the different 



doctrines I had been raised under. My wife and a sister are 
members of the Christian Church; my mother was a Methodist; 
my father thinks that all beliefs are wrong, except the hard-shell 
Baptist faith; and I have another sister that believes the only way 
to reach the place where Christ is, is through the Presbyterian 
Church; and a brother thinks no one will ever see Christ unless 
he takes, as he thinks, the only straight and narrow road through 
the Methodist Church. 

This brother has for hours tried to show me, why I should join 
the church, be a better man, and be saved from everlasting 
torment. I could only contend, that I could not see how they 
could all be right, and if the different teachers or denominations 
were all right, why was it that God wanted men to travel so 
many different roads, when they were all trying to reach the 
same place. It was something that worried me not a little. But I 
could not believe in the doctrines they all preached, therefore 
have been traveling with the majority of the world until now. 
But thank God, since the truth has been made so plain, I feel that 
I am a better man. And I must say, my friend, that I believe the 
discord in the church is the cause of millions not wanting to 
accept Christ to-day. 

About a year ago in Fort Worth, Tex., I received the DAWN as 
a loan with a request to read the book and return, or remit; so of 
course I remitted the 25 cents and kept the book. I read and re- 
read it, again and again, and am still reading it; in fact have read 
it, until it is about worn out. 

Now dear friend, I have never been a Christian, though always a 
believer, and I never could fully explain my way of thinking, or 
belief, until now; so I wish to change my ways and strive to do 
all the good I can, that all that will, may see the light that is 
dawning. Therefore you will find enclosed $5.00 for which 
please send me-one Emphatic Diaglott $1.50, two Dawns Vol. 
I. cloth-bound, ten Dawns Vol. I. paper covered; also the whole 
list of back Nos. of Tower advertised in August, 100 Missionary 
Envelopes and 300 or 400 Arp Slips, which I will distribute 
among my friends and others in this country; for there are 
thousands here longing for something different from what these 
people preach. 

Trusting this may reach you safely, I am yours, 

R. L. B.

Pierce City. 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-What I want to tell you is this, I 
am free! The truth has made me free! To-day I was excluded 
from the Baptist church of which I have been a member for 
almost twenty years, on the charge of heresy. 



But they did not exclude me until I asked the privilege of 
withdrawing. It came up in this way. This was regular church 
meeting day (business meeting). I was present as usual, but this 
time with my mind made up to explain to them my change of 
views on several so-called orthodox points. I waited until the 
regular business was transacted, before I arose to speak, and in 
the meantime they balloted for delegates to the association. No 
special nominations, each member voting for whom he chose; 
and when the ballot was announced, I was one of the chosen. At 
this point I remarked that they would probably want to rescind 
their action after hearing what I had to say. I then explained to 
them as best I could parts of my belief, and ended by telling 
them, I could not be consistent in believing and teaching as I do, 
and still retain my membership in the Baptist Church; in other 
words, I could not be two things at once without hypocrisy. 
Therefore, I asked the privilege of withdrawing my name from 
the church roll. I told them that my action was prompted by a 
sense of duty, and not that I held aught against any of them; for, 
said I, you have all been kind to me, and my relations as a 
member of your body, have ever been most pleasant. I believe 
that many of you are Christians, but blinded; and in one sense of 
the word, it is no easy matter for me to sever my connection 
with you, for I leave among you my dear old gray headed 
mother and father, sisters, wife, and many of my dearest friends. 
But brethren! Jesus said, "He who is not willing to leave all 
these for my sake is not worthy of me. " Then I sat down. Quite a 
number were in tears, including our pastor; and after the 
question was discussed, and regrets expressed on my strange 
action, it was decided to exclude me for heresy. But before the 
question was put, a good old brother arose and suggested that I 
be given a letter, not of dismissal, but a letter showing that I was 
not excluded on account of any misconduct, but simply on 
account of refusing to believe and teach Baptist doctrine. But the 
suggestion was not acted on, and the vote for exclusion was 
unanimous. In regard to the letter suggested by the brother, I 
will here state, I did not expect and do not want anything of the 
kind. I then handed to the Assistant Superintendent of S.S. my 
written resignation as Supt. of Pierce City Baptist Sabbath 
School, and in a few days I expect to hand in my resignation as 
Treasurer of the Baptist College at this place. And so I am all 
alone in the "flesh," but not in the "spirit." I believe Jesus of 
Nazareth is with me. And I believe he will continue to walk with 
me, if I hold fast to the faith first delivered to the saints. Pray for 
me. 

I have about 30 DAWNS loaned out. One Baptist sister, to 
whom I loaned one, said to me since my exclusion, I believe the 
doctrine taught in that book you loaned me, and in a short time I 
expect to do as you have done, withdraw from the Baptist 
Church. Her name is on the enclosed list of subscribers to the 
TOWER. 



May God bless you and us all in the work, is my prayer.

LET YOUR LIGHT SHINE. 



A recent letter from Sister Tackabury to Sister Russell, shows 
that Brother Tackabury's death-bed preaching was not without 
its influence for the Lord and the truth. It was his earnest desire 
and constant endeavor to show forth the praises of him who hath 
called us out of darkness, into his marvelous light. 

DEAR SISTER RUSSELL:-I must write to you again, for it 
relieves my mind to talk to you, and it comforts me to read your 
letters. 

O, how thankful I am to our Heavenly Father for such friends in 
this time of great affliction— brothers and sisters in the Lord. 
Natural ties are strong and all are very kind, and thoughtful of 
my sorrow, but that strong bond growing out of the ONE HOPE, 
is dearer to me than all earthly ties; especially now. How sweet 
to me the words of cheer and comfort that come from the saints. 
I am trying to spend much of my time in reading and study for 
which, of course, I have had little time for months. Indeed, for 
the last year Mr. Tackabury's condition was such that neither of 
us could read much, and now I feel that a part of my work is to 
gain more strength from a more thorough study of the Word, 
and be the better prepared to give a reason for the hope that is in 
us. 

Well, dear Sister, each week adds to my loneliness. As they go 
by I realize more and more that my earthly home is desolate; 
that there is no more happiness in it for me. How I thank God 
that the time is short. And yet I have my work to finish, and I 
shall no more than have time e'er my change shall come. 

I have much to write to you this time, of God's workings in this 
place. It really seems wonderful to me, and yet nothing is too 
great for Him to accomplish. 

The beginning was Mr. T.'s sickness; and as people knew that 
we were professedly Christians, although of a peculiar sort, of 
course, it was Christian people who called to minister to our 
needs, and therefore, it was to them that Mr. T. had access, when 
he was able to talk, and he improved every opportunity. It also 
seemed usually Baptist people who came in, and we often 
remarked to one another that they seemed more willing to listen, 
and manifested more Christian spirit than any others who called. 
We had distributed reading matter considerably, but after Bro. 
Russell was here, I immediately handed out all I could, where I 
thought it might be read to advantage, and I found a good deal 



of interest among the readers upon meeting and conversing with 
them. They almost without exception said, they had studied the 
Bible of late more than ever before. When Bro. Russell was here 
the Baptist church in which the funeral was held was without a 
preacher, and had been for quite a long time. Now they have a 
minister, and he believes and teaches God's Word almost 
identically with us. The first time he came he stopped with a 
near neighbor of ours who had been with us a great deal during 
the summer and had read Millennial Dawn. They showed it to 
him, and he said, "That is MY belief and I PREACH it." And he 
surely does. He is a young man and very intelligent, superior in 
that respect to any one they have had here before. I heard him 
preach last Sunday morning and he talked the Millennium to 
them strong, and said during his discourse, that he believed he 
was telling them God's truth, and if they cast him out as a 
heretic, he must be cast out. Of course he has adopted these 
views but recently, and I do not see how he can preach them to a 
Baptist church, unless the church becomes revolutionized, and 
then surely it would not be Baptist. He also gives a Bible 
reading every Thursday evening and I have attended them all so 
far. It seems wonderful to me, how these things have been 
brought about, and how much sound doctrine this people will 
endure. How the matter will terminate, time will tell. I am trying 
to do what I can-I strive not to allow an opportunity to go by, 
where I think I can do something to honor the Master-it is my 
meat and my drink to do His will. O, how I long for the time 
when the Lord Jesus will be glorified in his saints. 

Pray for me that my affliction and trials may "work out for me a 
far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. " Remember me 
kindly to any who may inquire after me. May I not hear from 
you soon? Very affectionately, Your sister in Christ, MRS. S. T. 
TACKABURY.

YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FOR THIS YEAR. 

Look up your memorandum; see whether your subscription is 
expired. Did you renew it for the present year? 

It is past our usual time for revising our list and striking off the 
names of all who have not renewed their subscription for the 
present year. We must do so now. None need expect the next 
issue, except those who have renewed in one of the three 
following ways;- 

lst, By paying the amount due in advance; or 

2nd, By sending a card or letter, saying -"Please renew my 
subscription for the TOWER for the present year. I cannot 
conveniently send the money at present, but will do so as soon 
as possible-I hope during the year;" or 

3d, By sending a card or letter to the TOWER TRACT 
SOCIETY, saying, "I am so circumstanced that I cannot pay for 
the WATCH TOWER for the present year- (aged, invalid or 
whatever)— Yet I am deeply interested in its teachings, and 
desire that my subscription shall be paid for out of the Tract 
fund, as one of the Lord's poor. " 

This arrangement complies with both the letter and spirit of the 
Postal Law, yet provides amply for all the truth-hungry; for none 
are so poor as to be unable to purchase a postal card. And all 
such orders, without money, are as promptly and carefully 
attended to, as those which contain money. If you need to avail 
yourself of this arrangement for the Lord's poor, do not let a 
false pride hinder you. Consider that it is of the Lord and not of 
us, though through us, that the favor comes. It is because we 
partake of his spirit that we take pleasure in distributing the truth 
to you, regardless of your ability to share in the cost of the 
service. Be free then, to accept of our offer. We well know that 
all of the saints would rather, far, contribute to the Tract Fund 
than receive from it— hence we urge you thus to partake of the 
bounties of our Master's table, if you have a relish for the food 
there supplied.

OUR SPECIAL ISSUE FOR APRIL AND MAY 

360 PAGES MAGAZINE FORM TO PAID UP 
SUBSCRIBERS ONLY. 

So many appeals have come to hand, from those who feel that 
they cannot afford to purchase MILLENNIAL DAWN Vol. H. 
in cloth binding, desiring that "The Time is at Hand" be issued 
in magazine form, to bring it within the reach of all, that we 
have concluded to issue it as we did Vol. I., "The Plan of the 
Ages;" viz., as a special issue of the WATCH TOWER. 

It is proposed, therefore, that it shall represent the April and 
May issues, No. 6 and 7, of TOWER Vol. X. We expect to mail 
it about April 15th next, to all whose subscriptions on our books 
shall stand renewed for 1889, as above explained, on the first 
day of April next. 

All whose subscriptions for the TOWER come in after May 1st 
'89 will be expected to pay 25 cents for this special issue, or 75 
cents for this year from Jan'y forward. 

This special issue will of course be a great expense to us, but 
reflecting that 

R1100:pagel 

about two thousand, now on our poor list, would not, possibly, 
otherwise get the important truths which Vol. II. presents, 
decided us that such a course would be to the Lord's glory. 
Many of these have waited long for this "meat," hoping that the 
Lord would provide it for them in some manner. And we would 
have presented this subject-matter long ago, in TOWERS of the 
usual shape and size, but the subject is such, and so connected, 
that much of its strength and force would be lost, if spread over 
a year's issues of the TOWER. Besides, the subjects are such as 
will need to be referred to continually, and this would be less 
convenient in our usual shape. In fact, all who can afford it, 
should also have both "The Plan of the Ages" and "The Time at 
Hand" in cloth binding, for preservation and frequent reference. 
And such will surely want some extra copies for their friends, if 
they appreciate the subjects treated. 



Do not hasten through, in reading The Time at Hand. The 
subjects will require at least two readings to get their force and 
beauty. And you will probably find, as so many have written of 
DAWN VOL. I., that the second or third reading was even more 
enjoyable and profitable than the first. So then, the two months 
which that special issue will supply, April and May, can be 
abundantly and profitably occupied by the study of its topics-a 
subject of deep interest to all who have caught a glimpse of the 
Plan of the Ages, and seen that in its sublime culmination, in the 
Millennium, center all our good hopes. None such can be 



indifferent to whatever testimony our Heavenly Father may have 
supplied us with, in the Scripture, touching the time for the 
beginning of the Restitution work of blessing. 



R1100:pagel 

ANNIVERSARY OF OUR LORD'S DEATH. 

For the sake of new readers we mention that it is our custom to 
commemorate our Lord's death once a year, upon the recurrence 
of its anniversary. 

To all who truly realize that the "wages of sin is death" -and that 
the ransom given for all, by our dear Redeemer, was his life,— 
his death, his cross, must always be the central point of interest 
from which all our hopes of future life and blessing emanate. All 
such will esteem it a privilege to commemorate the dying love, 
the redeeming love, the enduring love, the powerful love 
manifested at Calvary. Greater love hath no man than this, that a 
man lay down his life for his friends. But the love of God is 
specially commendable, as beyond all other loves in that it was 
while we were yet sinners and enemies, that Christ died for us, 
the just for the unjust, that he might lead us to God; that he 
might have the right and opportunity of effecting human 
restitution to the state of perfection and harmony with God, 
forfeited by Adam's transgression. 

As foreseeing this desire in his loyal followers, and as indicating 
his approval of it, and the propriety of it, our Lord instituted that 
very simple, yet very impressive remembrancer known as "The 
Last Supper." It was instituted the day before the beginning of 
the Passover Festival, —in the same night in which he was 
betrayed, and in the same day in which he was crucified;— the 
14th day of the month Nisan. 

The Hebrews reckoned their day differently from what we do. 
With them it began at sunset or at 6 o'clock P.M. Thus it was 
that our Lord and the apostles could eat the Last Supper 
probably about 8 o'clock, then go to the Garden of Gethsemane, 
to Pilate and Herod and be crucified the same day in the 
afternoon. Probably it was in view of the fact that both the 
symbolic supper in commemoration of our Lord's death, and the 
death itself, might be upon one and the same day, that the 
Hebrews had the custom mentioned, of reckoning the 24 hour 
day as beginning with the night. Again, the night represents the 
dark period of sin, and sleep in death, to be followed by the 
glorious and everlasting day, of resurrection and heavenly light 
and blessing, which begins with the rising of the Millennial Sun 
of Righteousness with healing in his beams. 

The fact that the Lord instituted his memorial supper of bread 
and wine as taking the place of the Paschal Supper of the literal 



lamb, coupled with the fact that the Passover lamb and the 
deliverance from Egypt which followed the eating of it, were 
typical of the Lamb of God and the deliverance of all who 
partake of his merits, leads us to recognize the propriety of 
commemorating on its anniversary, the death of its antitype, "the 
Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world, " as the 
only intended and proper and significant time. We believe too, 
that this was what our Lord intended to be understood by his 
words, "As oft as ye do this, do it in remembrance of me;" i.e., 
as often as ye celebrate this Passover Supper, henceforth, you 
who believe in me as the antitype, the Lamb of God, should 
think of me and the real passing over due at the resurrection, and 
not any longer do this in commemoration of the typical lamb 
and the typical deliverance from Egypt. 

Christians in every age have recognized the propriety of 
celebrating in some manner this great event of Calvary, and the 
purchase of the life of the world there effected; and many 
commemorate "Good Friday" and "Easter Sunday" in 
remembrance of the crucifixion and resurrection. But as for 
celebrating the Lord's death in the Supper, upon its anniversary, 
the very commemoration which he approved, that has been lost 
sight of for now nearly sixteen hundred years. It was dropped 
from policy, for two reasons: First, because of the animosity 
engendered between professed Christians and Jews: to cut the 
cord which would link the new religion with the old, for fear of 
the influence of other Jewish rites and customs over Christians; 
and secondly, because when Papacy had general control the 
"Sacrifice of the Mass" (which claims to be a fresh sacrifice of 
Christ repeatedly) was substituted for the one and true death, 
which alone and once for all time, taketh away the sins of the 
world. 

Protestants coming out of papal darkness generally saw enough 
to lead them to reject the Mass-"the abomination"-and to re- 
establish the Lord's Supper in much of its early simplicity. They 
are in doubt, however, as to how often it is proper to celebrate it; 
some doing so every Sunday, some monthly, some quarterly, 
etc. 

Scripture evidence upon the subject, however, removes all 
doubts and conjectures, and presents the ordinance in its 
primitive simplicity, and full of typical significance. As this 
subject was treated at some length in our issue of March 1888, 
we refer new readers to the article, "This Do in Remembrance of 
Me," in that number. We have a few copies on hand which we 
will be pleased to supply gratis, to such as are desirous of 
studying the subject from this standpoint. 

It is our custom to celebrate this event on its anniversary as 
reckoned by the Jews— the reckoning followed by the apostles 
and the early church in general— lunar, not solar time. Following 



the lunar time exactly, as the early church did, the celebration 
may fall upon any one of the 

R1100:page2 

days of the week. * This year it will be upon Sunday evening 
April 14th (after six o'clock). At six o'clock of that evening, the 
14th day of the Hebrew month Nisan begins, and lasts until 
Monday evening at six o'clock, where the 15th of Nisan 
commences the first day of the seven days festival of the Jews, 
called the Feast of Passover. We, however, do not celebrate their 
feast, neither do we use the literal lamb. Ours is the antitypical, 
the true Lamb of God, of whom the bread and wine are but 
emblems. And by and by we shall celebrate the antitype of their 
seven days feast of rejoicing, when all of God's people (all who 
have and will come into harmony with him, typified by Israel), 
shall have passed the Red sea of sin and its consequence, death, 
and stand on its further shore; and when Satan and all his willing 
followers with their slings and spears and chariots of evil devise, 
who now seek to hold in bondage, the firstborn (the church) 
and all who desire to follow them and to serve the Lord, shall be 
finally and everlastingly overwhelmed in death— the lasting or 
second death. These and their final destruction were typified by 
Pharaoh and his horsemen, overwhelmed in the Red sea. From 
that calamity all who were under the blood of the Lamb were 
saved,-not only the firstborn saved (spared) in that night (the 
present Gospel age), but also all the hosts of the Lord who 
followed their lead the next (the Millennial) morning. 

Wherever two or three or more believers in the efficacy of the 
precious blood of our Lamb can do so, let them not forget to 
assemble themselves and "do this" in remembrance of him who 
did so much for us. But while desirous of thus meeting as many 
members of the Lord's body as possible, do not urge any, nor 
feel that numbers, or the presence of any particular one of your 
company, is essential; indeed meet the Lord alone and celebrate 
his great sacrifice if you can find no others near you who would 
enjoy the privilege with you. 

Think not that the handling and commemorating of this simple 
ordinance belongs to a special class, called the "clergy," as some 
teach and as many believe. The Lord recognizes no such caste 
among 

R1101 : page 2 

his true followers, but declares, "all ye are brethren, and one is 
your Master, even Christ. " All ye are ministers (servants) of 
Christ; all ye are preachers (declarers) of the good tidings, 
showing it in your cheerful words and looks and deeds, as well 
as telling it with your tongues and pens and through the printed 
page; all ye are priests, not of human ordination, but by divine 
acceptance as members of the body of our great High Priest— 
"the High Priest of our order"- "the Royal Priesthood" "after 



[like] the order of Melchizedek."-Matt. 23:8; Rev. 1:6; Heb. 
3:1; 4:14; 7:21. 

But while not seeking the company of any but the consecrated, 
be not close-communionists; attempt not to decide the rights of 
others at the Lord's table. If some of whom you disapprove draw 
near and desire to commemorate, remember that one at the table 
with the Lord was a deceiver and that very night betrayed him 
for money. If the Lord endured Judas, until the devil whom he 
served led him to "go out," so can you wait for the separation to 
come voluntarily, on the part of a similar class now. 

It has been the custom of the church at Allegheny to invite all 
who can do so to meet with us here, to celebrate, and so far as 
possible to entertain those who come from a distance; and this 
invitation is warmly extended again, this year. Come, all who 
can; that we may celebrate our Redeemer's sacrifice, and in the 
three days following contemplate its fulness and sufficiency— as 
regards the consecrated church now, and as regards "all the 
families of the earth" shortly. Wait not for any further or private 
invitation. All who come will be welcomed, and this is your 
special invitation. But, let none come with bitterness of heart, or 
pride, or vain-glory; but with hearts overflowing with love to the 
Redeemer, and full of desire to know him, and to know his will 
and plan and our respective privileges therein more perfectly, let 
us meet. 

Decide as soon as possible whether you can probably come. If 
you think you will come, please write us a letter or postal card 
on this one subject alone. Give your address very plainly and 
mention if others will be with you, what rail-road you will take, 
and when you expect to arrive here. 

In reply to inquiries, whether there will be an opportunity during 
the meeting for water baptism (in symbolization of the real 
baptism or immersion into Christ- into his death) we would say, 
Yes! good opportunity. Both the "Baptists" and the "Disciples" 
have kindly placed their baptistries, robes, etc., at our disposal, 
for several years past. So many as feel that they have already 
been immersed into Christ, and are desirous of following the 
example of the Lord and the apostles, in the water symbol, will 
have the opportunity afforded them in the afternoon of Sunday 
April 14th. All such are requested to study the subject carefully 
with their Bible, Concordance and the May 1888 WATCH 
TOWER. Twenty-three rejoicingly availed themselves of this 
privilege just before our last Anniversary Supper. But we urge 
no one to thus openly confess his consecration. Nor do we make 
it a test of fellowship: we believe, however, that sooner or later 
the fully consecrated will be led to see the beauty and propriety 
of the water-symbol, and that whenever seen it becomes a test of 
the depth of our consecration, the reality of our death with 
Christ to the world and its opinions. 



The bread used by the Lord was unleavened bread, bread made 
without yeast rising, much like water crackers but in large thin 
sheets. If you can procure such bread from a Hebrew family, do 
so; or if more convenient use water crackers. Not that it is 
essential to have bread made without yeast, for "we are not 
under Law" but controlled by love and privilege in this, as in the 
matter of the time of observing the supper. But as we desire to 
observe at the proper time, when we see its special 
appropriateness, so in the matter of the bread, when we see it to 
be a symbol or representation of our Lord's body, and when we 
learn that leaven or yeast is used in the Scriptures as a symbol of 
corruption and sin, we naturally desire to use as pure a bread- 
symbol as we can conveniently obtain, to represent the pure 
One— holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from the race of 
sinners. 

The wine used by our Lord, to represent his shed blood, we have 
no doubt was made (as "orthodox" Hebrews still make their 
Passover wine) without any yeast or leaven being added to the 
grape juice to hasten fermentation. But nevertheless it was 
fermented wine; the elements of fermentation inhering in the 
grape juice, led by slower process to fermentation and 
clarification, and thus it became "wine." But while it is clear to 
us, that the wine used by our Lord at the Supper, was pure wine 
(but not simple grape juice, which would not keep without 
fermentation from fall to spring) and of the same sort mentioned 
elsewhere in Scripture, an excess of which would make drunk 
(Eph 5:18; John 2:10; Luke 5:39), still, we feel convinced, as 
we view the havoc made by the adulterated wines and liquors of 
commerce, and the wrecking of health and homes which it has 
accomplished and is accomplishing, that our Lord would neither 
use those adulterated and injurious wines as a symbol of his 
precious life-giving blood, nor any other, even pure wine, 
calculated to awaken or revive an appetite for alcoholic liquors. 
We believe that he would regard in this matter the growing 
weakness of our dying race. And when we thus judge of our 
Lord's sentiments on the subject, and reflect that the celebration 
of his death in the use of emblems is not a command, but a 
privilege, we see that as it would not be wrong for us to use 
leavened bread, so it would not be a wrong, nor a neglect of the 
ordinance, for us to use something that will not tempt any, as a 
substitute for the wine; especially as this principle is strongly 
inculcated by the apostle, who says, "It is good neither to eat 
flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother 
stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak." "If meat make my 
brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, 
lest I make my brother to offend." -Rom. 14:21; 1 Cor. 8:13. 

What can we use instead of wine? We can do as the Hebrews 
used to do during the Passover week in which all leaven was 
forbidden them under the law. If their supply of wine ran short 
and they could obtain no more into which they were certain that 



no leaven or yeast had been put to hasten fermentation, they 
made of raisins a substitute for wine, equally a "fruit of the 
vine." We can all easily do the same. Get the common raisins, 
which are strongest in sugar, and after stewing them in a little 
water strain off and use the juice. And will not this be as really a 
"fruit of the vine" as though it were real wine? Therefore while 
not claiming that our Lord and the apostles used raisin-juice or 
grape-juice, but the real wine, we believe that because of our 
climate, and the push, drive and fast living of our day, and the 
present weakness of self-control among men, the Lord would 
approve our use of the raisin-juice fruit of the vine, rather than 
real wine, because of the changed circumstances. 



*Those who commemorate Good Friday, Easter Sunday, etc., 
also reckon by lunar time, but not exactly, for they take for their 
anniversaries the Friday and Sunday nearest to the exact lunar 
date.

ENTERTAINMENT AT THE MEETING. 

For some years past a few of the friends at Allegheny have 
attempted to entertain all the visitors at these anniversary 
meetings, but as our gatherings increase each year, and will 
probably be much larger this year, this will be no longer 
possible. 

It is proposed this year to divide this honor of serving the Lord's 
body, so as to give a larger number a share in the privilege, by 
dividing the visitors. One of the marks of female saintship in the 
early church was, "if she have washed the saints' feet." (1 Tim. 
5:10.) Feet- washing being a necessity of that time, became a 
synonym of service and kindly hospitality. To illustrate this 
same principle of service and humility, our Lord used this same 
custom on the night of the Last Supper: and the entertainment of 
any of the household of faith, is really the fulfilment of our 
Lord's injunction, "See that ye wash one another's feet." But 
none should be permitted to overdo themselves in this blessed 
service, nor to deprive themselves of the spiritual communion of 
the meetings: to this end all have been urged to make only very 
simple arrangements, that both visitors and entertainers may 
have their principal feast upon the spiritual meat. Come then, 
expecting a warm welcome to such plain things as we have 
ourselves. 

Endeavor to reach Allegheny on Saturday afternoon or evening, 
April 13th, and come direct to our office, 151 Robinson Street, 
where some one will remain to meet you until 9 o'clock P.M. 



Those who may arrive on Sunday morning, April 14th, should 
come direct to our Meeting Room, No. 101 Federal Street, 
Allegheny, where there will be meetings at 10 A.M., 2 P.M., 
Baptism service at 4.30 P.M., and the Anniversary services at 
7.30 P.M. The hours for meetings on succeeding days will be 
arranged later. 

*** 

For the information of the friends, we announce, that we have 
arranged with restaurant-keepers here, so that all can have 
dinner and supper, near our hall, at 10 cents each,-no more than 
car-fare would cost you: the difference being made up by some 
of the friends here. Come to the morning meeting, therefore, 
with all your arrangements made to spend the entire day in 
spiritual communion.

EXCURSION RATES TO THE MEETING. 

The following Rail Roads offer us special rates, on the terms 
mentioned below: 

New York Central R.R. and branches. 

Baltimore and Ohio R.R. and branches. 

Pennsylvania R.R. and branches. -In fact all rail-roads, members 
of "The Central Traffic Association," and "The Trunk Line 
Association. " And these include most of the Rail Roads as far 
West as the Mississippi river. 

The reduction allowed, is one-third off the price of the first-class 
limited fare. 

To obtain this reduction, the following directions must be 
carefully followed, viz., Apply to the ticket agent of any of the 
roads named above (the one in your own town, or the nearest 
station to it on one of these roads). Ask him for a certificate with 
a first class limited ticket to Pittsburgh, Pa. (or better still to 
Allegheny, if their road enters Allegheny, which is just across 
the river from Pittsburgh). This certificate must not be dated 
earlier than April 1 1th, hence you must defer purchasing your 
ticket until ready to start for the meeting, though you had best 
inquire about price of ticket, route, certificate, etc., sooner. 

You will be required to pay the full price for the limited ticket 
coming, but hold on to the certificate, and when properly signed 
by the clerk of our meeting here, you will be supplied a first 
class ticket back home, over the same route you came; at one 
third the usual first-class price,- good to reach home on, by or 
before April 21st. Follow these instructions carefully and you 
will have no difficulty whatever. 



To all who write to us, as above suggested, saying they think of 
coming to the meeting, we will mail a sample of the sort of 
certificate they should expect to get (properly filled and signed) 
from their R.R. ticket agent.

ENTERING IN. 



Why don't you enter in? 

Into the work that calls for you, 

Into the promises grand and true, 

Into the inheritance that waits: 

Why stand and weep without the gates, 

O sorrowing one? 

You say you cannot see 

Why, if He loves, He grieves you so, 

Why thro' this path He made you go; 

if you'll enter in to-day, 

He'll show you in His own sweet way, 
Dear suffering one. 

But you will enter in, 

1 am so sure, some blissful day, 
And then, you'll joy to hear Him say, 
Why you have suffered and wept so sore, 
And you will see your sorrow was the door 
To let you in. 

"He lets us in,- 

O Alchemist divine, O wondrous sight! 

Our counted tears all changed to jewels bright, 

When we have entered in the secret place, 

Where He reveals the wonders of His grace. 

Then we can see the "all things" of His Word! 

When we have fully entered into the will of God.

OUR BODY, NOW AND HEREAFTER. 

"For our conversation [lit. community-the government or 
polity in which we are sharers] is in heaven, from whence also 
we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change 
our vile [ignoble] body that it may be fashioned like unto his 
glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even 
to subdue all things unto himself." -Phil. 3:19,20. 



There is a very general misunderstanding among Christians 
with reference to the body here mentioned by the apostle. He is 
here supposed to teach that these human bodies are to be 
changed and made like Christ's glorious body; and that the 
promise is to all of mankind who will be saved. But, while it is 
true, and elsewhere taught, that the "little flock" shall be 
changed and given spiritual bodies like that of Christ, and that 
they will thus be like him, yet, this is not what the apostle is here 
teaching. It should be noticed that the word body is not plural, 
but singular; and that this letter is addressed to the saints in 
Christ. And since the apostle likens the church to a human body, 
the head of which represents our Lord, and the various other 
members the individual members of the church, we are 
warranted from the context in believing that the body to which 
he here refers, is the church, and that this is another instance in 
which he employs this figure. 

The body or the church, in its present condition, is called a vile 
body, not because it is actually vile, but because it is so 
considered by the world. In the Emphatic Diaglott it is 
translated, "the body of our humiliation. " And this body, the 
church, which in God's estimation is a holy body, a body 
justified, and consecrated to his service, and therefore 
acceptable to him, and by him anointed for the glorious work of 
carrying into execution his great plan of salvation by the 
restitution of all things, is to be changed from its present 
condition of humiliation to a glorious condition-to a condition 
suitable to its real character, and the high position it is destined 
to fill as the bride of Christ. 

While, in God's estimation, the church is now regarded from the 
standpoint of her future exaltation as a glorious body, yet now, 
in the estimation of men, she is despised, rejected and hated, as 
was her Lord; because the world knows her not even as it knew 
him not. The world does not realize that this body, now in 
humiliation, is a body of kings and priests who shall by and by 
bear rule over angels and men. If they thought so, the saints 
would be very differently regarded and treated. They have found 
their Lord's prediction fully verified in their experience,-"Ye 
shall be hated of all men for my name's sake." (Matt. 10:22.) 
They must, however, be patient in their humiliation and 
suffering unto the coming of the Lord. Their exaltation and 
glory is not due until then. 

Though our Lord was changed from his condition of 
humiliation, and highly exalted to his present glorious condition 
nearly two thousand years ago, mankind in general is not even 
yet aware of his exaltation. Though they hear the church speak 
of it, they see no evidence of it, and have no faith in what they 
hear. The time when his glory will be manifested to all, so that 
none shall fail to recognize it, will be at his second advent; and 
we are further assured that the church's exaltation and glory 



shall occur, and shall be manifested at the same time- "When 
Christ ...shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in 
glory." (Col. 3:4.) Then, the church shall in reality be a glorious 
body, a body suitable in every way for the high position she 
shall fill as the bride of Christ-the companion of the Son of God 
for all eternity, his joint-heir in all things, and his efficient and 
thoroughly capable co-worker in the great mission to which 
Jehovah hath appointed the Christ-head and body-bridegroom 
and bride. Together they shall constitute the great Prophet, Priest 
and King whom Jehovah hath anointed; and their glory shall 
appear to all intelligent creatures in heaven and in earth. 

But before this glorious exaltation, must come the deep 
humiliation of every member; and if we have no part in the 
humiliation, we have no share in the glory; for only the meek, 
the humble, faithful ones who prove their loyalty to the divine 
will by most severe and humbling tests, will be worthy. They 
must manifest their disposition toward God by obedience even 
unto death; strengthened while walking down into the very 
depths of humiliation, by faith in the promise of God, to exalt 
them in due time. We must close our eyes and ears to the world, 
let them think and talk of us as they will, only giving no real 
occasion, by any actions which our enlightened conscience 
cannot approve. We must be willing to be counted a "vile body, " 
the refuse and dross of society, the offscouring of the church, 
and as fools and fanatics to be persecuted for righteousness sake. 
We must be willing to do good, to forward the truth and to 
suffer for it, and to continue on in the course directed by God, 
regardless of the losses and sufferings it will cost; through all 
waiting patiently, until in his own good time, God shall make 
our righteousness to shine forth as the noon-day, and silence all 
our opposers.-Psa. 37:6. 

Not forgetting that there is but one such body let us look about 
us to discover it. Is it the great Roman Catholic Church?- Or the 
Episcopal, or the Lutheran, or the Baptist, or the Methodist, or 
the Congregational, or any of the numerous other religious 
"bodies" or organizations known by distinctive names? Are any 
of these organizations despised, rejected and counted "vile" by 
the world? No, not one of them. From the least to the greatest 
they are all respected, and thought and spoken well of; but the 
measure of their respect and esteem among men, is always in 
proportion to their numbers and wealth. Some of the smaller 
organizations, comparing their own with the larger and more 
influential, might say they are lightly esteemed and less favored 
by the world, but this does not answer the description of the true 
church. God's Word points out the true church, not by naming 
the organization, but by naming certain features by which it can 
be recognized. 

First of all, he would have us bear in mind that there is but one 
true church (Col. 1:24; Heb. 12:23), and that other organizations 



called churches are not so recognized by him. Secondly, that this 
one church which God recognizes, is only a "little flock." (Luke 
12:32.) So we need not be on the outlook for the largest 
organization as the true church of Christ. Thirdly, we are 
informed, that this "little flock" does not contain many of the 
rich, or great, or wise according to the wisdom of this world. (1 
Cor. 1 :26.) It may contain some of the rich and learned, but not 
many. The rich and learned generally esteem the honors of this 
world (which their riches and learning secure), too highly to 
associate themselves with the humble and despised. Fourthly, it 
is shown that while the church does not contain many of this 
class, it is composed almost entirely of the poor of this world. 
(James 2:5.) And though they are not generally learned, neither 
are they ignorant; for they are close students of God's Word and 
learned in the Scriptures; and the heavenly wisdom derived 
therefrom, gives them an education to which the wisdom of this 
world can never attain. 

Fifthly, all the members of this little church are to be known, 
chiefly, by the spirit they manifest, which is the spirit of Christ; 
for, "If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his. " 
(Rom. 8:9.) He is not recognized of God as a member of the 
church, however much he may profess to be. But here there is 
some danger of being mistaken, unless we observe very closely 
what the spirit of Christ is; for the world and nominal 

R1103:page3 

Christians have, and very positively assert, their idea of the 
spirit of Christ, and bitterly oppose those who truly manifest his 
spirit. Their idea of the spirit of Christ, is simply that of a 
tranquil, peaceful disposition, which manifests itself always and 
only in kind deeds and kind words which the world can 
recognize as such— a disposition which can never be roused to 
indignation, and to words and actions manifesting it. Study 
carefully the spirit manifested by our Lord, and you will find 
that while he was courteous and kind, he expressed his righteous 
indignation against evil-doers, and particularly against 
hypocritical evil-doers, who pretended to be faithful servants of 
God, and exemplary keepers of the law. He never avoided 
declaring the truth, even though it placed him in direct 
opposition to all the religious teachers of his day. And so far 
from maintaining peace and order, was the course which he 
pursued, that to those who had the same idea now so prevalent— 
that his words and actions should always be for peace-he said, 
"Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to 
send peace, but a sword; for I am come to set a man at variance 
against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the 
daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man's foes 
shall be they of his own household. He that loveth father or 
mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son 
or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And he that 



taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me. " 
(Matt. 10:34-37.) Mark also, that the spirit of our Lord was one 
of meekness and humility, and that so he taught his disciples, 
saying, "Take my yoke upon you and learn of me; for I am meek 
and lowly in heart. " In him, truth, humility and love found an 
exponent, who at the same time was bold as a lion in their true 
defense. Though we will not find the spirit of the Master exactly 
duplicated in the members of the true church, we will at least 
find in every member a measure of that spirit, and an effort and 
progress toward a fuller development of it, some being much 
more advanced than others. 

Finally, we are told, that the true church is to be found walking 
in a very narrow way which few find, and in which fewer yet 
care to walk. It is the way of sacrifice, of suffering for 
righteousness' sake, and of humiliation even unto death. 

This class with such experiences as we have described, would be 
esteemed by the world a very miserable "body" as well as a very 
ignoble one; but in this they are mistaken also, for not only is it 
very honorable and destined to exceeding glory and honor in 
God's due time, but it is also a very happy, joyful "body." Those 
of its members who sacrifice, suffer and endure most in the 
cause they serve-the Lord and the truth-are "always rejoicing" 
and "in everything giving thanks." They have a "peace which 
passeth all understanding" and a "joy which no man taketh from 
them; " because, having done the Father's will, they know of 
Christ's doctrine (John 7:17), and "the light of the knowledge of 
God as it shines forth in Christ, hath shined into their hearts (2 
Cor. 4:6), giving beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, 
the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness (Isa. 61:3), for 
as much as they "know that their labor is not in vain in the 
Lord," and that what he hath promised he also will perform. 
Hence these, outwardly buffeted, have the greatest peace at 
heart; and these, outwardly troubled, have the deepest real joys— 
the joys of the Lord. 

Here is the description of the church. But comparing it carefully 
with every organization great and small, we find that not one of 
them answers the description. The true church is not a visibly 
organized body, and is not known among men as a church at all. 
Many of its members have been, and some still are, in the 
various nominal churches, and others are separate from all of 
them, so that you cannot point them out as a visible company 
and say to the world, This company is the true church. But, "The 
Lord knoweth them that are his" (2 Tim. 2:19), and they know 
each other wherever found, by the description which God has 
given. During this entire age it has been in existence, and has 
always been known and loved of God and nourished and 
sustained by him, though its scattered members have grown up 
as wheat in the midst of tares. Now, in the time of harvest, they 
may be more readily discerned as a company than ever before 



(except in the beginning of the age, before the tares began to 
mix in with them and to overshadow and hide them), because 
the Lord is calling them out, and separating them from the tares; 
and the table he has spread before them in the very presence of 
their enemies— the glorious truths now in due season revealed to 
them-is attracting them— in person so far as possible, and into 
sympathy and co-operation, however far separated personally. 

Bear in mind, then, fellow-Christian, that this body, the church, 
which is to be changed and made glorious like her Lord, at his 
appearing, is now a vile (ignoble) body in the estimation both of 
the world and nominal Christians; that her present condition is 
as the body of humiliation; and that her chief ambition and effort 
now, is to use all her powers to the best advantage for the 
Master's glory, in the advancement of his cause and in the 
interests 

R1103:page4 

of his kingdom, rejoicing even in the midst of present 
persecutions, in hope of the coming glory, now shortly to be 
revealed. And if any Christian would make his calling and 
election sure, he must see that he is one of this "vile body, " 
bearing some of the reproach of Christ. The present humiliation 
and sacrifice of the church, as well as her more glorious future 
work, is all for the grand purpose of subduing all things unto 
Christ. It is the indirect means which has for its grand ultimate 
object the restitution of all things. 

Such being the hope of the church, her interests are not in the 
things of this present time— what shall we eat, and what shall we 
drink, and wherewithal shall we be clothed?— how shall we plan 
for the future comforts and good things of this life, etc., etc.? 
These are not the questions of chief interest among the saints. 
The King and kingdom to which they owe allegiance are 
heavenly, and wherever the forwarding of their interests requires 
the sacrifice of earthly good things, that sacrifice for that object 
becomes a pleasure; and hence the saints have no interests here 
which they do not expect to sacrifice for the interests of that 
kingdom in which they shall be sharers, and to which they are 
even now heirs and reckoned of God as sharers. They count that 
already their citizenship is in that heavenly kingdom, and that 
here they are merely aliens and foreigners. 

Therefore, under the kingdoms of this world they have a right to 
expect only such rights and privileges as are accorded to aliens 
and foreigners, yet they know that even such rights and 
privileges may in many cases be denied them; for now "the 
kingdom of heaven [represented by the church] suffereth 
violence," and it shall continue to suffer violence to some extent 
until it is set up in glory and power. 

The "body" of Christ in its present condition of humiliation, is 
actually a very imperfect body, though reckoned perfect through 



the imputed righteousness of Christ; for we have the heavenly 
treasure —our new, transformed mind— in earthen vessels, full of 
imperfections inherited through the fall. These we strive 
continually to overcome; yet we shall never be fully able to 
eradicate them all. Our weaknesses of mind and body and bias 
of disposition, must be fought down, and kept under, every inch 
of the way. Inherited, and formerly cultivated, sinful 
dispositions, such as pride, love of display and praise of men, 
love of ease, selfishness, indolence, and every other sinful 
propensity, will prove a means of discipline to us in our efforts 
to overcome them, and to oppose them by doing the will of God. 
And the patience with which we bear with each other, as we 
gradually grow up into Christ, will prove the measure of our 
love both for each other and for our Lord, whose we all are. 

The various members of the body of Christ, knit together in 
love, should bear with each other, giving and receiving reproof 
in the spirit of meekness; each being careful not to put a 
stumbling-block or cause of offence in his brother's way; or if he 
has unwittingly done so, to quickly remove it as soon as he is 
made conscious of it. We are not to judge one another after the 
flesh but after the spirit, remembering that the flesh warreth 
against the spirit, and that it requires a desperate struggle in 
many cases to keep it down. If a brother through the weakness 
of the flesh has stumbled, remember it was through his 
weakness, and be patient and helpful, unless he manifests no 
disposition to regret it or to reform, in which case he needs 
counsel and reproof; for unless he reform he will be considered 
by the Lord as unworthy and will be cut off from the body. 

In the preceding verses, Paul speaks of some in his day, who 
after identifying themselves with the church, became the 
enemies of the cross of Christ by walking after the flesh and 
minding earthly things, and shows that the end of such a course 
is destruction. He warned the church against such, that they 
might not assimilate with, or recognize them, or be deceived by 
them into the idea that we can mind the earthly things, giving 
our effort and time and attention and interest to them, and still 
be of the little flock which God recognizes as his church, the 
body of Christ. 

Our citizenship is in heaven and all our interests are there, while 
here we are mere strangers and pilgrims, living only for that 
which is beyond.

AS BECOMETH WOMEN 
PROFESSING GODLINESS. 



NO. 4. 



CHRISTIAN WOMEN AS REAPERS 
IN THE GOSPEL HARVEST. 

Now we wish to talk a little to those sisters in Christ who have 
some talents, however great or small, which they desire to make 
use of in the interest of the great harvest work. We have nothing 
to say at present to those Christian women who find both the 
center and circumference of their desires and efforts to do good, 
within the comparatively narrow sphere of home, except that 
they are living far below their privilege, and that selfishness, and 
not the glory of God chiefly, is the mainspring of their efforts 
whether they yet realize the fact or not. 

Let us not be too quick to conclude that we have no talents. All 
the called ones have at least one, though the majority have more. 
Remember that health, money, time, influence, mental activity, 
education, and every advantage we possess, is a talent, to be 
used or abused. And while we should not think of ourselves 
more highly than we ought to think, neither should we underrate 
our abilities. We should think of ourselves soberly, and take as 
nearly as possible a correct estimate, in order that we may make 
the best possible use of our powers. 

We have heretofore shown the principles which should govern 
Christian women in all their work-that modesty of demeanor, 
dress, etc., should always be observed, and that every thing 
approaching a boastful, heady, high-minded spirit should be 
studiously avoided. Bearing this in mind, let us inquire then-In 
what way can we do harvest work to the best advantage? 

On this point several suggestions might be made. They will not 
fit every case and some of them may be impracticable in many 
cases, but we can make use of any or all of them as we find 
ability and opportunity. We should not forget that the strongest 
influence is generally that which comes closest to the heart, and 
here is woman's opportunity. The truth may be presented ever so 
clearly and eloquently in a public discourse, and the majority of 
its hearers will soon forget it in the multitude of other cares. But 
a woman whose heart is filled with the truth and the spirit of the 
truth, can drop in for a neighborly call and brush away the 
rubbish of care, water the seed with a little Christian sympathy, 
warm it with the happy sunshine of her living faith, and loosen 
the soil about it by tenderly showing how helpful such a faith is 
in lightening the cares of life, and how much it has done for 
herself in this way. 



A woman's natural and quick perception, too, generally shows 
her how far to go, and when to stop. Cultivate this faculty; it is a 
natural talent to be used for the Master's glory. 

Then, is any one sick in your neighborhood? You are generally 
welcome with your helping hand, your cheerful smile, and 
words of comfort, both to the sick and to the anxious friends 
who watch over them. Let your words be seasoned with the 
hope of the gospel, in such measure as may be most helpful to 
them, while your kindly offices give them confidence in your 
Christian spirit of love and self-sacrifice, and prepare the soil for 
the reception of the truth. Sometimes you will find it expedient 
to thus prepare the soil by more or less acquaintance before you 
drop any of the seeds into it. In this be wise and harmless, as the 
Master directs, but not too slow and over cautious else you will 
fail of your important work. 

Then remember, "the poor you have always with you;" and 
generally they are the class most ready to receive the truth. 
Some of them may be rough and rude and by no means 
congenial to your tastes. And when you were of the world you 
may have shunned them, and thus incurred their displeasure. Ah, 
what a mission you have here! and what a test, too, of your 
standing, and measure of your growth. Stop first and measure 
yourself, before you think of what you can accomplish in this 
way. Is your former pride crucified, so that you would not be 
ashamed to be seen with that coarse, uncouth neighbor, or to be 
called her friend, if thereby you can feed her with the bread of 
life? Would you be ashamed to say before your friends, as the 
Lord said to Zaccheus (Luke 19:5), I will dine with thee to-day, 
or Thou shalt dine with me? Have you learned to mind not high 
things, but to condescend to men and women of low estate, for 
the privilege of helping them up? (Rom. 12:16.)-and that, too, 
not in a condescending, patronizing way, but with true sisterly 
sympathy and love, manifested in your kindly courteous 
manner, plainness of dress, and simplicity of home 
appointments? 

If so, you can carry the blessed tidings to many a lowly, and to 
many a wretched home. And among them you will occasionally 
find one of the Lord's precious jewels, perhaps unfortunately 
united to a depraved character who calls himself husband, 
though he never knew the meaning of the name, and never filled 
the office. Crushed under a load of care and sorrow, and 
shunned by the more fortunate, what a comfort and blessing you 
may be, with your true friendship and the good tidings of great 
joy. 

Then there are children in your neighborhood. The children of 
the rich you may not be able to reach, but the children of the 
poor may be reached, if you use tact and discretion. You might 
gather a class of children about you to meet with yours at stated 
times, and then tell them the old, old story in as pleasing and 



simple a way as you can. Inspire the little ones with the hope of 
the glorious restitution of all things to Edenic glory and beauty. 
Paint the glowing details before the simple mind of a childhood 
and let them carry it home, being careful not to give meat too 
strong. Your own children, too, carefully instructed, may be 
little messengers of God. If they like the service, tell them they 
are God's little angels (messengers) and that all their little 
services are appreciated in heaven, where their names are 
written and they are personally beloved. 

As to your children's associations, you need to bear in mind that 
"evil communications corrupt good manners;" and, therefore, in 
the impressible period of childhood it will not do to let your 
children mingle indiscriminately with others, much as you may 
love the parents and desire to show yourself friendly to them and 
theirs. Indeed they will be better, especially in these days, to be 
kept to themselves as much as possible. And if your principles 
on this point are made known to your friends, they will not 
misunderstand, but will probably endeavor to imitate you. On 
very special occasions, however, you might find it expedient to 
call in your neighbors' children, even if they are rude and ill- 
mannered, that yours may treat them kindly and show 
themselves friendly. Under your eye, politeness and kindness 
and good feeling will readily take the place of rude ways. The 
strongest characters to resist evil are not those who never meet 
it, but those who do meet it, and overcome it. If your children at 
school and in the neighborhood meet rude children, and their 
rudeness is never commented upon or discountenanced by you, 
they will surely imitate it. Yet such comments should always be 
with charity and pity, and should never be made before others. 
While you teach your children to dislike the evil, teach them 
also to love and pity the evil-doer, as God does, and to study 
how they may help them. Be on the alert for all such 
opportunities, and by so doing you will develop strong 
characters able to resist the evil, which sooner or later they must 
meet, and to overcome it with good. Thus trained, you will soon 
have them as active co-workers with you and with God in the 
great work. 

If worldly ambitions for your children as well as for yourself, 
have been sacrificed —as they must be with the faithful, 
consecrated ones— and your chief desire for them is to have them 
faithful, humble and competent servants of God, you have here a 
grand opportunity to prove your faithfulness-or vice versa; and 
it will affect all your plans for them. As a servant of God you 
will bring them up as near to his idea as possible, teaching them 
that the adornments of the mind and heart are the chief 
adornments in God's sight. 

Another quiet unobtrusive way of working would be to visit the 
various churches, particularly their prayer and conference 
meetings and the Methodist class meetings, dropping a 



seasonable word where you can, and observing those who 
appear to be most earnest and devoted to the Lord, in order that 
you may acquaint yourself with them, or hand or mail them 
something to read, or visit them. 

Then again, there are both friends and strangers near and far, 
who may be reached both by personal letters and printed matter. 
Here lies a wonderful fruitful field of labor-practically 
unlimited. Mark, too, your privilege of spreading the cheerful 
meal— not elaborately, but plainly, and such as the humblest 
might imitate-and calling in, not your friends and rich 
neighbors, but any of God's children without respect to their 
earthly condition, who may be blessed by such a season of 
communion with saints. And verily, you shall not lose your 
reward, even in the present life. Remember, too, the old proverb 
which you can apply to advantage in the Lord's service, viz., If 
you would have friends you must show yourself friendly. Teach 
the little ones too, to enjoy and assist in such hospitality with 
you; and show them that 

R1104:page5 

this is the way, God's way, for us to find real happiness-in 
blessing and serving each other. 

On such and on all occasions discountenance everything 
approaching gossip, and show most decidedly that you have 
neither an ear nor a tongue for any such thing, and make some 
features of the truth, or of the harvest work, the topic of 
conversation. 

In such ways the busiest mothers may find places for profitable 
investments of their talents. With such at his coming the Lord 
finds his own, with interest. 

R1105 : page 5 

Then, in addition to these ways, in which it would seem very 
many could engage, there are the more fruitful means, such as 
those free from domestic encumbrances find— in canvassing 
town and city and country, and spreading the truth broadcast in 
printed form, leaving it to do its blessed work in silence, or to be 
watered and cultivated by some neighborly Christians who see 
in this their opportunity for service. But the above means will be 
open to the greatest number. 

Some, not fully understanding the spirit of consecration, may 
feel inclined like a certain class mentioned in one of our Lord's 
parables, to at once make excuse, saying, "I have no time, no 
money to spare for feasting friends and neighbors, too much 
opposition at home to claim such privileges, no talent to talk of 
the truth. I do not like to associate with people I have always 
considered beneath me, or to have my children mingle with 
theirs. I have no special aptitude to serve the sick, and my 



neighbors are generally well again, before I know they have 
been sick, etc." 

Well, then my dear friend, the principle difficulty with you is 
that you are not very anxious to find work in the vineyard; and if 
so, then you are not wanted there. Where there is a will, there is 
always a way to do something. You have not much time, but by 
economy of labor, in simplicity of house-keeping, of cooking, of 
dress, etc., by regularity and system, by seasonable times for 
rising and retiring, etc., and in various ways you can gain some 
time. If you have but little means, do not be too proud to be 
hospitable in a plain simple way. The Lord and his disciples 
often had nothing more than bread and fish. You have 
opposition from the worldly-minded in your home, but why 
allow all your rights to be rudely trampled under foot? If you 
have faithfully served the interests of husband and family these 
many years, or if as a young mother and wife, you are doing so 
now, it is your right and privilege to extend your simple 
hospitality to your friends as well as theirs. And you should 
claim and use the right. As your children grow up let them see 
that you expect their services, and while they are growing speak 
of the time when you will need it. Train them to the idea of 
relieving the cares of father and mother as soon as they are able. 
And as they are able, put little responsibilities on them, and use 
the time so gained in the Master's service. Some selfish, worldly 
husbands need to have this thought kept before them, too; for 
many such will see a faithful wife plod on year after year under 
burdens which they would not touch, and then feel that they are 
greatly wronged, if she seeks to have them lightened, when such 
a thing is possible. But remember that our first allegiance is to 
our heavenly Bridegroom; and where his counsel is called in 
question, there is but one proper course, and that is, loyalty to 
him at any cost. For this same reason, that you may have more 
time for the Lord's special work, be less particular than you 
would prefer to be about non-essential features of your 
housekeeping. Do not be too hard to please in your house 
assistant. She will not do the work so well, or systematically as 
you have done it yourself; but be satisfied with the best she can 
do under your direction and training. 

You will probably find, too, after faithfully making the effort a 
few times, that you have a better talent for talking of the truth 
than you now know of. Indeed you will often surprise yourself; 
for the Lord has promised you a mouth and wisdom that none of 
your adversaries can gainsay or resist. Sometimes you will find 
your opportunity best used in reading to others, or in merely 
talking enough to introduce the reading matter, and to lead your 
neighbor or friend to investigate. 

The excuse that you do not like to associate with some of the 
humble ones, savors both of the spirit of the world, and also of a 
seeming necessary prudence; and therefore it may be well to 



consider it carefully. The first thought is of the old nature—an 
outcropping of its pride and high-mindedness. Resist it, 
remembering the Master's words:- "Except ye be converted and 
become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of 
heaven. Whosoever shall humble himself as a little child, the 
same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whosoever 
shall receive one such little child (a humble teachable believer, 
or one likely to receive the truth) receiveth me."-- Matt. 18:3-5. 

Thus, in very many humble ways, the watchful faithful stewards 
will find opportunities to invest their talents with a good hope of 
considerable interest. He that is faithful in that which is least, 
will be faithful also in much. (Matt. 25:21,23.) Study to show 
yourself a workwoman approved unto God.

THE REST OF THE DEAD. 

But the rest of the dead lived not again, until the thousand years 
were finished. 

The reader is reminded that these words, though given as part of 
Rev. 20:5 in our common version Bibles, are not found in the 
oldest and most reliable Greek manuscripts; -in none written 
prior to the fifth century, nor even in Vatican MS. 1 160, of the 
eleventh century; neither does the Syriac MS. contain these 
words: but many MSS., not so old nor so exact generally, do 
contain the words. Whether they were originally a memorandum 
by some copyist, who thus commented for his own subsequent 
remembrance and jotted down his thought of the meaning of the 
text, afterward copied by others as part of the text, or whether 
the words really belong to the text and were accidentally omitted 
from the best, oldest and most reliable manuscripts, we will 
know, when we know all things. To us, these facts are of 
sufficient weight to warrant the conclusion that they are 
spurious. 

However, for the sake of those not so fully convinced, let us 
here consider the words as though they were part of John's 
inspired revelation. And it will be seen that even if they are not 
spurious, but properly of the text, yet they are in perfect 
harmony with the plan of the ages. The difficulty in the minds of 
those troubled by this expression, arises mainly from their 
failure to fully appreciate the terms "lived" and "resurrection." 

The passage when rightly understood is not at all in conflict with 
the Bible teaching, that all that are in their graves shall come 
forth, and that all shall be brought to a knowledge of the truth, 
and to a full opportunity for accepting or rejecting it, during the 



period of Christ's Millennial reign, and that with its close comes 
the end of human probation, when the willingly obedient shall 
all enjoy everlasting life, and the willingly disobedient will all 
be cut off in the second death; and that Adamic death shall 
cease, being destroyed by the Redeemer and Life-giver; and 
when, consequently, pain, sorrow and weeping, incidents of that 
Adamic penalty shall be forever at an end. 

The word life, really signifies that perfect state of existence from 
which death and dying, sickness and pain, and all the elements 
of death and condemnation, are excluded. Adam and Eve 
(before they sinned, and passed under condemnation of death 
and began to decay), and our Lord Jesus who was sinless, alone, 
of all human beings, ever had life; they alone ever "lived" in the 
full proper sense of the word; all others, born under Adamic 
condemnation (Rom. 5:12,17-19), are properly speaking dying, 
not living now. The death sentence having passed upon all, from 
the true standpoint of life all are in death-dying. All inherit the 
weaknesses, the imperfection and sin, and like-wise the penalty, 
dying and death. Thus our Lord also, at times, spoke of the race 
as a whole- "Let the dead bury their dead." 

We all know what it is to be dying until totally dead; let us all 
learn that it means to reverse this order, when we speak of living 
until perfectly alive. As the present and the past six thousand 
years, have been a dying time,— a time in which DEATH HAS 
REIGNED and triumphed and conquered the race-so the 
coming thousand years, the Millennium of Christ's reign, is to be 
a re-living time, a time in which LIFE WILL REIGN, the result 
of Christ's obedient sacrifice.— Rom. 5:17-19. 

When life shall reign, the reign of Adamic death (from whose 
dominion all were purchased by the precious blood of the new 
King, the Life-giver,) must cease. 

Many make the mistake of supposing that death was conquered 
when our Lord Jesus arose from the dead. True, there death was 
forced to surrender Him who is to be the destroyer of death, the 
life-giver to as many as will receive everlasting life as a gift of 
God upon his conditions, but Adamic death was not conquered 
then, nor its power even restrained. The long six thousand years 
reign of death has not yet been interrupted, except by the 
resurrection of our Lord. Death reigned before the Law-from 
Adam to Moses, -and during the Law or Mosaic dispensation, 
which gave release to none; and it has also reigned during the 
Gospel age over all except Christ. And since, we walk by faith 
and not yet by sight; trusting our Lord's promises of final victory 
through a resurrection out of death's domain and power. 

The apostle after relating (1 Cor. 15:42-54) the particulars of the 
first resurrection, that of the Gospel church, to the likeness, 
glory and power of her Lord, which he shows to be due at the 
appearing of her Lord, in the beginning of the 



R1106:page5 

Millennial age (1 Pet. 1:7; Titus 2:13; 2 Tim. 4:8), exultantly 
exclaims: "Then shall be brought to pass [to fulfilment] the 
saying which is written, 'Death is swallowed up in victory!'" But 
it is a further mistake to suppose the apostle to mean that the 
victory over death is gained when the church is completed, in 
the first resurrection. Not so; on the contrary he shows, that then 
shall be brought to pass, or from then on shall be accomplished, 
the victory over death. 

The resurrection of the Church, with the change of the living 
members of the same, marks the period of the inauguration of 
Christ's Kingdom, and from then on the reign of sin and death 
must give place to the reign of righteousness and life. The 
victory of the Life-giver, assured eighteen centuries ago by his 
resurrection from the dead by the power of the Father, will begin 
with the deliverance of his joint-heirs, the first resurrection, but 
thank God it does not end there. 

Dear dying Lamb, thy precious blood 
Shall never lose its power, 
'Till all the ransomed hosts of earth 
Are saved from Satan's power. 

This brings us to the point of time referred to by the passage 
quoted at the head of this article, when the first resurrection is 
complete. What then about the rest of the dead?— We answer: 

Then the general resurrection, of the dead and dying world, will 
begin. But it will not be at all like what is generally surmised. It 
will be the work of the entire Millennial age, a gradual lifting up 
to perfect life of those of mankind who shall then be found 
worthy of it. And though this work of resurrecting will be 
gradually progressing throughout the Millennial age, yet the rest 
of the dead (aside from those who share in the first resurrection, 
and live and reign with Christ) will not live again in the full 
sense of living-in the sense of regaining the perfection of life 
lost in Adam, -until the thousand years are finished. 

"The wicked shall never see life, " in this full sense (Psa. 
49:19,20; John 3:36), though all the families of the earth shall be 
awakened and brought to full clear knowledge of the truth, 
before being sentenced as "wicked."-! Tim. 2:3,4; Heb. 10:26. 



R1106:page5 

RESURRECTIONS AND 
CONDITIONS CONTRASTED. 

Let us contrast briefly the trial of those who shall share the first 
resurrection, with that of those who shall share the general 
resurrection; and the Lord's method of giving the reward to the 



worthy of this trial and to the worthy in that; and the reasons for 
the differences; in order that we may comprehend the situation 
more clearly. 

The first resurrection at the beginning of the Millennial age and 
the completion of the general resurrection at its close, reminds 
us of the fact that our Lord was raised from the power of death, 
perfect, in the beginning of the Gospel age, but the church lives 
not until the end of the Gospel age. But while there is this 
general resemblance between the two ages, in the fact that trial 
and testing come throughout, and the reward of life at the close, 
there is a wide difference between them in other respects. For 
instance:— 

First, the kind of "life everlasting" to be bestowed in the end of 
the Gospel age to the Gospel church, will differ from that to be 
given the faithful of the Millennial age— or rather, to express it 
correctly, the Gospel church will obtain similarly everlasting 
life, but will have bestowed upon them a higher nature or finer 
organism. Both classes when perfected, will have perfect 
everlasting life, but the one will be a perfection of human 
nature,- "very good," grand indeed, an image and likeness in 
the flesh, of the divine while the other will be superlatively 
grand, of a nature, organism, etc., not only higher than human, 
but "far above angels"— the express image of the Heavenly 
Father's substance- "partakers of the divine nature." 

Second, the kind and degree of trial will be very different. In the 
Millennial age all who would have the perfection of human life, 
then to be freely bestowed 

R1106:page6 

upon all worthy of it, will be required to prove their worthiness 
by willing conformity, not only to the righteous laws which will 
then prevail, but also to principles of righteousness. They must 
come to love righteousness and hate iniquity, not merely from 
fear of penalties, but on principle. But then knowledge will be 
clear and all things favorable to righteousness. In the Gospel age 
much more exacting and crucial is the test. All who shall share 
Christ's nature and throne are obliged to prove their worthiness 
by enduring much opposition from the wicked and blinded in 
the present age, as well as from their own physical and mental 
weaknesses and imperfections. They must prove themselves 
"overcomers" by patiently and perseveringly doing the Lord's 
will as best they can understand and do it. 

Third, the methods of giving the reward of life will differ. The 
Gospel church must walk by faith all the way, being treated as 
other men, subject to many of the vicissitudes of disease and 
death much as others; and they must trust, believe and hope for 
the life promised at the close of the age without experiencing 
any evidence of it on the way, except by faith. They, like others, 
have pain, sickness, sorrows and difficulties; they are men of 



sorrows and acquainted with grief, and are finally sown in death. 
Though trusting in Christ as their Savior and Life-giver, and 
publicly declaring it, yet they must in dishonor and weakness 
fall under the blow of the now reigning prince of darkness- 
death— hoping, praying, trusting for the resurrection- life 
promised, but not in any measure actually accomplished in 
them. "I have said, Ye are gods, all of you sons of the Most 
High; but ye shall all die like men and fall like one of the 
chiefs." (Psa. 82:7.) [We do not fall in death as sinners, like 
Adam, but as sacrifices for the truth in opposition to error, like 
the other chief-Christ Jesus- with whom we are reckoned joint- 
sacrificers.] These, having passed all their trial satisfactorily, 
without rewards, will be given the great reward all at once, 
without further trial. Their resurrection or perfecting as new 
creatures, spiritual beings, will be an instantaneous one-in a 
moment, in the twinkling of an eye. 

But with the world, during the Millennial age, it will be very 
different. They will not be promised life and restitution, yet be 
deprived of it entirely until the close of their age, and be obliged 
to sicken and die. No; on the contrary, Death shall reign no 
longer. At the very beginning of the Millennial age, Life will 
begin to reign, and will begin to pay his wages unto all obedient 
unto the spirit of the law of life. Each act of obedience shall be 
rewarded; each effort to honor and obey and uphold the right 
and the truth, will bring its compensation; not only of pleasure 
and a sense of heavenly approval, but also of health and 
strength— a gradual release from death, and a gradual bestowal 
of life. The work of restitution, as it relates to mind and morals 
and physical development is the resurrection work; -lifting the 
race up, out of the death state and all the degradation into which 
the penalty of Adam's sin plunged it. This is the true meaning of 
the word resurrection. 

It is a serious and blinding mistake, made by very many, to 
suppose that the raising of a corpse out of a tomb, or even the re- 
animation of a dead person, such as Lazarus, the widow's son, 
Jairus' daughter, etc., to be resurrections. Not at all; the term 
resurrection is never applied to such cases in the Scriptures. Of 
Lazarus our Lord said, I go to awake him out of sleep. He was 
re-animated or awakened to a former degree of life; or rather, 
we might more properly say, to the former degree of death. Of 
little value would the promise of resurrection be, to any, if it 
merely signify awakening and re-animation to our present, poor, 
dying state. Thank God it means in the fullest sense "to raise up 
again" not partially, but up, up, up to perfection. To the 
majority, as already shown, this will mean a lifting up, or back, 
to the perfection of human nature lost by father Adam- 
gradually, during the Millennium, and in co-operation with their 
own efforts and longings for righteousness and perfection, 
mental, moral and physical. To the "little flock," who, under the 
favor of the Gospel call, have exchanged human nature (by its 



sacrifice) for divine nature, it means, the lifting up (at one 
bound-in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye) to the full 
perfection of the new nature-the divine nature; not gradually, 
but instantly, from mortality to immortality, from weakness to 
power, from dishonor to glory, from a natural body to a spiritual 
body; because their trial is fully past before death. And all who 
shall be accounted worthy of the first [chief] resurrection will 
have been already proved "overcomers," "faithful until death," 
and "worthy," or they would not have part at all in that chief 
resurrection. 

Blessed and holy, proved and accepted, are all they that have 
part in the first resurrection. And while all others shall share in 
the general resurrection, none but holy ones shall ever reach its 
grand climax- perfect life;— for everlasting life is the gift of God 
(through Jesus Christ our Lord); and he gives it to none of the 
wilfully wicked or rebellious, but only to such as will serve, 
honor and obey him, when their knowledge and opportunities 
are perfect. All shall be awakened and brought to full knowledge 
before being sentenced as "wicked. " But the wicked shall never 
see life.-Psa. 145:20; Heb. 10:26,27; John 3:36. 



R1107:page6 

THEY THAT SHALL 
ATTAIN RESURRECTION. 

"They that shall be accounted worthy to obtain that age and the 
resurrection from among the dead, neither marry nor are given 
in marriage."— Luke 20:25. 

We do not here treat the subject, "Whose wife shall she be?" 
having already considered it. (See, TOWER of March '87.) We 
wish now merely to draw attention to the harmony between the 
above words of our Lord and the foregoing view, on the 
meaning of the word resurrection, as applied to the world, 
showing the class worthy of it, and how the worthiness or 
unworthiness of each will be demonstrated by their conduct, 
when awakened from death. 

We cannot understand our Lord's words, to apply to the saints, 
the church, who will share in the first resurrection; for the 
inquiry and conversation were regarding another class, and by 
another class. The Lord's answer applied to ordinary Jews who 
knew nothing about the first resurrection, the reward of 
following the Lord in sacrifice. 

The Millennial age is an age of trial, a transition period, and 
hence was not the age looked to by the question of the 
Sadducees who wished to know how matters would be finally 
and everlastingly. Our Lord's answer meets the question exactly; 
he does not explain how it will be during the Millennial age, 



while the race is being awakened, and while the willing ones are 
being restored from death to life, but pointing his words to "that 
age" of perfection which will follow the Millennium of testing, 
he informs them first of all, that it is an open question as yet 
whether the woman and the seven husbands will be accounted 
worthy of that age, worthy of resurrection,-of being raised up 
again to the perfection lost in Adam, and entering the everlasting 
state. Thus our Lord clearly teaches that though all that are in 
their graves shall hear his voice and come forth, some [the 
church] will come forth to a resurrection of life, and some will 
come forth to a resurrection of judgment or trial,-a resurrection 
work being begun which for its completion will depend wholly 
upon the faithfulness of those being tried in it. If in that period 
of judgment-resurrection any shall be proved worthy of the 
perfect age and everlasting life, he shall have it; and any found 
unworthy in that time shall not obtain access to the perfect age, 
nor to the perfection of life: They are "wicked" and "shall not 
see life," nor be worthy of complete resurrection. 

But, let us remember, that since a full release from the wages of 
Adam's sin (death-everlasting destruction) has been granted, it 
follows that the Millennial trial of each, individually, will be as 
though each were perfect, as though they had never been 
condemned in Adam,— full allowance being made by the Judge 
for the weaknesses, from the fall, remaining in them. Each will 
be judged by his own attitude toward righteousness, under the 
clear light and full understanding of the Millennial age. Only 
those wilfully opposed to righteousness, when clearly seen, will 
be condemned as unworthy of life; and such as then die, will die 
the second death; for if never fully lifted up out of the present 
dying state, it will be their own fault entirely-an evidence of 
their unwillingness to have life upon the only conditions it ever 
will be offered— obedience to God's righteous law. 

Hence, when we read, "Even death the last enemy shall be 
destroyed," "Death shall be swallowed up in victory," etc., we 
should "rightly divide the word of truth," and note that it is the 
release of humanity from the penalty which came upon all 
through Adam's sin and not from the second death, which will 
come upon willful sinners only. 

Adamic death, though a just penalty, is an enemy or opponent, 
because it slew all— both the willfully wicked, and the ignorant 
and blinded, and those also who willed to do well and loved 
righteousness. It was because God foresaw that there would be 
such lovers of righteousness under the death condemnation, that 
Christ Jesus died for our sins and released all from that penalty 
so as to give life to as many as would take pleasure in using it to 
God's glory and their own everlasting well-being. 

The second death, on the contrary, is not an enemy but a 
blessing; just as the destruction of useless, injurious and filthy 
rubbish, is a blessing. If the second death meant everlasting 



torture, the case would be different: No excuse could be offered 
to justify the perpetuation in misery of the existence of any 
creature, however wicked. Extinction (death, without hope of 
resurrection) is certainly a just penalty upon those who are 
willfully wicked, after they had full knowledge of good as well 
as evil, and the results of each. But the second death is an enemy 
to none of the righteously disposed; to them it is a blessing. The 
utter destruction of such as are proved unfit to have life, is 
needful to the harmony of God's kingdom and the peace and 
happiness of such as love righteousness. And this is the 
testimony of God's word concerning his plan: "All the wicked 
will he destroy." He will "destroy those that corrupt the earth. 
These are the symbolic "goats" of Matt. 25:41,46, also called the 
angels, messengers or servants of Satan, and the symbolic "fire" 
destroys them. The second death will be proportionately as great 
a blessing, in ridding the earth of the evil-disposed incorrigible, 
as the Adamic death was an enemy, destroying the well- 
disposed with the evil-doers and the ignorant. 



R1107:page6 

A MISAPPREHENSION. 

Some seem to get the impression, that for the Lord to finally 
destroy some of his creatures— Satan, and such as have his spirit 
of opposition to righteousness,— would imply a failure of the 
divine plan. Such ask, Is it not written that "All his purposes 
shall be accomplished?" and, Cannot God melt the hardest 
hearts? and will not Christ subdue all things unto himself and 
reign until he has put down all enemies? 

Yes, we answer; God's plan will be fully accomplished, but it 
does not follow that every human plan is the divine one. 
Nowhere has God declared it to be his plan to preserve 
everlastingly every creature he has made, and to force all such 
into obedience. To suppose such pride on the part of the 
Almighty would be to accuse him of folly. And if such a pride 
of workmanship related to man would it not extend to all of his 
creation and insure the resurrection to everlasting life, of every 
animal, fowl, fish and insect that ever lived? 

But such is not God's declared plan. On the contrary, while the 
Scriptures declare that God takes no pleasure in the death of any 
of the human family, but would or is willing that all should turn 
unto him and live, and has made abundant provision in harmony 
with this, his will, through Christ's sacrifice and coming 
Millennial reign, yet he declares clearly, that as sin in Eden 
brought death (from which we were redeemed by Christ's death, 
because it was not the penalty of our own wilful sin) so when 
each stands trial for himself the penalty will be no different; for 
God and his law have not changed. "The wages of sin is death," 



still. And in the individual trial, "The soul that sinneth 
[wilfully], it shall die," though in that [Millennial] day none 
shall die for another's sins, as now. 

So far from planning to coerce all men into his service, God's 
plan is the very reverse; only the willingly obedient shall eat the 
good of the land— shall partake of his bounties of lasting life and 
favor. Had God chosen to make man a mere machine— without 
will of his own, acting only as acted upon— would he not after 
making the machine right, keep it right; and not permit it to fall 
into destruction? Experience would be worse than wasted on 
such beings. But this theory would necessitate the conclusion, 
that God is responsible for all the sin and misery of the world. It 
implies that the fault is all with God, and starts the inquiry, Why 
did he not make the human machine as he wanted it at first? If 
this theory were true, God would be the great and only sinner; 
the only one justly worthy of punishment. 

But this theory would make God a liar, a deceiver, a hypocrite 
and unjust; for he tells us that the sin was man's, and that the 
penalty inflicted was just. Let us believe God. The man he 
created was a fleshly image of himself. He was in a fit condition 
to be tried or tested, to prove 

R1107:page7 

himself worthy or unworthy of life. He was organically perfect; 
nothing imperfect would be an image of God; nothing else could 
be tried or condemned, justly. To set Adam on trial, not only for 
his own life but also as the representative of the race in him, and 
to have him fall because created imperfect, would be unjust; and 
such a trial would be a farce, a deception, a great wrong. Any 
penalty would be unjust under such circumstances. 

Not only organically perfect, but also favorably situated in Eden, 
Adam had no reasonable temptation to disobey God's command, 
as would have been the case had other food been scarce and he 
about to die of hunger. If, having promised him life, God had 
made insufficient provision of food, etc., and forbidden a fruit 
necessary to his existence, Adam would have had some excuse 
for his disobedience and might have said, Lord you promised me 
life, but I was dying of hunger, and therefore I ate supposing 
you had forgotten your promise. In such a case the disobedience 
would not have been wilful, but under provocation -temptation. 
But God tempteth no man. 

It is true, though Adam had a perfect brain, he had not reached 
perfect knowledge and experience at the time of his trial. It was 
not needful to a fair trial that he should have had experience in 
disobedience, 

R1108:page7 

or a knowledge beyond what he possessed. He knew that God 
was his Creator and Benefactor and that he ought to render 



obedience to his commands, if he would continue to enjoy his 
favor and blessings. Nor was it needful to the trial that he should 
have large experience in the use of his perfect mind, for instance 
for the construction of apparatus for analyzing the forbidden 
fruit, to see whether it contained something really injurious, or 
for reasoning out the cause of its prohibition. The reason and 
propriety of this as a trial or test of his obedience, he no doubt 
would have been permitted to fully understand afterward, had he 
continued obedient to God. 

Adam was not deceived even (1 Tim. 2:14); he disobeyed God 
knowingly and willingly, evidently with the expectation and 
intention of dying; because his loved companion had been 
deceived into disobedience. As a free moral agent, he was left to 
do as he chose, and he wilfully chose to disobey and received 
the penalty -death. 

This power of will or choice belongs to human nature as God 
made it. Were it otherwise, human nature could not be called an 
image or likeness of God's nature. God has a will and exercises 
it. Man, made in God's likeness, must have a similar will of his 
own, and must be similarly free in its exercise. Adam's proper 
course would have been to say, Though all my happiness seems 
lost by the disobedience of my dear companion, for I know that 
God meant all he said, when he pronounced the penalty for 
disobedience, yet two wrongs will never make one right. I will 
be obedient myself, and go to God and confess with sorrow the 
case as it is, and solicit his mercy in view of the extenuating 
circumstance of Eve's deception. I will lay the case in the hands 
of our kind benefactor, praying that whatever his love and 
wisdom and power and justice can arrange may be done for her 
atonement and recovery. Peradventure he may see a way to 
maintain his own justice, and yet spare the only companion I 
have on earth. But self-will chose the independent course; and 
Adam determined to share the fate of his wife. His was really a 
case of suicide. 

Human nature has not changed, though our free agency is very 
largely curtailed by our unfavorable surroundings and our 
unbalanced, unsound minds on all subjects. With the restoration 
or resurrection, under the advantageous surroundings and 
allowances of the Millennium, the free agency or free will of 
man so far from being utterly destroyed will be restored, 
perfectly and completely; and by their will all will be judged 
worthy or unworthy of life everlasting. If it were a labor for the 
Almighty to create human beings or to destroy them, or if 
numbers were a necessity in his plan, there might be some room 
for questioning whether ages and ages of effort would not be 
made to bend the wills and turn the hearts of those found 
incorrigible during, and at the close of, the Millennium. But, 
when to create or destroy, are as easy with the Almighty as to 
preserve us alive, we see the wisdom of his plan of giving and 



continuing life to only such as appreciate it as his favor, and 
who, when fully informed, will rejoice to co-operate with God 
in recognizing it as the all in all of wisdom and righteousness- 
their wills being in perfect harmony with his. 

The promise that all things shall be "subdued," or "put under 
Christ," refers to the power that will coerce active evil during 
the Millennial age. All things actively in opposition to God's 
plan and law will be subdued, restrained, hindered. And if, after 
being for a time outwardly forced to obey the laws of 
righteousness, the former evil-doers continue opposed at heart 
they shall be cut off (Isa. 65:20; Rev. 20:7-10,15), that evil may 
be rooted out and righteousness firmly and lastingly established 
in and through them that love it.

ABOUT OLD MANUSCRIPTS. 

DEAR SIR AND BROTHER:-I have read with much interest 
your work "MILLENNIAL DAWN," and I agree that the theory 
it presents, though new [The original, old theology of the Bible, 
we call it. -EDITOR.], ought not to be rejected because so. But 
that passage in Rev. 20:5, "But the rest of the dead lived not 
again, until the thousand years were past," arose in my mind at 
once as a barrier to the reception of your view. You state it to be 
an interpolation, and that the words are not found in the best and 
most ancient manuscripts. I wrote to Dr. Manly of the S.B. 
Theological Seminary as to his knowledge of the matter. He 
writes to me, that so far as his investigations have gone there has 
been no dispute as to the authenticity of the passage, but some as 
to the verbal construction. He further says, that in his opinion 
there is no copy of Revelation ante-dating the fifth century. 

Now I am anxious to know just what God's Word teaches. Will 
you please give me the source of your information upon which 
you state that it is not in the ancient copies? Do you know from 
a personal investigation? Are there no copies of Revelation ante- 
dating the fifth century? I am anxious to be informed on the 
subject, for your theory will relieve my mind on some things 
that have been hard to understand. I want to believe it, if the 
Scriptures will allow me. But while that passage remains, it 
effectually bars the door to belief. I have been a pre-millennialist 
for nearly thirty years, and the doctrine becomes clearer with the 
coming years. Now, if your theory be true, a beautiful harmony 
will exist in my mind. 

Fraternally Yours, 

G. E. BREWER. 



-INREPLY- 

There are but two known copies of the New Testament, in 
Greek, ante-dating the fifth century: these are known among 
scholars as the Sinaitic and Vatican manuscripts. They are given 
the same date,- about A.D. 350-though by some the Sinaitic, 
which was most recently found, by Prof. Cons. Tischendorf in 
1859, is supposed to date a little earlier. 

The Vatican MS. came into the possession of European scholars 
in 1475 A.D., and is known from other more recent Vatican 
MSS. by its number, 1209. It is very accurate so far as it goes, 
but it is of no authority on the clause of Rev. 20:5 in question, 
because it is defective, incomplete, —the Epistle to the Hebrews 
from 9:15 to close is lacking, as well as all of the Epistles to 
Timothy, Titus, and Philemon, and the book of Revelation. 

The Sinaitic MS., remarkable as being the oldest as well as for 
its completeness and accuracy, is therefore the only Greek 
authority on Revelation ante-dating the fifth century: and it does 
not contain the clause, of Rev. 20:5, in dispute. 

Regarding your question, as to our authority and information, 
we would say: We do not possess these old manuscripts and do 
not hope to— they are esteemed as of almost priceless value 
among scholars. The Sinaitic is now in the possession of the 
Russian government at St. Petersburg. However, at great 
expense, borne by the Czar of Russia, Prof. Tischendorf, the 
finder, published an exact copy of this MS. And later, for the 
benefit of the general public, Mr. T. prepared and published, in 
1869, the common version of our English New Testament, with 
foot-notes showing all instances in which it varies from the three 
oldest Greek MSS. -the Sinaitic, and Vatican, above mentioned, 
and the Alexandrine, a later and less accurate MS. This work in 
a small form, cheaply bound in cloth, can be ordered through 
your nearest book-seller. Its retail price is one dollar. 

We hope, at some time ere long, to get out a copy of this last 
mentioned edition in cheaper form, for the benefit of all our 
subscribers; being desirous that they should all enjoy the 
benefits and information thus afforded.

A SUCCESSFUL MINISTER. 

[The following is from Brother Weber of Maryland. Though a 
florist and gardener on a large scale, he is not seeking worldly 
prominence or wealth, but divine approval and heavenly riches. 
To do this he uses his garden, hot-houses, etc., as ways and 
means for honoring the Lord by spreading the truth. He is out as 
much as possible in the "harvest" field selling DAWN Vol. I. A 
man of keen business judgment and good address, he enlists his 



best endeavors in this highest service— the service of God— and 
we believe is laying up treasure in heaven. -EDITOR.] 

MY DEAR BRO. RUSSELL:-After taking leave of you, 
Wednesday evening 6th, I arrived in Frederick, Md., next 
morning at 9:30 A.M., and started out by 10 o'clock and 
distributed Arp tracts the remainder of the day. Next morning I 
started out at 8:30 and sold that day 32 of DAWN Vol. I., and 
next day 22. Saturday being a pleasant day, a great many were 
not at home, which cut my sales short that day. The week 
previous I used a day and a half in the same way and sold 55 
books; and altogether in the 4-1/4 days I have sold 109 books. I 
only wish I could give my entire time to this blessed work, but 
other duties will not permit me yet to do so. But I hope as soon 
as I see my way clear, nothing shall prevent me from doing so. I 
realize the privilege of being 

R1109:page7 

a co-worker with the Lord in this evil day; and selling DAWN is 
certainly the most effective way of preaching the real Gospel, 
thus placing these blessed truths right in the hands of the people. 
This certainly is the best way of preaching, and if we are 
confronted with the blind leaders who will not buy them, we 
have then an opportunity of bearing witness to the truth by word 
of mouth. 

May our dear Brethren and Sisters who can give their time, see 
the privilege of doing all they can, so they may have the 
Master's approval. I will close with best regards joined by Sister 
W. to you and Sister R. and all the friends. Yours in fellowship 
and service of the truth.

OLD THEOLOGY TRACTS. 

THE WAGES OF SIN. 

This small tract of 24 pages, neatly printed, is considered 
excellent for new readers. They are of proper size for enclosing 
in envelopes. We believe that one of these, an Arp Tract, 
enclosed in a Missionary Envelope, would be a good means of 
reaching many of your friends. Those who think the plan a good 
one and desire to avail themselves of it, can do so. 

It is proposed to issue these tracts quarterly. They will vary in 
the number of pages. To conform to the requirements of the 
Postal Laws, a price must be fixed on these and subscriptions 
received,- same as with TOWER. We have fixed the price at 10 
cents per year, which would cover the cost, including postage. If 



we can get them out in large quantities, we will be able to 
produce them cheaper, and the more issued the more good 
results we may hope for. We therefore propose a large discount 
on quantities, thus— 

25 copies-quarterly for 1 year (100 tracts) for $ 1.00 

50 copies-quarterly for 1 year (200 tracts) for 1.75 

100 copies-etc. (400 tracts) 3.00 

500 copies- (2000 tracts) 13.50 

1000 copies- (4000 tracts) 25.00 

3000 copies- (12000 tracts) 68.00 

The topics selected for these will be chiefly selections from 
TOWER matter, specially suitable for general, promiscuous use. 
The cost of 1000 copies, quarterly, for a year, would be no more 
than some of you used to pay for pew-rent,— to have your 
understandings darkened by misrepresentations of God's 
character and plan. It is for you to consider, whether you can not 
better use that sum hereafter in preaching the Old Theology of 
the Bible, to your former fellow-sectarians and others. This 
number of tracts distributed quarterly at mills, shops, among 
clerks in stores, printers, editors, reporters, school teachers, at 
offices of lawyers and physicians, and at church doors, by 
yourself, or others employed by you, could scarcely fail to 
accomplish some good, in opening the eyes of some who would 
thank you for it eternally, as God's agent and light-bearer. 

Perhaps you used to give a like sum toward Home Missions, and 
as much more toward Foreign Missions-$75 per year toward 
religious teaching. It is for you to consider that under this plan 
this $68 would enable you to preach 3000 sermons quarterly, to 
your own and neighboring townsmen. 

You used to think that one-tenth of your earnings or profits 
should be used in the Lord's service; now you see, that that 
tithing system was the law to the Jews only, and that we are not 
under the Law, but under grace. As followers of Christ, we 
covenanted to give not merely one-tenth of our profits, but all 
that we have and are and shall be,— time, money, influence, all 
and forever-to the Lord and his service. It is for each to 
consider whether or not the Lord's favor toward us, in opening 
our eyes and delivering us from the bondage of fear and error, 
has drawn our hearts closer to him and made us anxious to 
spend and be spent more and more to honor him; or whether the 
removal of the chains of error's bondage and fear of future 
torment, has made us harder and more selfish. We may be 
assured that if the truth produces a hardening effect on us, it 
would not only prove us unworthy of the high-calling to joint- 
heirship, but 

R1109:page8 



unworthy of life on any plane. Pharaoh is an example of those 
whose hearts harden instead of melt, under the influence of 
God's mercy. 

Consider, too, that what you now do and spend, is in part at least 
to offset that formerly spent; to counteract former errors and 
misrepresentations of God's character with the clearer light now 
shining. Some of us who were for years very zealous in the 
spread of error, before the truth reached us, and who like Paul 
verily thought thereby to do God service, might almost despair 
of ever offsetting it with the truth, but for the fact that the money 
and energy we then spent accomplished little, compared with 
what even the same amount of each would accomplish now, in 
the service of the truth, in this harvest time and with the 
facilities our Lord has now put into our hands. 

Consider that "the time is short:" that where we used to give one 
dollar, or a hundred, or a thousand, we now have the privilege of 
showing the Lord our appreciation of the truth by using five 
times as much, both of time and money; the results of which are 
beyond comparison. 

Can we preach the good tidings in a better way than in 
circulating DAWN VOL. I., and these tracts? If some can afford 
to pay for the tracts, but cannot attend to having them circulated 
(and all should be able to do this also, unless invalids), there 
may be other brethren and sisters who would be glad to 
distribute more tracts than they can purchase, and we will find 
such agents for you, if you desire. 

But we are not urging this work, but merely asking you to 
consider the matter and act according to your own judgment. 
Here is an opportunity for extensive harvest work; and the time 
between the quarterly issues is ample for thorough distribution.

EXTRACTS FROM 
INTERESTING LETTERS. 

Venango. 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-Your book, The Time is at 
Hand, has been received and read with avidity. I can scarcely 
restrain myself from continually crying aloud, "Glory to God in 
the Highest!" Hallelujah! for evermore. May the praises of God 
and the Lamb be upon every tongue! How can it be otherwise? 
Who so great or so glorious as our Redeemer who gave himself, 
was slain, for the sins of the whole world— save the Great 
Jehovah who planned the redemption. I rejoice daily that I am 
made wise even at this day, and yet my heart grows sad when I 
think of the years that I have been led by the blind. Why was I 



not permitted to know sooner? Your book MILLENNIAL 
DAWN came to me last Fall-the first hint I ever had of such a 
work. I received it on a Saturday evening, commenced to read it 
immediately and never laid it aside, except when obliged, until 
finished. Its truth captured my heart at once; forthwith I 
withdrew from the Presbyterian Church where I had so long 
been groping in the dark for the truth, and found it not. 

The DAWN came as a light in a dark place and you cannot 
know the eagerness with which I have devoured all that I could 
get of your writings. My first impulse was to deliver the tidings 
to all I knew, but especially immediate friends, that they too 
might be made wise, and have cause for rejoicing; but they one 
and all discarded the book and TOWER, as the theories of one 
man trying to start a new religious sect for his own 
aggrandizement, I suppose, instead of an effort to place us upon 
the original Christian basis, which Christ and his apostles 
outlined for all the true followers down to the end of the age. I 
sometimes grow discouraged; still I cannot help rejoicing that I 
have found the true version of the Scriptures, even if others will 
not accept. I cannot tell you how happy it makes me. I try to do 
what good I can, but when others deem me crazy or lost to all 
my former senses, where is my influence? 

I long to tell you all that is in my heart, of joys and hopes, but 
cannot at present. May God bless you through time and eternity, 
which I know he will do; but what will become of such as I, who 
have never known the Scriptures aright, nor even concerning our 
Lord's presence and the harvest, until so late. 

[This must not discourage us; we must expect just such results; 
they were promised. (Matt. 10:22; 1 Cor. 4:10.) Even our Lord's 
faithfulness made him of "no reputation." And Paul and the 
early church were "counted fools for Christ's sake." Yea, and 
whosoever will live Godly, in this present time, "shall suffer 
persecution" of some sort— according to the degree of 
civilization by which surrounded. While pitying their blindness 
and longing for the clearer, fuller dawn, when all shall see 
clearly, let us rejoice that we are counted worthy of an 
experience so much like that of our dear Redeemer. -EDITOR.] 

Still, I will praise him. I cannot help being so late to know the 
truth. For many years have I prayed and striven to lead a 

R1110:page8 

Christian life, but with only blind leaders what could I know? I 
blush to think of my ignorance. Your last book is so conclusive 
in all its proofs; who can doubt them? I must read it over and 
over again. I do not feel able to say much to others, until I have 
informed myself more perfectly. How chilling such retorts as the 
following: After reading all the chronological facts and 
Scripture bearing upon them, my heart was so filled with joy 
that I mentioned them to a friend of Christ's coming, when he 



remarked, He has set the time, has he? I cannot tell you, how it 
makes me feel. You do not set the time; 'tis God, and 
undoubtedly there is a set time, as all will yet see. 

With much love to you and your beloved helpmeet, I remain 
sincerely, 

Your Sister in Christ,

[Be of good courage, dear Sister, consider that the readiness of 
heart in which the truth found you, indicates that you were a true 
child of God before, and that it was sent to you by our Master; 
because, blinded and starved by human tradition, you were 
hungering and thirsting for righteousness [truth]. He now invites 
all such to be filled, both with the truth and with its spirit. What 
VOL. II. has made clear to you regarding the "harvest," etc., will 
be emphasized and clinched by VOL. III. in due time, making 
very clear the importance of the work of harvest. Meantime 
enter as fully as possible into the present blessed opportunities 
of service, making known the good tidings of great joy— The 
Plan of the Ages— whenever and wherever you can find or make 
opportunity. The results to you will be deeper joy and clearer 
insight, whether they hear or whether they reject. Faithfulness in 
receiving and confessing the light, as God supplies it, is 
imperative. Yet, let us be "wise;" let us feed the "milk" before 
the "strong meat." 

"The Plan of the Ages" (Vol. I.) should, therefore, always be 
presented first, before any mention is made of "The Time at 
hand." If they cannot digest the "milk," we may be sure they 
cannot the "meat," and the result would be only the greater and 
stronger opposition. Remember how our Lord exemplified this 
in his teaching; he even said to his followers once, "I have many 
things to tell you, but ye cannot bear them now." To us, as well 
as the apostles, our Lord's words apply: "Be ye wise as serpents, 
and harmless as doves. "-EDITOR.]

GENTLEMEN:-I came into possession of a copy of 
MILLENNIAL DAWN VOL. I., The Plan of the Ages, a short 
time ago, which I read with a great deal more than ordinary 
interest. Though there are a few paragraphs I do not altogether 
comprehend, yet as a whole, it has given me an entire new 
channel of thought relative to the impenetrable future. I 
carefully compared all your Bible references, and became so 
favorably impressed with your version of Scripture and so 
hungry for more of the same kind of spiritual food that I feel I 
must have the second volume. 



I have enlisted in the service of the Lord Jesus Christ for the 
remainder of my life; and it is my heart's desire to be even more 
faithful to Him than I was to the stars and stripes during the dark 
days of the rebellion. Oh! how I should love to be one of that 
"Little Flock," one of the Lord's daring soldiers, to help bind the 
great dragon, Satan, the vile enemy of all those faithful to the 
Lord. 

Please let me know if you have any other religious literature. 
Very Respectfully, Yours in the Love of Jesus.

MY DEAR SON:-Your welcome letter is received. We are glad 
to know that you are in usual health, and I trust and pray that 
your labors are still being blessed to yourselves as well as all 
others who have ears to hear and eyes to see. 

As for myself I have been greatly blessed by the reading of 
Vols. I. and II. of DAWN. I have just finished reading Vol. n. 
and I feel that it would be impossible to ignore the truthfulness 
of these wonderful developments. The types and antitypes of the 
Jewish and Gospel dispensations, The Times and Seasons, the 
Manner of our Lord's Second Advent, Earth's Great Jubilee, 
Parallel Dispensations, Elias shall First Come, and the 
wonderful unfolding concerning Antichrist, the Man of Sia- 
mese contain very much that I had never fully understood 
before. I am perfectly astonished at the array of Scriptural 
argument to substantiate every position taken; and I can only 
say, To God let us give all the praise. It seems to me that no one 
can overthrow these arguments and conclusions except they 
deny the truth of the Scriptures. 

I am very sorry to know that Brother Clowes is so very low. 
Possibly before this time he has gone to his rest. But his works 
will follow after; and may we also be ready, for we know not 
when our change may come. We are all in usual health at 
present, and hope you are all well. Joined by Wife and Mabel in 
love to you all, I am your loving Father, 

J. L. RUSSELL. 

[The above is from the Editor's aged Father, whose 
appreciation, love and zeal for the truth, seem to grow with his 
years. Now in his seventy-fifth year, he is more and more 
seeking to let the light shine, loaning DAWN, tracts, etc. His 
fellowship is highly appreciated. 

On Januaryy 25th our dear Brother Clowes, with whom some of 
our readers were acquainted, having heard him preach the word 
of truth at various points near Pittsburgh, passed away full of 
triumphant faith and glorious hope. "Blessed are the dead who 



die in the Lord from henceforth. Yea, saith the spirit, they shall 
rest from their labors, but their works follow with them."]

DEAR BROTHER AND SISTER RUSSELL:- I would like to 
tell you how much we enjoy the Second Volume but haven't the 
words. I shall be very glad when the next Vol. comes, but expect 
to read this over many times yet; and having the "Sure Word of 
Prophecy," there is no lack of food, until it is ready. 

I do hope you may find it desirable, to publish this Vol. in paper 
binding and to help the work I will do what I can. 

It is true that comparatively few are yet interested, but some of 
this sowing is for the future harvest and the truth must be first 
made known before it can be received. Our heathens are at our 
own doors. "Who is blind but my servant?" I send a check for 
$30, toward the fund for paper bound "Time at Hand." If you do 
not think it best, however, or if means are not sufficient, use the 
money in any way that you deem proper or in the Tract Fund. 

In your last you expressed the desire to hear how the good work 
prospered with us. Although "our report" is looked upon as 
foolishness, and ourselves as deluded, I do not at all feel 
disheartened, for the rumblings of our chariot wheels sound all 
around. The papers have to announce sermons upon special 
subjects by the different pastors to notify the people of very 
interesting themes, viz., Immortality, Future Punishment, etc. 
DAWN has stirred up the waters any way! If none believe, it is 
not surprising, no man has helped them yet to get into the water 
and be healed, but they will soon get help and then they will 
proclaim the goodness of the Lord. (Psa. 107:10-16.) The 
greatest obstacle in the way is the denunciations of the clergy. 
They tell their sheep this is poisonous food and they are so 
ignorant of God's Word, that they are afraid of the unpardonable 
sin if they dare to read for themselves and trust to the spirit of 
truth to interpret for them. Truly "they sit in the shadow of death 
and are bound with fetters of iron and brass. But when they cry 
unto the Lord he will hear and deliver them. " "Wait upon the 
Lord and ye shall see his salvation, " is good enough cheer. In 
most kind remembrance and love in Christ, Your fellow- 
workers, 

DR. and MRS. ABIEL BOWEN. 



DEAR BRO. RUSSELL:-I enclose a letter which is so full of 
interest and encouragement to me, that I thought it might be 
interesting to you also. I am sorry to say that I am unable at 
present to do much in the cause of truth, as I cannot leave home, 
but expect to go on the road again about April 1st. Then I shall 
use every possible opportunity to distribute Arp tracts and sell as 
many DAWNS as I can. Yours, L. A. PATCHEN. 



DEAR BRO. PATCHEN:-Your welcome letter at hand, I was 
glad to hear from and get your opinion of DAWN Vol. n. 

Mr. Tavender called about two weeks ago and said so much 
about the book, that I sent right away for a copy and have read it 
through, some parts twice. 

I feel that Mr. Russell has been entrusted with the key which has 
unlocked the prophecies. It seems that the blessed time we have 
been so long praying for is very near, even at the door. I am 
trying to spread these truths as much as I am able. I talk to every 
one I can reach. Does it seem possible that 25 years more will 
see evil overthrown and the "King of Righteousness" reigning in 
the Earth? Will there then be no more, agonizing wives in behalf 
of drinking husbands? No longer shall mothers on bended knees 
cry to God: how long, O, how long! 

Thank God, the clouds are parting, and we begin to catch 
glimpses of the great plan which was laid before the foundations 
of the earth. Evil has had its day. The good have been powerless 
to turn back the tide of wrong-doing which has flooded the 
whole earth. How we have suffered on account of evil, but could 
not see why we were not able to subdue wrong. I have verily 
thought myself to blame for many things which I now see I was 
powerless to control. 

I trust I shall ever feel grateful to you, brother, for calling my 
attention to these things, when in agony of soul, God was 
leading me through affliction away from the love of earthly 
things, that I might be prepared with those who love Him for 
that rest that remaineth for the people of God. I am trying to 
spread the truth and with some success, apparently. 

Mr. P. sends kind respects. Yours in Christ, 

MRS. J. H P .

PREACHING THE GOSPEL BY MAIL. 

The Missionary Envelopes are not so generally used as we 
could wish. They are neat, cheap, and certainly attract attention 
and do good. Every letter of business or friendship we write, 
should go in one of these envelopes, accompanied by an Arp 
Tract or Old Theology Tract, or both, as judgment may dictate, 
and thus carry the good tidings in addition to what you write. 
We have already printed about 80,000 but the quantity should be 
a million or more by this time. 

The price is low, merely designed to cover cost, postage, etc. ; 
but if our readers or their friends use a cheaper grade of 
envelopes and buy in large quantities (5000 to 20,000 at a time), 
for use in mailing circulars, etc., we will be pleased to supply 
such at a rate that will correspond with the price of a cheaper 
grade —at a loss— in order to do mission work in this way. 

But, see that you send no orders from disreputable or dishonest 
firms who might use the envelopes because attractive— whose 
dealings might reflect against the truth.

"THE TIME IS AT HAND." 

(DAWN VOL. E.) 

Did you receive a copy? We sent one to each WATCH 
TOWER subscriber who had renewed for 1889, so far as we 
know, as a special number for the months of April and May 
combined. 

We mailed it to all of the "Lord's Poor List" who have requested 
the TOWER for the present year (See Terms above), as well as 
to all who have paid for this year; and also, to all who requested 
that the paper be continued to them and who hoped to be able to 
pay for it during the year. 

If any who renewed their subscription, in any of these ways, 
failed to get the book, they should at once drop us a postal-card, 
that any mistakes may be rectified. 

In our March issue we promised this book ("The Time is at 
Hand"), without extra charge, as part of this year's WATCH 
TOWER, to those only whose subscriptions should be received 
before April 1 . But as we find this left too short a time for some, 
especially our Foreign and Pacific coast readers, we have 
concluded to leave the offer open until August 1 . next. 
Therefore all whose subscriptions for the TOWER for 1889 are 
received up to that date, will be supplied with this book without 
extra charge. 

Friends of the truth can therefore bestir themselves among those 
to whom they have sold or loaned DAWN VOL. I. and take 
subscriptions for the TOWER for 1889 with VOL. II. included 
for 50 cents; or, "The Time at Hand" alone, for 25 cents.

VIEW FROM THE TOWER. 

Many of the saints abroad, who could not meet with us here at 
the celebration of the Lord's Supper and subsequent meetings, 
have written requesting a full report of the proceedings. Such a 
report we would like to give, but to do so fully is impossible. If 
pen could portray the glow and warmth of Christian love that 
illuminated every countenance, the heartiness of the hand- 
shaking, the tones of good cheer in the words of greeting, and 
the fervent farewells and God bless you and speed your work, at 
parting, then we might give a fuller report. But all this can be 
better imagined than described. It was a season which afforded a 
blessed foretaste of the joys of the gathering of the church 
triumphant, when all the faithful sowers and all the faithful 
reapers shall rejoice together,-when the first-fruits of the 
harvest have all been gathered in. 



The number present from abroad was the largest we have yet 
had, twelve states and Canada being represented, viz., 
Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, Illinois, Virginia, West 
Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Connecticut, Maryland, 
Michigan, New Jersey and some from far off Manitoba. Among 
the number present were six who had been ministers in various 
denominations of the church nominal, whose eyes have been 
anointed with the eye-salve of harvest truth, and who have left 
title and parsonage and salary and friends and reputation and all, 
to henceforth preach the glorious gospel of the blessed God; to 
reap in the whitened fields, esteeming the reproaches of Christ 
as greater riches than the treasures of the world. 

But we, as usual, recognized all the consecrated ones as 
ministers (servants) of Christ, of his church and his truth, and 
made no difference, one way or another, because of past 
prominence in error. Remembering our Lord's words, "All ye 
are brethren and one is your master, even Christ," we 
endeavored, according to Paul's suggestion, to know no man 
after the flesh, but recognized each and all according to their 
possession and manifestation of the spirit of Christ-the spirit of 

Rllll :pagel 

the truth. All engaged in sacrificing their human natures and 
interests (much or little— their all), in the service of the truth, on 
the altar of love, we heartily recognize as priests— of the royal 
priesthood under Christ Jesus the High Priest of our profession 
or order. 

With extra seating accommodations, our meeting hall was filled 
to the extent of its capacity, about 225 being present to 
commemorate the Lord's Supper. The first meeting, at 10 A.M. 
Sunday, April 14th, was of a social character, and the time was 
fully occupied with short addresses from various brethren, 
telling of the condition and prospects of the great harvest work 
in their places of labor, the helps and hindrances they meet, the 
sustaining grace they find, the good hope they have, the joy and 
peace they have personally found in believing the truth; with 
interesting incidents of personal experience as to how the 
harvest message reached them or some others, and of experience 
in the work as to how God had verified to them so many of his 
rich promises, such as, "I will give you a mouth and wisdom that 
none of your adversaries can gainsay or resist;" "Open thy 
mouth wide and I will fill it;" "Whosoever will do his will shall 
know of the doctrine; " "My grace shall be sufficient for thee; " 
"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the age," etc. 

This meeting encroached somewhat on the noon hour, and yet 
before two o'clock the company was again in place for the 
afternoon session, at which, Brother Wallace illustrated his 
method of presenting the outlines of the Plan of the Ages to the 
audiences he meets. Bro. W. was a travelling lecturer and 



professor of phrenology before the harvest truth reached him. 
When he received it, he began to mix with phrenology the good 
tidings of great joy for all people; and now as the truth has 
reached his mind and heart more fully, it has so quickened his 
zeal in the Master's service that the old profession is almost 
crowded out, except as it serves to pave the way for the glad 
tidings which now fills his heart and overflows at every 
opportunity. His talent is for public speaking, and after every 
lecture the DAWN is presented as a further elaboration of the 
great subject to which he has called attention. To illustrate his 
lectures, he has had the Chart of the Ages (from DAWN Vol. I.) 
enlarged and painted on canvas, and ornamented with pictorial 
illustrations of the various ages; and above all a beautiful 
symbolic sky representing the changing conditions of the 
various dispensations, from Eden to Paradise restored. God bless 
him, and may his talent never be turned aside from the service of 
the great cause. 

The address by Bro. Wallace was followed by a discourse on the 
subject of Baptism and its import, after which at 4:30 P.M. the 
congregation adjourned to the baptistry of the "Disciples' 
church," which is kindly placed at our service, where that most 
impressive and solemn ceremony, symbolic of death and burial 
to the world, was performed. Twenty-two persons— ten of the 
brethren and twelve sisters-symbolized in that water-burial their 
own deadness to self and sin and to the various aims and hopes 
of the human nature— as dead to the world— to henceforth live as 
new creatures in Christ, making God's service, the service of his 
revealed plan, their chief business: this, as well as the grand 
consummation of resurrection in the actual likeness of the Lord, 
being pictured in their being raised up from the water. This 
solemn, symbolic burial-service, with its hymns of consecration 
and faith and hope and triumph through Christ, its offering of 
the right hand of fellowship one to another, and its prayers for 
the divine blessing and aid, was one never to be forgotten. 

In the evening at 7:30 the assembly was again convened, for the 
solemn and impressive celebration of the Lord's Memorial 
Supper. While partaking of the emblems of our Lord's broken 
body, and blood shed for the remission of sins, the significance 
of the emblems and of our partaking of them was shown; and 
our hearts held sweet communion with our dear Redeemers- 
praising and thanking him for his loving sacrifice on our behalf 
and pledging ourselves anew to his cause and to sacrifice 
ourselves for it now, in anticipation of his promise that such 
shall share also his nature, his glory and his great work of 
restoring all things by and by. 

This simple service, so often particularly described in the 
Tower, lasted until 9:30 P.M., and closed as did the first 
occasion: we sang a hymn and went to our homes, meditating on 
our dear Redeemer's last night of sorrow in the Garden of 



Gethsemane and the inestimable value of his death, as our 
redemption price, 

Rllll : page 2 

both from sin and its death penalty. 

On Monday at 10 A.M. meetings for Bible study commenced 
which continued without intermission, except for meals and 
sleep, until Thursday night. The subject of the harvest-the 
harvest work and opportunities, and the time, etc., connected 
with it, and past leadings, present indications, and future 
prospects from the prophetic standpoint- was the almost 
continuous theme of all these meetings. Questions of almost 
every conceivable bearing upon the subject were brought 
forward and carefully considered in the light of the Word of 
God. These topics you would like us to present here at length, 
and we would enjoy doing so, but it would be impossible. It 
would fill a book. However, these subjects will be still more 
fully elaborated in DAWN Vol. IE., now in course of 
preparation. It is expedient that Vol. II. and especially Vol. I. be 
fully digested by all of you, first, to prepare each for the still 
further unfoldings of the wonderful plan of our God. One point, 
however, is briefly treated in this paper under the caption- "The 
Door was Shut;" because the deeply interested have already 
given Vol. n. one reading, and in order that such might not be 
discouraged by supposing that the "door was shut" when the 
high calling ceased, in 1881. 

All that we can tell you concerning those meetings is, that 
though brain and body grew weary, from the continuous sitting 
and continuous thinking, the hearts of all grew warmer, and zeal 
came to a glowing heat, as all seemed to grasp clearly the 
conviction that the time for service is short; that we are even 
now in the "eleventh hour," and that the night wherein no man 
can work is drawing rapidly on. The Master's voice was heard 
saying, "Go ye also into my vineyard and whatsoever is right I 
will give you" (Matt. 20:4); and many were the resolves to lay 
aside worldly aims and schemes and to bend every energy and 
concentrate effort to do "harvest" work under the direction of 
the Chief Reaper, our Lord, in the ways he has been, and now is, 
so generally and widely opening up. Each seemed to resolve to 
show the Master his love, and his appreciation of the privilege 
of being a co-worker, by redoubling his efforts. 

Methods of work were discussed at two meetings, as well as late 
into the nights. While public speaking, lecturing on the Chart of 
the Ages, etc., was conceded to be good, where a talent for it is 
possessed and an opportunity could be had, it was nevertheless 
conceded that the Lord is making use of very few who have this 
talent specially, and is opening very few opportunities for labor 
of that sort in the present harvest. It was conceded that 
preaching by the printed word is the agency chiefly being used 



and blessed in this "harvest," and more than all others, DAWN 
Vol. I. Brothers Adamson, Rogers, Hickey, Weber and Bryan- 
who have sold many thousands of copies of "THE PLAN OF 
THE AGES," encouraged all by their reports of the Lord's 
blessing and the good results following to those who purchased 
of them. They urged and encouraged others to enter this 
wonderful field of labor which the Lord has opened up, and in 
which he provides abundantly, though not without weariness, 
and gives opportunity for them to deny themselves many of the 
advantages and comforts of a settled home life. They thanked 
God, too, that he had made provision for all the laborers now, so 
that they need not depend upon alms, nor upon collections, but 
while they are giving away thousands of tracts and selling a 
book containing sixteen sermons (chapters) on the real good 
tidings of great joy, at half what any other book on religious 
subjects is sold for,— yet under the Lord's gracious provision 
(through the TRACT FUND allowance of one half of all 
receipts for expenses) they were enabled to feed and clothe 
themselves decently (not elegantly) and to thus "provide things 
honest in the sight of all men. " 

As a result, several new missionaries started forth with DAWN 
and tracts, and good reports are daily coming in. As an 
illustration, three brethren full of zeal went to Detroit, Mich., 
where they distributed about 3000 Arp Tracts and sold about 
1400 copies of The Plan of the Ages-DAWN Vol. I.-in four 
weeks after the meeting. 

We wish all could have been here to have enjoyed the liberty 
and harmony, and to have become personally acquainted with 
each other as the Lord's members and servants, and to learn 
something of the Lord's special and general dealing with all. As 
some expressed it, it was a foretaste of the general assembling of 
the Church- when all the faithful shall meet with their Lord as 
well as with each other to recount God's favors in the past and to 
discuss the great work of restitution then to be ushered in. 

We need not tell you that the dear scattered ones, less privileged 
than ourselves in the matter of this meeting, were remembered 
by us all, and that rich spiritual blessings upon you all were 
desired and invoked. And we are glad to note from very many 
letters received, that our Lord's Supper was so generally 
commemorated by those who love him and appreciate his great 
sacrifice for the sins of the church and the world, and we are 
glad, too, that so many of you were praying God's blessing upon 
our meeting here. No wonder we were blessed; and you, too, 
would share it while generously asking it upon us.

EXTRACTS FROM 
INTERESTING LETTERS.

Detroit, Mich., May 2nd '89. 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-It is very encouraging to hear 
from you occasionally, if only a few lines. I would no doubt 
write more and much oftener, if I thought there would be 
anything of interest to you. 

Of one thing I am quite sure: If you were to be in the 
colporteur's place for a short time, you would have still stronger 
evidence of the great work being done and that is to be done by 
DAWN. Even Herod, I think, would say-- "I find no fault." If the 
succeeding volumes are as worthy as the first and second, will 
the Lord not use it even unto the end of the Millennial age? It 
helps to open the eyes of the blind, to set the prisoners free, and 
to cause all to see the beauty of his Word. 

As to the work here, I trust the result will be acceptable to the 
Lord. The towers of Babylon are very high in this place, but 
there are also not a few "little ones." These, we trust, are being 
found. We, in all, have about 700 names now, and hope to take 
three or four hundred more. Brothers Weimar and Leigh are 
each getting along nicely. We have little meetings of our own, 
which of course are encouraging to all. One who has been in this 
post of service for some time can find many little things to 
encourage a beginner. In working smaller towns it would be 
hardly advisable for three to go together, so we were glad to 
hear from the brother in Ohio, wanting a companion. 

We think we shall be able to finish the work here, for the 
present, about the 1 8th of this month. Please have a box 
containing three or four hundred DAWNS ready to ship to us on 
Wednesday, if you can. I am using the Arp Tracts freely and am 
sure they are doing a good work. 

I feel that we should get over the cities of the several states as 
fast as possible. Good reports are being heard from places where 
DAWN was introduced over a year since. Remember me when 
you can find a little time for writing. S. D. ROGERS.

Detroit, Mich., May 12th '89. 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-Your lines came duly to hand. I 
rejoice to know that you are praying the dear Lord's blessing 
upon me and all. Through the favor of God I am getting along 
pretty well in the blessed harvest work. Though my feet through 
the day get sore from walking so much, yet in the morning they 
are generally restored. I think by and by it will be better as I 
work myself in. I am determined to endure. My heart's desire is 
to esteem all things a loss, on account of the excellency of the 



knowledge of the Anointed Jesus, my Lord. And with my whole 
being I do desire to press along the line towards the prize of the 
high calling. My sales for the first ten days run as follows: -22,

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-I am just writing to encourage 
you by telling you how we are getting on. The other two are 
going to make their final deliveries Friday and Saturday and 
then leave for some northern town. I do not make mine till the 
20th and 21st. 

I am slowly but surely improving. At first I could not sell more 
than sixteen, but now get up to nineteen and twenty-one, and I 
can assure you no one is more pleased than 1. 1 have not been 
getting over the ground as fast as the others and have hardly 
averaged as many as Bro. W., but I am very thorough and sell 
more in a given space. I shall perhaps work south from here. 

Last Monday I delivered a lot of books, about 88, and as I was 
passing along one of the streets this evening, a lady who was 
sitting at the window reading her DAWN saw me. I saw her face 
light up, and she rose, and I waited till she came out. She invited 
me in and I had a two-hours talk with her and her estimable 
husband. Like all the earnest ones she was so delighted with the 
truth, she wanted every one to have it, and had talked to her 
neighbors so that two more wanted it. A few grains of wheat like 
this pays for all we have done here. By God's favor I want to 
spend the balance of my time ministering to the saints. 

There is also a gentleman here who has withdrawn from the 
sects after reading the TOWER for some time, though all his 
family are opposed to him and ashamed of him. 

I think my experience would help any of the colporteurs who 
need a word of encouragement. I don't think any one would have 
more to overcome from within than 1. 1 am Yours in Christian 
Love,

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-As proposed, I delivered the 
DAWNS in Noblesville on Monday last and canvassed in 
Anderson for 4-1/2 days. Have not counted the names, but think 
between 125 and 150 names, beside about 30 sold out of hand. 

I met one deeply interested reader at Anderson and had a good 
talk, and for more of it he invited me to stop over night with him 
when I return Monday to deliver DAWNS. 

At Anderson I put the delivery on the first Monday after 
receiving the names. The place is full of spiritualism and the 
"blind guides" call it "nonsense," but do not attempt to tell why 
it is nonsense, and are helpers. 

Although the weather is hot, I have good health and speak in the 
Park here on Sunday. Also could get a church at Noblesville and 
they would like lectures at Anderson in their fine park. 
However, both canvassing and lecturing going on together 
(especially lectures on week-day evenings) seem too much for 
me in hot weather. 

I am rejoiced to see the quickening effect of DAWN VOL. II. 
All consecrated persons and even others who read intelligently 
the first Volume are greatly moved and influenced by the 
statements of Vol. II. Many have been impelled to take a more 
decided interest in the great truths of both Volumes and have 
taken a firmer stand in advocating the truth openly and 
fearlessly. To this I attribute the intense interest and increased 
numbers attending our late meeting in Allegheny. 

I have a letter from Sister Ray who states that 25 or 30 are 
reported as having left the churches in the western part of 
Springfield. She will when able visit some of them. 

With kindest remembrance and love to you and Sister R., joined 
by Mrs. A.,

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-It is with extreme regret that I 
feel obliged to give up meeting you and many brethren on 
Sunday, April 14th. I have earnestly desired to go, and prayed 
that the Lord would open up a way for me to bear the additional 
expense, but I see no prospect now. It is not that I value $25 or 
even $50 so highly that I cannot part with it; but I am under 
heavy obligations, in part for others, and I am not my own until 
this is accomplished. So I must deny myself what would be to 
me a great privilege and blessing. Well, a time will come, I am 
pretty certain, when I can go without loss to any one. My heart 
and sympathies are with you all in this glorious reunion, where 



there will be a taste of heavenly joy. I shall calculate on next 
year for a certainty, if alive. 

May light and joy, more and greater, go out from the efforts you 
and the brethren are continuing to put forth, to the praise of the 
great God and our glorious Redeemer. 

I will write again after a time. For the fourth time I am going 
through Vol. I. You would be surprised to see the marks of 
emphasis and the underscoring on every page. In this way I get 
the essence or spirit of each thought, at a glance. Sometimes 
perusing a sentence six or eight times before marking. The 
Ransom is a fact with me. 

Vol. II., so far (only half through it), is a rich mine, a treasure 
house of truth. To me, it is giving more conviction than anything 
before it. The light is becoming bright! Your chronology is 
extremely convincing and the time periods wonderful in their 
completeness. No "chance" in this! I shall make full notes in my 
large margin Bible, from Vol. II. for future use. I rejoice with 
you more and more. 

Yours, in Christ's service, B. P . 



P.S.-"01d Theology Tracts:" Put me down for 1000 copies 
quarterly (4000 tracts) $25, of which I will use 200 copies to 
commence with, the balance to go as you find workers to use 
them. And with first lot please send 200 Arp Slips and 100 
envelopes. I shall order some DAWNS soon. 

Ohio, May 12th '89. 

DEAR BRETHREN:-The one hundred copies of VOL. II. came 
to-day. Since my last I had a little experience: I failed utterly to 
get a house of any kind to speak in the first of last week. The 
M.E. church, though used for anything to raise money for that 
sect, is not let out for anything outside the denomination. The 
Disciple house had never been in the habit of being let out, and 
did not wish to change its custom. It is ruled by one man whose 
only merit is that by horse trading he has more money than any 
other member of the congregation, and is opposed to 
instrumental music at home and in the church, and the members 
bow to him for his lucre. The trustees granted the use of the 
school house, but the teacher, a narrow and bigoted U.P., 
objected, and my way was blocked in that direction. But I was 
bound to be heard, so on Tuesday I had a bell rung over town 
calling meeting in front of one of the vacant store rooms. I had a 
splendid and attentive audience, and made such a good 
impression that the 

[Letters continued on 8th page.] 

page 8 

[Interesting Letters Continued] 

[FROM PAGE 2.] 



people were much displeased with their rulers, and during the 
remainder of the week murmured against them. The following 
evenings were too cold for out-door meetings, but the landlord 
of the hotel where I am stopping is friendly to my work and has 
been very helpful to me. On Friday evening, he put his parlor at 
my service and invited about thirty of the best citizens to hear a 
parlor lecture on The Plan. The Chart was stretched against the 
wall and fully illuminated, and the lecture met with such hearty 
approval that all present are anxious to hear further of "this 
way. " One lady present kindly offered her parlor for the next 
lecture. But public sentiment grew loud in favor of public 
lectures, and this week I have the school house. Last night I 
lectured to an audience of 36, and distributed a number of 
Towers and Tracts. This will be kept up all week. I put an "Arp" 
in every Tower, Tract or book I give, out and before the week is 
out, the entering wedge of present truth will be in every house in 
this vicinity. 

On last Sabbath evening I gave a full summary of the Allegheny 
meeting to a large audience at P. Our friends are alive there. In 
view of my coming the hall was scrubbed and whitewashed, and 
a vase of beautiful flowers was placed on the stand. A 
Presbyterian Minister from Delaware, Ohio, was one of my 
hearers, and was favorably impressed. I go back there next 
Sunday. The friends talk of starting a Sunday Bible class in 
order to search the Word for the whole truth. The Lord is 
leading them. 

The tract you sent me before the meeting, I at once sent to a 
Mrs. A., and she gave it to Mr. R. He immediately sent to your 
office for more and has been mailing them in DAWN envelopes 
to all his Presbyterian brethren. Thus the truth spreads. Let us 
praise the Lord. Regards to all. Yours in the Love of the Truth, 

W. A. WALLACE.

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-You will be glad to know that 
Brothers Page, Dixon, and Dickinson met with us at our home 
Sunday, April 14th. In the morning we considered the Passover 
historically, reading Gieke's account of the celebration as 
observed in Christ's time, and noted that the early Christians in 
Palestine and Syria commemorated the Lord's Supper on 
Passover anniversaries only. In the afternoon we studied the 
symbolism of the Passover, and of its successor, the Lord's 
Supper. In the evening we participated in the broken body and 
shed blood, in a manner far more impressive and real, than if our 
business-like Brother Page had been retired to give place to 
surpliced and stoled priest, backed by the transubstantiation 
dogma: and my writing table, covered with a white cloth, and 
furnished with plain glass service (emblematic of purity and 
innocence) had been supplanted by a gorgeous altar, fenced off 



by the kneeling rail, beyond which the "laity" dare not trespass. 
We had no costly organ, no robed boy choir, but there was a 
harmony and peace in our hearts the world cannot give or take 
away. 

Your Brother in Christ, W. M. WRIGHT. 

New Orleans, La. 

C. T. RUSSELL, DEAR BROTHER:-I greet you with much 
love and joy in the Lord. VOL. II. of "DAWN" has indeed been 
greatly instrumental in strengthening and confirming 
convictions that the day of the Lord is present, that we are 
indeed in the harvest of the "Gospel age," when his chosen are 
being gathered, "as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day 
that he is among his sheep that are scattered" (Ezek. 34:12), 
when the "Abomination that maketh desolate" is visibly being 
consumed by the bright shining of his presence. 

I must say that I rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorious as I 
am learning more about that new song which no man could learn 
but the hundred and forty and four thousand. I rejoice even, 
seeing the opposition against the truth, that is still permitted to 
try our faith. Many here are getting interested, and 
MILLENNIAL DAWN has many friends and advocates. The 
truth is beginning to take hold in this city now, though I seemed 
to be a lone witness for the truth in New Orleans for the last six 
or seven years. 

I distribute tracts on Sundays, to congregations as they dismiss. I 
have not yet been molested— with the exception of being asked 
by pastors, with threats of arrest, to cease giving these things to 
their flocks. The non-interference must have been providential, 
as I now learn that a city ordinance, forbidding the distribution 
of tracts, circulars, etc., has been rigidly enforced, in this place, 
during the last six months. The last large lot of Arp Slips are 
now nearly out. About 50 copies of DAWN are out, being read 
and re-read. The rest have been sold. Some are beginning to join 
us in singing the Song of Moses and the Lamb. Many more I 
hope will be "sealed" while this "great calm before the storm"- 
as it were (Rev. 7:1) -lasts. May the Lord strengthen us, to 
faithfully improve the opportunities. 

Yours in fellowship, C. A. S . 

Minneapolis. 

MY BELOVED BRO.:— Some way I am kept at high pressure in 
my work all the time these days. Yet I bless and thank my Lord. 
He honors me by permitting me to "sup" frequently with Him, 
and to keep constantly doing a little something in his service. 

Please send me 40 "DAWNS" No. I, and I will remit the first of 
the next month. I send nearly all the DAWNS I dispose of by 
mail, to parties in whom I have found a disposition to listen, and 



who promise to read. Generally I present the work with my 
compliments, as it takes better and attracts more attention. Then 
when forwarding the book, I write the party to whom it is sent, a 
letter such as seems proper under the circumstances. 

You can put me down for $50, which I will send you about 
October 1st, '89, toward paying expense of publishing DAWN 
VOL. II. in paper as a number of the TOWER. I am glad that all 
the brethren can thus have it, and now see the way clear to make 
this arrangement with you, and joy in the fact that the Master 
will allow me to so pledge myself. Please send me 100 
Missionary Envelopes, and about 500 Arp Slips. 

Yours in service and much Christian love, 

W. E. P .

CHRIST ALL IN ALL. 



In Christ all fulness dwells: from him proceeds 
All that fall'n man, poor, wretched, guilty, needs. 
In him the contrite, bruised in spirit find 
Whate'er can heal the sorrows of the mind- 
Forgiving love, that saves from blank despair, 
Rich grace, that banishes each anxious care, 
Soft pity, that relieves the bursting sigh, 
And truth, revealing joys that never die. 

Thrice happy they, who to his word attend, 
His favor seek, and on his strength depend: 
'Tis their's to know his heart-consoling voice, 
To share his smile, and in his name rejoice; 
To them, reclaimed in mercy from the fall 
And heavenward marching, Christ is all in all: 
In want, their treasure-in distress, their stay- 
In gloom, their day-spring— vigor, in decay— 
'Mid foes, their guard-in solitude, their guest- 
In storms, their hiding-place— in toils, their rest- 
In bonds, their freedom— their relief, in pain- 
In life, their glory-and in death, their gain. " 



R1112:page3 



"AND THE DOOR WAS SHUT." 

Many who have read DAWN VOL. II.- "The Time is at 
Hand"-are anxiously inquiring whether they are too late for 
admittance to the kingdom class: whether the door of 
opportunity is yet open, or whether it closed when the high 



calling ceased, in 1881. We answer, Though the "call" has 
ceased, the "door" is not yet shut. The "call" and the "door" are 
distinct and separate. 

The Scriptures teach that God fore-ordained or predestinated 
that a fixed, definite number should be selected from among 
men to constitute the Bride of Christ and be his joint-heir in the 
great work of bestowing the Millennial blessings upon the world 
in general. And this is perfectly reasonable. 

To secure this number, "many are called" or invited to pass an 
examination in the school of Christ, to prove their worthiness to 
be of that select and limited number. Only believers in Christ, 
only such as recognize him as their Redeemer, are "called" or 
invited to stand this examination under the promise of that great 
prize of joint-heirship with Christ; and all such believers were 
invited, from the day of Pentecost down to the time when 
enough had been called to complete the fixed number, which 
God had fore-ordained. Then, of course, the call to that honor 
and distinction must cease; for God would certainly not mislead 
any one nor promise "the great salvation" to a single individual 
more than the predestinated number. None shall have it to say 
that God invited him to run the race for the prize of the high 
calling and that after running faithfully he could not receive the 
reward because too many had been called and the fore-ordained 
number was more than supplied. 

First notice, that the close of the "call" is not the close of the 
race. Those who have been called, and who have accepted the 
conditions of the call and promised to "run" faithfully so as to 
obtain the prize, must be tested. And hence the fact that the 
general calling of new runners has ended, in no way ends the 
running of those who were called in time and who had 
consecrated themselves to the Lord's service before the call 
ceased. 

And the fact that you may only recently have come to a clear 
knowledge of the exceeding great and precious promises of the 
things which God hath in reservation for them that love him, 
does not prove that you were not called and accepted as a runner 
for this great prize long before you understood clearly how great 
and grand the prize is to be. In fact, not one who accepts the 
"call" is able at first to comprehend fully either the roughness 
and narrowness of the way, or the grandeur of the prize to be 
attained at its farther end. The clearness of our comprehension 
of the promises comes to us as the power of God working in us 
to strengthen us and enable us to overcome present obstacles, 
difficulties and trials. The exceeding great and precious 
promises are unfolded to us gradually, as we prove faithful and 
go on, in order that by these -by the strength and courage which 
they infuse- we might be enabled to so run as to obtain the 
promised prize.— 2 Pet. 1:4. 



The class to receive the prize is not only called and chosen 
(accepted), but also faithful. And though the general "call" has 
ceased, it is evident that the testing of the faithfulness of the 
called ones is not yet finished. The faithful are being marked, 
sealed, and separated from those who are unfaithful to their 
covenant of self-sacrifice; the wise virgins are being separated 
from the foolish ones, whose folly consists in supposing that 
they can run for and win the world's prizes of honor, wealth, 
etc., and at the same time run faithfully the race for the great 
prize, of glory, honor and immortality, -the very conditions of 
which render such a course impossible. 

When all the faithful "wise" virgins have been proved so, and 
have entered in to the joys of the Lord, the "door" of opportunity 
to become of that class will close, and no more will enter. When 
all the "wise" have entered in, the number predestinated will be 
complete; and then the Master will rise up and shut the door. 
(Luke 13:24,25; Matt. 25:10.) Our Lord himself tells us that then 
many will begin to see matters differently— to see what 
privileges and opportunities for sacrifice they once enjoyed and 
missed. But when they shall seek and knock, the Master will tell 
them, I do not recognize you as my Bride— she is complete and I 
have but one. But thank God, other Scriptures show that the 
foolish virgins, though thus rejected from the high calling for 
which their conduct, when on trial, will have proved them 
unworthy, will nevertheless be granted a lesser favor and will be 
known in a humbler capacity in the Lord's household. 

R1113:page3 

Before the door shuts, therefore, before the full number of the 
faithful is finished, let each strive to make his calling and 
selection sure; and to this end let us permit the Lord, by these 
precious promises and these explanatory and illustrative 
parables, to work in us to will and to do his good pleasure. 

But some will say, I am certain that I am not one of those called 
before the general "call" ceased in 1881, because I then was not 
only wholly ignorant of the deep things of God's promises, but 
more, I was wholly a stranger to God, and even an enemy of his, 
far from any covenant with him to do him service, and far from 
any such desires. But recently I came to know God at all, 
recently I took Christ's yoke upon me to learn of him, and still 
more recently I learned of the privilege of suffering with Christ 
now, in self-denial in his service, and that such joint-sacrificers 
are by and by to be made joint-inheritors with him in the 
glorious work of the Millennium. And now, after seeing these 
glories, and after admiring those precious things, and after 
setting myself to run this race for this wonderful prize, must I 
conclude that it is not open to me, because enough to fill the 
number had already been called? I would not think to change the 
divine arrangement, or to ask that another be added, beyond the 



limit determined by divine wisdom, but I shall feel keenly my 
misfortune. 

To such we answer (briefly here, more fully in DAWN Vol. m. 
now in preparation): Run on, dear brothers and sisters, your case 
is not so dark as it seems to you. Remember that if all who had 
accepted the call when it closed should prove faithful to their 
covenant, there would be none too many, but just enough. 
Remember, too, that your observation, as well as the Scriptures, 
indicates that of the "many" who accept the call "few" will be 
chosen, because but few prove faithful to their covenant when 
on trial. As one after another some of the "called" ones prove 
unfaithful, their places of labor and their crowns of reward are 
transferred to others. One of these places of labor and one of 
these crowns of reward may be transferred to you, and your 
name may be written on the scroll of life as a probationary 
member of the Bride of Christ, instead of one blotted out 
therefrom as unworthy.-See, Rev. 3:5; Heb. 12:23. 

It is already "the eleventh hour," the time for labor and sacrifice 
in the Lord's service is nearly ended, "the night cometh wherein 
no man can work," so if you see a "door" of opportunity, to 
labor for and serve the Lord and his truth, open before you, 
consider that the Master is saying to you, as in the parable, "Go 
ye also into my vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. " 
Remember that the reward is paid only to such as render service, 
and remember that while, as in the parable, the Lord does not 
promise the prize (the penny) as he did at the beginning, yet the 
parable shows that some thus admitted to the harvest work just 
at its close, just before the night when work will be impossible, 
will get the same reward as others —taking places and 
opportunities of labor left vacant by others. 

And what a lesson is here for such as have covenanted with the 
Lord to serve him first and chiefly, and who are neglecting his 
work to strive with time and thought and means for the transient 
joys and prizes which the world offers. These the Lord urges 
saying, "Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown 
of life; " "He that overcometh [who conquers in himself the spirit 
of the world] the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I 
will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will 
confess his name before my Father and before his holy 
servants." But, our Lord says also: "Hold fast that which thou 
hast, that no man take thy crown."— Rev. 2:10; 3:5,11. 



R1113:page3 



WHO SHOULD BE IMMERSED? 

In the Tower for May 1888 the subject of water baptism was 
examined. It was there shown that the real baptism is the burial 



of the human will into the will of Christ, complete consecration 
to him and his service; and that water baptism is but a symbol of 
this. The symbol should, therefore, be applied only to those 
justified believers in the ransom who have performed for 
themselves the actual immersion or consecration. And such 
should rejoice to fulfill the symbol as soon as they see its fitness 
and the Scriptural injunctions regarding it. 

But questions are raised by some which may be of interest to all, 
viz. : Is it proper that those who had not consecrated before the 
general call ceased in 1881, but who have since consecrated, 
should be immersed to symbolize their consecration? And, if at 
all, should it be "into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ?" 

We answer, Yes, to both questions. It is proper that all who 
come to a knowledge of the Lord should consecrate themselves 
fully to him. This will always be the only proper course to 
pursue, whether they come in under the "high calling" or under 
another later call, not so highly honorable and distinguished. 
Nothing short of full consecration will ever be proper, though by 
and by when our Lord's kingdom is ruling, and when the reward 
will be less, the keeping of that consecration will cost no self- 
denial except of things actually sinful. There will no longer be 
any suffering for righteousness' sake, as now. Since, therefore, it 
is proper to consecrate-and thus perform the real baptism-it 
must still be in order, also, to perform the symbol of it in water. 

And, it is still proper to use the same words-though really the 
words used do not affect the symbol at all: it is the thought in 
the heart of the baptized one; and the significance of the act is 
according to his understanding of it,-neither more nor less. 

As shown in the foregoing article, some of those who have 
consecrated since 1881 will yet receive the places of service 
which some, consecrated and baptized before, have failed and 
are failing to use; and such will also receive their places in the 
"body of Christ" and their crowns; hence, to these the thought of 
immersion into the name and body of Christ is altogether proper. 
And for others the same will be proper, for the name Christ 
becomes a family name. It is the name of the Bridegroom. It is 
bestowed upon his bride, the overcoming church; and it will be 
appropriate to all the children of Christ. The Christ complete, 
head and body, is proclaimed to be the "Everlasting Father" (i.e., 
the everlasting Life-giver) to all of the human family, who, 
during the Millennium, when awakened from the tomb and 
brought to a clear knowledge of the truth, will become fully and 
heartily consecrated to him; and who by his power shall reach 
perfection of mind and body and be counted worthy of 
everlasting life. It is proper, therefore, that these also should be 
baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus Christ; for if he is to be 
their Everlasting Father, they are to be his everlasting children, 
and children may always bear the family name. 



R1115 : page 3 



TILL HE COME." 



Some who have read DAWN VOL. II. attentively, are inquiring 
whether the Apostle's statement concerning the Lord's Supper, 
that it shows forth the Lord's death till he come (1 Cor. 1 1:26), 
should not be understood to limit its observance and to make it 
no longer proper. We answer, No; it will be proper to celebrate 
our Lord's death and our consecration, to be dead with him, 
down to the time when we shall complete our sacrifice by 
actually dying, and until we partake of the new wine (joys) of 
the kingdom with our Lord. 

The expression "till he come," does not indicate the 
discontinuance of the observance after the Lord's arrival, until 
he shall have fully gathered his jewels. A similar expression is 
found in James 5:7 -"Be patient, brethren, unto the coming of 
the Lord. " No one certainly would 

page 3 

understand the apostle to mean that the brethren should lose 
their patience at the time of the Lord's coming. Rather they will 
need still more patience, as they will the more appreciate the 
Memorial Supper, in the parousia [presence] of the Son of man, 
until the course of the church is finished.

BLAMELESS, NOT FAULTLESS. 

No Christian is or can be faultless before the Lord. Blameless, 
all may and ought to be. The child that does its needlework 
faithfully is commended, though not a stitch is perfect. The child 

R1115 : page 4 

is blameless, but the work is not faultless. The Christian who 
lives up to his light and ability is blameless, but in God's sight 
faulty. He is not always conscious of his defects, his eyes are not 
as sharp as God's; his best efforts are like the needlework of the 
little girl, well done for her, but so defective in fact that every 
stitch must be removed and done again by a more skillful and 
experienced hand. Saints sometimes judge themselves perfect 
because they are not conscious of sin. They may be innocent, 
but surely not perfect. With more light and culture they would 
discern defects. Others of more experience observe them now, 
but they see them not, because not sufficiently educated or 
advanced in wisdom. Jesus keeps his trusting sheep blameless, 
and step by step leads them up to higher culture, richer wisdom, 



purer tastes, until finally he gives them his likeness in glory. 
Selected.

CHRISTIAN GROWTH. 

"If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in 
you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken 
your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. "-Rom. 
8:11. 

There is a philosophy in the growth and development of 
Christian character, just as truly as in the growth and 
development of vegetation; and the more thoroughly we 
acquaint ourselves with the natural processes and conditions of 
development and growth in either case, the better we will 
understand how to cultivate and to secure the desirable end- 
maturity and luxuriant fruitfulness. The farmer who puts into 
practice only what he has learned by accident, and that in a 
haphazard way, and only goaded to effort by sheer necessity, 
cannot expect the fruitful fields, abundant harvests and well- 
earned approbation of the enterprising, thrifty farmer who has 
made a study of the business and brought knowledge, carefully 
gleaned, together with enterprise and energy to his assistance in 
the work. 

Take for example a tree. If you know nothing about its 
cultivation, do not realize the necessity for it, and simply plant it 
and let it alone, its strength, instead of producing fruit, will 
generally go to making wood and leaves; worms and decay may 
attack its roots, insects may sting and blight its scanty fruitage; 
and if it continue to stand, it will only be a useless, fruitless 
cumberer of the ground, an advertisement of the farmer's 
negligence, and worthy only of having the ax laid to its root. 
Had it been pruned and trimmed, and kept free from insects, 
etc., under the blessing of God's air and rain and sunshine, it 
would have been a fruitful, creditable tree; for the laws of nature 
are true and faithful in all their operations. 

And none the less true are the operations of moral law in the 
growth and development of moral character. Under proper 
conditions and with proper diligent cultivation, the character 
will grow and develop, in accordance with fixed laws, and will 
become beautiful and fruitful in blessings to self and others; or, 

R1114:page4 

lacking the necessary cultivation, even under favorable natural 
conditions, it will be deformed, worthless and fruitless. 

When we presented our bodies as living sacrifices to God, holy 
and acceptable through the merit of our Redeemer, we there 



received the spirit of adoption to the spiritual plane, as spiritual 
sons of God; and from that time the faculties and dispositions of 
our mortal bodies were reckoned as our new being, now under 
the direction and control of the Spirit of God. And the 
faithfulness with which we cultivate this reckoned new nature, 
by persistently weeding out old habits of thought and action, 
supplanting them with new virtues, and training them to activity 
in the divine service, is to prove our worthiness or unworthiness 
of the actual new nature to be received at the resurrection, to 
which perfect spiritual condition our present reckoned condition 
stands related as embryotic. And of course, the disposition and 
character of the embryo new creature will be the disposition of 
the perfected new creature when born in the resurrection. 

The Apostle in the above text affirms, that if we really have the 
spirit of God in us— unless we quench or put it away from us— it 
will quicken our mortal bodies, make them alive toward God, 
active in growing into his likeness, and fruitful in Christian 
graces and activities. And again he adds, "If any man have not 
the spirit of God he is none of his," and that, "As many as are 
led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God."— Rom. 
8:9,14. 

It is our business, therefore, to grow, to cultivate in ourselves 
those dispositions which are worthy of us as spiritual sons of 
God, called to be heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ. 

The Apostle Peter tells us how to proceed in this matter of 
cultivating Christian character, intimating that we cannot do it 
all in a day, or in a few days, but that it must be a gradual daily 
life-work, a process of addition-adding virtue to virtue and 
grace to grace, day by day and hour by hour, saying:— 

"Giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue 
knowledge, and to knowledge temperateness, and to 
temperateness patience, and to patience godliness, and to 
godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity." 
And then he adds, "If ye do these things, ye shall never fall. "-2 
Pet. 1:5-7-10. 

This is a very strong assurance— that if we do these things we are 
sure to stand approved of God. We do well, therefore, to 
consider them with special care. Here are eight elements which 
must go toward making up the Christian character, the one to be 
added to the other and assimilated by the spiritual germ of the 
new nature, until the embryo new creature is formed, and then it 
must continue to grow and develop. Look at them again, They 
are- 
Faith, 
Patience, 
Virtue, 
Godliness, 
Knowledge, 



Brotherly kindness, 

Temperateness, 

Charity-Love. 

Now for a little self-examination: Let each ask himself, (1) Have 
I the faith to which the Apostle here refers?-not faith in every 
thing or every person, but faith in God— in his plan of 
redemption through the vicarious or substitutionary sacrifice of 
Christ, and in all his rich promises built upon that sure 
foundation? Do I trust him implicitly? Is a "Thus saith the Lord" 
the end of all controversy, the solution of all doubts and the 
restful assurance in every perplexity? 

(2) Am I endeavoring to lead a virtuous life? This to the child of 
God consecrated to be a living sacrifice, implies much more 
than merely abstaining from evil. It implies living truthfully, that 
is true to his covenant, which to willfully violate would be 
equivalent to swearing falsely. How we need to invoke the 
divine assistance here! and how critically to judge ourselves! 

(3) Am I endeavoring from day to day to gain a more thorough 
and complete knowledge of God, of the great plan revealed in 
his Word, and of the special features now in operation, that I 
may co-operate with him in its execution, and of his will 
concerning me in the particular relationships and conditions in 
which I now stand-irrespective of my own will and disposition 
in any matter? 

(4) Am I temperate-moderate in all things ?-in eating, and 
drinking, and dressing, and home-arrangements, and conduct, 
and thoughts, and words, and deeds, and looks? "Let your 
moderation [temperateness] be known unto all men, " says the 
apostle. Let men see, by our thoughtful, not rash and hasty but 
careful and considerate demeanor, in every affair of life, that we 
honor our profession. 

(5) Am I patient under trial and discipline, keeping my feelings 
always under the control of enlightened reason, letting patience 
have its perfect work in cultivating the character, however 
severely the plow and harrow may break up the subsoil of the 
heart, meekly submitting to the discipline in every case? 

(6) Am I carefully observing and endeavoring to pattern my 
character and course of action after the divine model? If a 
parent, or one in any position of authority, am I using that 
authority as God uses his?— not for selfish purposes, to make a 
boast of it, or to in any way oppress or trample upon the God- 
given individual rights of those under such authority, but for the 
blessing and advantage of those under it, even to the extent of 
self-denial,-with patience, dignity and grace, and not with 
boastful imperiousness which is the attitude of tyrants? 

If a son, or one under authority to any extent, do I consider the 
example of loyal and loving obedience furnished in the example 



of our dear Lord? His delight was and is to do the Father's will 
at any cost to himself. As a man under the kingdoms — 
authorities-of this world, and as a youth under the authority of 
earthly parents, he was loyal and faithful (Matt. 22:21; Luke 
2:5 1), yet all of this earthly authority was exercised by his 
personal inferiors, though they were his legal superiors. How 
beautifully we will be able to grace and fill whatever station we 
occupy in life, if we carefully study and copy godliness— God- 
likeness, whether we be princes or peasants, masters or servants. 

(7) Does brotherly kindness characterize all my actions? does it 
make due allowance for the inherited weaknesses and 
circumstantial misfortunes of others? Does brotherly kindness 
deal patiently, and helpfully so far as wisdom in view of the 
correction of those faults, may dictate? and that, even at the 
expense of self-interest, if necessary and prudent? 

And if, as I look myself squarely in the face, I recognize 
deformity of character, do I thankfully accept a brother's 
proffered aid and meekly bear reproof, determining that by the 
grace of God I will overcome such dispositions, and prove 
myself a help rather than a hindrance to others, if it should even 
cost my life to do it, and that I will no longer foster my old 
dispositions, but plunge into activity in the service of God with 
those who should have my co-operation in service, instead of 
my burden? 

(8) Have I charity— love unfeigned— for the unrighteous and 
unlovely, as well as for the good and the beautiful?— a love 
which is ever ready to manifest itself in wise and helpful activity 
for saint and sinner; a love which pities, and helps, and 
comforts, and cheers, and blesses all within its reach; which 
longs for the grand opportunities and power and glory of the 
incoming age, chiefly for its privileges of scattering universal 
blessing; and which, in harmony with that sentiment, utilizes 
every present opportunity wisely, and in harmony with the 
divine plan, for the accomplishment of the same end-thus 
manifesting and cultivating the disposition which must be found 
in every member of that glorious company which shall 
constitute the King's cabinet in the incoming age? If this 
disposition is not begun, cultivated and developed here, we will 
not be considered worthy of that honor and office then. 

And just as in the cultivation of vegetation, watchfulness, and 
the necessary precautions to prevent blight and decay and to 
guard against the intrusions of evil powers and influences 
calculated to sap its life, pruning, trimming and cultivation are 
necessary to accomplish the desired end of fruitfulness. By 
resisting the devil he will flee from us, and by patient 
continuance in well doing, an increasing measure of 
development will result. 



"If these things be in you and abound," says Peter-That is, if 
you have them in some measure, and keep on cultivating them, 
so that they abound more and more and rule in you, "they make 
you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the 
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. " The truth is for such: 
"Light is sown for the righteous," and they are sure to get it. 
They shall not walk in darkness. If any man will do the will of 
God, he shall know of the doctrine. (John 7:17.) "But he that 
lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has 
forgotten that he was purged from his old sins." 

"Wherefore, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and 
election sure; for if ye do these things [if you diligently cultivate 
this disposition] ye shall never fall." Being justified fully by 
faith in the sacrifice of Christ for your redemption, and thus 
sanctified (set apart from the world and devoted to the service of 
God) by the truth, your final selection to that position of glory, 
honor and service, to which you are called, shall be sure. And 

R1115 : page 4 

"so, an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly, into 
the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ." 

"Wherefore," again says our beloved brother Peter, "I will not be 
negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things. 
Yea, I think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you 
up by putting you in remembrance.... Moreover I will endeavor 
that you may be able after my decease to have these things 
always in remembrance. " This he did, and the church to this day 
may profit by his brotherly counsel. 

While the Apostle Peter, addressing the consecrated, thus clearly 
and explicitly points out the way in which we may make our 
calling and election sure to the chief favor of God, the apostle 
Paul, addressing the same class, shows that neglect to develop 
and cultivate the Christian character involves not only the loss 
of the chief favor of our high-calling, but eventually of all favor, 
if willfully and continually neglected. He wrote: "If ye [ye who 
have solemnly covenanted to sacrifice your very life in the 
service of God, for the eradication of evil] live after the flesh 
[with selfish effort, merely to gratify self] ye shall die. " (Rom. 
8:13.) God has no use nor place for willful covenant-breakers 
and covenant-despisers, after they have been brought to a 
knowledge of the truth and of his will, and have covenanted to 
do it faithfully. 

With all our striving and watchfulness, however, we shall not be 
able, in our present condition, to reach our ideal. Perfection is 
something which can only be approximated in the present life. 
But the measure of our effort to attain it will prove the measure 
of our faithfulness and 

R1115 : page 5 



earnest desire to do so. And that effort will not be unfruitful. If 
no fruit appears, we may be sure that little or no effort is made at 
cultivation, pruning, etc. The fruit will not only appear in the 
development of the Christian graces of character, but also in 
increasing activities. We must not wait for our spiritual and 
immortal bodies, promised us in our resurrection, before our 
activity in God's service begins. If we possess the spirit [the 
will, the disposition] of that new nature our mortal bodies will 
be active in the service of God's truth now. Our feet will be swift 
to run his errands, our hands prompt to do his bidding, our 
tongues ready to bear testimony to the truth, our minds active in 
devising ways and means to do so more and more abundantly 
and effectively. And thus we shall be living epistles known and 
read of all about us.

A RELIGIOUS TEACHER 
MEASURED BY A "TWO FOOT RULE." 

THE LIVING CHURCH, a Protestant Episcopal organ 
published weekly in Chicago, is supposed to voice the ideas of 
"the Church," and to furnish instruction on the religious subjects 
of the day. It is a 16-page journal, having 4 columns of 13 
inches each per page. Deducting 50-1/2 inches for the Headings, 
Calendar and prospectus we have left 65 feet 1-1/2 inches of 
solid reading matter, or 3126 quarter inches in length and the 
width of a usual column of printed matter. These 3126 quarter 
inches are divided as follows:— 

I. Advertisements of 50 Schools 175 qr. ins. 

17 Church Bell Foundries, Church Supply Stores 115" 
17 Books and Papers 226" 

22 Patent Medicines, Soaps and Baking Powder 302" 
22 Miscellaneous-Agents Wanted, Insurance, etc. 154 " 
128 Different Advertisements (20 feet 3 inches) 972" 

II. Religious, etc. 14 Clippings and Household Recipes 304" 
4 Obituaries 46" 

20 Diocesan and other Church News 752" 
6 Church Ritual, Policy and Instructions 577" 
4 Bishop's Personals 61" 
10 Letters and Notes Complimentary and Controversial 

(4 feet 9-3/4 inches) 231" 
10 Miscellaneous Personals 78" 
8 Church Finances 46" 
2 Spiritual Instructions 60" 

— 206 Items measuring 2154 qr. ins. 
128 as above 972" 

— Total 3126 qr. ins. 



Of all this mass of "Stuff," but two items measuring 1 foot 3 
inches— or just a little more than one column (or about 2/3 of a 
column in ZION'S WATCH TOWER) were devoted to religious 
or spiritual instruction. These taught of the Divine Nature of 
Christ, and the necessity for self-examination. Some issues are 
better and they have fully twice as much spiritual teaching or 
perhaps 2 to 3 columns— out of 64. But even they are of a kind 
better left unwritten. Nowhere does this paper teach us to 
consecrate our poor selves to Christ expecting the reward of the 
divine nature. Nowhere does it present hopes of our being called 
Christ's brethren. It nowhere points to the glorious hopes which 
have become our ambition to attain. 

This paper, "The Living Church," is recommended highly, and 
subscriptions are taken for it by the "Clergy," as they style 
themselves, of the professed "Church of the living God, the 
pillar and ground of the truth. " But as we, the consecrated, now 
know by actual measurement what this would-be teacher really 
is, we take notice and govern ourselves accordingly. Leaving 
behind all the worldly vanities this blind leader of a blind church 
advertises, and uses its sacred character to recommend, let the 
true Church, the Stone rejected, press forward to the grand prize.

[The above is by the Brother who a little more than a year ago 
was a staunch "Churchman"— Episcopalian-whose defence of 
that system we published and answered in the issue of Nov. 
1887. He is now more of a churchman than ever, but he serves 
and acknowledges not a human system, but the divine one— the 
"Church of the Firstborn whose names are written in heaven. " A 
busy man, the special agent of a leading Fire Insurance Co., he 
nevertheless is constantly preaching the good tidings among all 
classes. He orders the Missionary Envelopes and Arp Tracts by 
the thousand, and seldom a week passes that we do not receive 
from or through him fresh orders for ten or more DAWNS VOL.

The zeal of all who really receive the good tidings with all 
readiness of heart must surprise former friends, as Paul's course 
did his friends. Yet with Paul they can say, "I am not mad-but 
speak forth the words of truth and soberness." -EDITOR.]

THE SAINTS AS LAW STUDENTS. 

"Let your speech be always with grace seasoned with salt."— 
Col. 4:6. 

The whole world is full of suffering; and the more we partake 
of the spirit of our Lord, the more will our sympathies be drawn 



out toward the suffering ones around us and cause us to 
measurably forget our own. And while our present chief 
business is not to devote special time and attention to the 
temporary amelioration of present suffering, we rejoice that the 
time is coming, and that at no distant day, when that will be our 
chief business, -when with a strong hand which no opposer can 
stay, we shall be able to help all. With this end in view we 
rejoice in the present preparatory work, in which we are engaged 
as co-workers with our Lord— the developing and harvesting of 
the Church, the body of Christ, which, together with our Lord 
and Head, is to be the Seed of Abraham which was promised to 
bless all the families of the earth. 

Though this preparation for a future work for the world is not at 
present appreciated by the world, and does not directly alleviate 
its present suffering, yet it is the grandest and most important 
movement in this direction which can at present be made. 

And it is to the direct and indirect influence of this consecrated 
class, preparing for the great future work, that all present 
benevolent and philanthropical enterprises are due. The truth 
concerning God's great and loving plan, and the spirit of that 
truth reflected upon the world, are the moonlight of the present 
dark night and the promise of coming sunlight in the Millennial 
day of blessing. 

Every educator well knows that if his school is to be a success it 
must have an educated, disciplined and competent faculty to 
take charge of the various departments of the work. If the crude, 
undisciplined and uneducated were placed in such positions, the 
institution could only imperfectly bless those under its charge. If 
such an institution were contemplated and no such faculty could 
be found, its work could not begin, nor its blessings be felt, until 
the faculty were first selected and prepared for the work. And 
this work, though it might have little direct or present bearing 
upon the prospective pupils of that institution, would be the 
most necessary work for their future welfare. And any side 
issues which would detract from, or delay this preparatory work, 
would be detrimental to the great work of general education 
designed to be accomplished by the proposed institution. 

Just so it is with the work now before the church. The great 
"Prophet," or Teacher of the world under the New Covenant, the 
Christ, head and body, must first be developed and exalted to his 
position, before the work of instructing, training and educating 
the world up to perfection can really begin. We must not expect 
the world to understand or appreciate our present work; for that 
is as impossible as for an infant to appreciate a parent's plans for 
its future good. We, as children of God approaching maturity, 
have been taken into our Heavenly Father's confidence, and 
have been shown his plan for the blessing of his entire family in 
heaven and in earth, and have been privileged to become co- 
workers with him in carrying out that plan. As the scope of the 



plan is so broad and comprehensive, it is necessarily of slower 
development than those would suppose who have narrow, 
contracted views. The world, and Christians who keep the 
world's standpoint of observation, have no wider plans for the 
blessing of others than those bounded by the narrow limits of the 
present life, while God's plan stretches on into eternity and is for 
the thorough reformation and eternal blessing of all. Its 
foundations are therefore laid broad and deep, so as to last 
eternally, and every step of the plan is accomplished with 
unerring wisdom. 

As co-workers together with our Lord, we are permitted to assist 
in the gathering and developing of the various members of the 
body of Christ, building one another up in the truth, and in the 
spirit of it. And in this very work of assisting one another, come 
up all those principles of the divine law, by which the whole 
world is to be governed when the kingdom of God is established 
in the earth. As children of God, therefore, called to be of that 
little flock which shall judge both angels and men, we should be 
constant students of divine law. We should not only acquaint 
ourselves with its surface meaning, but also with its great 
underlying principles and all their ramifications, as they apply to 
the practical affairs of life; and our own course should be ruled 
accordingly, however squarely in opposition to current opinions 
it may run. 

While in the flesh we have to deal with the questions which 
confront the rest of mankind with regard to our duties in the 
various relations of life— our duties to God and to each other, as 
members of society, and as husbands, wives, parents and 
children. When the law of God and its underlying principles are 
carefully studied, it will be found to touch every contingency 
which can arise, and to point out the narrow path of duty in 
every emergency. No question of duty is too mixed and 
complicated for God's law to unravel and justly settle, if 
appealed to with studious effort. And if we make a study of that 
law, we will not only find the solution of all the perplexing 
questions in our own experience, but we will have a fund of 
information which may be of great service to others in times of 
trouble and perplexity, whether of the church or of the world, 
when they come to us for sympathy and advice. Our own human 
judgment in many cases would be very imperfect, being biased 
by our ignorance, or prejudices, or our natural dispositions; but 
if we are law students under the great Teacher we will be able to 
say, Thus and so is the law of God on this subject, and as it 
applies in this particular case. Neither our own affairs, nor the 
affairs of others who seek our counsel, should be decided upon 
by the impulse of the moment, but always with a careful 
consideration of the law of God on the subject. Thus may our 
speech be always "with grace seasoned with salt." Salt is a 
preserving element keeping that which is good from decay and 
putrefaction. And just so, the influence of wise and well 



instructed saints tends to the preservation of everything that is 
good; and their counsel and sympathy will assist and encourage 
every earnest seeker after righteousness. And if their own lives 
and affairs are continually governed by the high principles of 
true Christianity, they are living epistles known and read of all 
men. 

As intelligent creatures of God, we stand related in some sense 
to the entire family of God in heaven, and in earth. Our very 
existence has brought us into these relationships, with all their 
corresponding privileges and obligations, and as intelligent 
beings it should be our desire and effort to learn the exact 
measure of privilege and obligation which these varied 
relationships involve. 

To our great Creator, we originally stood related as children, and 
to all his intelligent creatures as brethren-brethren of the family 
of God, though not as great as our brethren the angels, who are 
of higher nature (Eph. 3:15): and to earthly creatures lower than 
human nature, we stood as rulers. When we became sinners, 
these privileges, blessings and relationships were canceled by 
our Heavenly Father's decree. As unworthy of life and its 
blessings, we were condemned to death. Thenceforth we were 
no longer recognized as children of God, or brethren of his 
family, but were regarded and treated as aliens and enemies until 
the death sentence should be fully executed upon us— until 
existence should terminate. 

After our redemption by his grace, through the precious blood of 
Christ, and our acceptance of the same by faith, the former 
natural relationships are again recognized, though all their 
privileges are not enjoyed, nor all their obligations insisted 
upon, until the effects of the fall are fully overcome— until we 
are actually restored to perfection. Though again recognized by 
our Heavenly Father as sons and heirs through Christ, yet until 
actually perfect all communication with him must be through the 
name and merit of our Mediator, Christ, who represents us and 
our interests before the Father. All judgment is therefore now 
committed unto the Son of God who purchased us by his blood. 
(John 5:22.) Believers now, therefore, stand in a new 
relationship to Christ, who becomes Lord and life-giver (a 
father) to those whom he purchased and proposes to restore out 
of condemnation and death to fellowship and life. Hence he is 
called the Everlasting Father. (Isa. 9:6.) And when the age of his 
reign is over, the restored ones will again recognize Jehovah as 
the great Father of all, and Christ as their Lord and Redeemer. 

Thus far, no reference is made to the peculiar relationships of 
the church as new creatures in Christ. We wish first to consider 
the human relationships and their privileges and obligations, and 
then to inquire 

R1116:page6 



how the new conditions, into which we come by consecration 
during the Gospel age, affect our former relationships. 

First then we inquire, What, in the way of privilege and 
obligation, is involved in our relationship to God as justified 
human sons? As justified human sons we come into possession 
of all the rights and privileges bestowed upon Adam, viz. : life 
and the dominion of earth-life in its blessed fulness, unmixed 
with any element of death, perfect health without an ache or a 
pain, life which will never terminate unless forfeited by misuse. 
To be given the dominion of earth, signifies the full enjoyment 
of every earthly good. The earth was made for man. "God 
created it not in vain, he created it to be inhabited" (Eccl. 1:4; 
Isa. 45:18) and enjoyed forever by a glorious race of perfect 

R1117:page6 

beings, to whose wants it will be perfectly adjusted when both 
they and it have attained his ideal perfection, which was at first 
illustrated in our progenitor, Adam, and his specially prepared 
Eden home. Then the whole earth shall blossom as the rose, and 
the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad. (Isa. 35:1.) 
The animal, the mineral, and the vegetable kingdoms will all be 
at man's command, to serve his pleasure and to supply his needs. 
And the laws of nature which govern their increase, and 
circumscribe their power and place, are so appointed, and, we 
are guaranteed, will so continue, as to forever minister to human 
necessities and happiness. Earth, air and water are teeming with 
blessings, constantly inviting man to prove by still deeper 
investigation their wonderful power to enhance his comfort and 
pleasure. Delve into the mines, bore into the earth, dive into the 
waters, soar upon the wings of the wind, harness the electric 
currents, study and apply the divinely appointed laws of nature, 
and prove the Creator's power and will to bless his creatures. 
And as we lift our hearts in grateful praise for his goodness and 
love, let the smiling heavens again whisper to our hearts that 
"God is love;" for he has appointed the sun to bless us by day, 
and the moon and the stars by night. 

And yet the half has not been told. Consider your own 
organism— how wonderfully made! not only your physical, but 
your mental organism, those wonderful mental faculties which 
answer to God's own glorious attributes-the will, the judgment, 
the reasoning powers, the conscience, the memory, the 
imagination, the aesthetic tastes, and the capacity for social 
enjoyment founded upon the love and appreciation of the good, 
the pure, and the beautiful. Then remember that all this capacity 
for happiness, as well as all the means of happiness within our 
reach, is God-given. We are not attempting now to account for 
the irregularities and miseries brought about by sin, we are 
merely considering the perfect condition of humanity, when 
fully justified, not only reckonedly, but actually, when as it is 
promised, there shall be nothing to hurt nor destroy (Isa. 11:9), 



when sin and its consequences will have been forever banished. 
And yet quite a measure of these blessings we are permitted to 
enjoy even now. We now taste and see that the Lord is good, but 
the fullness of his favor will be realized when he hath made all 
things new. -Rev. 21:5. 

Then consider that all these blessings flow to us from purest 
love; that God created us for his pleasure, that he might have a 
father's delight in us as his children, that he might bestow upon 
us the wealth of his affection and bounty, and that he might find 
in us the corresponding satisfaction of filial love and gratitude. 
When we thus consider the object of our creation and the love 
and bounty of our Creator, love and gratitude spring up 
spontaneously in our hearts towards him who thus first loved us. 

Some say, It is our duty to love God; but duty is not the word. 
We never love any person or any thing because it is our duty to 
love them. We love because we cannot help loving, because the 
object is worthy of love, good, beautiful, true, or in some way 
precious to us. A feeling of selfishness or gratification which 
springs from any other source, is not true love. Love is a pure 
and noble quality. By a law of our mental constitution, love 
springs up spontaneously for the good, the pure, and the 
beautiful in all who are right-minded. To love God, therefore, 
we need but to acquaint ourselves with his character and to 
meditate upon it. Therefore it is our duty to acquaint ourselves 
with God, and to meditate upon his goodness and favor toward 
us, and when he is fully known and appreciated, as he will be by 
the restored race, then will men love him voluntarily with all 
their heart, with all their mind, and with all their strength. 

Thus the first commandment will be fulfilled; and the second, 
being like unto it and springing from a similar source, will be 
fulfilled just as spontaneously or naturally- "Thou shalt love thy 
neighbor as thyself. " Why? For a two-fold reason: First, All our 
neighbors are creatures of God, and therefore, like ourselves, 
objects of his love and care; and to love God with the whole 
heart, is to love all that he loves, for the same reason that he 
loves them. And secondly, the germ of the future perfect man, 
however now degraded by sin, must be a thing of great value 
when God gave his only begotten Son to redeem it; and 
therefore, every man for whom Christ died is worthy of love. 
However, from the very nature of the case, the creatures must 
always take a subordinate place to the great Creator in the 
affections of each other, when that upon which love is to be 
based is fully known and recognized. 

The justified man's relationship, therefore, to the Creator, is that 
of a child to a father. His condition is that of entire dependence 
upon God for every thing, from least to greatest. And his 
wisdom and justice being faultless and infallible, his power 
omnipotent, and his love fathomless, our only safety and 
security is in implicit confidence and obedience to his will in 



every matter, whether in our shortsightedness we can or cannot 
understand it as the expression of infallible wisdom, justice and 
love. We can safely trust such a Father, even where we cannot 
trace him. 

It is because it is necessary for our good, and because it is the 
proper attitude in which filial love and gratitude should naturally 
place us, that God requires of his creatures implicit obedience. It 
is for the same reason that you as a parent require obedience 
from your children. And as you accept cheerful and prompt 
obedience from your children as the expression and measure of 
their love to you, so God measures our love to him. And since 
an enforced obedience is no expression of filial love or 
confidence, he has given to all his intelligent creatures freedom 
to either obey or disobey, that thereby he may prove them, and 
that thereby the eternal blessedness of all his loyal and obedient 
children may be established in the universal mutual love which 
shall bind and cement all hearts with the tenderest, most 
beautiful, and strongest cord— love. 

Then our deepest and warmest affections, our profoundest 
gratitude, and our implicit faith and obedience, are due to our 
heavenly Father, and should be manifested in our conduct 
toward him in studious efforts to learn, and ambitious efforts to 
do, his will. On the first commandment, and the second which 
grows out of the first, hang all the Law and the prophets, said 
Jesus (Luke 22:40); for "love is the fulfilling of the law. "-Rom. 
13:10. 

Having thus considered our relationship to our Heavenly Father, 
let us remember his words— that he would also have us honor his 
dear Anointed Son "even as we honor the Father:" not that he 
should take the Father's place in our affections, but that next to 
the Father, as the executor of his plan, he should receive the 
honor, love and praise of our hearts. To love and honor and obey 
him, not only for his personal character, and because of his great 
love for us, but also because he was the willing obedient agent 
of our Father in the execution of his benevolent plan, is the 
natural outgrowth of deep love to the great Designer of the plan. 

When we observe closely our relationship to God and all of duty 
and privilege which that relationship involves, we find that the 
same principles carried out, apply to all our relationships with 
each other. For the very same reasons that as children of God we 
should love, honor and obey him, children of earthly parents 
should love, honor and obey them Their love and care and 
sacrifice and bountiful providence during the years of 
helplessness and ignorance, should ever be held in loving 
remembrance, and should be rewarded with gratitude, and with 
kindest attentions when their age and infirmities require it. And 
though the helplessness and ignorance of our early years, which 
necessitated our obedience to earthly parents until the years of 
maturity were reached, then no longer require subjection to 



parental authority, yet the duty of love and honor and grateful 
recognition and preferment, is never canceled. 

So, likewise, when we observe God's attitude toward his 
children, we see the model for all parents to imitate. We see how 
love, justice, benevolence, generosity, economy, wisdom and 
prudence harmoniously work together for the good of his 
family. And as we study his plan and his methods for discipline, 
development, and culture, we have practical suggestions to 
parents for every emergency which can arise in the family. We 
have in his methods the example of love which never grows cold 
or indifferent and of firm justice which never bends; and the two 
always act in harmony. Let earthly parents study and copy the 
divine pattern; and let the children of earthly parents be taught to 
be grateful for all favors, from whatsoever source they come, 
and to recognize the principles of love, justice, benevolence and 
generosity, as manifested in God's dealing with us, and to act on 
them from earliest infancy. 

It will be comforting, too, to perplexed earthly parents, the 
fruitage of whose best efforts seems to tarry long, to observe 
that time is a large factor in the outworking of God's disciplinary 
measures. For six thousand years he has let his refractory 
children try and prove the futility of their own plans, before he 
attempts to force their submission to his, knowing that the rough 
experience is necessary to their final good; and looking forward 
to the end to be gained, he is undisturbed by present discords, 
and firm and unmoved in his unerring purposes. 

The obligation, arising from the relationship of brothers and 
sisters, whether considered as bound by the narrow limits 

R1118:page6 

of the family circle, or the wider sphere of the whole family of 
God, is simply that of mutual love, as children of common 
parentage. And love worketh no ill to his neighbor, but delights 
to be gracious. 

But alas! love does not reign in human society. Men do not 
generally consider the duties and obligations arising out of their 
varied relationships. Parents do not consider, children do not 
consider, and generally are not so taught, brothers and sisters do 
not consider; and so in all the other relationships. Men and 
women, from infancy up, are generally heady, high-minded, 
proud, boasters, and lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. 
And those who resolutely set themselves against the 
overwhelming tide of popular opinion, to live Godly, and if they 
have families to bring them up in the way of truth and 
righteousness, must ignore the opinions of others, and study and 
closely follow the divine law. 

Let us now inquire, how the new conditions into which some 
come by special consecration, during the Gospel age, affect our 



relationships. Those whose ambitions are not now of an earthly 
character, but who are seeking the heavenly prize-the divine 
nature and joint-heirship with Christ- while they are in the 
world and have to do with the world, must ever bear in mind 
that they are not of the world, but that they are God's 
representatives in the world to faithfully carry out and exemplify 
the principles of his government in whatever position in life they 
may be placed, whether as parents or children, or brothers and 
sisters, or members of society. They should not only exemplify 
the principles of the divine government, but should have such a 
clear understanding of them as to be able to fairly present them 
to any inquirer. 

While we are in the world our business is the King's business, 
and all cares of an earthly character must be resolutely pushed 
aside, so far as may be consistent with the obligations we had 
assumed before we came into the Lord's service, so that all the 
time and energy we can possibly spare from the necessary duties 
of this life may be spent on the great work of preparation for our 
future work of teaching and restoring the world. 

Our duties of an earthly character must be performed in exactly 
the same way that we would counsel the world to do, if they 
would heed our counsel. As parents and children and husbands 
and wives and brothers and sisters, our rightful obligations to 
each other are not canceled by our higher relationships as sons 
of God and heirs with Christ of the kingdom to come. But our 
duties must be limited by the necessities of ourselves and those 
dependent upon us. 

Study and apply the principles of the divine law in all its 
bearings, both on the present and the future, and let your course 
be ruled accordingly and your counsel to others be drawn from 
it. "Let your words be always with grace, seasoned with salt. " 
Ye are the lights of the world; let your light shine, as a beacon 
on a dark and stormy sea.

ESTABLISHED. 



An aged farmer and a young man who had recently given 
himself to Christ were driving along a country road. The young 
man was talking about his newly found Savior with all the 
joyous enthusiasm of a young convert, when his old and 
somewhat cynical companion interrupted, saying, "Oh, yes, you 
know you are just in your first love; but wait a little, and then 
you'll-you'll-," and he meant 



R1118:page7 

though he did not say it, that he would get "cold," like himself. 
"And what are you?" inquired the young man. "I am an 
established Christian," was the answer. They drove on for some 
time in silence, until they were somewhat roughly brought up by 
the cart-wheel sticking fast in a deep rut. They got out to try and 
liberate it; the old man whipped the horse and spoke rather 
forcibly, but all to no purpose; the wheel remained immovable. 
After one of the fruitless efforts, the young man looked at the 
farmer and remarked, "I guess, my friend, it's got established. " 
Similarly, there are some Christians who get into a deep rut, and 
stick there, and mistake their inactivity for established 
Christianity.-Selected.

VALUE OF THE PRESENT LIFE. 

Is life worth living? What a question! Who would die? glad 
youth replies, buoyant with hope, unfettered with care, the ruddy 
cheek glowing with health, the eye sparkling with pleasures- 
How sweet to be, to think, to move, to drink of joy on every 
hand. Oh, who could part with life? 

Is life worth living? 'Tis youth again gives answer, but hope has 
fled. The pale face, emaciated form, and sunken eye betoken 
affliction's heavy hand, with days and nights of anguish and 
unrest. Oh what is life to me! -to be, and suffer. Life is a 
synonym of pain, and time means torture. 

And what has life for you, O man of riper years ! busy from early 
morn till close of day. Has labor aught of joy that one should 
care to live? Talk not to me of giving up to plan and do, gaining 
of knowledge, wealth, honor's wreath, and fame's fair title. "Tis 
true, life has its trials, cares, its stormy days, but these are only 
fleeting shadows that serve to gild the intervening time with 
brighter splendor. But again an answer comes from him who has 
reached the meridian of life in our day. Misfortune on the right 
hand and the left. Life to me means toil for naught. Affection 
has no sooner settled firm around earth's fairest blossoms than 
death puts an end to all our cherished hopes. Friends are gained 
but to be lost again. Honor is a bubble to be bursted by the first 
foul breath of jealousy. The cup of pleasure scarce is lifted to the 
lips till dashed to earth again. To judge the future by the past, 
what has life in store that I should crave it? 

And what of life? 'Tis now the gray-haired veteran gives reply. 
The weight of years has bent the once proud form, furrowed the 
cheek and brow, and robbed the senses of their acuteness. 
Alone, and trembling on the verge of the grave, memory of 
younger days is all there is left of comfort. The days of the years 



of my pilgrimage have been few and full of sorrow. The beacon 
lights of pleasure, wealth and glory are as fleeting as the 
moments we employ in their pursuit, as changeful as the firefly, 
and if secured are only vanity. Humanity's portion is, to be, to 
hope, to hover between its fruition and despair, and end in death, 
fitting finale of the fitful dream. 

But Christian, what say you of life? It is our first and greatest 
blessing, the 

Rl 1 19 : page 7 preface to eternity, the time in which true 
happiness may be forever gained. I look not for the present 
earthly joy, knowing full well that the afflictions, trials and 
temptations which abound are means by which God proves me, 
whether I will do his sovereign will. What virtue in obeying him 
if there are no desires of my own to disregard? How may I prove 
him to be the chief object of my affections, and not be called 
upon to deny myself for his sake? Life affords the opportunity to 
battle for immortality, to struggle for an existence that shall 
prove eternal. They who use it for a baser purpose are void of 
understanding. The curse of God now rests upon the land. We 
need not think to find our hearts' desires where such a blighting 
curse exists. But he has promised to remove all evil in his own 
good time, when, with his blessing here instead, happiness shall 
be ours. Rejoicing in his love so freely manifested in the gift of 
his only Son, who even died to redeem us from our present sin- 
cursed state, gladly do I seek to follow him, scorning all that 
earth now has in store, and present my body a living sacrifice to 
God, a reasonable service. I am made conformable unto his 
death, that I may know him and the power of his resurrection. I 
rejoice in his self-denial, and partake of his sufferings, that I 
may share in his joy and glory. Glory to God in the highest! for 
the being and time by which I may work out so great a destiny. 
Whatever may be my portion now, I praise his name for life; for 
I look not at the things that are seen, they are temporal, but at 
the things that are not seen, which he has promised, for they are 
eternal. "He that loveth his life shall lose it, and he that loseth 
his life for my sake shall find it. " "For I am persuaded, that 
neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, 
nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor 
any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of 
God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. " 

Those who live to make the most they possibly can of earthly 
objects through their present fleshly nature, are doomed to bitter 
disappointment. This life can prove a blessing only when lived 
for God.-P. W. Pope. 



R1119:page7 



IS EARLY DEATH A BLESSING? 

On last Sunday I was one of a crowd of over four thousand 
people who listened to a sermon by the noted Brooklyn 
preacher, De Witt Talmage. The whole discourse was a 
pessimistic view of this present life, and an effort to prove that 
the more brief the life the greater the blessing, because of the 
struggle, the labors and heart-aches that are escaped, as well as 
the temptations that are avoided. 

To quote his own expressive language: "If one die at thirty-five, 
he gets through work at noon;" and speaking of the child that 
dies in infancy, "That child touched the earth and glanced into 
heaven. " 

I could not interpret the thoughts of the throng who appeared to 
receive his bold unproven assertions as the words of one 
speaking with authority, but I know that many thoughts coursed 
through my brain. The following are a few of them:- 

I thought- You profess to be a minister of God, why don't you 
teach the people God's word instead of giving so many of your 
own words; for since bidding good-bye to your text you have 
not quoted a word of Scripture to support your assertions. I 
thought— If it is such a blessing to die young, what a great 
mistake our Creator has made. If he had taken counsel of 
modern theologians he would have arranged to have had the 
bulk of humanity "just touch the earth and glance into heaven, " 
reserving only the "real good," who could not be corrupted, to 
perpetuate the race, and thus furnish more inhabitants for 
heaven. 

I thought-My dear sir! I wonder were you taken seriously ill, if 
you would not send post-haste for a physician, and if necessary 
for a council of them, for fear that by some mistake you might 
be taken away to the "warmth and sunshine and beauteous 
landscapes" of heaven before you were quite ready to quit this 
"outer circle." 

I thought-Had you been God's counselor on Mt. Sinai you 
would have advised Him not to add the promise of long life to 
the fifth commandment; and you could have corrected Paul 
when he quoted the commandment, so that he would not have 
added as a blessing: "That thou mayest live long on the earth." 
Then again, how ignorant was Hezekiah. What a splendid 
opportunity he had to go directly through the pearly gates into 
glory; but he prayed and he wept to remain "in this cheerless 
world;" and God humored him, and as a special privilege 
allowed him to remain "outside in the cold and the wet" for 
fifteen long years. If Hezekiah could have listened to his sermon 
he would never have written as he did: "Behold for peace I had 
great bitterness, but Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it 
from the pit of corruption, for thou hast cast all my sins behind 
my back. For the grave cannot praise Thee, death cannot 



celebrate Thee; they that go down into the pit cannot hope for 
Thy truth. The living, the living, he shall praise Thee even as I 
do this day."-Isa. 38:1,5,17-19. 

I thought— Solomon was a very wise man; but if you, Mr. 
Talmage, are correct, he made one great mistake when he gave 
counsel to the young man, "My son, forget not my law; but let 
thine heart keep my commandments; for length of days, and 
long life, and peace shall they add to thee; " Talmage would have 
given as the reward, "For you shall die young and go to glory. " 
Again David ought never to have said, in enumerating the 
blessings of a perfect man, "With long life will I satisfy him, " if 
as you say, the dead "are more alive than we are— we are the 
dead." 

I thought- "What fools we mortals be" to struggle and labor in 
search of knowledge as we do, if it be true that, "in five minutes 
after death we will know more than by studying one hundred 
years;" and "a child six months old knows more than all the 
wisdom of Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Oxford, and all other 
universities combined; " and then, how strange it is that the 
inspired Psalmist did not know this, as he would not then have 
written that "the dead know not anything," that "in death there is 
no remembrance of Thee; " and concerning man that "His breath 
goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, in that very day his 
thoughts perish. "-Psa. 6:5; 146:4. 

"If any man speak let him speak as the oracle of God."- 
Selected.

THE REST OF THE DEAD. 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-I have read with great interest 
Mr. Brewer's letter to you and your reply, on the resurrection of 
"the rest of the dead," published in ZION'S WATCH TOWER 
for March '89. 

I have given the subject deep thought and cannot help 
concluding that to any logical mind it should be clear that the 
passage in question was a comment or note made by a reader, 
and was not in the original text. I give you my thoughts as they 
came to me while studying the subject: Christ is Lord both of 
the dead and of the living (Rom. 14:9), hence, I conclude that 
the second resurrection will be his work and will take place 
during his Millennial reign, i.e., the first resurrection will be that 
of the saints immediately at Christ's coming, and the second that 
of the "rest of the dead;" because to restore, or raise up, or give 
life will be his special work during his reign. 



From the study of the Lord's Word I conclude that his work 
would not be complete, if the "rest of the dead" were raised up 
after the thousand years, for then Christ will deliver up the 
kingdom to his Father perfect in every respect.- 1 Cor. 15:24 
and following verses. 

Peter says in Acts 3:20,21: "Restitution of all things." This 
implies a restoration of all things both dead and living to their 
original condition or state of perfection lost by Adam's 
transgression, and if such is not the case the Apostle Paul's 
statement in Rom. 14:9 has no meaning. We cannot for a 
moment suppose that Christ would deliver up the kingdom to his 
Father in an incomplete condition, and it certainly would be so, 
if he did not awaken all and give all the opportunity to be fully 
raised up out of death; and it would be contrary to his own 
words in John 5 :27-29 and 1 1:25; and to Paul's words in 1 Cor. 
15:21,22.- Diaglott. Yours in the service of Jesus, 

W. C .

OLD THEOLOGY TRACTS. 

Sample copies of OLD THEOLOGY TRACTS, No. I. of the 
series, have been sent to all the TOWER readers. These will be 
issued quarterly, beginning with April 1889. Our first edition of 
No. I. was 10,000 and was quickly exhausted; now 50,000 more 
of the same are at your service. We are ready to do our part to 
make the edition a million, and if each steward of time and 
money and influence among us will do what he can, we believe 
it will not be long before the Old Theology, older than 
Romanism or any other ism— the theology of our Lord and the 
apostles— will be much more clearly understood than at present. 

Study over the matter, and decide how many you can subscribe 
for and use each quarter, at the very low rates mentioned on 
second page of Tract No. I. Some write that they can take a 
larger quantity, if permitted to send the subscription price in 
quarterly installments, instead of sending for the entire year at 
once, and ask if this will be agreeable to us, or whether it will 
cause too much trouble. We answer, Do whichever way you can 
accomplish the greatest results. We gladly take any extra labor 
that will honor our great Redeemer's name and help set free 
God's saints still held in error's bondage in Babylon. 

Some of the saints are very enthusiastic in regard to these 
Tracts. Bro. Weber insists that they will be the shower of hail 
mentioned by the Prophet Isaiah. (Chap. 28:17.) As heretofore 



shown, water is a symbol of truth; hence hail is a symbol of 
crystalized and purified truths. May the Lord grant that these old 
theology hail-stones may in many cases be successful in 
exposing and sweeping away the refuges of error, and thus in 
liberating the minds of many of God's true children, who shall 
be in trouble until made to understand the true doctrine, the old 
theology. See marginal reading of Isa. 28:19: "report" should be 
translated "doctrine." 

Let us who are of the "Day," and who realize that we are in the 
dawn, not pattern after the worldly, and be asleep to things 
spiritual and absorbed and overcharged with worldly aims or 
pleasures or business; but let us make the spread of the truth the 
main business of life, to which all other business will be but 
servant and contributor. As an illustration 

R1120:page7 

of keenness in the spiritual work, worthy of emulation, we note 
the following circumstance:— 

Rev. Dr. Henson of Chicago preached recently on the subject of 
Eternal Torture, and his sermon, which pictured vividly the 
everlasting agonies of those who die without becoming saints, 
was published in the Chicago papers the following Monday; and 
by the following Sunday two of the brethren there had 500 of 
the Old Theology Tracts, No. I., and distributed them personally 
to that congregation at their church doors. Those brethren 
preached a sermon to that congregation, from the Bible, such as 
could reach them in no other way so thoroughly; one that Dr. 
Henson's preaching will never efface. They may not know of the 
results in the present life, but doubtless in the kingdom some 
may come to them and say, "Under God I owed my liberation 
from blindness and error to that hail-storm which as messengers 
of the truth you let fall upon that congregation, and that was my 
start in truth-seeking and truth-getting. "

OLD GERMAN TOWERS FREE. 

We have thousands of old copies of the German WATCH 
TOWER, very suitable for new readers, which we are anxious to 
put into their hands FREE. We ask our readers who can do so 
and would enjoy the privilege of such service, to take these and 
distribute them at the doors of German churches on Sundays. In 
ordering say how many you can use. 

When thus distributing papers or tracts do not stand to do so, for 
this blocks the street and is contrary to law, but keep walking up 
and down while handing them out, and be as polite and 
agreeable as possible. 



R1120:page8 

TRACT DISTRIBUTORS 

TAKE NOTICE. 

The Constitution of the United States guarantees every one the 
right to distribute money or tracts or papers of any sort, to any 
desiring to take them,— provided they contain neither obscene 
nor incendiary matter. Any city or state law, such as is 
mentioned in a letter from New Orleans, attempting to interfere 
with this privilege, is unconstitutional and cannot be sustained. 
The sidewalks are public property, and one man has as much 
right to walk thereon as another. No one has a right to blockade 
the way, or to trespass upon enclosures, or to attempt a 
distribution of anything in the yard or vestibule of a place of 
meeting; and no one who has clear, true ideas of justice and the 
rights of others would attempt such an intrusion, even if no 
human law forbade. The royal law of Love and respect for the 
rights of others, would quickly settle this point. 

Let us clearly divide and distinguish, however, on this subject, 
and if chief priests and elders attempt to interfere with you in 
distributing tracts and papers on the public highways, do not 
easily permit that. They have no more right to interfere with 
your preaching by tracts, etc., quietly and unobtrusively, to those 
who want to read what you have to give, than you would have to 
interfere with people who desire to hear their oral preaching. 
Both you and they are preachers, each according to his 
conviction, though you employ different methods of reaching 
the people. Neither has a right to interfere with the other's 
methods. 

If some shall claim that it is unkind for you to attempt to feed 
his sheep, just remember that they are misstating the case; for 
the sheep are not theirs, but Christ's. When seeking to feed 
Christ's sheep, in any manner that does not intrude upon the 
private property or rights of others, you are certainly doing the 
Lord's sheep, who alone have a relish for such food, a great 
kindness. If the chief priests and elders consider our food 
poisonous, let them analyze it and show it to be so; if they 
cannot do this, and the sheep who feed upon it enjoy it and grow 
spiritually stronger upon it, who has a right to feel that you did 
an unkind act in offering the food. 

The same sort of argument that would prove your act of 
unobtrusive tract distribution unkind, could be used to prove that 
it would be unkind and unloving to interfere with the plans of 
robbers. Kindness in such a case would have to draw a line 
between the wishes of the robbers and the robbed. And just so, 
true kindness must choose between the rights and needs of the 



poor starved sheep of Christ and those who in the name of the 
Chief Shepherd seek to enslave his sheep as their own, in the 
bondage of sectarianism and errors.

"THE PLAN OF THE AGES." 

MILLENNIAL DAWN, VOL. I. 

This work is specially designed to make plain the divine plan. It 
begins at the beginning of the subject, by establishing the faith 
of the reader in God and in the Bible as his revelation, and 
proceeds to trace the glorious plan therein revealed, and to show 
which parts of that plan are already accomplished, and which 
will be accomplished during the Millennial age, the manner of 
its introduction, and its objects and methods. 

We know of nothing to compare with this book, as a "Bible 
Key"--" A Helping Hand for Bible Students." The One Hundred 
and Twentieth Thousand is now on the press, and many who 
have read it carefully and prayerfully, declare that if they could 
not obtain another they would not part with their copy, and the 
hopes it has enkindled, for millions. 

It contains 352 pages, clear type, good paper, etc. Price in cloth 
covers $1.00 (or together with one year's subscription to this 
journal, Zion's Watch Tower, $1.25). Price in paper covers 25 
cents, reduced from 50 cents to bring it within reach of all. 
These prices include postage. 

Only Watch Tower subscribers are desired to act as colporteurs 
or agents for this book, and to thus preach with each book 
sixteen sermons more effectively than in any other way, and to 
classes not otherwise accessible. Some loan these books in 
quantities, others give them to their friends, and others sell them. 
The latter plan is often best, because people will more surely 
read what they have paid something for. 

Some of our readers, who can afford it, pay the above low prices 
by the hundred copies, and some do more and contribute to the 
TOWER TRACT FUND, enabling us to make the following 
terms on the paper covered books to those whose circumstances 
are such that they can greatly increase their time and labor in 
this work by taking advantage of the allowance, as all 
subscribers are at liberty and welcome to do, each according to 
his own judgment. 

The terms to Colporteurs are as follows:— To such as desire 
these books for loaning or giving away, and to those who can 
spend more of their time in selling them by reason of this 
arrangement, the Tract Fund grants an allowance of 10 cents per 
book, in lots of not less than 10 books AT A TIME- that is 



$1.50 for 10 books, $3.00 for 20, etc. This allowance is made to 
enable those of limited means to do more in the work of 
spreading the truth than they could otherwise do. 

To such as give their entire time to this ministry of the truth, 
traveling from town to town and engaging in no other business 
for support, the Tract Fund grants an allowance of 12-1/2 cents 
per copy (called "Expense Money" to pay the traveling and 
living expenses of colporteurs), -in lots of not less than 20 books 
AT A TIME,-that is $2.50 for 20 books, $5.00 for 40, etc. 

When ordering state plainly which terms you accept, otherwise 
we shall reckon at 25 cents each.

"THE TIME IS AT HAND." 

MILLENNIAL DAWN, VOL. II. 

[In English only.] 

Prices and terms same as Vol. I. This volume is intended only 
for those who have carefully and thoroughly studied Vol. I. All 
such whose interest is awakened, will surely want this volume 
and succeeding ones which are in course of preparation, as well 
as the regular issues of the WATCH TOWER. 

FOREIGN TERMS. 

Though foreign postage is higher, we must not increase the 
price; for money elsewhere is more scarce among the poor than 
here, and the poor we want specially to reach, since we know 
that "not many rich or great" are among the Lord's chosen. 

Our foreign friends may, therefore, hereafter, reckon our terms 
in English money, thus:- 25 cents = 1 shilling. 50 cents = 2 
shillings. $1.00 = 4 shillings $1.25. 5 shillings. 1.50 = 6 
shillings. 2.50 = 10 shillings. 3.00 = 12 shillings. 5.00 = 20 
shillings. 

Upon this arrangement the WATCH TOWER will hereafter be 2 
shillings instead of 3 shillings per year.

CREDIT FOR THE POOR. 

Those unable to purchase the Dawn (and there are some we 
find— even at this low price) can have a copy of either volume on 
loan, upon promise to read it and to return it. 

All who would engage in the work of ministering as colporteurs, 
but who lack the means to purchase the quantities mentioned 
above, can take their sample book and begin by taking orders, 
payable on delivery. If you can write us that you have secured 
orders for 5 we will let you have 10 books on credit; if you get 
orders for 10 we are willing to let you have 20; if you get 20 we 
will let you have 40 books on credit. 



R1121 : page 8 

Write your order on a separate piece of paper from that upon 
which your letter is written. Write very plainly— especially your 
name and address. The name of the town is not always the same 
as the name of the post office: be sure to give the name of the 
Post Office to which you wish books sent. Give us plenty of 
time by ordering several days before you want the books, as we 
are very busy.

OLD THEOLOGY POOR FUND. 

It is suggested that, as the OLD THEOLOGY TRACTS are 
evidently destined to become quite a feature of the "harvest 
work," some arrangement should be made for supplying them 
free to the Lord's children who have the time and heart to give to 
this sort of preaching, but who could not afford to pay for the 
one-thousandth part of what they could wisely circulate. 

Nor would it be right to absorb the general fund, called "Tract 
Fund," in this work, for already it finds more to do than it can 
do, in the other branches of the work. (The Tract Fund will do 
this, however, toward putting a little ammunition in the hands of 
those who would be sure to use it and that wisely: It will pay the 
subscription for one year on five tracts quarterly to any WATCH 
TOWER subscriber too poor to purchase them, who will send in 
the request.) Besides, some deeply interested in the OLD 
THEOLOGY "hail" desire such a special fund so that they may 
specially help and forward that part of the work. 

A start has already been made in this direction. One sister 
contributes $68 for 3000 tracts, quarterly, this year (12,000 
tracts in all), to be sent to Baptist ministers throughout the 
United States. We have thought best to fill this order by sending 
Tract No. I to all as a sample, so far as it will go, and 
accordingly the 12,000 are already send out. As there are about 
22,000 Baptist ministers, this sister's wise stewardship of the 
Lord's funds entrusted to her care sends some "meat in due 
season" to more than one half of the Baptist preachers-some of 
them we trust will produce an abundant yield. 

A brother of this city, himself so situated that he cannot engage 
in circulating them, as he would like to do, contributed $1 10 for 
20,000 tracts, of any or all the numbers of the present year, for 
circulation in the cities of Pittsburgh and Allegheny: remarking 
that he knew of no other way of doing so much good with the 
same amount of money; that he could think of no better topic for 
the general reader than Tract No. I, and that even if he could 
prepare as good, only about one half as many, for the amount of 
money, could be procured in the ordinary way from printers; 
adding that, if permitted, he hoped from time to time to provide 
for others of our large cities, thus to aid representatively in 



preaching the truth to thousands who as yet know only very 
imperfectly— 

"The message of salvation 

From God's own holy Word. " 

The work was taken hold of here with a will by some who 
appreciate the privilege of the service, (some doing more and 
some less) three brethren and five sisters having already 
distributed about 6,000-to church-goers, to street car 
passengers, etc. A plan found to be good, is to have along also 
some of the Arp Tracts, which are less expensive (and supplied 
free), to give to such as appear less likely to become interested. 

If all TOWER readers, not otherwise in the service, would take 
hold of this work earnestly, a million or two of these "hail" 
stones would quickly be poured forth to sweep away the refuge 
oflies.-Isa. 28:17. 



R1121 :page 1 

MISTAKEN EXPEDIENCY. 

Among Romanists there is a recognized principle, which might 
be termed the law of expediency; which, briefly expressed, is— 
"The end justifies the means." The all important end is the glory 
of the Church, let the means be what they may; and every reader 
of history knows how vile the means have been. And while 
Protestants do not admit this principle openly, and are scarcely 
aware that they admit it to any extent, the question of 
expediency is often raised, and sometimes with considerable 
bitterness, against the truth-the old theology of the Lord and the 
apostles and prophets. 

Very many of God's children who long since got their eyes open 
to the fallacy of the doctrine of everlasting torment, and who 
realize it to be a horrible blasphemy against God's character, 
permit Satan to seal their lips, and to destroy their influence as 
children of the light, by getting them to cover their light with the 
bushel of expediency. He raises before their minds dreadful 
pictures of what would result if this truth, which so much 
relieved their minds and refreshed their hearts, and which lifted 
them into a new atmosphere of joy and peace and love, should 
become generally known. He points out that they first 
approached the Lord through fear and under the influence of this 
error, -without pointing out that they might have received the 
Lord much sooner under the presentation of the truth, and under 
the constraining power of love. He points out that they 
themselves had finally found peace while holding this error, but 
does not mention how unsatisfactory a peace it was, which 
continually had unrest for fear of a final slip into eternal 



torment, either of themselves or their loved ones. Nor does the 
adversary point out that the proportion in which any obtained 
peace was to the degree that they forgot or disbelieved the 
horrible error. 

The adversary, furthermore, urges the inexpediency of 
proclaiming this and other truths on still other grounds; he 
reminds his victim that though neither reason nor the Bible 
endorses the doctrine, yet upon it all the creeds and sects of 
Christendom are built; and that to attack that error is to attack 
the entire nominal church and to gain the opposition in every 
way of the most powerful human institution; and that he has no 
chance for success; and that if he should succeed in 
overthrowing the error, it would shake and break sectarianism 
entirely, create a great commotion, and paralyze sectarian efforts 
at home and in foreign lands. 

He does not suggest, however, that the breaking of false creeds, 
confessions, and of the sects which hold them, would be a great 
blessing to all the true "wheat," the true church, and would result 
in bringing them into true unity upon the basis of God's Word 
and under the bonds of love; and that the only evil would be to 
the "tare" class, who have no knowledge of God's true church 
whose names are written in heaven, and who recognize only 
sectarian systems and memberships whose names are written on 
earth; and who worship and serve the institutions of their own 
organizing. 

Alas ! How many are bound by mistaken expediency, almost as 
firmly as they 

R1122:pagel 

were formerly by errors, from which these truths, which they are 
ashamed or afraid to acknowledge, set them free. 

To stimulate this mistaken idea of expediency, the adversary 
emboldens some of the shallowest minds and hearts to 
unreasoningly cry aloud, "Awful heresy!" "Infidelity!" etc. 

This he does to draw attention away from the fact that it is the 
error that is "awful," "blasphemous," "heresy," and veritable 
infidelity to God's Word. 

This cry comes with greatest emphasis from those whose earthly 
interests of bread and butter, and ease, and comfort, and 
reputation, and honor, and pride are bound up with this long 
admitted and established doctrine of fear. And every zealous 
supporter of so-called Orthodoxy re-echoes the cry of alarm; and 
as the message of truth, "the good tidings of great joy to all 
people," goes forth, it is everywhere confronted by the zealous 
heralds of the bad tidings-of eternal misery to all people, except 
a holy few who expect to become so God-like that they will 
praise God the louder when they witness the wretched despair 
and hopeless eternal torment of their fellow-creatures, who were 



so unfortunate as never to have received as good a chance as 
themselves to escape the awful ruin. 

These notes of alarm from Babylon, probably hinder many of 
the Lord's sheep from apprehending his truth. Having trusted too 
implicitly to the teachings of a self-exalted clergy, and failed to 
search the Scriptures for themselves, like the "noble Bereans," 
that their faith might stand in the wisdom of God and not in the 
wisdom which this world teacheth, they are afraid to disregard 
their commands now,— afraid to believe their own senses in the 
study of God's Word. 

Let us remind such of the words of the Prophet Isaiah- "Their 
fear toward me is taught by the precepts of men; " and again, of 
the Apostle Paul- "For God hath not given to us the spirit of 
fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. " (Isa. 
29:13; 2 Tim. 1:7.) That the spirit of love and of a sound mind is 
a power, "Orthodoxy" fails to see. The scourge of torment, the 
mean incentive of fear, is held to be a necessity, to restrain men 
from vice and to inspire them to morality and virtue and secure 
their admission to heaven when they die. 

Before considering the wisdom of God's course, let us first 
inquire, Has the doctrine of fear accomplished the end which it 
claims to have in view? No, we answer. The result of this error 
have only been bad, and that continually; and any good which 
has been accomplished is due, not to the error, but to the all- 
powerful truth, -withstanding the friction of error which 
everywhere opposed its progress. As the result of this error, 
what do we see, after centuries of effort ostensibly to convert the 
world, to turn men to God and righteousness? We see just what 
we should expect to be the miserable fruitage of such doctrine— 
that it has not only failed to accomplish the world's conversion, 
which Orthodoxy claims to be its mission, but that it has 
accomplished the demoralization of the church (nominal) and of 
all influenced to any extent by it. 

Under its influence and misrepresentation of the character of 
God, every device of tyranny and persecution and torture, in the 
name of God and religion, has flourished, and largely 
accomplished its diabolical mission of stamping out truth and 
righteousness. And as a consequence, we see to-day great 
antichristian systems of error, built up by centuries 

R1122:page2 

of false teaching and so subtle in their influence as to deceive, if 
it were possible, the very elect. Their form of godliness draws 
one class which desires to live godly; but their lack of the power 
of godliness, truth, soon deadens every real spiritual aspiration. 
They also draw and encourage a mean hypocritical class of 
those who assume the garb of Christianity for mercenary and 
base purposes. And amid an overwhelming host of deceived and 
hypocritical pretenders, those possessing the genuine article of 



living faith in the true Word of God, and vital godliness, are to- 
day at an immense discount among the loudest professors of 
Christianity. And thinking men of the world-and the thinkers 
are fast multiplying-are beginning to see, in the light of a better 
civilization, that this monstrous blasphemy of eternal torment 
has no foundation in common sense and that it can in no sense 
be compatible with their natural ideas of morality and virtue and 
godliness: and, say such, if the Bible teaches this doctrine, as all 
branches of the church claim, the Bible must be a bad book, and 
the God of the Bible, if there be such a God, is unworthy of love 
or worship, or even respect. And some to whom nature and 
reason whisper, There must be a God, conclude that nature and 
reason are the only channels through which he may be known or 
traced. And thus the thinking and nobler minded of the world 
are driven to Infidelity and Atheism; and the ignorant and the 
credulous, while they still fear that eternal torment may be a 
reality, are generally willing to incur the unlikely risk of 
realizing it, that they may enjoy the pleasures of sin while the 
opportunity lasts. And the heathen nations never have been and 
never will be influenced by it. 

Such, in brief, have been the results of the doctrine of fear. It has 
repelled the world from God, and reduced (nominal) Christianity 
to sham and hypocrisy, and stimulated vice and immorality to 
the crimes of treason against God and persecution of truth and 
virtue. 

But let us now consider, on the other hand, what power there is 
in the spirit of love and of a sound mind. A sound mind is a 
reasonable mind, a mind governed, neither by fickle impulse, 
nor by superstition, fear, prejudice, nor any other than the 
noblest faculty which God has given it, namely reason. And 
reason, if not perverted by pride, or prejudiced by false teaching, 
leads directly to the fountain of truth in God's inspired 
Revelation (See, M. DAWN, Vol. I., Chap, iii.); and to one so 
led, faith in the inspired revelation of the omnipotent God is a 
most reasonable thing. This reasonable faith, rooted and 
grounded in the divine testimonies and promises, calls into 
exercise all the noblest faculties of our moral nature and centers 
the affections upon the great Author of all truth, whom to know 
is to love and worship and adore. And this faith, working by 
love, purifies the heart and transforms the character into the 
glorious likeness of the blessed God. 

Such is the power of love and of a sound mind. It serves God 
from purest filial love and gratitude, and the only fear it knows 
is that filial fear of failure to fully manifest love and 
thankfulness, which is the fear mentioned by the Psalmist 
(111:10) as the beginning of wisdom. Perfect love casts out all 
servile fear, and brings the studious and devoted servants of God 
into active co-operation with all his benevolent plans for the 
blessing of all his creatures. This is the kind of service God 



accepts: Those who worship him acceptably must worship him 
in spirit and in truth-in love and verity, and not hypocritically 
through fear. 

Such results never have been and never can be produced by the 
"orthodox" doctrine of fear. Why, then, should it be deemed 
expedient to suppress the true plan of God and still advocate the 
blasphemous error of eternal torment? 

The earnest, sound-minded Christian sees no sufficient reason; 
though the supporters of Orthodoxy see very grave and weighty 
ones. They see at once that to renounce this doctrine would be to 
destroy their systems of theology and completely disintegrate 
their various organizations, to give the lie to their false 
teachings, to expose a vast amount of hypocrisy and deceit in 
high places, to discontinue the gains of oppression, and to 
humble their pride and assumed dignities and honors in the dust. 
And truly, before this spirit of fear could be supplanted by the 
spirit of love and of a sound mind among the great masses of 
men, these, released from the bondage of fear and not yet 
restrained and constrained by the power of love and of a sound 
mind, would suddenly become a dangerous element in the 
world. 

And just this, which "Orthodoxy" fears, the Scriptures declare 
shall actually come to pass— a time of trouble such as was not 
since there was a nation— a fearful recompense to great Babylon 
for her blasphemous misrepresentation of the character and plan 
of God. Fearful plagues are to be visited upon Babylon, and no 
wonder she raises the cry of alarm when she sees them coming. 
To preach the truth is not expedient, she declares,- "The end 
(the preservation of the old order of things) justifies the 
means;"- the perversion and suppression of truth. 

Had the truth been preached by the church from the days of the 
apostles to the present time, the centuries past would have so 
fully accomplished the development of true Christian character 
that the present time, we might safely say, would witness a truly 
"Christian world." But as it is, when the old errors are 
overthrown, it would be unreasonable to expect to see a sudden 
conversion of the world to truth and righteousness. Time is an 
important element in the arrangements for the world's 
conversion. It will require a thousand years to accomplish it 
under the reign of Christ, and since the church (nominal) has 
frittered away nearly two thousand years and accomplished 
worse than nothing in this direction, she must reap the reward of 
her doings— the punishment due her misarranged systems. 

God's time to speak has come; and let the prayer of every loyal 
son of God be, O send forth thy light and thy truth! God will 
send it forth and is sending it forth: he will vindicate his 
character and 

R1123 : page 2 



his cause before an astonished world, and the glorious end will 
be the peaceable fruits of righteousness in all the earth, when the 
truth is fully known and its blessed influences have had 
sufficient time to accomplish the great work of transformation. 

If we would be in harmony, and co-workers together with God, 
therefore, our chief business in life must be the vindication of 
his character by the preaching of his truth. And so far as our 
testimony can reach, let the message of his gracious designs be 
coupled with the wholesome restraints which his justice insures. 
There shall be a just recompense of reward to every man. The 
eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the 
good, and every work shall be brought into judgment, with 
every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. Not 
the benevolent gift of a cup of cold water shall lose its reward; 
nor shall any wilful sin against light and opportunity escape its 
deserved punishment. 

It is our business to declare these truths, to preach the gospel 
without any mixture with the traditions of men, to declare the 
whole counsel of God, as the church should have done since the 
days of the apostles, and the results God will take care of, and 
out of the confusion of the great time of trouble he will bring 
order and harmony and a grateful recognition of and submission 
to his righteous authority, based upon the principles of truth and 
justice. Our effort should always be, however, to accomplish a 
conversion so complete that it will not only turn men away in 
disgust from the old errors, but also turn them fully to 
righteousness. And such conversions there are, when the truth is 
wisely presented by those who are imbued with its blessed spirit. 
It is only by the presentation of a measure of truth sufficient to 
turn men away from doctrinal errors, and yet leave them in their 
sins, that violence and confusion shall be brought about. 

We may not teach men that God is so loving that justice can 
never exert its power, but, on the other hand, that his justice is 
so unswerving that his love can in no degree conflict with it, or 
act contrary to it, and that so important was it that his justice 
should stand inviolate, that only through the sacrifice of his only 
begotten Son did his love accomplish his purpose for man's 
redemption and restitution: "For God so loved the world that he 
gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him 
might not perish, but have everlasting life. " 

Through Christ alone, therefore, is the great salvation attainable- 
-"through faith in his blood." Without faith in his blood, we can 
only be judged by God by the rule of strict justice, and it is a 
fearful thing to fall thus into the hands of the living God; for 
outside of God's plan for our redemption through Christ, his 
justice can only condemn us as unworthy of life. Nor do we 
teach that having once come to a clear knowledge of the truth, 
we may reject it and sin against it with impunity, or postpone 
our personal submission and conformity to it, without receiving 



the penalty for so doing;— the penalty for rejection of full light 
and opportunity being the second death, from which there is no 
recovery. By one offering he hath perfected forever them that 
are sanctified by the truth; but that offering intelligently 
rejected, there remaineth no more a sacrifice for sin, but a 
certain looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which 
shall devour the adversary. But having come to the knowledge 
of the truth-to which God purposes to bring all men-and to 
obedience, and to faith in God's appointed way of salvation, not 
attempting to climb up like a thief or a robber by some other 
way, the end of such faith and obedience will be everlasting life. 

It is expedient, therefore, from God's standpoint of view, that the 
truth should be fully and clearly proclaimed without regard to 
the cry of alarm from Babylon, and equally without regard to the 
disastrous consequences to that system, against which the fiat of 
destruction has gone forth from Jehovah. "This is the will of 
God, who will have all men to be saved and to come to a 
knowledge of the truth. " 

So far as our knowledge and observation have gone, a 
knowledge, even of the general outlines of God's plan, does not 
produce carelessness or indifference or a desire to procrastinate 
coming into conformity with it. On the other hand, we do know 
of hundreds of sound conversions from sin and infidelity and 
from every evil course. At the present time there are on our list 
of subscribers to the TOWER five names of criminals in various 
prisons who have received the truth, and who have been 
converted by it. And another whose term expired a few months 
ago, having been imprisoned for highway robbery, was soundly 
converted through the reading of The Plan of The Ages and the 
TOWER while in prison, and has now become an active 
minister of the gospel, and in the past two months has sold 800 
copies of DAWN, Vol. I. Raised in the Methodist church under 
the influence and fear of the doctrine of eternal torment, he 
became a highway robber, while under the influence of the truth 
he became a minister of the gospel. Yes, praise the Lord! it is 
expedient to preach the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but 
the truth; and we rejoice to know that God will continue to send 
forth his light and his truth until the earth is filled with his glory, 
and blessed is every man who is privileged to bear the message.

CHEERFULNESS. 



Cheerfulness is one of the loveliest graces of the Christian 
character. It belongs to those noble natures whose very presence 
carries sunshine with them wherever they go. 



Sometimes we look into a face which is so cold and repulsive, 
dark and gloomy, that it makes us feel almost blue to look at it, 
and which betokens no joy in the heart, no nobility in the soul, 
no generosity in the nature; the whole character as cold as an 
iceberg. And again we meet a face so bright, smiling, cheerful, 
happy, that one glimpse of it does our very souls good, and is 
like an inspiration to us. And we feel more cheerful ourselves. If 
we possess a hopeful spirit it will enable us to discern the silver 
lining of the darkest cloud, behind which ever shines the light of 
divine promise and help. 

True religion is not gloomy, "her ways are ways of pleasantness, 
and all her paths are peace. "-Selected. 



"Blessed is he who learns to profit by his wants and infirmities, 
and who, in all the privation he endures, is still submissive to the 
Word of God." 



Much remains 



To conquer still; Peace hath her victories, 
No less renowned than War; new foes arise 
Threatening to bind our souls with secular chains. 
Help us to save free conscience from the paw, 
Of hireling wolves, whose gospel is their maw. 



-Milton.

COURAGE! PRESS ON. 

Tired! well, what of that? 
Didst fancy life was spent on beds of ease, 
Fluttering the rose leaves scattered by the breeze? 
Come, rouse thee! work while it is called to-day: 
Courage! arise! go forth upon thy way. 

Lonely! and what of that? 
Some must be lonely; 'tis not given to all 
To feel a heart responsive rise and fall, 
To blend another life within its own: 
Work can be done in loneliness. Work on. 

Dark! well, what of that? 
Didst fondly dream the sun would never set? 
Dost fear to lose thy way? Take courage yet! 
Learn thou to walk by faith, and not by sight; 
Thy steps will guided be, and guided right.

With lessons none to learn, and naught but play?

CALAMITIES-WHY PERMITTED. 

"EXCEPT YE REPENT, 
YE SHALL ALL LIKEWISE PERISH." 

"There were present at that season some who told him of the 
Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. 
And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these 
Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they 
suffered such things? I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye 
shall all likewise perish. 

"Or, those eighteen, upon whom the tower of Siloam fell, and 
slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that 
dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye 
shall all likewise perish. "-Luke 13:1-5. 

Noble and good in the sight of both God and man are the 
generous impulses, of charity and sympathy, awakened by great 
calamities in recent years. And when this is said, it leaves little 
more of good to be said favorable to calamities or their 
influence. 

While these charities should not be misconstrued to signify that 
God's consecrated saints are rapidly multiplying-for many of 
the charitable are not the consecrated, and some are even 
infidels,— yet they are an evidence that at least some of the 
original God-likeness of our race remains; that it has not been 
wholly obliterated by the degradation of the fall, nor wholly 
poisoned by the bad theology of the dark ages. While we live in 
perhaps as selfish and money-loving a period as any known to 
history, yet millions of dollars are generously poured forth to aid 
suffering humanity. And yet many who in times of calamitous 
distress show that they have a tender spot, somewhere, in their 
hearts, would and do at other times lend time and brain and skill 
to the arts of war, and in designing the most horrible implements 
of warfare; and on occasions when bitter passions are aroused 
would relentlessly and pitilessly slaughter a thousand times as 
many as the accidents of nature. Yet, for all this showing of the 
two elements in the same men, we rejoice 

R1124:page3 



that the God- like element of sympathy exists as a partial offset 
to the devilish qualities of selfishness and heartlessness, which, 
under the degrading influence of man's fallen state, have grown 
strong during the past six thousand years. 

Preparatory to looking carefully, reasonably and Scripturally at 
the question of why does God permit calamities, let us note 
some of the absurd views of some Christian people, who should 
know God's Word and character much better than they seem to. 
Some whose hearts overflow with sympathy and God-like love 
in the presence of great calamities (which proves their hearts 
better and more sound than their theology), declare that God is 
the director and cause of all disasters and troubles. Hence 
whatever men may do to alleviate such distresses would, 
according to this false view, be so much done in opposition to 
God; and whatever love and sympathy they feel, is as much 
sentiment opposed to God's sentiments, —which are thus made 
to appear malicious. 

But the hideousness of such a character, as is thus ascribed to 
the God of love, is intensified, when the same good, tender- 
hearted, but wrong-headed, Papacy-deluded people (whose 
theology was formed in the "dark ages" when the Bible 
doctrines concerning God's character and plan had become over- 
grown with papal superstition and human tradition), tell us their 
faith in God and their view of his character, is that, He not only 
looks without pity or sympathy upon man's present calamities 
and distresses, and fore-ordained them, but that he has 
furthermore fore-ordained and made fullest preparation for 
engulfing the vast majority of his creatures in a calamity in 
comparison with which all the horrors of all earth's calamities 
united in one would be nothing;— but mere preludes to that most 
awful, indescribable torment, which would be wholly 
unendurable, but that God with fiendish cruelty will perpetuate 
life under such awful conditions, forever and forever, in order to 
have them suffer, and will never relieve them. And why? Simply 
because, when told that such was God's character and plan, they 
would not love him, nor praise as good and just such a plan; or 
because millions of others had died in ignorance of the Lord 
Jesus, through faith in whom, alone, any can be acceptable 
before God. 

It is surprising that any who possess the spirit of God, to any 
extent, can thus blaspheme his holy name? It is surprising that 
they do not know more of the character of the Creator than this, 
even without the Bible testimony to his character of love and 
justice, to advise them of his plan in Christ for blessing all the 
families of the earth; the declaring of which plan constitutes the 
"good tidings of great joy [not of eternal torment] which shall be 
unto all people. " Verily, God is more villified by many of his 
children than by the infidel world. And yet, how strange ! the 
very Bible which declares God's true character of love and 



justice, they have been led to consider as the authority for these 
devilish doctrines and false interpretation of our Lord's parables 
and of the symbols of the book of Revelation, originated by 
those who during the "dark ages" used to burn and torment Bible 
believers. 

GOD'S LO VE-HO W SHO WN. 

When we declare that whatever there is of love and sympathy 
in man, is only the remnant of the original divine likeness, in 
which Adam was created, not wholly effaced by six thousand 
years of degradation in sin, it at once raises the question: In what 
way does God manifest his sympathy and love in such 
emergencies, when even the hearts of fallen human beings are 
touched, with sympathy and love, to acts of kindness and 
succor? 

A correct answer is, that God is represented in every act of 
kindness done, whether by his children or by the world; because 
their actions under such circumstances are the results, in some 
measure, of his character and disposition. And yet this answer is 
not full enough to be satisfactory. But, thank God, a fuller 
investigation, in the light of his Word, reveals a boundless 
sympathy on God's part,- providing also an abundant succor, 
which is shortly to be revealed. 

But why does not God immediately succor his creatures from 
calamities? Or, to go still farther back, why does he who has all 
wisdom to know and all power to prevent, permit calamities,— 
cyclones, earthquakes, tidal-waves, destructive floods, 
pestilences, etc.? And while we are about it, we may as well 
include all the evils which God could, if he would, prevent -all 
the forms of sickness and pain and death; every form of 
destruction— wars, murders, etc.; every thing which causes pain 
or trouble to those willing to do and be in harmony with God? 
The answer to one of these questions will be the answer to every 
question on the subject; for all human evils are related and have 
a common source or cause. 

To fully comprehend this cause, we must go far back, to the 
very beginning of sickness, pain, death and sorrow,-to the 
Garden of Eden, where neither famine, pestilence, cyclones, 
earthquakes, nor death in any form was permitted; where man 
and his surroundings and conditions were pronounced "very 
good," even by God himself, and certainly greatly appreciated 
by man, who had to be driven out and prevented from returning 
by the fiery sword which kept the way of access to the life- 
sustaining fruits of the trees of the garden. 

How came it that the Creator, who so graciously provided for 
the life and comfort of his creatures, and who communed with 
them and gave them his blessing and the promise of everlasting 
life upon the sole condition of continued obedience, should so 



change in his attitude toward his creatures, as to drive them from 
the enjoyments of those Eden comforts and blessings, out into 
the unprepared earth- to toil and weariness and insufficient 
sustenance, and thus to death? 

We must remember that only the Garden of Eden was 
"prepared," and fit for man's comfortable enjoyment of the favor 
of life. The preparation of the whole earth for man, requiring in 
a natural way seven thousand years more to entirely fit it for the 
habitation of perfect, obedient, human children of God, the 
Creator specially or miraculously prepared the Garden of Eden 
in advance merely as a fit place for Adam's trial. God foresaw 
the fall of his creature, and provided that the penalty for sin, 
"dying thou shalt die, " instead of being suddenly inflicted as by 
a lightning stroke, or other speedy method, should be served out 
gradually by conflict with the unfavorable conditions (of 
climate, sterility of soil, storms, miasms, thorns, weeds, etc.,) of 
the as yet unprepared earth. 

Adam and Eve, therefore, went forth from Eden convicts, under 
sentence of death; self-convicted under the most just of all 
judges, their Creator and friend. The convicts esteemed it a 
mercy to be let die gradually rather than suddenly; while to the 
Creator and judge this was expedient because of a plan he had 
for their future, in which such experience with imperfect 
conditions would be of great value;— a plan for the increase of 
the race, and for its discipline and final redemption and 
restoration. 

The death penalty, inflicted in this manner, God foresaw would 
furnish man, through experience, such a lesson on the exceeding 
sinfulness of sin and its baneful results as would never need to 
be repeated; -a lesson, therefore, which will profit all who learn 
it to all eternity; especially when Christ's Millennial reign of 
righteousness shall manifest in contrast the fruits of 
righteousness: God also designing that the exercise of man's 
mental faculties in coping with the disturbances and 
imperfections of his surroundings and in inventing reliefs, and 
the exercise of his moral faculties in combating his own 
weaknesses, and the calls upon his sympathy should prove 
beneficial. 

Had the sentence of God (in addition to a loss of Eden's 
comforts and experience with sin and death,) condemned his 
creatures to an eternity of torment and anguish, as so many now 
believe and teach, who could defend such a sentence, or call the 
Judge just, or loving, or in any sense good? Surely no one of a 
sound mind! 

But when it is seen that the Scriptures teach that death 
(extinction), and not life in torment, was the penalty pronounced 
and inflicted, all is reasonable. God has a right to demand 
perfect obedience from his perfect creature when placed under 



perfect conditions, as in Adam's case. And the decree that none 
shall live everlastingly except the perfect, is both a wise and a 
just provision for the everlasting welfare of all God's creatures. 

There is a depth of meaning in the Creator's words, as he sent 
forth his fairly tried and justly condemned creatures, among the 
thorns and briars, to labor and pain, and sorrow, and disease, and 
to be subject to the casualties and calamities of nature's 
unfinished work. He said:- "Cursed is the ground FOR THY 
SAKE:" i.e., the earth in general is in its present imperfect 
condition for your profit and experience; even though you may 
not esteem it so. Adam would have sought to retain continual 
access to the garden fruits, to avoid severe labor and to enable 
him to fully sustain his vital powers and live forever; but in 
loving consideration for man's ultimate good, no less than in 
justice, and in respect of his own sentence of death, God 
prevented this and guarded the way back to the garden, in order 
that the death sentence should not fail of execution, in order that 
sinners should not live forever and thus perpetuate sin. 

The children of the condemned pair inherited their fall, 
imperfections and weaknesses, and also the penalties of these; 
for "who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?" The whole 
race, therefore, 

R1125 : page 3 

as convict laborers, have not only been learning what sin and 
evil are, and their undesirable results, but by their labor and skill 
they are serving to prepare the earth and bring it as a whole to 
the full perfection designed for it, and illustrated in the condition 
of Eden-ready for a further purpose of God of which none but 
his children (and not all of them) are made aware through the 
Scriptures. 

We can see, then, that labor and toil were prescribed for man's 
good. They have kept him so employed that he could not plan 
and consummate evil to the same extent that he otherwise would 
have done. And as the earth becomes more fertile, approaching 
perfection, man's vitality becomes less; so that now, with greater 
leisure to plot and scheme and grow wise in evil, the period of 
life in which to do so is shorter. What a mercy in disguise 
present shortness of life is, under present circumstances. Were 
some of our "shrewd business men" who accumulate millions of 
money, and grasp great power, in a few short years, to live 930 
years, as Adam did, what might we expect but that one man, or 
at most a syndicate or trust, would own every foot of land, 
control every drop of water and every breath of air, and have the 
rest of the race for their dupes and slaves? 

God's action, then, in exposing his creatures to death, pain and 
various calamities, it must first of all be seen, was one which 
related only to his present life on earth, and to no other; for of 



any continuance of life, in any other locality, God did not give 
him the slightest intimation. On the contrary, the words of the 

R1125 : page 4 

penalty were, "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return, "-- 
"dying thou shalt die. "-Gen. 3:19; 2:17, margin. 

True, God gave promise that, somehow and at some time, a son 
of the woman should accomplish a deliverance. But it was vague 
and indefinite then, merely a glimmer of hope, to show them 
that though God dealt severely with them, and on lines of law 
and justice, he yet sympathized with them, and would, 
ultimately, without violating justice or ignoring his own 
righteous sentence of death, bring them succor. 

Paul tells us that God adopted a method for the recovery of man, 
from that original sentence of death which came upon all as the 
result of Adam's fall, which would show the justice of his 
sentence and the unchangeableness of his decrees, and yet 
permit such as are sick of sin to use their experience wisely, and 
to return to harmony and obedience to their Creator and his just 
and reasonable laws and regulations. 

This divine plan, by which God could remain just and 
unchangeable in his attitude toward sin and sinners, and yet 
release the well-disposed from the penalty of sin (death and 
disfavor), is stated by the Apostle in Rom. 3:24-26. 

In brief, this plan provided that another man who, by obedience 
to the law of God, should prove his worthiness of eternal life, 
might, by the willing sacrifice of the life to which he was thus 
proved worthy, redeem the forfeited life of Adam and of his 
posterity who lost life through him; for it is written, "In Adam 
all die," and "By the offence of one sentence of condemnation 
came on all men."-l Cor. 15:22; Rom. 5:12,18. 

Since the condemnation to death was thus upon all men, and 
since another man newly created and inexperienced as Adam 
was, though just as favorably situated, would have been 
similarly liable to fall, God devised the marvelous plan of 
transferring his only begotten Son from the spiritual to the 
human nature, and thus provided a man fit for sacrifice- "the 
man Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all;" "who, 
though he was rich [though he was possessed of glory and honor 
and riches of wisdom and power above both angels and men], 
nevertheless for our sakes became poor [humbling himself to a 
lower nature, even as a man, becoming obedient even unto 
death] that we through his poverty might be made rich."-l Tim. 
2:5; 2 Cor. 8:9. 

Thus the one first created, "the firstborn of all creation" (Col. 
1:15), "the beginning of the creation of God" (Rev. 3:14), the 
one who had known God's character longer, more fully and 
more intimately than any other being, the one in fact who had 



been Jehovah's chief and honored, intelligent and active agent in 
the creation of angels as well as of men, the one by whom all 
things were made, and aside from whom not anything was made 
(John 1:3; Col. 1:16,17) -this great being, Jehovah's Prime 
Minister, and next to himself in dignity, the Almighty entrusted 
with the great work of redeeming and restoring mankind. 

To redeem them would cost the sacrifice of his own life as their 
ransom-price, with all that that implied of suffering and self- 
denial. To restore them (such of them as shall prove worthy— 
whosoever wills,) will require the exercise of divine power to 
open the prison-house of death, and to break the fetters of sin 
and prejudice and superstition, and give to all the redeemed the 
fullest opportunity to decide whether they love good or evil, 
righteousness or sin, truth or error, and to destroy all who love 
and work iniquity, and to develop and perfect again all who love 
and choose life upon its only condition-righteousness. 

To know the Father's plan and his privilege of co-operation in its 
execution, was to appreciate it and joyfully engage therein. 
Willingly our Lord Jesus laid aside the glory of the higher nature 
which he had had with the Father from before the creation of 
man. (John 17:5; 2 Cor. 8:9.) He was "made flesh" (John 1:14; 
Heb. 2:14), became a man at thirty years of age, and then began 
the great work of sacrifice, the sacrifice of himself, a perfect 
man, for the cancellation of the sin of the first man, to recover 
Adam and his race by dying on their behalf, as their Redeemer. 
By giving to Justice the price of their liberty from divine 
condemnation, he secured the legal right to cancel the sentence 
of condemnation to death against them, and hence the right to 
resurrect or restore to life and to all the lost estate and blessings, 
"whomsoever he wills." (Rev. 22:17.) And he wills to restore all 
who shall prove worthy. And to prove who are worthy will be 
the object of the Millennial reign.-l Tim. 2:4; 2 Pet. 3:9. 

This fact that our Lord's mission to earth at the first advent was 
to undo for the race, legally, the results of Adam's transgression, 
and to secure the right to resurrect them and restore them, is 
clearly stated by the Apostle.-See, Rom. 5:5-12, 16-19,21; 1 
Cor. 15:21-24. 

Though tempted in all points like as we (his "brethren") are, he 
ignored his own will (Luke 22:42; John 4:34; 5:30) and all 
suggestions from others contrary to God's plan (Matt. 16:23; 
Luke 4:4,8,12), and obeyed God implicitly. And therein lay the 
secret of his success. Temptations did not overcome him, as they 
did even the perfect man Adam, because of the fulness of his 
consecration to the divine will and plan; and this fulness of 
consecration and trust was the result of his intimate knowledge 
of the Father and his unbounded confidence in his wisdom, love 
and power. He had recollection of his previous existence as a 
spirit being with the Father. (John 17:5; 3:12,13.) Our Lord's 
success, then, was the result of being rightly exercised by his 



knowledge of God; as it is written: "By his knowledge shall my 
righteous servant justify many, while bearing their iniquities." - 
Isa. 53:11. 

The suggestive thoughts here are two: First, that even a perfect 
man failed in trial because of the lack of full appreciation of 
God's greatness, goodness and resources. Secondly, the 
knowledge (as in Satan's case) would be valueless, if 
unaccompanied by sincere love and consecration to God's will. 
A lesson further, to Christ's "brethren," is, that knowledge and 
consecration are both essential to their following in the Master's 
footsteps. 

Among men he and his mission were not really known; even his 
most ardent followers and admirers at first supposed that his 
mission was merely to heal some of the sick Jews, and to 
advance their nation to the rulership of a dying world, and to be 
a teacher of morals; they saw not at first that his mission was to 
lay the foundation of a world-wide empire, which should not 
only include the living, but also the dead, of Adam's race, and 
which should insure peace and joy everlastingly to all the 
worthy, by eradicating, forever, sin and all who love it after 
fully comprehending its character in contrast with righteousness. 
Even his friends and disciples were slow to realize these grand 
dimensions of his work, though he continually repeated them, 
and bore witness, saying: "The Son of man came to give his life 
a ransom for many;" "Verily, verily, the hour is coming* when 
the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that 
hear [obey] shall live. " "The Lord hath sent me to preach 
deliverance to the captives [of death] and recovering of sight to 
the [mentally, morally and physically] blind; to set at liberty 
them that are bruised" -injured by the Adamic fall. -Matt. 20:28; 
John 5:25; Luke 4:18. 

The sacrifice of the Redeemer's all, as man's ransom price, was 
offered at the time he was thirty years old-at his baptism. And 
there the offering was accepted by Jehovah, as marked by his 
anointing with the spirit. Thenceforth, the three and a half years 
of his ministry he spent in using up the consecrated life already 
offered; and this he completed at Calvary. There the price of our 
liberty was paid in full. "It is finished!" It holds good; it is 
acceptable by the grace of God, as the offset and covering for 
every weakness and sin of the first man, and his posterity, 
resulting either directly, or indirectly, from the first 
disobedience and fall. All that is necessary since, for a full 
return to divine favor and communion, and to an inheritance in 
the Paradise of God, which 

R1126:page4 

the great Redeemer in due time has promised to establish in the 
entire earth, as at first in the Garden of Eden, is, a recognition of 
sin, full repentance, and a turning from sin to righteousness. 



Christ will establish righteousness in the earth by the Kingdom 
of God, which he has promised shall be established, and for 
which he has bidden us wait and hope, and for which he taught 
us to pray, "Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth even 
as it is done in heaven." 

Under that blessed and wise rule of Christ as King of nations,* 
all the evil, depraved tendencies inherited from the fall and from 
the six thousand years of degradation, will be restrained, held in 
check, by super-human wisdom, love and power; and all being 
brought to a clear knowledge of the truth in its every phase, all 
will be fairly and fully tested. The lovers of righteousness will 
be perfected and given control of the perfected earth, while 
those loving unrighteousness under that clear light of knowledge 
and experience will, as followers of Satan's example, be utterly 
destroyed in the Second Death. The first death is the destruction 
to which all were subjected by Adam's sin, but from which all 
were redeemed by the Lord Jesus' sacrifice; and the second 
death is that destruction which will overtake those who, though 
redeemed by Christ from the first death, shall, by their own 
wilful conduct, merit and receive death again. This second death 
means utter destruction, without hope of another redemption or 
resurrection; for Christ dieth no more. Nor could any good 
reason for their further trial be assigned; for the trial granted 
during the Millennial age under Christ, as Judge, will be a 
thorough and fair and individual and final trial— 1 Cor. 15:25. 



*Sinaitic MS. omits the words and now is. 



*Not visibly in flesh, however, for he is no longer flesh, having 
been highly exalted again, after he had finished the flesh-life by 
giving it as our ransom price.— See, "The Time at Hand," Chap. 

v. 



R1126:page4 

"YE SHALL ALL LIKEWISE PERISH" 
UNLESS YE REPENT. 

Death, in whatever form it may come, is perishing, ceasing to 
exist. All mankind, through Adam's transgression, came under 
condemnation to loss of life, to "perish, " "to be as though they 
had not been. " And only one way of escape from that 
condemnation has been provided. (Acts 4:12.) Because of 
Christ's redemptive work all may escape perishing by accepting 
the conditions of life. During Christ's Millennial reign those 
whom Pilate slew, and those upon whom the tower of Siloam 
fell, and all others of the race, sharers in the death penalty now 



upon all, will be released from the tomb, brought to a knowledge 
of Christ, his ransom work, and their privilege of repentance and 
full restitution to divine favor,-life, etc. Thus seen, the Adamic 
death penalty was-to perish; but it has been canceled by Christ's 
Ransom, so far as it relates to those who, when brought to know 
the Redeemer, shall forsake sin. No longer should it be regarded 
as a perished condition, but as a "sleep" (John 11:11-14; Matt. 
9:24; 1 Thes. 4:14; 5:10), from which the Redeemer will awaken 
all, to give each who did not have it before being overtaken by 
Adam's death, a full, individual opportunity to escape perishing 
and live forever. Yet, finally, all who shall fail to repent and lay 
hold upon the gracious Life-giver shall perish; they will fail to 
obtain the full restitution provided; they shall never see [perfect] 
life [full restitution] for the wrath or condemnation of God will 
abide on them, condemning them to death as unworthy of life. 
As this will be their second condemnation, and an individual 
one, so the penalty will be the second death, which will not be 
general to the race, but only upon such individuals as refuse 
God's favor of reconciliation and life. 

As our Lord Jesus used the calamities of his time, as illustrating 
the just penalty against all who do not flee sin and lay hold upon 
the Redeemer and Life-giver, so we use them. We declare that 
destruction, perishing, is the just penalty of sin taught in the 
Scriptures. We denounce the eternal torment theory, so 
generally believed by God's children, as unscriptural; as one of 
Satan's blasphemous slanders against God's character. And we 
proclaim that only by faith in the Redeemer, repentance and 
reformation, can the gift of God, eternal life through Jesus 
Christ our Lord, be obtained. Whoever hears the offer of life is 
responsible to the extent that he understands it; and according to 
God's promise and plan all mankind shall, at some time, either 
during the Gospel age, or during the coming Millennial age, be 
brought to a full, clear appreciation of these conditions and 
opportunities, with fullest opportunities for repentance and life. 

Calamities, then, are to be regarded, generally, as accidents, 
attributable to human imperfection and lack of experience, or to 
disturbances incidental to the preparation of the earth for its 
more quiet and perfect condition during the Sabbath or Seventh 
Thousand years (the Millennium), and for its state of absolute 
perfection forever after the Millennium, which, under Christ's 
direction, shall give it its finishing touches and make it fully 
ready for the redeemed race, which his reign shall prepare also 
to rightly use and enjoy and rule the perfected earth. And man is 
exposed to these calamities and accidents, and not defended 
from them by his Almighty Creator, because, first, man is a 
sinner condemned to death anyway, and is not to be spared from 
it, but must be allowed to pass through it; and secondly, by the 
present experiences with trouble and sorrow and pain, all of 
which are but elements of death, mankind is learning a lesson 
and laying up in store an experience with sin and its awful 



concomitants, sorrow, pain and death, which will be valuable in 
the Millennial age, when each shall be required to choose 
between good and evil. The evil they 

R1126:page5 

learn first, now; the good and its blessed results and rewards, but 
dimly seen now, will be fully displayed then,— during the 
Millennium. 

But some one inquires, If this be God's plan, for redeeming the 
world by the death of his Son and justifying and restoring all 
who believe in and accept of him, and obey and love 
righteousness, why did not the Millennial reign of Christ with its 
favorable conditions and powerful restraints begin at once, as 
soon as Christ had given the ransom price at Calvary; instead of 
compelling those who would follow righteousness, to sail 
through bloody seas and suffer for righteousness sake? Or else, 
why not have postponed the giving of the ransom until the close 
of the six thousand years of evil and the inauguration of the 
Millennial reign? Or, at least, if the present order of events is 
best in the divine wisdom, why does not God specially protect 
from calamities, accidents, sorrow, pain, death, etc., those who 
have fully accepted of Christ and who have sacrificed and are 
using their all in the service of righteousness? 

Ah yes! The subject would be incomplete were this point left 
untouched. The consecrated saints, the church of the Gospel age, 
are a "peculiar people," different from the rest of the redeemed 
race; and God's dealings with them are peculiar and different 
also. Inasmuch as it was God's purpose to highly honor and exalt 
our Lord Jesus far above all others, because of his faithful 
obedience even to self-sacrifice, so it was his purpose to select a 
"little flock" for his companionship in glory, who, after being 
justified by Christ's sacrifice and reconciled to God by the death 
of his Son, should develop so much of a likeness to his Son, by 
intently following his words and example, that they, like him 
(though far less fully than he because of weaknesses of the 
flesh), should likewise so love righteousness and truth, and so 
delight to do God's will, that they would do it at any cost or 
sacrifice of earthly pleasures, or comforts, or esteem among 
men— even unto death. 

The space of time between the giving of the ransom for all, and 
the establishment of the kingdom which is to bestow upon 
mankind the blessings purchased, is for the very purpose of 
selecting a "little flock" of under kings and priests, Christ's 
companions in the honors and work of the Kingdom, otherwise 
called, as a class, "the Bride, the Lamb's wife. " The selection of 
this class must take place during a time when evil, trouble and 
sin have sway in the world; for it is by the special opposition of 
evil and sin, to God's plan and to all in harmony with it, that 
these are to be specially tried and tested; that only "overcomers" 



shall be selected and given this very honorable and responsible 
position. 

Not only is this class required to follow after righteousness and 
truth, and to support them and oppose sin, to their present 
discomfort and loss, but they are required to do all this on the 
strength of faith, outward evidences being often contrary to 
faith. A part of their test is, that they must walk by faith and not 
by sight. They are to believe God's promises though every 
outward circumstance seems to contradict it. This is part of their 
lesson as well as part of their trial. 

They are to believe God's testimony, that death and trouble 
entered the world as a result of Adam's sin, and that a fall from 
perfection took place in Eden, no matter what speculations 
among scientists may suggest to the contrary,— as that Adam was 
evolved from an ape, and that the Bible story of the fall, the 
condemnation and the redemption are alike unscientific; that 
Christ, like Confucius, was a great teacher, but nothing more; 
that he accomplished no redemption and that none could have 
been needful or required. The saints are to shun all such 
babblings of science and philosophy, falsely so-called, and to 
walk by faith in God's revelation.- Rom. 5:12-20. 

Though they see errors flourish and Scriptural truths spurned 
and disregarded, they are to disregard numbers and human 
traditions and, by faith, hold to God's Word. Though told by 
God that they are redeemed and no longer under his 

R1127:page5 

condemnation and disfavor with the rest of the world, they are to 
believe and walk by faith, nothing doubting, even though they 
are not the recipients of special earthly favors, and even though 
they, like others, have a share of sickness, pain and death. 

Their advantages are often less than those of other men, and 
their course often much more up-hill and rough. They walk by 
faith and not by sight, however; they endure as seeing him who 
is invisible, and the crown which is invisible, and the kingdom 
which is invisible, and as though they already had everlasting 
life, though they die like other men. In all these things, yea, in 
everything, they are required to walk by faith and not by sight, if 
they would be crowned overcomers and made heirs in the 
coming kingdom. 

Their advantages are all invisible to the world, and are seen only 
by the eye of faith. Their peace and joy are dependent upon their 
knowledge and trust of God and his plan; and their knowledge 
and trust depend upon their faith in his Word of promise. By 
faith they "know [even when outward evidences seem contrary] 
that all things are working together" for their ultimate good, and 
that the glories and blessings of the future shall far over-balance 
all the trials and troubles and wounds of the present; and so 



believing from such a standpoint, it is well said that these have a 
joy and peace, even amid tribulation, which the world can 
neither give nor take away. 

What advantage, then, hath a true, consecrated Christian in the 
present time? Much every way; both in the life that now is, and 
also in that which is to come. All things are yours; for ye are 
Christ's, and Christ is God's, and ye are accepted of God in and 
through the merit of Christ. 



Soul, then know thy full salvation, 
Rise o'er sin and fear and care; 
Joy to find in every station, 
Something still to do or bear. 

No matter how dark the clouds, no matter how unfavorable the 
circumstance on its surface, thou hast the heavenly assurance, 
that- 

" All must work for good to thee. " 

Even those things which may seem to be, and to the world are, 
accidents, cannot be so regarded in connection with these so 
peculiarly precious in God's sight. Nothing transpires without 
your Father's knowledge —not even a sparrow falls, nor a hair of 
your heads. And since infinite wisdom, infinite love, and infinite 
power are pledged to our aid, and guarantee us against all that 
would not be for our ultimate good, with how much confidence 
and trust all such may free themselves from harassing care and 
anxiety, and with how much courage they may press on, 
committing their way unto the Lord, and engaging heart and 
hand and brain in his service; for we also "know that our labor is 
not in vain in the Lord. " Like their Master, such shall yet see 
results for all their travail of soul which will fully recompense or 
satisfy them. Such may rejoice even in tribulation, knowing the 
results. Even the families of the saints, and all that concerns 
them, are precious to the Lord for their sakes. 

Courage, then, dear family of God! Be strong! quit you like 
men! Endure hardness as good soldiers; endure as seeing the 
Lord and the prize, though they are invisible except to your eye 
of faith. Expect not to reign, nor to be exempted from trial and 
sufferings, until the battle is ended-until Evil (sin, as well as 
disaster, trouble and death, its accompaniments) shall be 
removed by our Redeemer, who soon is to take his great power 
and reign to deliver the groaning creation from all its present 
distresses. 

"Behold, we bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be 
unto all people." (Luke 2:10.) Let every thing that hath breath 
praise the Lord; for though for a little moment he hid his face 
and permitted calamities to scourge and destroy his creatures 
because of their transgression, yet in great mercy he hath 



provided our ransom price; yea, he hath highly exalted him to be 
both Priest and King to cleanse from sin, and to rule to perfect 
all who will then submit their hearts to him and obey him. From 
such he shall wipe away all tears; and sorrow and dying, and 
every evil, shall be no more. "Behold, I make all things new." 

Tell the whole world the blessed tidings; 
Speak of the time of rest that nears; 
Tell the oppressed of every nation 
Jubilee lasts a thousand years.

PAUL'S CHARGE TO TIMOTHY. 

"This charge [message] I commit to thee, son Timothy, in 
harmony with the teachings previously given thee [to guide 
thee], that by these thou mayest carry on the good contest, 
holding faith and a good conscience, which some having put 
away, concerning faith have made shipwreck. " 

"I give thee charge in the sight of God who quickeneth all 
things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate 
witnessed the good confession, that thou keep this 
commandment [Greek, entole— "this thing given in charge"-this 
doctrine given by divine inspiration] without spot, unrebukable, 
until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: which [good 
confession or sound faith] will be manifested in due time by that 
blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords- 
-the only one possessing immortality, inhabiting light 
inaccessible, whom no one of men has seen, nor is able to see, to 
whom be honor and power everlasting."- 1 Tim. 1:18,19; 6:13- 
16. 

We have frequently noticed and called attention to the earnest 
exhortations and careful instructions given to Timothy by the 
faithful Apostle Paul. But while these instructions were 
applicable and profitable to Timothy in his day, they apply with 
still greater force to the Gospel Church as a whole, of which 
Timothy was a member, and of which we have reason to believe 
he was a figure, or representative. 

Of this we have evidence in the general character of the epistles 
addressed to Timothy, which implies either that Timothy, or the 
class which he represented and of which he formed a part, 
would be living down into the end of the age. We believe, then, 
that in the person of Timothy as a representative, the entire 
Gospel Church is here addressed by Paul, and we notice that the 
name Timothy signifies- "honor of God." The church honors 
God and is to have honor conferred upon her by God. In the 
present age the honor consists in the fact that so important a 
"charge" is committed to her trust. And those thus honored in 



this age, and who prove faithful to the trust, will in the next age 
be yet more highly exalted and honored. 

Three times Paul most solemnly and earnestly repeats this 
charge. He thanked the Lord that though he had been a 
blasphemer and persecutor of the church, yet he had obtained 
mercy, because he did it ignorantly, and verily thought that in so 
doing he was doing God service, and had been put into the 
ministry, the glorious gospel of the blessed God being 
committed to his trust. (1 Tim. 1:11-13.) And now knowing that 
age was creeping on, and that perils surrounded him on every 
hand, and before writing the second letter, saying that he was 
about to be offered, he commits this charge to the faithful ones 
who must carry on the work after his departure. 

The charge was to keep the blessed gospel untarnished and 
"without spot," to keep it in its glorious simplicity and purity, 
unmixed with human theories and 

R1128:page5 

false doctrines, which even then the enemies of the cross of 
Christ were laboring to introduce. The rising errors must be 
guarded against, first, by maintaining a clear conscience; and 
secondly, by faithful study of the word of God. To study the 
Word of God with a clear conscience is to study it with the 
single and only purpose of knowing and doing God's will. This, 
Paul says, some in his day did not do; they had theories and 
plans of their own, and endeavored to wrest the Scriptures to 
give their theories seeming support; and thus they made 
shipwreck of their own faith and turned others out of the way. 
As the end of the age should approach such false teachers he 
said were to multiply and gain great influence, and overthrow 
the faith of all who should not meekly and devoutly walk with 
God, trusting alone in his faithful word. 

Next to guarding ourselves thus— and those who thus do so have 
the power of God pledged to keep them from falling- is the 
charge to help others to stand: to help them by earnestly 
contending for the faith; by pointing out the snares of the 
adversaries of the truth, and by calling attention boldly and 
fearlessly to every pitfall and placing the light of truth over it. 

To preach this "glorious gospel of the blessed God," to present it 
in its purity and grandeur, to contend against the errors which 
friends and enemies seek to engraft upon it, is the charge given 
to and the duty devolving upon the church in the present time- 
the charge which we must keep and labor to sustain until the 
appearing (manifestation, or bright-shining) of our Lord Jesus 
Christ. Before the brightness and glory of his presence the 
darkness of ignorance and error shall flee away, and no hiding 
place shall be found for them; for the knowledge of the Lord 
shall fill the earth as the waters cover the sea, when his presence 
is fully revealed to all. 



Till thus relieved of this duty of guarding the truth, the church 
must wait for her victory, must watch against the dangers of 
abounding and wide-spreading error, and the seducing 
temptations of the world, the flesh and the devil, must pray for 
and use divine strength in enduring hardness as good soldiers 
unto the end, and must boldly and nobly contend for the faith 
delivered in charge to the saints. "Blessed is that servant whom 
his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing. " Those not so 
doing will not be counted worthy to be gathered among Christ's 
jewels. 

It should be borne in mind also that in the days of his presence, 
before his manifestation to the world, there is even greater 
necessity for watching and contending for the faith than at any 
previous time,— since his presence is discerned by the church 
only by faith in the foretold indications, and since the perils 
occasioned by numerous false doctrines and many antichrists are 
greatly increased; so much 

R1128:page6 

so, that only those who have on the whole armor of God are able 
to stand and to contend for the faith in the face of such subtle 
and crafty opposition. The charge is to stand well armed, and to 
contend for the faith until his manifestation to the world, in the 
close of the perilous times of this harvest. 

How solemn the obligation: -"I give thee charge in the sight of 
God who quickeneth all things "-the great Life- giver or Father 
of all, Jehovah. We are his representatives in the earth; the honor 
of his name is to be vindicated in the presence of his enemies 
and before many of his deceived children; his glorious plan is to 
be published broadcast in opposition to all the worldly-wise 
schemes which men are and have been trying to invent. And his 
eye is upon us, marking how faithfully or unfaithfully we as his 
ambassadors represent him. 

Not only do we receive this charge in the sight of God, but also 
"before the anointed Jesus," our great example and forerunner, 
who also bore witness to the truth, sacrificing all things for the 
privilege of witnessing to it— even unto death. 

All told, the church is but a little flock: they are generally also 
the humble poor of this world, who have little influence among 
men. Nevertheless their charge is an important one. They must 
"hold the fort" until the Lord himself shall in power and great 
glory establish the truth and exalt his church. He will complete 
what we in our present condition accomplish only in part: He 
will scatter all the mists and let in the broad sunlight of his truth, 
until none need say to his neighbor, "Know the Lord— for all 
shall know him from the least unto the greatest," as represented 
in his plan, work and office. Already the light of his presence 
begins to dawn. Already he begins to lift the veil of error and to 



restore, with increasing beauty and clearness, the truths he first 
inculcated and afterward left to his church in charge. 

The substance of this sound faith left in charge at first was, 
"This is life eternal that they might know thee," Jehovah;- know 
his goodness, know his love, know his power and his justice; 
that knowing of God's character as revealed by Christ they 
might delight to accept his proffered aid through Christ, and 
returning to God be abundantly pardoned; and, continuing to 
grow in knowledge and love and devotedness to God, be 
accepted as co-workers and co-heirs with Christ Jesus, their 
Redeemer and Lord. 

Our Lord's work at his second advent will be similar, the 
Apostle assures us: He will take up the same truth, which he first 
taught, the same that was given into the church's charge during 
his absence, and will show to all the world of mankind, the real 
character and plan of God the Father;-i.e., he will cause all to 
know and appreciate the character and plan of Jehovah, the 
blessed and only potentate; King of all kings, and Lord of all 
lords; who alone possessed, originally and innately, immortality; 
who dwells in light unapproachable. 

Courage, the, brethren! Our great Commander is even now upon 
the battle field. "Stand fast; quit you like men; be strong!" the 
fiercest part of the conflict is just before the shout of victory is 
heard; the darkest hour is just before the dawn of day. As 
triumphant conquerors, O faithful few, you shall soon wear the 
laurels of immortality and eternal glory. 

The witnessing of the church through the long dark centuries of 
the Gospel age has not been in vain. The object of her mission 
was not to convert the world before the Lord's return, but to 
develop her own character and prove her worthiness of the high 
exaltation which she is called to share with her Lord, while 
bearing witness to the world of the facts of the glorious gospel, 
which shall be good tidings of great joy to all people, when in 
due time it is testified to all. 

Then continue to preach the word. Be instant in season and out 
of season;— when it suits your convenience and when it does 
not. Reprove, rebuke, exhort with all patience and doctrine, and 
study to show yourselves workmen approved unto God, rightly 
dividing the word of truth. Thus, speaking the truth in love and 
growing up into Christ our living head, may we each be found in 
acceptable readiness to be gathered among the Lord's jewels. 
And to this end let us each see to it, that what faith we hold is 
held with a good conscience,— honestly held and honestly acted 
upon. 



R1128:page6 



THE CHRISTIAN MINISTRY, NO. I. 

That at this time of day there should be anything new to be said 
on the subject of Christian Ministry, and that any one should, by 
appealing to the New Testament alone, lay open such a 
statement on this theme as must, if true, tend to disturb the 
composure of every sect, would appear to many too strange for 
credence; yet the very fact, that numerous religious divisions in 
Christendom have established many varieties of ministry, and 
that all of them appeal to the Scriptures for the validity of their 
ministerial arrangements, is a prima facie argument for a new 
examination of the question, as it is quite obvious that only one 
of the sects can, by possibility, have discovered the truth. 

At the same time, it is far more probable that all should have 
erred than that only one should be right. Every one who has not 
taken for granted the perfect and unimpeachable conditions of 
the "denomination" in which he happens to be enrolled, must 
acknowledge the force of this argument. And when the history 
of Protestant divisions is duly weighed; when their origin and 
the circumstances that led to their formation are calmly 
considered; when it is remembered that not one of them can put 
in a claim to a divine birth (for we know the pedigrees of them 
all, and can most accurately describe their earthly lineage), then 
must the argument be much strengthened, so that we need 
scarcely fear stating, that it is in the highest degree improbable 
that any known sect should have come to indubitable 
conclusions on the article of Christian Ministry. 

In the great Reformation this momentous question was never 
fairly examined, or rather we may say it was slurred over as too 
delicate and dangerous to handle. Luther indeed saw very 
clearly the master-truths of the spiritual priesthood of all 
believers-liberty of ministry for all the saints, the total 
abrogation of all official priesthood in Christianity, and the 
vanity and absurdity of "ordination." He had nothing more to 
learn on these points; but then, as in many other instances, he 
did not think it necessary or politic to press his views, or to 
insist on them as a part of the Reformation. It is well known that 
he tolerated many absurdities in worship and ceremonies, 
probably because he despaired of weaning the people from 
them; and thus he tolerated ordination 

R1129:page6 

though he made a joke of it in his letters, and unmercifully 
quizzed his brother reformers who had some grand doings at 
their* "ordinations." 

The Protestant party, headed by Melanchthon, were so little 
solicitous to place "ministry" on Scriptural foundation, that they 
rather showed a disposition to yield to all the papal decrees 
concerning the Priesthood. In the confession of Augsburg, the 
Protestants thus warily expressed themselves in the 14th article:- 



-"Concerning the ecclesiastical order, they [the Protestants] 
teach that no one ought to teach publicly in the church, or to 
administer the sacraments, unless he be duly called." To this the 
papal party replied: - 

"When in their fourteenth article they confess that no one ought 
to administer the word and the sacraments in the church unless 
he be duly called, it ought to be clearly understood that he only 
is duly called who is called according to the form of the canon 
law, and the ecclesiastical sanctions and decrees, which, up to 
this time, have everywhere been observed in the Christian 
world; not called according to the vocation of Jeroboam (1 
Kings 12:20), or a tumultuous election of the people, or any 
other irregular intrusion: for no one taketh this honor unto 
himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. " 

The Protestants, in their "Apology of the Confession," thus 
notice this stricture:- "Our fourteenth article, in which we say 
that the administration of the sacraments and of the word should 
be allowed to no one unless he be duly called, they accept, if 
only we make use of canonical ordination. On this subject we 
have frequently testified in the diet of Augsburg, that we, with 
the greatest willingness, desire to preserve the ecclesiastical 
polity, even the degrees of priesthood that have been made in 
the church by human authority; for we know that ecclesiastical 
discipline, as set forth by the ancient canons, was established by 
the fathers for a good and useful purpose; but the [papal] 
bishops compel our priests either to renounce and condemn the 
doctrine which we have confessed, or else kill them, innocent as 
they are, with new and unheard-of cruelties. For this cause our 
priests are prevented from acknowledging the bishops." 

Here, then, we see the perilous position of "ministry" during the 
Reformation; and we can therefore well understand how, in such 
circumstances, there was little likelihood that the question 
should be investigated, as it deserves to be, with a professed and 
unhesitating submission to the Word of God. 

But this is not all, for "ministry" must needs be produced in 
some form by the Protestants, and that form must of necessity be 
accommodated to the worldly position which the Protestant 
religion assumed at first, and has retained ever since. For it is to 
be remembered that the Reformers never acknowledged the 
heavenly calling of the saints; never confessed that the church 
had her polity only in heavenly places; never hesitated to draw 
the sword in "defence of their civil and religious liberties:" 
never declined from power and authority in the world, but 
rather, under the auspices of princes and magistrates, sought to 
establish the Gospel as a handmaid of Government, and, as if a 
second Joshua were their leader, to drive the enemy out of the 
land, that they might take possession of the fertile Canaan, long 
defiled with papal abominations. 



The world, then, being the portion of the Protestant religion, its 
ministry required a substantial and consolidated formation, 
suited for its earthly calling and its contentious life; and that it 
soon obtained on the Continent, and in England and Scotland, 
according to the arrangements of the different predominant 
sections of the reformed faith. Hence we everywhere find that 
Protestant ministry is based on the old maxims and principles of 
the antecedent creed. These maxims and principles may indeed 
be modified, and reduced in intensity, but as the papal system 
had brought to perfection the mystery of amalgamating the 
church and the world, the new possessors of power, whose 
object it was to be proficients in the same mystery, could not do 
otherwise than study the successful methods of their 
predecessor. 

But in this forbidden science, the Protestants seem to forget that 
the old masters can always obtain an easy victory over all co- 
rivals; for in the matter of ministry, wherever it is of human 
institution, Popery has the means of surpassing all antagonists, 
and of confounding all opponents. It is owing to the superior 
claims of the papal priesthood to the obedience of man, on 
earthly principles, that Popery is now once more disturbing the 
repose of Protestants, and threatening some great crisis in 
ecclesiastical history. 

In "ministry," as a human institution, Popery possesses 
incomparable advantages; for who does not see that even the 
ordinations of the dissenters come from Rome through the 
Church of England, and that the idea of requiring a clerical body 
to convey the power of "administering the sacraments" (an idea 
fully recognized by Protestants), is easily to be traced to the 
decrees of the canonists? 

The Church of England smiles with disdain on the imitation of 
clerisy by the dissenters, and haughtily denies the validity of 
their ordinations; but the Church of Rome, enthroned in the 
magnificent deceptions of many ages, and unrivaled in the 
perfection of every earthly principle, classes the Anglican 
prelate with the dissenting minister, sees no difference between 
the preacher of the conventicle and the archbishop of 
Canterbury, and in the comprehensive category of "heretic," 
erases all Protestant ministers of every grade out of the clerical 
order. And, indeed, if it be a question between the comparative 
merits of any particular clerisy, if the genus "clergyman" be 
once admitted in Christianity, who would not naturally prefer 
the type of the whole family to any of the imperfect and mongrel 
varieties which could be put in competition with it? 

When once, therefore, an inquirer is directed to rest on human 
ministry, and when he comes to discover that the priestly 
college, the priestly education, holy orders, the distinction of 
clergy from laity, the clerical character, title, and costume, the 
clerical right to preach and administer the sacraments, and the 



clerical prerogative of conveying that right, are to be had at the 
fountain-head at Rome— that from Rome all these things were 
derived, and that at Rome they all flourish in native splendor, 
inimitable in any other communion-he must naturally incline to 
go direct to the fountain-head for that which he had been falsely 
taught is a part of Christianity. Neither can we doubt that Popery 
is triumphing now through this obvious process of thought; for I 
profess not to understand how, admitting the clerical character 
and prerogatives obtainable by clerical ordination, it is possible 
to rest content with the imperfect and borrowed orders of the 
Church of England. "If there is a link out of 

R1129:page7 

the chain, it seems to matter very little whether it is wanting at 
one end or the other," the Anglican priest remarks, in 
commenting on the "orders" of the dissenters, forgetting that he 
is himself a dissenter from the mother church, and that it 
belongs to that church alone to use such a reproof, which is 
applicable to every Protestant that tampers with "the apostolical 
succession. " 

As, then, preaching justification by faith without works, that is, 
asserting that he who does not work, but instead of working 
believes in that God who justifies ungodly persons, is the only 
method of meeting Rome in her doctrinal power, so the assertion 
of liberty of ministry for all believers is the only method of 
meeting Rome's pretensions to clerical pre-eminence, a 
pretension before which all must succumb who in any way 
acknowledge the clerical order. There is no medium, no resting- 
place for a candid inquirer between the two extremes— the 
ministry of the Spirit as revealed in the Word of God, or human 
ministry as exhibited by the ancient Church of Rome. Either 
take liberty of ministry for all the saints, from the supernal and 
free Jerusalem, "the mother of us all;" or, rejecting this, then 
accept the clerical order from Rome, the mother of all clerisy, 
and the mistress of all ecclesiastical bondsmen. 

Let not these remarks, however, be interpreted as belonging to 
the controversy between the Roman Catholics and the 
Protestants. That controversy enters not, I trust, into any part of 
this inquiry, which, as it professes to be an examination of the 
Scriptures, for the purpose of vindicating certain Scriptural 
truths of deep value to the Church of God, can only incidentally 
touch on the divisions of professing Christendom. In vain will 
we seek for either Papist or Protestant in the New Testament, or 
for their churches under any name, or any representation. 

In God's Word we find only two antagonistic sects: that of the 
world and that of grace; known also by the names of the 
children of the devil and the children of God; of the sons of 
darkness and the sons of light; the body of Christ and the 
children of wrath. But wherever we find the principles of this 



world admitted into any system of professing Christianity, there 
we find a portion of that which is technically called "Popery;" 
and which is nothing but the fulness of this world's principles, 
and the entire satisfaction of all the desires of the carnal mind in 
its notions about religion. Now, with the Church of England and 
the dissenters, there is much of the elements of this world: much 
that proves that their citizenship is not, and that they do not wish 
it to be, in heavenly places. They are 

R1130:page7 

marshaled under opposing banners for an earthly portion; they 
both teach that politics should be "cultivated religiously;" and 
they both give the whole weight of their influence to the 
political parties of the day; nay, to such an extent is this rivalry 
carried on, that their very places of worship are rearing as if they 
were fortresses and castles for a civil war. "It seems to be the 
present policy of the Church of England to build us down and 
build us out," says one of the antagonists; "but we must catch 
the building spirit of the age; we must build, build, build. This 
should be our cry, MORE PLACES OF WORSHIP. It may be 
well enough to form protective societies for the defense of our 
civil rights; but our best defense, under God, is in our numbers; 
numbers carry weight and influence. We cannot multiply our 
persons, unless we multiply our places. We must not wait for 
congregations to be gathered before we build; we must build to 
gather." 

In the meanwhile, on these very principles, the common enemy 
of all the Protestant sects is advancing with a rapidity that 
alarms them all; and he who, ages ago, had the whole earthly 
portion, for parts of which others are now contending, is 
reviving his claim and taking active measures to recover it. 

"I claim to retain the favor of the state," says the church; "I 
claim an equality in all rights of earthly citizenship," says the 
dissenter; but the imperial priest of the seven hills cries out, "I 
claim dominion over all the works of God's hands; all things are 
put under my feet; all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the 
field, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea, and 
whatsoever passeth through the paths of the sea; for of me it is 
written, 'Behold, I have set thee over nations, and over 
kingdoms, to root out and to pull down, to destroy and to throw 
down, to build and to plant."* 

It is not then for Protestants that we write but for the "holy 
brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling," who desire to be 
acquainted with the will of God, whatever may be the 
consequences. One consequence, indeed, is certain, that if these 
things be true, then does Christianity stand before the world 
acquitted of the charges brought against it by its restless 
enemies, who, viewing it only in its clerical form, condemn it, 
both for what it has done, and for what it has failed to do. 



When Gibbon lays it down as an axiom, "that the Christian 
Church entrusted the service of the altar to a perpetual 
succession of consecrated ministers; and that bishops alone 
possessed the power of spiritual generation" (Decline and Fall, 
chap, xx.) he asserts that which all his Christian antagonists 
have allowed to pass unnoticed and uncontradicted; but grant 
him only this hypothesis, and who then shall be able to gainsay 
his history, which indeed has hitherto been more railed at than 
confuted? Gibbon has incidentally written a history of clerical 
Christianity in tracing the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, 
and that form of Christianity it has never been proved that he 
has misrepresented; but if we deny that clerisy is an authentic 
part of Christianity, and if we establish this position by a close 
inquiry into the Scriptures, then we ascertain that neither he nor 
any other infidel has ever yet been able even to find the true 
Church, which has fled into the wilderness far out of their reach, 
where, being reputed dead, and having her "life hid with Christ 
in God," she has found for herself "a fountain of gardens, a well 
of living waters, and streams from Lebanon." They that know 
this life will not evade any truth of the Word of God, whatever 
may be its tendency; for they know full well that most of the 
truths of Christ are attended with His cross, and to the world 
must ever appear unconvincing and unamiable; but, as their 
citizenship is in heaven, so will they not, as others do, be 
looking to this earth as a place of power, influence and honor for 
the Church, but rather remembering the great question, "When 
the Son of man cometh, will he find faith upon the earth?" they 
will anticipate suffering times, and days of painful testimony, 
"until the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall 
see it together;" and so, suffering with him, that with him they 
may also reign, their present position will be unhesitating 
obedience, though the daily desire of their hearts will be, "Make 
haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe, or to a young hart 
upon the mountains of spices." 

It should be understood that the word "denomination," which 
will occasionally appear in following our Inquiry Concerning 
Christian Ministry, [in subsequent issues of the TOWER,] is 
used for the sake of peace, and to avoid the appearance of 
criminatory language; for if, in detecting error, crimination is 
inevitable, it is better that it should be by facts than by pointed 
expressions, and by proofs than by contentious phrases. 
Nevertheless "denomination" is only a veil for that harsher word 
"sect," though even that is a softened translation of the 
original.+ 

"Denomination" is a specious word invented by Shame to 
conceal the nakedness of the fall of Christendom: that which 
erring and bewildered Christians call denomination is in the 
Scriptures SCHISM, for so it is in the word, "I beseech you, 
brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that ye all speak 
the same thing, that there be no schisms [see the Greek] among 



you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind 
and in the same judgment" (1 Cor. 1:10 and 12:25); for in the 
Scriptures believers are represented not only as being one body 
and one spirit, but as having a perfect unity of mind and 
judgment; so that whatever we may now hear concerning 
"denominations" (that is, sects and schisms), and however these 
divisions may now be applauded and admired, and how much it 
may have become a fashionable virtue to speak well of them all; 
yet this is certain, that if there be any truth in the Word of God, 
every sect is a sin, and every division a proof of disobedience. 

"THERE IS ONE BODY," is a truth in the Word of God. (Eph. 
4:4.) The faith once delivered to the saints was mainly to 
establish this fact, the whole of the New Testament tends to 
confirm it, and visible Christianity utterly fails to represent the 
true Christian faith where this fact is not both in practice and in 
theory fully acknowledged. I can, at present, only allude to this 
subject in passing, for it is of itself a theme for a wide and 
serious inquiry, but so much is here said on it, lest any believer, 
rightly instructed in the word of truth, should be offended with 
the usage of a word, which was originally intended to hide sin. 
To speak of "various denominations" is, after all, but saying that 
there are various schisms, for Christ and his Church have but 
one name (1 Cor. 12:12), one body (Eph. 5:29,30), and one 
spirit (1 Cor. 6:17); and therefore to give Christ the name of 
Roman Catholic, Churchman, Presbyterian, Independent, 
Baptist, Wesleyan, or any other sectarian name, and to admire 
this many-headed portent as "his body," the Church, is as 
intolerable as to call our Lord by the names of Brahma, Vishnu, 
and Siva, or to look for the body of his disciples among the sects 
of Athenian philosophy. It is one thing to love all God's children 
though entangled in sects, and another to avoid the meshes of 
their captivity. The oneness of thought, mind and action, 
required of the Church of God, may be seen in the following 
texts: -John 13:34,35; 17:23; Acts 4:32; 20:29,30; Rom. 12:16; 
15:5,6; 16:17; 1 Cor. 1:10; 12:25; 2 Cor. 13:11; Gal. 1:9; Eph. 
4:14; Phil. 2:2,3; 3:16,17; 1 Thes. 5:13; 2Thes. 3:6; 1 Tim. 1:3- 
6; 6:3,20; 2 Tim. 4:3,4; 2 John 9.

*The imposition of hands in ordination was a perplexing 
question to the Protestants; thus, for some time, the whole senate 
of Geneva, consisting of many laymen, used, by imposition of 
hands, to ordain the ministers. Calvin and Farel objected to this 
practice. The Kirk of Scotland, a branch of Calvin's church, in 
the year 1560, renounced ordination by imposition of hands, as a 
"superstition:" eighteen years later, they restored it! 



*So applied by the canonists, and so quoted by Pope Boniface 
VIII., Extrav. C. "imam sanctum." 

+That word is heresy (airesis). "As concerning this sect [i.e. 
heresy] we know that it is everywhere spoken against. " (Acts 
28:22.) So Acts 5:17; 15:5; 26:5. In all these instances heresy is 
translated sect. But in 1 Cor. 11:19 we read, "There must be also 
heresies amongst you," or if we choose, sects, or denominations, 
"for one saith, I am of Paul, and another of Apollos." (1 Cor. 
3:4.) Then again, Gal. 5:20. "The works of the flesh are 
manifest, which are these, adultery, fornication, uncleanness, 
lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulation, 
wrath, strife, seditions, heresies"-or sects or denominations.

THE ANATOMY OF CONCEIT. 

Every man sees with his own eyes. He discovers in the world 
only what his capacity and range of vision fit him to see. So 
every man thinks and judges and estimates other men and 
himself according to standards and limitations peculiar to his 
own mind. The eye of the soul has its limit of vision. Many a 
man has no right estimate of his fellow men, because he 
measures them by the false standards of his own thinking. Still 
more men have no right estimate of themselves. Wrong 
estimates of others and of ourselves are sure to be found 
together sooner or later; they spring from the same root, namely, 
a bad standard or a false application of good standards. In this 
way a man may either underestimate or overestimate himself. 
Thus arises conceit. This quality is simply erroneous self- 
measurement. 

Conceit implies a narrow and superficial knowledge of the 
world. As in perception we determine the size of things by 
comparison of them with other things, so we estimate men and 
ourselves by comparison. The earth seems very great to us when 
we cross its oceans and traverse its continents. But when we 
pursue the astronomer's reasoning, and learn that there are 
worlds in comparison with which our planet is little more than a 
floating particle of dust, our estimate of its relative size and 
importance is wholly changed. A better knowledge of the 
universe humbles our judgment concerning our world as a part 
of the creation of God. In like manner, all self-estimates are 
relative. In self-conceit, man dwarfs the universe in order to 
magnify himself. With a true conception of the majesty of the 
universe, and of the wisdom and power revealed in it, conceit is 
impossible. The mind is overwhelmed with the impression of its 
weakness in the presence of that gigantic system of things in 
which it finds itself. 



It follows that conceit springs from ignorance and 
thoughtlessness. It is consistent only with narrow views of the 
world and of life. It makes precisely the mistake of the old 
astronomy, which supposed our world to be the central and 
largest one of the system, simply because it knew so little of 
other worlds. The conceited man magnifies his own importance 
only because he does not know what real greatness is. He is 
great in his own eyes only because his eyes can see nothing truly 
great. 

Conceit arises from a low estimate of other men. Estimates of 
ourselves, as well as of other men, are relative. All self- 
measurements involve measurement of others. It results from 
this, that there is no way by which the conceit can be taken out 
of a man so effectually as by bringing him into a clear 
comparison and sharp competition with other men. This is the 
reason why it has become proverbial that school-life— especially 
college-life— will be likely to cure boys and young men of their 
conceit. In the class-room they are brought into close 
competition, in which even the best scholar is sure to be 
sometimes outdone by other men. Thus every man is frequently 
compelled to a tacit acknowledgement of others' superiority, and 
that in their very presence. This kind of life forbids to men the 
easy and flattering method of "comparing themselves with 
themselves," which is the great promoter of conceit. 

This is the reason why the process of education tends to cure 
conceit. The men who recover from it least, are the men who 
have too little perception to discover clearly, or too little 
sensitiveness to feel keenly, the superiority of others. The same 
principle holds in the great school of life. No man can remain 
persistently conceited, who has any adequate appreciation of the 
merits and attainments of his fellow-men. A man may be 
conscious that he has done his best, and may feel a keen 
satisfaction in this fact; but any large knowledge of men will 
show him how often his work has been equaled and surpassed. 
The real scholar is compelled to think modestly of his 
productions; for he well knows how thorough and successful 
have been the labors of others in the same or similar fields. He 
who is most likely to suppose that he has done a great service to 
science, is the tyro who does not know what others have 
accomplished. 

We estimate ourselves by comparison. The more widely and 
truly we know men, the more we shall see we are frequently 
equaled and surpassed. Candid estimates of ourselves by 
comparison with others will make us think soberly, and judge 
ourselves modestly. Conceit has no more fruitful root than a 
narrow knowledge and prejudiced estimate of the labors and 
worth of others. 

Conceit involves a faulty self-knowledge. It is noticeable that a 
man who thinks most highly of himself is one of whom others 



think least highly. The conceited man has only one ardent 
admirer -that is himself. The world knows most men better than 
men know themselves, and at this point "this wise world is 
mainly right. " A true self-knowledge reveals our faults to us, 
and gives us a true view of ourselves. It lets the light in upon our 
narrow prejudices, and makes us ashamed of them. It discloses 
the insufficient grounds of many of our judgments, and unearths 
the subtle processes of our self-deception. It lays bare the 
operation of motives, and shows how often conscience itself is 
made a convenience. Self-knowledge humbles a man. Those 
who think themselves complete beyond other men commonly 
stand alone in that opinion. They think themselves complete 
only because, while they keenly perceive others' faults, they are 
blind to their own. 

In this view lies almost the only excuse which can be given for 
the man of inordinate self-conceit. It implies intellectual 
weakness, an incapacity for keen discernment, an inability to 
study successfully one's self and others. It may be a mental quite 
as much as a moral fault, though it is usually both. In both views 
it is a quality whose development is to be dreaded and checked 
with the utmost promptness and sternness. No trait of character 
conveys a more unfavorable impression; none so quickly excites 
disgust; none provokes such constant and universal ridicule. The 
ancient proverb expresses the world's verdict on this point: 
"Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? There is more hope 
of a fool than of him. " 

Conceit is a mark of smallness of soul. It is a phase of 
selfishness. Conceit is essential littleness. It means small 
thoughts of the world and of other men; low ideals of character 
and attainment; weak and narrow conceptions of duty. It is the 
mark of a self-centered life; and the life which makes self the 
center is as much smaller than the true life as the idea which 
made our earth the center of the universe was beneath the true 
conception of the solar system. "Conceit, in weakest bodies 
strongest works," said Shakespeare. The men who have been 
servants of humanity- the great reformers and philanthropists- 
have been freest from conceit. They were great in humility; for 
humility, rightly understood, is essential greatness. Humility is 
the quality which leads men to serve others; conceit, the quality 
which leads them to serve themselves. 

Traced to its deepest root, therefore, conceit is a fruit of 
fundamentally defective character. It implies a lack of 
appreciation of God's greatness, before which every thoughtful 
mind should stand with reverence and humility, and the proofs 
of which in the world, in man, and in history, might well 
impress every person with his own feebleness and 
insignificance. It implies a want of generous sympathy and 
kindly appreciation of others. It gives rise to cynicism and 
misanthropy. The conceited man helps nobody, unless he does it 



in order that he may thereby indirectly help himself. He is as 
intolerant of other men's faults as he is tolerant of his own. 

Like all other qualities, conceit grows by indulgence. It is as 
subtle as counterfeit virtue, with which it has close affinity. It is 
as mischievous as self-deception, of whose essence it partakes. 
The analysis of this trait lays bare its inherent meanness, and 
shows it to belong to a type of life which is unworthy of any 
noble, generous, aspiring soul.— Sunday School Times.

VIEW FROM THE TOWER. 

Old readers will recall that, long ago, we drew attention to the 
prophets Elijah and Elisha as being types of the Gospel church 
in its closing stages;-not types of the nominal church, but of 
God's true children. True, God's children will not be entirely 
separate and distinct from the nominal mass, until the close of 
the present "harvest;" but these prophets represent at first a 
nucleus of the true class, led into the light, to which all the 
faithful in Christ will be gathered; and from which will be sifted 
and separated all who lose the spirit of humility and true 
discipleship. 

We saw that these two prophets typified two classes of the true 
children of God: that Elijah represented, so to speak, the cream 
of God's true church, the class called overcomers, who are to be 
granted the kingdom honors, at the first resurrection, -the 
specially holy and specially blessed of the Lord (Rev. 20:6) who 
will be caught up to spiritual power and glory in the time of our 
Lord's presence at his second advent, in the close of the harvest 
of this age; and that Elisha represented a class which would not 
be counted worthy of so great honor, because less faithful, ~ 
though the difference in faithfulness, as the reason for his 
exaltation, is not shown in the type. 

As shown in DAWN, Vol. II., Elijah was the representative or 
type of the "overcomers" of the Gospel church, in their present 
earthly career, as the fore-runner of the glorified church, of 
which they shall compose a part when changed, glorified and in 
kingdom power; and Elisha represented a company of believers, 
the companions of the Elijah class and co-laborers together with 
them, though more on the natural plane. They too love God and 
are consecrated to his service, to the extent of striving to abstain 
from sin and to live holy lives, but not to the extent of 
sacrificing present rights and privileges even unto death. While 
they love God and love righteousness and admire the spirit of 
self-sacrifice and to some extent practice it, yet they are not 
fully on the altar as "burnt offerings" (Lev. 9:7), as all who 
would be of the Elijah class must be. 

As the time for the "change" of the Elijah class draws nearer, the 
tests as to who of the living are worthy to be of the Elijah class 
become more and more stringent, as the import of entire 
consecration is more and more clearly seen. Already this fiery 
chariot begins to separate the classes, and it will continue to do 
so, more and more, during coming years, until complete. The 
Elisha class catches a view of the coming glory and exaltation 
for the overcomers, yet will not walk up to their privilege of 
sharing in it-will not walk worthy of that high vocation by 
making complete sacrifices of themselves in the service of the 
Lord and the Truth. 



The fact that the two prophets walked side by side, and had 
personal acquaintance, does not imply that the two classes they 
represent are all personally acquainted: they may or may not 
know each other individually and specially; but they both walk 
the same road, progressing in knowledge and experience under 
God's leading and instruction, which, however, comes more 
directly and clearly to the Elijah class. 

In every gathering of true children of God both classes may be 
found, and with many hopes and experiences similar. Both 
classes are consecrated, but to different degrees; and 
consequently to somewhat different services, and with 
proportionately varying degrees of spiritual insight into the 
Lord's plan. In some companies the Elijah class may 
predominate, but usually the Elisha will be the more numerous, 
and growingly so; for, evidently, though both classes are to be 
delivered from Babylon's bondage, the large majority of the 
"overcomers," being stronger, are already free. 

The various stops made by Elijah, on his journey, while 
expecting exaltation, (at each of which Elisha, typifying all not 
overcomers, was invited to stop and go no further-see, 2 Kings 
2:2,4,6), represented trials, and siftings, and separatings, here. 
Those who were sifted out on those various occasions do not 
belong to either the Elijah or the Elisha classes. To such as were 
sifted out, it is proper to apply the Apostle's words, "They went 
out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us 
they would no doubt have continued with us; but they went out 
that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us."— 
1 John 2:19. 

These two constantly growing classes of children of God, sifted 
and tried and proved honest, though with different ideas and 
degrees of consecration, like the two typical prophets, go on 
together (i.e., in sympathy and interest) talking of the fact that 
one class is to be taken away to other scenes of joy and service, 
and a remaining class to continue in the world and start the work 
of restitution-healings of mind and body, abstaining from sin, 
etc. Thank God for the companionship of these two classes of 
his children, and for the sympathy and friendship, so profitable 
and encouraging to both. 

But, we recently notice that a separation between these 
companion classes must take place. It will not, however, be in 
bitterness, nor in anger, nor as a result of error, we believe; but 
nevertheless it will be a marked division and separation of these 
two classes, which will continue to love and respect and 
fellowship each other. Each of God's true children will, 
according to his standing and degree of consecration and of 
faithfulness, be drawn into fullest sympathy with the class to 
which he belongs. 



This conclusion, which we consider a reasonable one, is daily 
being forced upon us by facts which corroborate it,— by letters, 
etc. And we find this separation noted in the narrative of the 
typical prophets, where a chariot of fire parted or separated the 
two. We need not infer that the horses and chariot of fire which 
separated Elijah from Elisha will at once convey Elijah away. 
This we find is not the statement, -but that the fiery chariot 
"parted them both asunder," and after being thus parted from 
Elisha, Elijah was taken up "by a whirl- wind. "~2 Kings 2:11. 

As Elisha loved and respected and clung to Elijah to the last, and 
even after the separation cried after him, My father! my father! ! 
and as he sought for and obtained (after Elijah was taken) an 
extra share of his spirit of consecration and power, and became 
his successor in the world as a teacher,— so, we may expect, will 
be the separation of these classes which they typified, and the 
results to them. 

Therefore, "think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which 
shall try [and separate] you, as though some strange thing 
happened to you," but rather expect it and be prepared for it. 

This separating is not to be esteemed a mark of divine disfavor, 
or an injury even, to the Elisha class: it leaves the individuals of 
the two classes as they were before, and assigns to each class the 
work for which its degree of consecration fits it. It will be in the 
end a blessing to both, for the sooner the Elijah class is 
completed and exalted, the sooner the fuller blessing of their 
mantle, the power and spirit of fuller consecration, will come to 
the Elisha class. God is testing the present probationary 
members of his church, by their faithfulness in following the 
example of their Redeemer in sacrificing their little all of earthly 
advantage, etc., and this test shall prove who are worthy of a 
place in the glorified "little flock" to whom is promised joint- 
heirship with the Lord Jesus. According to this crucial test, each 
one of the true servants must be tested. It will be for each of us 
to take his place, according to the depth or completeness of our 
consecration and the consequent fullness of our sacrifice, with 
either the one or the other of these classes. 

If you are very faithful in walking up to the light you have, self- 
sacrificingly, you are one of the "overcomers," one of those 
represented in Elijah, and will find yourself continually in 
closest and growing sympathy and fellowship with others 
similarly desirous of sacrificing earthly advantages and plans for 
heavenly ones. If you are not so fully consecrated, yet one who 
loves God and who desires to please him in well-doing— yet not 
to the extent of complete self-sacrifice to his will, his plan and 
way— you will find yourself drawn toward other good people 
who love right, but who like yourself are unwilling to serve it to 
the extent of complete self-sacrifice. You will find yourself and 
them gradually becoming more interested in human restitution, 
faith-healing, reforms, etc., than in the prize of the high calling. 



And this Elisha class will have a great work of this sort to do 
after the Elijah class is exalted. 

The time for choosing our place is rapidly passing. In fact, the 
choice is made almost imperceptibly; almost unconsciously 
some, the Elisha class, draw away from the searching, bright, 
spiritual, truths which are approaching more and more near, and 
which prove and show clearly what manner of persons we 
should be, sacrificing all for the great prize. Thus the Lord's 
fiery or spiritual, chariot, drawn by spiritual doctrines, is to do a 
final, separating work. But the weakest and humblest of the 
consecrated ones need not fear this chariot. It is your privilege to 
be of the Elijah class, if you will. God has invited you to this 
class and has made it possible for you to walk with and be of it, 
no matter how deficient you may be, naturally, of those sterling 
qualities which "overcomers" must possess. It is for us to will, 
and for us to lay aside every weight and hindrance and to so run 
as to obtain this great prize; then God will work in us to do his 
good pleasure. But, thank God, our overcoming is not judged by 
the 

R1133:pagel 

amount of service we shall be able to render to our Lord, nor by 
the amount of honor we shall bring to our great Redeemer, but 
by our willingness and the earnestness of our endeavors to do 
and to suffer all we can in his cause. 

Be our sacrifice ever so lame and imperfect, it is reckoned holy 
and without blemish, if we presented it to: the Father in and 
through the merit of our Redeemer; and if "holy and acceptable" 
through him (Rom. 12:1; 1 Pet. 2:5), the reward of sacrifice is 
ours, be our offering ever so small. But it must be a free-will 
offering, and it must be a whole burnt-offering; 

R1133:page2 

not the smallest piece can be kept back from the consuming fire 
of the altar. And none who have the spirit of the Master will 
seek to keep back a part of their little all; they will feel, indeed, 
on the contrary, that at most it is but as offering dross for a 
jewel, for a pearl of great value. They will rather truthfully say:- 



Were the whole realm of nature mine, 
That were an offering far too small: 
Love so amazing, so divine, 
Demands my life, my powers, my all. 



R1133:page2 



SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN- 
FORBID THEM NOT. 

Consecrated parents, after seeing the truth, should not only let 
the light shine out upon neighbors and grown folks, but also and 
especially upon their children. And as the children come more 
and more to love the Lord and his truth, it is well to teach them 
to appreciate the privilege of rendering little sacrifices of play, 
etc., in his service. We should not force them, but teach them 
both by word and example to appreciate such opportunities as 
great privileges; nor should we expect them to sacrifice all their 
play-time. Endeavor to have their services like your own, 
freewill offerings. 

It has been suggested that children can do little in the way of 
preaching the good tidings, and this has been true until now. 
Now, a way has opened up by which the children may be a 
mighty power, a way in which the parental influence may reach 
out through the children to whole neighborhoods. Thus many 
who have regretted that they were so circumstanced that they 
could not go forth to preach the truth by selling DAWN, find a 
door opened to them now through their own and other children. 

The plan is, to have children all over the country in every city 
and town, act as colporteurs in selling the OLD THEOLOGY 
TRACTS for the Tract Society. Tracts Nos. I. and II. are now 
ready, and a new one may be expected each quarter. The first 
one is, Do the Scriptures Teach that Eternal Torment is the 
Wages of Sin? The second is entitled, The Scripture Teaching 
on Calamities, and Why God Permits Them. 

It is proposed that these Child-Colporteurs shall sell these tracts 
at one cent each, wherever parental judgment may direct— on the 
cars, in the markets, in stores, depots, etc., etc.— everywhere. 
Thousands can be sold thus, and will be more surely read than if 
given away gratis. 

Furthermore, while your own children might gladly, for a while, 
engage in this service from interest in you and a desire to serve 
God, it will be necessary for others to have a money interest in 
the service; and this will help give stability and continuity to the 
efforts of the interested children also. Therefore, the TRACT 
SOCIETY proposes the following special arrangement with all 
Child-Colporteurs. They will be supplied 50 tracts for 25 cents 
(Nos. 1 and 2 assorted or separate as desired); and thus even at 
the small price of one cent each, the children will have half their 
receipts for profit-for spending in whatever way they please. 

To enable any, who may feel uncertain as to their ability in this 
work, to give it a trial, we will put up packs of ten tracts (5 No. 1 
and 5 No. 2) and call them "trial packs," at the same rate-i.e., 5 
cents per pack, postage free. And if any are so poor that they 
cannot purchase one of these packs, we will start them in the 
work by sending the first pack on credit.

WORDS FITLY SPOKEN. 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-I enclose some clippings 

regarding Brother 's experience which explain 

themselves. I do not know all the facts in the case, but as 
reported, it would seem that our Master's cause has suffered 
from zeal untempered with wisdom. No one realizes more fully 
than I do how easy it is to be taken captive by our great 
Adversary for his pleasure, and we must walk very humbly 
before our Lord to escape these things. Yet we rejoice in the 
knowledge that it is his good will to deliver us from all these 
snares, if we commit ourselves fully to him, and diligently 
pursue the truth. This episode has led me to crystallize a few 
thoughts which I send you herewith for such use as your good 
judgment dictates. 

In Christian love and fellowship, I am, 

W. E. PAGE. 



"Let all things be done in a becoming manner, and according to 
order. " "For God is not a God of confusion [tumult] but of 
peace."-l Cor. 14:40,33. -Diaglott. 

While it is the privilege of the saints to "endure affliction" and 
make full proof of their ministry, we must be constantly on 
guard against the Adversary, who specially delights in tripping 
us up. Nor must we fancy that we are not subject to strong and 
blinding temptation from this wily foe. Unless we are constantly 
on the alert we will fall into some snare of his setting. 

We must not hesitate at all opportune times, and with the 
"wisdom of serpents and the harmlessness of doves," to 
proclaim the truth about these present evil times, and the 
seductions that are blinding the great ones in Babylon. Yet, the 
questions of time, place and manner must all be carefully 
weighed; and when we act, it must be after careful and 
unprejudiced study to ascertain the right: if we diligently seek 
for this light in the "sure word of prophecy," we will find it. 
Babylon, and the world, have their rights and privileges now, 
which we must respect, or else forfeit for the truth that dignified 
position to which it is entitled, and which will command for it 
the respect of its opponents. It is our blessed privilege at all 
times to proclaim the knowledge we have of passing events in 
the true Temple of God, and we will there find hearing ears and 
seeing eyes. When approaching Babylon on any errand, we must 



be sure that we give no occasion for criticism as evil doers. We 
must not present the truth through lawless means. Right here 
socialism, anarchy, etc., commit their greatest error. With many 
and convincing truths regarding the rights of men (restitution), 
they go about to establish their hopes through one form or 
another of lawlessness. Until the completion of "The Times of 
the Gentiles," we must not expect to reign, and must be 
subservient to the powers that be, when they are not exercised to 
make us deny, in word or deed, the "Lord that bought us." 

By attentively considering the Apostle and High Priest of our 
profession, Christ Jesus, in his walk in the world, we will gain 
much information as to how we are to conduct ourselves. He 
never attempted to force himself or his views upon any one. 
"According to custom," he spoke the truth in the Jewish Temple 
(the type of the true one, the Church, which God, not man, 
builds), or in the wilderness, as occasion fitted, but his cry was, 
"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. " "In driving the money 
changers from the courts of the Temple, he simply did what any 
Jew under the law could do: it was no form of lawlessness. In 
studying the Acts of the apostles, we find that they conformed to 
custom in their manner, time and place of publishing glad 
tidings, and where propriety required, gained proper license 
before speaking. -Acts 21:37-40. 

Justice and fairness require that if we desire to address any sect 
on the truth, and especially if we select the time and place which 
they control, we first gain their consent; if we cannot do this it 
behooves us to await other times and places. If we are faithful, 
full opportunity will be given us to complete our consecration, 
and to fully do our Lord's will, and carry out his purposes for us. 
He will use every empty vessel that presents itself. We must be 
careful not to interpose our ways, and insist on doing the Lord's 
work our way. Such a course can only bring confusion upon the 
cause, and distress upon us. We must, sometimes, patiently wait 
to be used in the Lord's way and at his time. The test of waiting 
in the armor will not be without its fruit. "Having done all, 
stand!"

EXTRACTS FROM 
INTERESTING LETTERS. 

Jacksonville, Fla. 

ZION'S WATCH TOWER:-I have read The Plan of the Ages, 
with great interest. It fell into my hands while attending our 
annual Conference of the M.E. Church. I was so much pleased 
with it that I purchased seven, and at once on my return home 



sent them out on a mission. They are now being read by six of 
our ministers of this city, and I will keep them going from house 
to house. 

Send me six more, and I will send them out on the same 
mission. There are 50 preachers, teachers, lawyers, and others, 
into whose hands I wish to place them. 

Yours, 

S. W .

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-I inclose money order of ten 
dollars for Tract Fund. 

On coming home to see my parents I find them so situated that 
they need my services for a short time, and I hardly feel 

R1134:page2 

it right to go away for a week or two. I trust the short change I 
shall make will not be any loss to the service. Next month I hope 
will find me in the field with renewed strength. 

I hope to be able to sell the two volumes of DAWN together 
mostly in the future. I do hope and pray that the Lord may grant 
you sufficient time and strength and knowledge that the third 
volume of DAWN shall be a suitable climax to the grand and 
God- like prelude. If the Lord permits us to continue our work 
for the coming ten years I hope and trust to dispose of fifty 
thousand copies of DAWN, and we can hope that many others 
will do accordingly, as the Master hath given unto them. If you 
can find time to write, I shall be greatly pleased to hear from 
you. 

I am glad to acknowledge the strength and grace received from 
reading last TOWER. I know it will be a rich feast to all the dear 
saints to whom it goes. You may think it queer that we do not 
secure some subscribers to the TOWER, while working with 
DAWN. If so, I might say that I think the reading and 
circulating of the book to be so important that I do not think it 
well to try to take orders for the paper. [We fully endorse this 
course. The DAWN is much better suited to new readers than 
the TOWER. Mention the latter only where you find some 
interest already.— ED.] The way things are now going, it seems 
quite possible that the TOWER may be suppressed in the near 
future; and though the printing of DAWN might also be stopped 
it would be difficult to stop the reading of the thousands of 
copies now being circulated. 

[The TOWER would, probably, have been suppressed long ago 
in Europe. But thank God for this land of liberty, where thus far, 
and probably for some years, we may boldly declare His Word, 



with none to molest and make us afraid. But blinded sectarians 
are very bitter. They hate the "good tidings" and would think 
that they served God as well as their sects by injuring or 
stopping our influence. -EDITOR.] 

Does not the teaching of our Master indicate that we should find 
and help to "seal" as many as possible with the truth, before 
doing anything which would be pretty sure to invite decided 
opposition to our work? I think, if your judgment on this could 
be given in the TOWER, it would be important to the service. 

[A good suggestion. Be wise as serpents and harmless as doves. 
A good article on this subject from Bro. Page's pen will be 
found in another column. -EDITOR.] 

Please give my love to the Church at Allegheny. With kindest 
regards to you and Mrs. R., I remain, as ever, 

Yours, 

S. D. ROGERS.

ZION'S WATCH TOWER:-I wish to add one more voice from 
this distant corner, because light is breaking and creed shackles 
are loosening. We are falling into battle line. We need more of 
the TOWER literature. I enclose five dollars. Please send the 
Diaglott and M. DAWN, Vol. II. Also some DAWNS, Vol. I., 
and anything you have at hand. 

Yours for the truth, D. M. D .

Mr. C. T. RUSSELL, DEAR SIR:-I have read Volume I. of 
your MILLENNIAL DAWN and am now reading Vol. E. This 
work seems to me to open up the Scriptures in a manner which 
no other works ever did. I am more than delighted with it. To me 
it is the very truth of God, and I cannot but exclaim: "O! the 
depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!" 
Now from the depth of my heart I can say: "Even so, come Lord 
Jesus." 

I am a Cadet in the Salvation Army. I was a member of the 
Presbyterian Church for seven years before joining the army, but 
I could not help thinking Jehovah had sadly failed in 
accomplishing the redemption of man. And much did I wonder 
at such passages as: "And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men 
unto me. " And, "God is the Savior of all men, especially of them 
that believe, " etc. The prophecies were a complete mystery. 
Now, praise God, all is clear and harmonious. God is love. He is 
the very God poor, fallen humanity needs. Bless his name! 



I am at present passing through a severe trial. Being convinced 
of the truth, I could no longer preach or uphold the doctrines of 
the army; so I at once sent word to headquarters of the new light 
I had received on the Scriptures and that, as I no longer believed 
the doctrines of the army, I could stay in it no longer. I have not 
yet had time for a reply. I am thousands of miles from home, 
and do not know what I shall turn my hands to, but I trust the 
Lord will open a door for me at the proper time. I love the army 
and it will go hard with me to leave it. Besides, I shall be looked 
upon as a backslider and a hindrance to the cause of God. But 
where the Lord leads I must follow at any cost. I sacrificed 
home and friends and good employment, as a teacher, to come 
into the army, as I believed, at the call of God; and I believe so 
still. I have learned many precious lessons in the army, and 
would not injure it in any way -but I must walk in the light. 
There are several other officers whom I expect to see leave for 
the same reasons. 

I see that you wish to spread the news of the "harvest" as much 
as possible. I long to do so, too, but until I am released from the 
army I can do nothing, and I know not what then to do. I can no 
doubt find employment of some sort. If you can in any way 
advise me, as to what I should do and what course I should 
pursue, I shall be much obliged. I can easily go back to teaching 
again if I wish, but if there is any way in which I could be more 
directly engaged in the Lord's work I would prefer it. The 
reading of the "Plan of the Ages" gave me much joy in the Lord, 
and what I have read of Volume II. is equally good and 
profitable. 

Wishing you God's speed, I am Yours in Christ, 

A. M . 



[The fields are ripe, and we advised this sister to proceed at once 
in the harvest work by canvassing with DAWN. The Lord 
blesses those who are faithful in few things by calling them to 
higher service, and will doubtless continue to test and prove, 
until he sees it is enough and calls them up to the higher 
fellowship and service with himself in glory. -EDITOR.]

Sutter, Ills. 

DEAR BRO. RUSSELL:-DAWN, Vol. II., which I have read 
through, carefully, and which is a "feast of fat things," most 
surely, came to hand in due time. 

No one, I think, can take greater interest in the subject matter of 
the DAWNS, Vols. I. and II., than I do. The Truth is wonderful, 
glorious, grand. And the overjoying feature of the whole matter 
is, that it is "at hand." Surely, you have "ciphered" the matter out 
about right. Looking at it, as I do, I see no chance for a doubt. 



Yours in Christ, Dr. H. J. S

THE REST OF FAITH. 

Since the Father's arm sustains thee, 

Peaceful be. 

When a chastening hand restrains thee, 

It is he. 

Know his love in full completeness 

Fills the measure of thy weakness; 

If he wounds thy spirit sore, 

Trust him more. 

Without measure, uncomplaining, 

In his hand 

Lay whatever things thou canst not 

Understand; 

Though the world thy folly spurneth, 

From thy faith in pity turneth, 

Peace thy inmost soul shall fill, 

Lying still. 



Like an infant, if thou thinkest 

Thou canst stand, 

Child-like, proudly pushing back 

The proffered hand, 

Courage soon is changed to fear, 

Strength doth feebleness appear; 

In his love if thou abide, 

He will guide. 

Fearest sometimes that thy Father 

Hath forgot? 

When the clouds around thee gather, 

Doubt him not. 

Always hath the daylight broken, 

Always hath he comfort spoken; 

Better hath he been for years 

Than thy fears. 

Therefore, whatso'er betideth, 

Night or day, 

Know his love for thee provideth 

Good alway. 

Crown of sorrow gladly take, 

Grateful wear it for his sake, 

Sweetly bending to his will, 

Lying still. 



To his own thy Savior giveth 

Daily strength; 

To each troubled soul that liveth, 

Peace at length; 

Weakest lambs have largest share 

Of this tender Shepherd's care; 

Ask him not, then, 'When?' or 'How?' 

Only bow!"

PROTESTANTS, AWAKE! 

THE SPIRIT OF THE GREAT REFORMATION -DYING.- 
HOW PRIESTCRAFT NOW OPERATES. 

The attitude of Rome on the public school question in this 
country, her increasing power and prestige in places of authority 
and influence throughout "Christendom, " the attention she 
called to herself in the late celebration of the Papal Jubilee, the 
flatteries and honors she received from crowned heads and even 
from this great Republic, together with her renewed claim of 
temporal power and her manifest determination to regain it, 
whenever the auspicious moment to strike for it shall come, are 
facts which should arouse every Protestant, every true Christian, 
to a sense of the danger to which liberty and truth and 
righteousness are exposed from their old and wily foe and 
relentless persecutor, the Church of Rome. 

It has been well said that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty: 
and truly it is the price of every principle of truth and 
righteousness which we desire to hold; because unceasing 
vigilance, art, cunning craft, unscrupulous hypocrisy and 
unblushing impudence are the characteristics of Satan, "the 
prince of this world" (John 14:30; Eph. 2:2), who, unrecognized 
by men, is constantly manipulating human affairs, civil and 
religious, for the accomplishment of his own diabolical purposes 
in the enslavement of humanity to the dictum of ignoble 
tyranny. 

And yet, it is quite manifest that Protestants, listlessly resting in 
fancied security, have long since ceased to be vigilant; and the 
masses of them are almost totally unaware of the present 
perilous position, or the dangers ahead. But if they will carefully 
take their bearings, they will soon see that much has been lost 
already, and hence the present vantage ground of the great 
enemy to true religion and to civil and religious liberty, 
concerning which Macaulay the historian remarks truly, that 
"among all the contrivances which have been devised for 
deceiving and oppressing mankind, it [the Church of Rome] 
occupies the highest place. " 



The underlying principle of the Great Reformation, to which all 
Protestants look back with pride, was the right of individual 
judgment in the interpretation of the Scriptures, in opposition to 
the papal dogma of submission to clerical authority and 
interpretation. On this very point was the whole issue of the 
great movement. It was a grand and blessed strike for liberty of 
conscience, for an open Bible, and the right to believe and obey 
its teachings regardless of the usurped authority and vain 
traditions of the self-exalted clergy of Rome. Had not this 
principle been firmly held by the early Reformers, they never 
could have effected a reformation, and the wheels of progress 
would have continued to stick in the mire of papal traditions and 
perverted interpretation. 

To-day, the careful observer may note, and it should be noted 
with alarm, that the very condition of things which led to the 
great Papal apostasy, against whose errors and bondage our 
fore-fathers awoke and protested in the sixteenth century, is 
gradually, stealthily, yet swiftly, overshadowing Protestantism; 
and, unchecked, will soon entirely wipe out the idea of the right 
of individual judgment in the study of God's Word, and bind 
Protestants as securely as Romanists are bound, to the judgment 
and religious decrees of a system, instead of leaving faith to the 
intelligence, study and judgment of each individual. 

The foundation of the great Apostasy (Papacy) was laid in the 
separation of a class, called the "clergy," from the church of 
believers in general, who, in contradistinction, came to be 
known as the 

R1135 : page 3 

"laity." This was not done in a day, but gradually. Those who 
had been chosen from their own number, by the various 
congregations, to minister to or serve them in spiritual things, 
gradually came to consider themselves a superior order or class, 
above their fellow-Christians who elected them. They gradually 
came to regard their position as an office rather than a service 
and sought each other's companionship in councils, etc., as 
"Clergymen," and order or rank among them followed. 

Next they felt it beneath their dignity to be elected by the 
congregation they were to serve, and to be installed by it as its 
servant; and to carry out the idea of office and to support the 
dignity of a "clergyman," they deemed it better policy to 
abandon the primitive method by which any believer who had 
the ability had the liberty to teach, and decided that no man 
could minister to a congregation except a "clergyman, " and that 
no one could become a clergyman except the clergy so decided 
and installed him in office. 

Their councils, at first harmless if not profitable, began 
gradually to suggest what each individual should believe, and 
came finally to decreeing what should be considered orthodox 



and what should be considered heresy, or in other words 
deciding what each individual must believe. There the right of 
private judgment by individual Christians was trampled upon, 
the "clergy" were put in power as the only and official 
interpreters of God's Word, and the consciences of the "laity" 
were led into captivity to those errors of doctrine which evil- 
minded, ambitious, scheming, and often self-deluded men 
among the clergy were able to establish and false label, Truth. 
And having thus, gradually and cunningly, secured control of 
the church's conscience, as the apostles had foretold, they 
"privily brought in damnable heresies," and palmed them off 
upon the conscience-fettered laity as truths. —2 Pet. 2:1. 

One result was, that the Bible took second place to the opinions 
of the clergy in these councils, thus discounting the value of the 
only true standard of faith. Another result was, that this self- 
exalted clergy, becoming more and more vain and boastful, 
finally concluded that they alone constituted the Church, and 
that the laity bore to the clergy the relationship of children, 
"children of the Church," and were not to be classed as joint- 
heirs with the clergy, to the promises of coming glory and honor 
and association with Christ in the Millennial reign. 

When the Roman empire was falling into ruins, these clerical 
schemers by multitudinous crafty arts and intrigues, too 
numerous to be here detailed, contrived to work their own 
advancement to political power and influence until, as the great 
papal hierarchy, they gained the rulership of the world, electing 
one of their number king of kings and lord of lords- the pope. 
Thereafter the church, instead of being "subject to the powers 
that be," assumed and used power over the world and demanded 
universal obedience. Instead of suffering at the hands of the 
ungodly, this corrupt church reigned; instead of being 
persecuted for righteousness' sake, she was flattered and 
honored, and became the persecutor of all who differed from 
her, rejecting the decrees of her Councils, and exercised their 
right of private judgment in the study of the Bible. 

To account for this changed condition of things, the claim was 
then made that the doctrine that Christ would come and set up 
his Millennial kingdom and subdue all things to his rule of 
righteousness, as taught by the apostles and held by Christians in 
the first and second centuries, had been misunderstood. The 
claim was set forth that those Scriptures which referred to the 
Millennial blessedness and reign of Christ and the church, as 
Kings and Priests to rule and teach and bless the world, was to 
be fulfilled by the church without Christ Jesus, her Lord and 
head; that he was represented in reign and glory and power by 
the successive popes who claimed to be his vicars or 
representatives, and as such to be infallible, as Christ would be. 

This claimed Millennial reign is dated from about A.D. 800, and 
since then, the line of popes, in Christ's name and stead, have 



applied to themselves all the titles, promises and predictions of 
Scripture which relate to Christ and his Millennial glory. And 
thus the popes, as falsely representing Christ, the Head, and the 
general clergy, as falsely representing the Body, Bride or 
Church of Christ, constitute themselves the Antichrist, or false 
Christ and his false kingdom, predicted by Daniel, Paul and 
John, as well as by our Lord and others. 

This counterfeit of Christ's Millennial Kingdom could not 
indeed resurrect the dead to glory, power and immortality, as the 
Scriptures predict (1 Cor. 15:42-44; Rev. 20:6), to live and reign 
on earth; but as a pope could represent Christ, so bishops, 
cardinals, etc., could represent the saints of the first resurrection; 
and though these could not possess the power, glory, etc., 
promised to all who will have part in the first resurrection, and 
share in Christ's Millennial reign, yet those glories could be and 
were counterfeited or represented, in the clothing, etc., of the 
hierarchical class. And the master-artists of the world were 
engaged to paint and gild and bestud with blazing precious 
stones the papal throne, and to so arrange windows and mirrors, 
lights and shadows, etc., that, on certain occasions, as nearly as 
possible a supernatural radiance might seem to the people to 
emanate from the person of the pope as, clad in gorgeous 
clothing and flashing with jewels, he sat in regal state, the false 
head of the apostate church, personating and counterfeiting the 
true head of the true church and his Millennial glory and power. 

The terrible state of ignorance, superstition and priestcraft, 
which prevailed for centuries under this counterfeit kingdom of 
Christ, known in history as "the dark ages," was broken by the 
Great Reformation movement of the sixteenth century, —when 
Luther and his coadjutors, recognizing the true character of 
Papacy's kingdom, in sermons and tracts and posters boldly 
denounced and exposed the counterfeit, and pointed out some of 
the errors and blasphemies of that deceptive system. 

And Luther noted, too, that the start of the great Apostasy was in 
the error that the clergy were a divinely appointed order, distinct 
and separate from the remainder of the church. He saw that the 
reign of Christ was not fulfilled by Papacy, and that the 
promises, that those who suffer with Christ shall reign with him, 
were not made to a clerical class, but to all the consecrated, 
faithful church of Christ. Did space permit, we would give 
samples of some of Luther's forcible utterances on this subject, 
which show that he had a very clear idea of the relationship 
which should exist between the church in general and those who 
minister to or serve it; even though he found it impossible to 
fully bring his ideas into practice, owing to the gross darkness 
and superstition of the long priest-ridden people. He clearly 
points out Peter's words, "Ye are a royal priesthood," as relating 
to the general church, and not to a clerical class, and denounces 



the assumptions of the Papacy on this subject, although he 
himself had been one of the favored "clergy" class. 

True, Papacy does not now attempt a despotic sway of the 
world, nor does she loudly and publicly assert her claim to 
divine authority as God's Kingdom among men. This, she is 
crafty enough to see, would not be wise policy in this nineteenth 
century and under present circumstances. Hence, Romanists do 
not now make these doctrines prominent; but their theological 
works do present such views, unblushingly, and Papacy's boast 
is, that she never changes. The same claims to divine authority 
to rule the world and to punish and torture in the present life and 
to damn to all eternity, as heretics, all who will not accept her 
claims and obey her "royal priesthood," would soon be heard 
again, were ignorance and superstition to again thoroughly 
enslave the masses. 

Now, while cunningly avoiding the question of civil power over 
the world, she retains her grip upon the minds and consciences 
of her people, by proclaiming her chief cleric, the pope, 
infallible; and by having him loudly assert his spiritual power 
(?) and influence, to compensate for his loss of earthly power. 
Thus, to display his spiritual authority and power, Pope Leo 
Xin. recently announced the liberation of millions of souls from 
the 

R1135 : page 4 

pains of purgatory, with as much apparent candor as President 
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation which set free 
millions of slaves in the South. And strange to say, the masses 
of Romanists, even to-day, believe this monstrous, wholesale 
fraud. 



THE PROTESTANT CLERGY. 

Protestants generally, except Episcopalians, admit the fallacy of 
these claims of Papacy. And yet the habit of centuries, of regard 
for certain forms and ceremonies and for a certain class of self- 
exalted fellow-mortals, called the clergy, still clings to the 
people, and the Protestant clergy consequently receives much of 
the same homage and reverence against which the reformers of 
the sixteenth century protested. 

Nor can we wonder much that even some very earnest, honest 
ministers accept this customary submission and reverence of the 
people, and the title of Reverend, and that superstitious respect 
which looks up to them as possessed of almost superhuman 
authority as religious leaders. It is a general weakness of the 
fallen human nature to take all the respect, honor and authority 
others are willing to accord. And then, too, many ministers have 
become possessed of the same ideas, and really believe 
themselves to be worthy of homage and reverence. Many get the 
old papal idea that the ruling and teaching of the church belongs 



to the "clergy" by divine arrangement. We all know how much 
easier it is to "receive honor one of another" (John 5:44), than to 
refuse it, and tell the people the plain truth which Peter so 
clearly enunciated (1 Pet. 2:9), that the entire church of Christ- 
that is, all fully consecrated and self-sacrificing believers- 
constitute the 

R1136:page4 

royal priesthood, and not a self-appointed lordly class in it or 
above it, calling itself the "clergy. " 

We certainly do not deny, but on the contrary affirm, that the 
church should have living teachers; and that the Lord has raised 
up such teachers all through the Gospel age, and will to its close, 
to instruct the church in general by expounding the Word of 
God, pointing out and making clear its teachings and bringing 
forth from the storehouse things both new and old. But all are 
not teachers. Teaching, Paul declares, is a special gift. (1 Cor. 
12:28-30.) A teacher is one who, being fully consecrated and 
brought into submission to the divine will and enlightened 
concerning the divine plan, God can and is pleased to use in 
instructing his church. And the basis of such selection may be a 
keen, penetrating mind, or other natural or supernaturally 
imparted endowment and qualification. 

But as for a clerical class, God does not recognize it as his elect 
teachers; nor has he chosen many of his teachers from its ranks. 
The mere claim of any man to be a teacher is no proof that he is 
one by divine appointment. That false teachers would arise in 
the church, who would pervert the truth, was foretold. The 
church, therefore, is not to blindly accept whatever any teacher 
may set forth, but should prove the teaching of those whom they 
have reason to believe to be God's messengers, by the one 
infallible standard -the Word of God. "If they speak not 
according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. " 
(Isa. 8:20.) Thus while the church needs teachers, and cannot 
understand God's Word without them, yet the church 
individually-each by himself and for himself, and himself only- 
-must fill the important office of judge, to decide, according to 
the infallible standard, God's Word, whether the teaching be true 
or false, and whether the claimed teacher is a true teacher by 
divine appointment. 

Thus seen, not many special teachers are necessary ("Helps," 
"pastors," etc., are more numerous- 1 Cor. 12:28)-and they only 
when old truths may need to be lifted out of the dust of error and 
human tradition; or when some new unfoldings of God's plan 
require presentation to the church as "meat in due season." And 
then, such teacher must offer proofs that he is a teacher, and that 
his teaching is true, by expounding and harmonizing the 
Scriptures. 



God has in the past raised up teachers who, though befogged by 
prejudices and errors, nevertheless brought forth parts of truth; 
for instance, Wycliffe, Huss, Zwingli, Luther, Bunyan, Calvin, 
Wesley, and others; and God will continue to so raise up the 
needed teachers. As Paul declares, God himself provides these 
teachers; they are his gifts to the church.- 1 Cor. 12:28. 

Any superior wisdom and ability granted such, is as much for 
the sake and for the good of the other members of Christ's 
church as for themselves. And whichever of God's children 
comes to see some important truth generally disregarded by the 
church and finds himself possessed of ability to make it clear to 
others, should do so, should teach it, to whomsoever has an ear 
to hear. If a new truth, it belongs to the entire household, and he 
who keeps it from them, for any cause, defrauds the family of 
God, misuses a great favor, and deprives himself of a ministry 
(service). 

But notice, that these teachers are not the only priests of the 
royal priesthood; rather, they are merely God's agents or 
mouthpieces by which he speaks to the general priesthood, his 
consecrated church; and the entire church or priesthood is 
blessed of God through such teachers. 

Notice, that the self-constituted clergy are not teachers, and do 
not and cannot appoint teachers; nor can they in any degree 
qualify them. Our Lord Jesus keeps that part in his own power, 
and the so-called clergy have nothing to do with it, fortunately, 
else there never would be any teachers; for the "clergy," both 
Papal and Protestant, strive constantly to prevent any change 
from those conditions of thought and ruts of misbelief, in which 
each sect has settled down. By their course of action they say, 
Bring us no new unfoldings of truth, however beautiful; and do 
not disturb the heaps of rubbish and human tradition we call our 
creeds, by digging down through them and bringing forth the 
Old Theology of the Lord and the apostles, to contradict us and 
to disturb our schemes and plans and methods. Let us alone! If 
you go poking into our old musty creeds, which our people so 
devoutly and ignorantly reverence and respect, you will stir up a 
stench such as even we could not endure; then, too, it will make 
us appear both small and foolish, and as not half-earning our 
salaries and not half-deserving the reverence we now enjoy. Let 
us alone! is the cry of the clergy, as a whole, even if a few may 
be found to dissent from it and to seek for and speak out the 
truth at any cost. And this cry of the "clergy" is joined in by a 
large sectarian following. 

We exhort all God's true church-the one church, which includes 
all consecrated believers— to awake to the principles of the 
Reformation, to a recognition of the right of individual judgment 
upon religious questions. Demand Scriptural proofs for all you 
are asked to believe; take neither the decisions of Rome, nor 
those of Westminster, nor those of any smaller councils or 



synods, as final settlements of the question, "What is truth?" 
And be sure that you believe and confess nothing that you do 
not understand fully and clearly. To subscribe to, or confess, 
what you do not understand, and therefore cannot truly believe, 
is solemn lying in the presence of God and witnesses, no matter 
if it be true that others, by the hundred, have done the same 
before you. If you did this once, thoughtlessly, even though it 
were years ago, in joining church, now that your attention is 
called to it, you are bound to procure a copy of the "covenant," 
or "articles of faith," the belief of which you confessed publicly, 
and after careful, prayerful study of it, if you find that you do 
not so believe, you will be bound to deny it as publicly as you 
confessed it, or else forfeit in God's sight all claim to honesty. 

Require of all who shall attempt to teach in the name of the 
Lord, the exact words of the Lord or the Apostle which they 
claim support their teaching. Get the chapter and verse and look 
the matter up for yourselves, critically, examining the text and 
the context. Weigh and test every item of teaching which you 
receive as your faith, regardless of how much you esteem the 
person who presents it. We know that no fellow-mortal is 
infallible, and that his word is the only standard by which God 
wishes us to square and measure and build up our faith. 

When you come to apply this rule you will be greatly surprised. 
You will find that many errors of doctrine, as well as of custom, 
have been carried over from Romanism into Protestantism. 
Many doctrines expressed in the catechisms and confessions of 
faith and in the hymn books and from the various pulpits, you 
will find no foundation for in the Bible; and many prominent in 
the Bible, you will find are ignored by one or another, and some 
of them by all the sects of Christendom. But hold fast to God's 
Word. Let God be true, if it should make every man a liar.- 
Rom. 3:4. 

WHA T IS THE OBJECT? 

The object of Rome in establishing a clerical class, as separate 
from what she terms the laity, was to gain and to hold full 
control of the people. Every one admitted to the Romish clergy 
is bound by vows to submit implicitly to the head of that system, 
doctrinally and in every way. Not only is such a one held fast to 
those doctrines and hindered from progress by the strong chain 
of his vow, but also by innumerable smaller ones-his living, his 
dignity of position, his title, and his hope of advancement in the 
same direction; the opinions of his friends, their pride for him, 
and the fact that should he ever confess to greater light and 
renounce his position, he would, instead of being honored as an 
honest thinker, be maligned, despised and misrepresented. In a 
word, he would be treated as though to search the Scriptures and 
to think for himself and exercise the liberty wherewith Christ 
made all his followers free, were the unpardonable sin. And as 



such he would be treated as an excommunicated person, cut off 
from the church of Christ, now and to all eternity. 

This clergy class, being thus bound hand and foot to the system, 
are so many live, active agents of the system in binding the 
people to it; and sectarian pride and rivalry and reverence for the 
clergy, and an undefinable fear of the future, begotten of 
ignorance of God's Word and fostered by the arts of priestcraft 
and superstition, are the cords by which the clergy of Rome bind 
the people to that great Antichrist system. Nor can it be denied 
that the Protestant clergy, though in advance of that of Rome, 
have the same object and many of the same methods; each 
clergyman being expected to exercise tact and wisdom and to 
act according to the intellectual status of the people with whom 
he has to deal. 

WHA TARE SOME OF THE METHODS? 

Rome's method has been to concentrate authority and power in 
the hands of her priesthood or clergy. Not only are they 
supposed to have power in their hands to shut or open heaven or 
hell to whom they please, but even in the present life their 
authority is impressed. Roman Catholics are expected to address 
their clergy, "Your Reverence," and to treat them as vastly their 
superiors in every respect —as holy men, whom to offend might 
jeopardize eternity. They are taught that every infant must be 
baptized, every marriage performed, and every funeral service 
attended, by a clergyman; and that for any one except a 
clergyman to administer the simple elements of the Lord's 
memorial supper would be sacrilegious and profane. All of these 
things are so many more cords to bind the people to reverence 
and subjection under the clergy, who, by reason of the claim that 
they have these 

R1137:page4 

special rights above other Christians, are caused to appear to be 
a special class in God's estimation. And these cords and 
inferences are applied by Protestants as well as by Roman 
Catholics. 

The truth, on the contrary, is that no such clerical office or rights 
are established in the Scriptures. These simple offices are 
services, which any brother in Christ may do for another. 

We challenge any one to produce a solitary passage of Scripture 
giving one member of the Church of Christ more liberty or 
authority than another in these respects. In fact, in the matter of 
baptism, the true idea of the general priesthood of all Christ's 
followers is tacitly admitted by the "clergy"-though in a rather 
pinched manner, it is true-for the regulations of the various 
denominations provide that in the case of any unbaptized person 
about to die, and desiring baptism, or in the case of any infant 
about to die, if no clergyman can be found in time, any layman 



may perform the service. [With some in such a case when death 
does not ensue a sanctioning by a cleric is required to follow to 
make it valid.] And the only reason why the clergy yielded this 
privilege to the laity was, that having taught the people that 
sprinkling is necessary to salvation from eternal torment, it 
became necessary to grant the laity this privilege, in order to 
keep the people from reasoning too carefully upon the matter; 
lest they should thus force the subservient laity to exercise 
common sense and reject the absurd idea that a few drops of 
water and a few mumbled words could prove a charm to procure 
God's interest in the dying one and to cause him to change his 
purpose and not to consign it to an eternity of torture. 

It is true that the more advanced both of clergy and laity are 
becoming too intelligent to attach such an awful importance to 
baby-sprinkling; and in proportion as they do, the emergency in 
which the laity may be permitted to officiate is lost sight of, so 
that to-day few of them know that so great a privilege was ever 
conferred on them by the clergy. The authority to baptize is now 
fully in the hands of the clergy, though the rules still permit the 
laity to use it. 

R1137:page5 

But, notwithstanding the fact that the teaching, that there are 
unbaptized infants in hell not a span long, is no longer heard 
from the pulpit, and would no longer be tolerated in civilized 
lands, yet there is in almost every mother's head a caution, and 
in her heart a love and a fear for her child's eternal welfare, 
which leads her to have it sprinkled as a precaution. Indeed a 
case in this very city of Allegheny, in which we write, came 
under our notice, not long since, which shows that the papal 
error, both on baptism and on the authority of the clergy, has a 
very strong hold yet, even in this land of liberty and general 
intelligence. The case was that of a man and his wife who had 
been members of a Lutheran church, but who, through 
irregularity of attendance at church services and irregularity of 
payment of church dues, had fallen under the displeasure of the 
clergyman there officiating. One of their children took sick and 
was about to die; and as it had never been sprinkled, the parents 
were in great distress; and conquering his pride for the sake of 
his child's eternal welfare, the father went time and again, and 
finally accompanied by his sick and weeping wife, to entreat the 
clergyman to come and save the child by baptizing it; but he 
refused to come, telling them that it was what their conduct 
deserved; and possibly he superstitiously believed that these 
parents being no longer in good and regular standing in his 
church, the child must be counted as a child of unbelieving 
parents which could not be brought to God's favor even by the 
sprinkling of water. But no matter what we should say about the 
efficacy or non-efficacy of the drops of water, the incident 



shows the power of the clergy and the authority they are 
supposed to have, even among Protestants. 

The Roman Catholic clergy add other cords to bind the people, 
such as the confessional, the use of "holy candles," "holy water," 
"holy burying grounds," etc., which the greater intelligence of 
Protestants would not generally submit to. 

ORDER AMONG THE ROYAL PRIESTS. 

But in showing that the Scriptures recognize no separate clergy 
class, but that the entire Church of Christ is the Priesthood, and 
that they each and all have the same authority to do anything 
that the Lord and the apostles enjoined, as they find they have 
the ability, let no one suppose that we urge disorder. It is proper 
that each congregation should select or elect some of their 
number, best qualified, for these services. But it should always 
be remembered that the one who thus serves belongs to no 
higher class or caste than his brethren who chose him to thus 
minister or serve. "All ye are brethren, and one is your Master." 
Such a servant of the church is no more reverend or sacred than 
others, though if he be a very faithful and Christ-like servant he 
should be esteemed very highly "for his work's sake," because of 
loving, faithful service, but for no other reason. (1 Thes. 5:13.) 
He is not a "clergyman" in God's sight; for God recognizes no 
such class, and his Word authorizes no such distinction. 

Whatever "authority" such a minister or servant of the church 
possesses, is given him; he possesses no more "authority" than 
the humblest of his "brethren," the entire church, any of whom 
has the authority of God's Word (Matt. 28:19,20) to declare and 
to do any or every thing which it enjoins, according to his talents 
and opportunities and the desires of his fellow-believers to be 
served by him. Authority to preach or otherwise minister cannot 
therefore be given by other ministers, or by conferences, synods, 
etc. Each royal priest is the peer of each other one in authority 
and dignity of priesthood, though in talents, intelligence, etc., 
and therefore in fitness, they are not all equals. The choice of 
one or more to specially represent and serve all, as ministers, 
implies, or should imply, that those so chosen have some 
qualifications for such service superior to others; which should 
be willingly and freely used for the service and benefit of all. 

The tendency of intelligence has been gradually toward the 
recognition of this common priesthood of the church. "Baptists," 
"Congregationalists," and "Disciples" have recognized it more 
fully and more clearly than others; though some other 
denominations have been gradually forced by growing 
intelligence to permit what they term "lay-representation" at 
conferences, etc., though in such a manner as to make the laity 
feel that between them and the clergy there is a great gulf fixed. 



While glad to acknowledge that Baptists, Congregationalists and 
Disciples approach the true idea, that the entire church is the 
royal priesthood and that each congregation stands independent 
of the jurisdiction and authority of all others, yet we beg them to 
consider that their theory is not fully carried out; and, still 
worse, that the tendency among them is backward toward 
centralization, clericism, denominationalism; and far worse still, 
that the people "love to have it so" (Jer. 5:31), and take pride in 
their growing denominational strength, which means their 
growing loss of individual freedom. 

It is only of late that these could be called sects or 
denominations. Formerly each congregation stood 
independently, like the churches of the apostles' times, and 
would have resented any attempt on the part of other 
congregations to dictate regulations or faith, and would have 
scorned to be known as in any sense bound into a sect or 
denomination. But the example of others, and pride to be parts 
or members of a large and influential band of churches known 
by one name, and all confessing to one faith, and ruled over by a 
council of ministers resembling the assemblies and conferences 
and councils of other denominations, has led these generally into 
similar bondage. But above all other influences leading them 
backward to bondage has been the false idea concerning the 
authority of the clergy. The people, not Scripturally informed on 
the subject, are swayed much by the customs and forms of 
others. Their unlearned "clergymen" follow carefully and 
scrupulously every form and ceremony and detail suggested by 
their more learned clerical brethren, lest they should be thought 
"irregular. " And their more learned clergymen are shrewd 
enough to see how they can take advantage of the ignorance of 
the others to gradually create a denominational power in which 
they shall be able to shine as chief lights. First, it is suggested 
that certain doctrines or customs are not according to Baptist or 
Congregational usage, and the next step is to boycott such a 
congregation or minister as does not harmonize with the General 
Association, by dropping it or him from representation in the 
association. This is regarded as a punishment and disgrace, and 
most congregations and ministers will submit rather than incur 
it; whereas the fact is, that there should be no such association 
formed. Each individual and congregation should stand free. 

A WARNING TO PROTESTANTS. 

A careful survey and study of the field will show that the spirit 
of reform on this subject of clerical authority, which was in 
progress for some time, has really ceased; and their present 
movement is backward, toward the assumption of greater 
authority on the part of the clergy. The reason for this 
retrogression lies in the fact that the spirit of freedom and 
independence in religious thought, on the part of the masses of 
professed Christians, is being swallowed up by worldliness and 



money-getting and pleasure-seeking; consequently they have 
neither time nor desire for matters of faith and doctrine, and 
permit themselves to be tightly bridled by the clergy. And this 
decline in individual liberty and equality is regarded by the 
clergy as desirable, as a supposed necessity, because here and 
there in their congregations are a few "peculiar people," who 
partially appreciate their rights and liberties, and who are 
growing both in grace and knowledge beyond the clergy. These 
are causing trouble to the 

R1138:page5 

creed-bound clergy by questioning doctrines long unquestioned, 
and by demanding reasons and Scriptural proofs for them. Since 
they cannot be answered Scripturally or reasonably the only way 
to meet them and to settle them is, by brow-beating and a show 
and claim of clerical authority and superiority, which holds itself 
bound to account in doctrinal matters only to fellow-clergymen 
and not to laymen. 

But some in the pews are to-day as well or better educated than 
the occupant of the pulpit, and it will no longer do to claim that 
the laity are so ignorant that they could not comprehend; and the 
people have learned that the big words of technical, clerical 
phraseology are used to hide and not to teach the truth. Hence 
the individual and educational superiority of the clergy can no 
longer be given as an excuse for arbitrary definitions of 
Scriptural statements and doctrines. 

The doctrine of "apostolic succession" -the claim that the laying 
on of the hands of a bishop conveys to a man an ability to teach 
and expound the Scriptures -still holds Romanists and 
Episcopalians, who fail to see that the very men thus said to be 
qualified to teach are among the least able; none of them indeed 
seems to be any more able either to comprehend or to teach the 
Scriptures than before being thus authorized; and many certainly 
are decidedly injured by the arrogance, self-conceit and assumed 
authority to lord it over their brethren, which seems to be the 
only thing they do receive from the "holy hands." However, 
Catholics and Episcopalians are making the most of this Papal 
error, and are more successful in smothering the spirit of inquiry 
than others. 

Recently, however, in view of the growing intelligence of the 
people, the tendency among clergymen is to disclaim personal 
superiority or authority and to place the authority in the hands of 
conferences, synods, etc. Some ministers even disclaim any 
responsibility for their doctrinal faith, placing the whole 
responsibility for what they teach upon these councils. Some 
even admit that their personal views differ from those they 
preach, and are endeavoring to have their conferences and 
synods allow them to preach what they conceive to be truth and 
to desist from preaching what they believe to be error. 



Dishonorable, ignoble, hypocritical and slavish though such a 
course is, yet it is the natural result of the false view of the "call" 
and "authority" of the ministers of Christ. If "called" to the 
ministry, and granted "authority to preach" and "supported" by 
and according to the rulings of a conference or synod, what is 
more reasonable than to look to such bodies for doctrines also; 
for each denomination grants "authority" to preach its doctrines 
only. How needful then that all should recognize only the 
authority of God's Word and go to it for the doctrines it 
authorizes. 

The tendency of Protestants in this respect is to follow the 
method and practice of Rome. With Papacy, the councils declare 
the doctrine to be believed; and the people, denied the right of 
private judgment, are required to believe whatever these 
councils decree to be the truth. The same tendency is observable 
in all denominations of Protestantism; and we predict, what is 
even now suggested by prominent Protestant clergymen, that ere 
long Protestants will unite in a General Council which will 
decree and settle what shall, and what shall not, be received as 
divine truth. 

Not only do the current tendencies indicate this, but that 
wonderful symbolic prophecy, the Book of Revelation, clearly 
points it out as coming. The only difference between these and 
Papal councils will be, that there will be no chief pope to 
execute the decrees of the Protestant council. The council will 
be its pope, and each recognized clergyman its tongue. 

In view of these facts and tendencies, we sound an alarm to all 
who hold to the original doctrine of the Reformation— the right 
of individual judgment. You and I cannot hope to stem the 
current and to prevent what is coming, but we can by the grace 
of God, imparted through his truth, be overcomers and get the 
victory over these errors (Rev. 20:4,6), and as overcomers be 
granted a place in the glorified priesthood of the incoming 
Millennial age. (See, Rev. 1:6; 5:10.) The words of the Apostle 
(Acts 2:40) are as applicable now, in the harvest or end of the 
gospel age, as they were in the harvest or end of this Jewish age: 
"Save yourselves from the perverse generation!" Let all who are 
Protestants at heart flee priestcraft, flee clericism, its errors, 
delusions and false doctrines. Hold to God's Word and demand a 
"Thus saith the Lord" for all you accept as your faith.

THE HOPE THAT PURIFIES. 

"Every one that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself even as 
He is pure. " 



In view of all his experience, and his companionship with the 
Lord when in the flesh, how the beloved disciple must have 
longed for the realization of "this hope, "-to be like Jesus and to 
see him as he is. "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it 
doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that when he 
shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is." 
What glory and joy in the assurance! We shall see him: our 
Comforter in all our disciplining, when the way was narrow and 
steep; our Refuge when all around were indifferent, or cold and 
cynical; our Lord who calls us "friend" and "brother;" our 
Shepherd who died for us, sought us out so tenderly (John 
15:16), and who leads us so carefully in our present rich 
pasturage! Aye, more! We shall then know him; for "then shall 
we know, even as also we are known." Do not "our hearts burn 
within us" as we contemplate these glorious prospects? 

And then, "every one that hath this hope in him purifieth 
himself, even as he is pure." Quickened by "this hope," how we 
are strengthened to lay at the foot of the cross all our worldly 
desires, realizing that "the carnal mind is enmity against God, 
for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." 
"So then they that are in the flesh [of sin] 

R1138:page6 

cannot please God." But we "who walk not after the flesh, but 
after the Spirit," having received "the mind of the Spirit," 

R1139:page6 

have the inspiring realization that we are "Sons of God," and 
wait with patience, yet in eagerness, the grand consummation. 

Purify ourselves ! How carefully we must guard our every 
thought and act. To "be like" our dear Lord, we must rid 
ourselves not only of the grossness of the flesh, but also of every 
desire of the flesh, for "if any man love the world, the love of 
the Father is not in him. " Does any one say, it is not natural to 
lay down all desire of the flesh! No, it is not, but it is Divine! ! 
We who are "new creatures in Christ Jesus" are seekers after the 
"Divine Nature," hoping "to escape the corruption that is in the 
world through lust." How inspiring the hope! "True is the word: 
If we died with him, we shall also live with him; if we endure 
patiently, we shall also reign with him; if we disown him, he 
will also disown us; if we are faithless, he remains faithful: for 
he cannot deny himself. " "But faithful is the Lord, who will 
establish and guard you from the evil one. " (2 Tim. 2:11-13 and 
2 Thes. 3:3, Diaglott.) With "our beloved brother Paul," let us 
"do this one thing," "forgetting those things which are behind 
and reaching forth to those things which are before, press toward 
the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ 
Jesus."

CANONIZING SAINTS. 

With us, as with the apostles in their writings, the word saint is 
used to designate the truly consecrated among professing 
Christians. See the use of the word in Rom. 12:13; 15:25,26,31; 
16:15; 1 Cor. 14:33; 16:1; 2 Cor. 8:4; 13:33; Eph 3:8; 4:12; 
6:18; Phil. 1:1; Jude 3. But as the early church began to grow 
popular with the world, this Scriptural use of the word ceased 
very generally. Really the great mass of those who then came to 
profess Christianity because of its popularity were heathens and 
not truly converted to Christianity; and generally they were far 
from claiming full consecration of thought and word and deed to 
Christ's teachings and example. 

It was at that time that the papal system was gradually shaped. 
And taking advantage of the idolatrous tendencies of the 
heathens then claiming to be Christians for the sake of worldly 
advantage and favor with the emperor, the idea was conceived 
and acted upon, of designating certain notably good or zealous 
persons of the past as saints, worthy of adoration and privileged 
to be meritorious intercessors between God and men, who might 
therefore be prayed to by the people. Thus Papacy presented to 
the heathen mind something very closely resembling the heathen 
worship to which they had long been accustomed. Their many 
gods found correspondence in the so-called trinity, the worship 
and images' shrines, etc., of Diana and other heathen goddesses 
were supplanted by those of the virgin Mary, styled The Holy 
Mother of God and Queen of Heaven; and the dead heroes, the 
demi-gods [lesser gods] of Greece and Rome were supplanted 
by the dead saints whom the Papacy specially authorized the 
people to make pictures and images of and to pray to. The work 
of formally declaring any man thus a "saint" is called 
canonizing, and is usually deferred until several hundred years 
after his death, when his sins and sometimes crimes were 
generally forgotten, and his virtues and graces then multiplied 
and garnished with accounts of wonderful fastings, miracles, 
etc., performed by him. Such, by Papacy's decree, suddenly 
became saints to be adored and reverenced. 

One might suppose that such nonsense would be discontinued 
now; and that persistence in it would only expose Papacy to the 
contempt of the civilized people. For quite a long period indeed 
they were discontinued, and no new saints were canonized, but 
the present pope is a keen reader of human nature and sees that 
people of to-day "like to be humbugged," as Barnum expresses 
it, and he is reviving many of the old customs, and among others 
the canonizing of more saints. 



It is not necessary to directly criticize this procedure; our 
readers, acquainted with God's Word, well know that all the true 
saints will be heralded and canonized in a much grander manner 
when the due time shall come; and by the true Christ, and not by 
a representative of Antichrist. 

We present below a description of a recent canonization in the 
city of Rome, as given by a Protestant missionary there -Mr. M. 
C. Van Meter. He says:— 

"The Hall of Canonization is over the vestibule as you enter St. 
Peter's. It is about 300 feet long, 90 feet in width and 75 feet to 
the ceiling, in the center of which is a golden halo with a dove 
descending through atmosphere such as veils Mount Blanc on a 
clear summer day. It was spanned by luminous arches of 
marvelous beauty and the place was flooded by the soft light of 
thousands of wax candles. At the far end where the pope was 
enthroned, stood his altar. Behind and above this was an 
indescribable 'glory,' the bright soft golden rays of which melted 
away in a pure atmosphere. In the midst of this halo was a silver 
ground, with nothing upon it, so far as we could see, but at the 
appointed moment figures began to develop until we had the 
Trinity in this 'glory,' surrounded by cherubim. The Father 
appeared like a monk; the Son as a little baby in his mother's 
arms, smiling as if pleased to see so many pretty things; the 
Holy Ghost in the form of a dove, but the virgin Mary was the 
great object of adoration. As represented there and accepted by 
the Pope, the Trinity was merely to 'fill up the picture.' 

"Separated from the people were the reserved seats on either 
side, raised one above the other, covered with costly damask 
with golden cord and fringe. These were occupied by the various 
orders, viz.: Cardinals, archbishops, bishops, diplomatic corps, 
Roman nobility, the Pope's relatives, the representatives of 
various ecclesiastical orders, the Cardinal Secretary of State, 
with his officers, the major-domo of the apostolic palace, the 
pope's singers, etc. The Swiss and Palatine Guards, in their 
fantastic costumes, were the guards of honor. The galleries were 
occupied by distinguished visitors from all parts of the world. 

"As early as 5 o'clock the people began to assemble in the 
square in front of St. Peter's, though the ceremonies were not to 
begin until 9 o'clock, and they knew they could see nothing until 
that hour. At least 50,000 people stood from three to six hours 
and looked at the building in which such mysterious work was 
being performed. This was the order within. First, congregation 
of the orders, procurators of the college of cardinals, lawyers of 
the consistory, private chaplains, cross-bearers, priests in 
chasubles (long gowns), two hundred bishops with white mitres 
and capes of silver cloth, embroidered with gold, archbishops, 
among whom were many Armenians, Syrians and Greeks, 
dressed with a richness and magnificence beyond description. 
After these came forty cardinals in their official robes, preceded 



by vergers, followed by their 'tail bearers' and 'gentlemen in 
waiting.' 

"When all were seated, there was for a few moments the silence 
of the tomb. Then the Pope in his sacerdotal chair, under a 
golden canopy and flabelli, or immense fans, of ostrich and 
peacock feathers, surrounded by the pontifical court, was carried 
into the hall and seated upon the 'throne of God!' Extending his 
foot from under his royal robe, cardinals, archbishops and the 
others, in their order, came and kissed his hand, knee or toe, 
according to their rank. When this disgusting performance was 
ended the lawyers read the petitions for the canonization of 
these people, to which the Pope replied. Then he sang, 'Veni 
Creator,' placed the miter upon his head, and pronounced them 
saints ! At this moment the great bell of St. Peter's was rung and 
in a moment the thousands of bells in the city were rung wildly. 
The telegraph, by arrangement, told the news in other cities, and 
thus, all over the land, bells were rung to tell the people that now 
there were others in heaven to plead for them. 

"The Pope then signed the papers testifying that they were real 
saints and could be prayed to. Then he said mass and received 
the offerings for the occasion, consisting of a large historical 
candle, on which were painted historical scenes in the life of the 
saint, a silver cage with turtle doves, wild pigeons, canaries, and 
a box of bread and wine. He then bestowed the papal 
benediction and was borne out, and all retired in the order of 
their entrance. Thus ended this blasphemous demonstration of 
paganized Christianity. " 



This is the idolatrous and blasphemous system to which so 
many leading Protestants (so-called) are again turning with 
flatteries and compromises to gain her favor. This is the church 
which a Methodist bishop proclaims as a "great Christian 
camp;" which a Presbyterian minister affectionately owns as the 
Mother church to which he feels indebted for every doctrine he 
holds dear (Yea, verily!); which others declare must be 
conciliated by repeated concessions, until she is willing to own 
them as co-workers together with her. 

We have no idea that the mass of nominal Christians will be 
able to discern the hypocrisy, idolatry and blasphemy of this 
imposing and deceitful counterfeit of the true church glorified; 
but the Lord's true sheep, who know the voice of the true 
Shepherd and will not follow another, need only to be informed 
of facts, to see plainly the steps they should take— that if they are 
in any district of Great Babylon, either Papal or Protestant, they 
should obey the call, "Come out of her, my people. " 



R1140:page6 



WHAT SHALL WE SAY 
TO THESE THINGS? 

"What, then, shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who 
can be against us?" "We know that all things work together for 
good to them that love God, to them who are the called 
according to his purpose. "-Rom. 8:31,28. 

The early churches, whether composed of Jews or Gentiles, 
although they had accepted of Christ and had become his 
disciples, were still largely influenced by their former Jewish 
ideas and prejudices. The Jews, particularly, were slow to 
believe that now they merely stood on a common level with 
their Gentile brethren, having no pre-eminence whatever over 
the Gentiles; their only special favor, and a great one, though 
they failed to realize it as such, being in the fact that the gospel 
of the new dispensation was offered to them first. On the other 
hand, the Gentile converts, long accustomed to regard the Jews 
as the chosen people of God, were still disposed to grant them 
supremacy, and to be influenced by their prejudices. And until 
these prejudices were overcome, growth in grace, in the 
knowledge of the truth, and in the full assurance of faith, was 
greatly hindered. In order to fully appreciate the generous scope 
and breadth of the divine plan, the contracted views they had 
gained from God's dealings with Israel as a typical people must 
be dropped. 

It was with this thought in mind, and that he might assist the 
Jews to a humble recognition of their position, as well as to 
encourage and strengthen the Gentile believers, that Paul wrote 
his remarkable letter to the church (the company of believers) at 
Rome, as well as various portions of his other epistles to other 
congregations. The Jews were all strong believers in election. 
They knew and gloried in the fact that God had chosen them for 
his people, and made promises with reference to them to their 
father Abraham, long before they were born, and that while he 
paid no attention to other nations, he gave to them continual 
evidences of his favor and care. He superintended their affairs as 
a nation, gave them his law, appointed their judges, overcame 
their enemies, chastised them for their sins, and comforted and 
blessed them when they turned from their sins back to 
righteousness; and finally he sent his Son to them to be their 
Prophet, Priest and King. Thus God was a father to them, and 
owned them as his children, while for the time he seemed to 
ignore all other nations. And his promise was, that through 
them, in due time, the other nations should be blessed. 

But this favor of God to Israel did not have the effect of bringing 
them to loving, filial obedience and a hearty co-operation in 
God's plan, with a humble and grateful recognition of their 
constant dependence upon him. On the contrary, they were "a 
stiff-necked, rebellious house," puffed up with pride, as though 
they were worthy, and almost continually required the rod of 



correction. They were proud, and boastful of being the children 
of Abraham, concerning whom God had made so many 
wonderful promises; and though unworthy of any of God's 
favors, they were disposed to claim his favor on the ground of 
worthiness-as if they had merited it by keeping his law. 

They thought they were "the elect" to whom pertained the 
adoption, and all the promises, and all the glory. And truly, they 
were the elect, and heirs of the promise to Abraham, in the only 
sense in which either they or Abraham could understand it; but 
there was a grander significance to that promise, intended for the 
spiritual seed of Abraham, which was entirely concealed until 
the dawning of the Gospel age, when it was brought to light and 
made manifest through the apostles— to the Jews first, and 
afterward to the Gentiles. 

Paul's letter to the Romans was part of his effort to free both 
Jews and Gentiles from the former yoke of Judaism, and to lead 
them to implicit confidence in Christ as the end of the law for 
righteousness to every one that believeth, whether Jew or 
Gentile, as well as to give them a clear appreciation of the chief 
favor of God now offered, and the conditions on which it might 
be obtained. 

Even among those Jews who had believed on Christ, there was 
still the disposition to put upon Gentile believers the yoke of 
Judaism, and to trust at least measurably in the Law for the 
favors now 

R1140:page7 

promised only through faith in Christ. Their experience for 
nearly two thousand years past should have proved to them, 
beyond a doubt, their inability to keep the law and thereby merit 
God's favor; and had they not been so stiff-necked and proud, 
they would have been glad to realize their release from the 
condemnation of the Law, and to accept of God's favor in Christ 
on precisely the same terms offered to the Gentiles-the only 
terms on which they could receive it. 

Paul's argument in this letter to the Romans is not to prove or 
disprove the doctrine of election: that doctrine was already 
accepted. But his effort was to prove from the Scriptures, that 
although God had elected or chosen them as a people in the past, 
that was no proof that they would always be the people of his 
special favor. They were not in their pride and hardness of heart 
to console themselves with the thought that they had Abraham 
for their father; "for I say unto you," said John the immerser, 
"that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto 
Abraham." (Matt. 3:9.) God never meant to make such as they 
were at heart the heirs of his choicest favors. Israelites as a 
nation had proved their unworthiness, and had thereby forfeited 
the chief place of favor with God; for the promise that they 
should be the chief favorites was conditional- "If ye will obey 



my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a 
peculiar treasure unto me above all people; for all the earth is 
mine. And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy 
nation. "-Exod. 19:5,6. 

The chief favor had been blindly forfeited by Israel as a nation, 
though it was still within the reach of any individuals of that 
nation who might yet comply with the conditions and become 
joint-heirs of this chief favor, together with their Gentile 
brethren. Paul declared (Rom. 9:1-5) that he had great heaviness 
and continual sorrow of heart, because Israelites, his brethren 
according to the flesh, were so foolish and blind as not to 
perceive the great favor offered to them, and to them first, as 
another and their last mark of special favor. 

Then he adds (verse 6) that their failure as a nation to obtain the 
chief favor implied in the Abrahamic promise does not make the 
promise of God a failure. The fact that God could not own and 
use them, as a nation, to accomplish his work of the future, to 
bless all the families of the earth, would not thwart God's plan. 
On the contrary, Paul shows (verse 8) that the two sons of 
Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac, illustrated the fact that the natural 
seed of Abraham (Israel according to the flesh) would not 
inherit the chief blessings: for Ishmael was born in the ordinary 
course of nature, but Isaac, who typified the true heirs, was not 
so born, but on the contrary came by the exercise of divine 
power-not of the will of the flesh, but of God, for Sarah was not 
only barren but aged. (Heb. 11:11,12; John 1:13.) The Apostle's 
argument is, that this fact of passing by of the first-born and 
natural offspring, in the type, and the giving of the blessing to 
one not naturally born, to one subsequently born by divine 
interposition and in fulfilment of the original promise, showed 
that the natural or fleshly descendants of Abraham would not 
obtain the great, promised favor, but that another seed, a 
spiritual seed, would be developed, begotten of God by the word 
of truth, which would inherit all the privileges and honors 
contained in those promises. 

This fact, that the natural heirs would be set aside as unworthy, 
and a later-born be granted the more honorable place, was 
illustrated also in the two children of Isaac— Esau being passed 
by and Jacob being accepted as the heir of the Abrahamic 
promises. 

The rejection of Ishmael and Esau was not an injustice; it in no 
sense or degree related to their future, everlasting welfare. God 
had a great blessing to bestow, and Ishmael and Esau were made 
types of, to illustrate the unworthiness of fleshly Israel to inherit 
this great blessing, while Isaac and Jacob were made types of, to 
illustrate the selection of Christ and the Gospel Church to be 
God's instrumentalities for blessing all the world, in due time. 
The rejection of Ishmael and Esau, and natural Israel whom they 
typified, leaves them under no disadvantage, but on the common 



general footing with all men and all nations, aside from the 
"heirs of the kingdom. " In fact, they have an advantage over 
others by reason of the closeness of their natural relationship to 
the "heirs;" and they will be among the first to be blessed, when 
the true seed is completed and given the power to bless and 
restore the world. 

The promise made to Abraham will have its fulfilment, not only 
in this higher sense to the children of God-Christ Jesus and the 
church, typified by Isaac and Rebecca who became his joint- 
heir, -but also to Abraham personally and those of his natural 
seed who have come, or shall come, into harmony with the 
divine plan; for there will be two phases of the Kingdom of God 
which is to bless all nations, an earthly and a heavenly phase. 
(See, MILLENNIAL DAWN, Vol. I., chapter xiv.) Thus the 
promise made to Abraham will "be sure to all his seed; not to 
that only which is of the Law [the natural seed], but to that also 
which is of the faith of Abraham, who [as a figure or type of 
God] is the father of us all... like unto Him whom he believed, 
even God, who quickeneth the dead, and declareth those things 
which be not, as though they were." (Rom. 4:16,17.) And this 
intention on God's part to recognize more than Israel in the 
covenant blessing is shown also in the declaration to Abraham, - 
"I have constituted thee a father for many nations." This proves, 
conclusively, that God had in mind, originally, the selection of 
the promised seed of blessing, of which Christ is Head and Lord, 
as well as Redeemer. 

R1141 : page 7 

-Gal. 3:16,29. 

In the clearer light of the then dawning dispensation, Paul 
showed that Israel had nothing whereof to glory over Gentile 
believers in Christ; that though they had been the called and 
favored people of God from the very beginning of their history, 
their continuance in that favor beyond the limit of their special 
dispensation was contingent upon their worthiness -in other 
words, upon their meekness and faith in the Messiah, and in the 
advanced truths of the new dispensation, then being declared by 
his faithful apostles. 

Israel as a nation had already forfeited its privileges as God's 
favorites, but to individuals of that nation who were in the right 
condition of heart, this highest favor was first offered, yet on 
precisely the same terms that it was shortly after offered to the 
Gentiles: "For" he adds (chap. 10:12), "there is no difference 
between the Jew and the Greek; for the same Lord over all is 
rich unto all that call upon him. " The class which God had fore- 
ordained should receive this chief favor was to be composed of 
those who should be "conformed to the image of his Son. " 
(Rom. 8:29.) They must all have his likeness, be meek and 
lowly in heart, desiring only to know and to do the will of God 



at any cost or any sacrifice of their own will. This class God 
fore-knew or fore-ordained to receive "the fatness of the 
Abrahamic promise;" and to all of this class, whether found 
among Jews or Gentiles, the promise is sure. They shall be joint- 
heirs with his Son in the glory of his kingdom, and among them 
all distinctions of Jew and Gentile are obliterated; for unto this 
honor these were fore-ordained before the foundation of the 
world. These are the antitypical seed of Abraham, the children 
of God, "the elect according to the fore- knowledge of God," not 
as individuals but as a class, to whom belong the promises of 
eternal glory. 

Then, dear reader, if you are of this class thus conformed to the 
image of God's dear Son, if like him your will and effort is 
simply to know and do the will of God, if you are meek and 
lowly of heart, ready to receive instruction and profit by it at any 
cost, then take courage: you may thus be sure that you are one of 
those called to be of this elect class, and that you have accepted 
the call and are accepted in God's plan as a probationary 
member of the class fore-ordained to receive this divine honor 
of the kingdom. But if you have not this image of Christ, do not 
deceive yourself, you are not of the elect class; for "if any man 
hath not the spirit [this mind or likeness] of Christ, he is none of 
his. "-Rom. 8:9. 

Oh! says some timid one, but I am so unworthy, it surely is not 
for me; I am conscious every moment of my imperfection and 
short comings. 

That may be very true, yet if you have the likeness above 
referred to, the prize is open to you. God knows your 
weaknesses and short-comings; he knew it before he called you; 
he knew you could not keep his law perfectly, though you would 
greatly desire and try to do so; and so before he called you he 
made abundant provision for your justification. You were 
justified freely from all things by the death of Christ, your 
Redeemer. (Rom. 3:24.) "Whom God called, them he also 
justified." Not one was ever "called," i.e., invited to run for this 
kingdom prize, who was not first justified; and moreover, all 
"whom he justified, them he also honored" [doxazo, honored; 
"glorified" is a poor translation] with a "call." (Rom. 8:30.) 
Therefore, every called one is justified, and every justified one 
is honored with a call. It is for this purpose-that they might be 
eligible to the high calling— that any are justified (reckoned 
righteous through the imputed righteousness of Christ) in this 
age. And no one is thus justified by God through Christ, who 
has not repented of sin, believed on Christ as his Redeemer, and 
who does not humbly desire and endeavor to do the will of God. 

And if those thus justified and called heed the call and comply 
with its conditions —presenting themselves living sacrifices to 
God, with the same meek, obedient and teachable spirit, 
resolutely endeavoring to fulfil those conditions— they are sure 



of the great reward, the grandest favor in the gift of God, even 
though to other eyes than God's they may seem very unworthy, 
because of unavoidable weaknesses and imperfections of the 
flesh. 

What a full provision is this for us: that, though you be Jew or 
Gentile, bond or free, rich or poor, learned or ignorant, weak or 
strong, the promise, the very fatness of the Abrahamic promise, 
is for you, if you are Christ's, and being conformed to his image. 
Make your calling and election sure by continuing to conform to 
his image, faithfully, unto death. 

"And we know that all things work together for good to them 
that love God, to them who are the called according to his 
purpose. " We are not promised the luxuries of this life-ease, 
comfort, health, friends, etc., etc. On the contrary, we are fore- 
warned to expect the very opposite —enemies, persecutions, and 
the loss of all things, though we are promised that these ills of 
the present time, patiently and faithfully borne for the truth's 
sake, shall work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal 
weight of glory, and that all of them shall work together for our 
good. 

What then shall we say to these things? If God, with all his 
power, and wisdom, and love, be for us, who can be against us? 
He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, 
how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? Could 
he manifest his love in any stronger way than that? Could he 
show us by any stronger evidence, how freely he will give us all 
the glorious things which his exceeding great and precious 
promises lead us to hope for? If we would yet more fully assure 
our faith, let us remember our dear Lord's words- "Fear not, 
little flock, it is the Father's good pleasure to give you the 
kingdom;" "for the Father himself loveth you."— Luke 12:32; 
John 16:27. 

Well may we then ask, If God be for us, who can be against us? 
Puny indeed is the arm of flesh that is raised against the saints in 
defiance of the Almighty. Who shall lay anything to the charge 
of God's elect? It is God himself that justifieth. The supreme 
Judge of the supreme court has acquitted, once forever, all that 
are in Christ. 

Who is he that condemneth? Surely not our Lord Jesus, for he 
also commended his love toward us in freely giving his life for 
our redemption. Yea, more, he is even now at the right hand of 
God, making intercession for us, -not in the sense of pleading 
with the Father to do for us what he already planned and 
arranged to do, but his very presence at the right hand of power 
is the constant and availing plea for our salvation, proof that 
God's law was satisfied, that the claims of justice, which were 
against us, are fully met and forever canceled. Who, then, is he 
that condemneth, and seeketh to convince us that we are still 



condemned, that we are not justified freely from all things by 
the precious blood of Christ? It is the adversary! Beware of his 
deceptions, whether from within or without, or whether saint or 
sinner be his mouth-piece. 

If such be the love of Christ, who shall separate us from his 
love? You may have no charms in the eyes of the world; you 
may be old, deformed, awkward, crippled, blind, deaf, 
unlearned, illiterate, sick, despised, ridiculed, hated, friendless, 
poor, and persecuted; but no matter, these things cannot separate 
us from the love of Christ, or from the love of our Father, if we 
have the image of his Son. "Hearken, O daughter," says the 
Psalmist (45:10,11), "consider and incline thine ear, forget also 
thine own people and thy father's house"-forget the world in the 
sense of any cravings or desires for its approval or favors, and 
let your interests and affections be bound up with Christ's, and 
let your rejoicing be in the fact that you are called to be his 
bride. "So shall the King greatly desire thy beauty. " Thou art 
beautiful already in his eyes; for he looks upon the heart and 
reads its loyalty to him. 

Yes, says the Apostle, and "I am persuaded that neither death, 
nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things 
present, nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other 
creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, 
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."— Rom. 8:39. 

When you have bitter persecution and affliction, and worldly 
professors of Christianity look on and say, He is an evildoer and 
therefore the Lord will not permit him to prosper, heed it not, 
but keep on your way rejoicing in the Lord and in the privilege 
of bearing some of the reproaches that were heaped upon him, 
and let his word comfort you: "In the world ye shall have 
tribulation, but in me ye shall have peace. " Then forget the 
world and its opinions, that you may the more fully enjoy the 
peace of God which passeth the understanding of all others than 
this elect class. 

Call to mind also, for your comfort, how God's elect ones, to 
whatever position he had called them, were always thus tried. 
Paul in Rom. 9 cites the cases of Jacob and Esau. Jacob was the 
chosen, the beloved one, and Esau was loved less and not 
chosen; yet it was Jacob that suffered tribulation, while Esau 
flourished and increased in goods. So also the chosen nation of 
Israel was disciplined under suffering, while other nations took 
their own course and received no discipline. The present is the 
time of discipline to the chosen ones. What son is he whom the 
Father chasteneth not? If we receive no chastisement, then we 
may be sure we are not sons. 

Then what shall we say to these things? Is there any space left 
for doubts and fears? May we not have the full assurance of 
faith, in proportion as we are faithfully conformed to the image 



of God's dear Son, in meekness and entire consecration to the 
will of God? The promise of God is not to the fearful and 
unbelieving, but to those who like Joshua and Caleb say, Since 
God has called us, we be fully able to go up and possess the land 
of promise. 

R1142:page7 

What God has promised, he is able also to perform: "Faithful is 
he that calleth you, who also will do it." (1 Thes. 5:24.) The 
promise is to the called and chosen [accepted] and faithful. Let 
us prove faithful!— Rev. 17:14. 

What more can he say 
Than to you he hath said: 
You who unto Jesus 
For refuge have fled?" 



R1142:page8 

THE CHILDREN'S TOWER. 

"What kind of helps have you for children? I wish there were a 
TOWER that children could understand. " 

We have no reading matter specially designed for children, and 
we cannot refer you to any papers or books setting forth God's 
plan in a manner suited to the comprehension of children. Nor 
would such a thing be possible. Though children's minds, 
unprejudiced, are specially susceptible to the truth, and they 
seem to drink in the beautiful story of Jesus and his love, his 
redemptive work and work of restitution, yet children need 
personal teaching and living example. As you study the divine 
plan, and come to understand it more and more clearly, live it 
and teach it, step by step, simplifying it and diluting it, so as to 
bring it down to the comprehension of each of your children- 
even little tot whose eyes will open wide with wonder as she 
will question you regarding the wonders of restitution in the 
Millennium. 

Study the principles of the divine will and show your children, 
by word and example, how to apply them in the everyday affairs 
of life. The parent is the very best instructor for children, and it 
is a very mistaken idea to hand them over for religious training 
to the Sunday Schools, where they actually receive little to 
profit, but very much to engender and to cultivate pride and love 
of display. 

There are some children's papers and books which, if carefully 
selected, would be aids to moral culture. But as a general thing 
light literature is placed in the hands of children on the 
supposition that they are not capable of appreciating books of 
merit and usefulness, until the taste for light reading is formed, 



to the exclusion of that which is wholesome and good. When 
they are able to read well, they are able to appreciate something 
worth reading. 

The parents, then, should be the TOWERS of strength for their 
children, their teachers both in morals and theology, and God 
will add his blessing to your earnest efforts. Not only will the 
children be blessed, but you will be blessed also by faithfulness 
in this matter. You cannot transfer to a Sunday School teacher, 
or any one else, the responsibilities which as a parent you owe to 
your children, to train them in doctrine and practice 
conformably to the spirit of God's Word. If you have brought 
children into the world, you have an obligation toward them in 
God's sight, until they reach years of discretion, which must not 
be set aside, even to take part in the glorious and important work 
of preaching and teaching the truth to the more matured. 

A brother recently confessed sorrowfully, that before he came to 
see the truth regarding God's plan of the ages, he used to spend 
his Sundays in church (sectarian) work and Y.M.C.A. work 
from morning till night, and paid almost no attention to his own 
family's spiritual matters, the very duty which should have taken 
precedence to all others. He was led astray in this, as many 
others have been, by a false theology, by the mistaken idea that 
God had sent him to "save souls" from eternal torment. 

This brother, no less zealous now, has his judgment more 
correctly guided, has received "the spirit of a sound mind" from 
an unprejudiced study of God's Word. Now he sees that Christ's 
death redeemed all from death, and that in God's "due time," in 
the Millennial age,- 

He comes to make his blessings flow 
Far as the curse is found. 

And he sees that now it is his privilege as one who has found 
Christ and tasted of his favor, to tell these good tidings to all 
who have ears to hear, beginning with his own household; and 
as for those who have no ear for the good tidings, he now sees 
that he need not agonize for them, because God has already 
arranged that they all must come to a knowledge of the truth, 
concerning his goodness and abundant provision for them, that 
all may be saved, if they will, not from torments, but from the 
second death- from extinction -and have everlasting life. His is 
now a reasonable joy and peace and a reasonable service— based 
upon the reasonable teachings of the good word of the good 
God. 

God bless the dear children; and may the consecrated parents, 
instructed and equipped of God and invested with a just and 
love-inspired authority over their children until the years of 
maturity are reached, be indeed their towers of strength, training 
them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, until through 
their instrumentality young manhood and blooming womanhood 



shall come forth with strong hearts and ready hands and 
consecrated wills to take part in the Master's great work. 

We are pleased to learn, from several quarters, that children of 
the saints are receiving the truth and catching its spirit, and that 
some at the early ages of ten and twelve are active missionaries 
to the extent of their ability. Elsewhere in this TOWER you will 
find a suggestion as to a way in which the children may do 
effective harvest service; and a way, therefore, in which busy 
mothers can do some harvest work by proxy.

VIEW FROM THE TOWER. 

How few there are who put together and see the relationship of 
those three statements of the prophet Daniel: (1) "Many shall 
run to and fro" [referring to the general and rapid 
intercommunion between the people of earth]; and (2) 
"Knowledge shall be increased" [the direct consequence of the 
intermixture of various peoples and their various ideas]; and (3) 
"There shall be a time of trouble such as was not since there was 
a nation. " 

Many who can see that the great and general increase of 
knowledge, of our day, is the result of the interchange of thought 
among the people-by means of printing, railroads, telegraphs, 
etc., etc.— fail to see that this very increase of knowledge is not 
producing happiness and contentment, but that, on the contrary, 
it is producing discontent and unhappiness; and this 
increasingly, as the knowledge increases; so that ere long it will 
lead to a fratricidal strife, and in general to just what the prophet 
has foretold— "a time of trouble such as was not since there was 
a nation. " 

It can not be denied that the grandfathers of the present 
generation, with a less degree of general intelligence than their 
children of to-day, with fewer of the comforts, conveniences and 
luxuries, were much more contented, and hence really much 
happier, than their children who possess these favors which are 
the results of increased knowledge. Shall we conclude, then, that 
knowledge is an injurious thing, and not a blessing? 

The Negroes of the South were probably happier fifty years ago, 
in slavery, than they now are; and though now possessed of 
many more privileges than were ever before accorded them, yet 
the reports are that a race war, between blacks and whites, is to 
be feared. It was an increase of knowledge that led public 



sentiment to a repudiation of human slavery and that 
emancipated the slaves; and it is a fuller knowledge of his rights 
as a man, under the law of God, and as a citizen, under the 
Constitution of these United States, that is stirring within the 
hearts of the Negroes a desire for more and more, until they 
shall feel satisfied that they have their full proportion of the 
rights, privileges and common blessings of our day. 

Is knowledge an evil thing, an injury to society, then, we again 
ask? 

Many would answer, "Yes, it is an evil thing: the lower classes 
of society would be wholly ungovernable, if all class- 
distinctions were obliterated, if they were not under the 
wholesome restraints at present exercised by society, which is 
well supported by the nominal church, which in turn is well 
upheld by the most intelligent, influential and most wealthy 
element of society. If the priestcraft and superstitions of the dark 
ages are vanishing before the greater intelligence of the 
nineteenth century, something must be found as a substitute 
therefor, else we shall lose the control of society; the masses 
will become so independent and dictatorial that we will be 
hindered from carrying on our governmental and business plans, 
which, while they have accrued to our own 

R1143 :pagel 

interest, specially and chiefly, were really better for the masses 
too, as evidenced by the growth of their ambition and discontent 
as their knowledge and privileges are increased. 'Let us put on 
the brakes ! Let us stop the spread of knowledge or it will wreck 
our social fabric!'" 

And to this expression the Papacy would breathe a fervent 
(though inaudible) "Amen!" and reflect upon its glorious career 
in the dark ages when priestcraft and superstition held full sway, 
and the pope was owned to be "another god on earth." And 
many nominally Protestants, some of them earnest, intelligent 
persons, would take a similar view, except that they would like 
to preserve the intelligence and liberty of the educated and 
wealthy, remembering with dread the time when Papacy held 
such control that even their classes dared scarcely to think, let 
alone to act or speak. 

Our answer to the question is, The fault lies in the imperfection 
of the social fabric and not with the increasing knowledge which 
threatens to wreck it. True, a knowledge that is only partial may 
for a while work more harm than good; for as some one has 
said- 

A little knowledge is a dangerous thing; 
Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring. 

It would be better for all concerned, if full, absolute knowledge 
were general; all would then be more quickly adjusted, no 



doubt; the struggle would be shorter and sharper, and a new 
arrangement of human affairs, a new social fabric, suited to the 
increased knowledge and recognizing every individual's rights 
to the fullest extent, would supersede the present order. But this 
is not possible: knowledge must come gradually and 
individually; God's "due time" has come for knowledge to be 
increased, but he will not bring it about miraculously but by 
natural means, such as the "running to and fro" of men and 
ideas. God's method will not only bring about the great time of 
trouble predicted, but it will also give mankind a valuable and 
lasting lesson on justice, which will enable each, thereafter, to 
look fairly upon another's rights as well as his own, when their 
interests differ. 

The result of God's method of introducing knowledge will be 
that the old social fabric in the hands of the small class of 
favored ones -intellectually, financially and politically-will 
endeavor to remain, to continue itself upon the old lines and 
principles;-merely stretching itself a little more to 
accommodate itself to the increasing pressure from expanding 
ideas of the people in general. Yet all the while, its general 
structure prevents its expansion much beyond its present limits, 
and each increase of pressure from within adds to the strain 
upon both the people and the present social structure. The 
present liberty and privilege and share of earth's blessings 
accorded to mankind in general would have been grand and 
benevolent beyond appreciation in the "dark ages," but now it 
fetters and frets the masses, because knowledge has increased; 
and they will continue to fret and strike and plot until in 
everything they have their full share of all blessings, comforts, 
privileges, advantages and liberties as men; as common heirs of 
the world and its natural advantages. In this the masses respond 
to the principle of selfishness; even as the upper class of society, 
actuated by a similar selfishness, seeks not only to hold present 
wealth (which is at least an excusable weakness,) but also to 
perpetuate the present social structure which so greatly favors 
the already favored class. 

It is the new wine in the old wine-skins (Matt. 9:17) over again: 
it is the new principles, of justice and equality among men, the 
principles which must prevail during the Millennial age, that are 
now stretching the old system of things and which ultimately 
will burst and destroy the present social order in a period of 
troubles, disaster and anarchy. What lessons both parties will 
learn, regarding each other's worth and rights in that dark day! 
Thank God, his children are also advised by his Word of the 
glorious Day to follow, in which society shall be reorganized 
(the "new earth") under the blessed influence of the Lord and the 
glorified Church (the "new heavens"), upon a basis of fullest 
justice to all,— under the gracious provisions of the New 
Covenant. 



Many conscientious and even benevolent minds fail to see 
wherein the present social structure is unfair, or wherein it 
grants greater privileges to one than to another; and in 
amazement they inquire: "Do you mean to suggest that all who, 
by careful, prudent living, by industry and temperance in all 
things, have accumulated a few hundred or a few thousand 
dollars for their old age, that they may not be chargeable to any, 
should divide this product of industry and frugality with others 
who have been too indolent to work, or who have wasted their 
earnings in a wild, profligate course, and who would soon waste 
also the accumulations of others to their own injury?" 

No; such a view is held by few— by very few, if any, even among 
the reckless, professed anarchists. It is too much the case that 
people who are being actually pinched by want, and who have a 
little money laid aside for old age or "a rainy day," feel that their 
interests lie across the path of any social reorganization; and 
such too often dismiss all suggestions that the present social 
structure is imperfect and could be improved upon for the 
general good- for the benefit of the poorer class-without doing 
any injustice to the wealthier class; without interfering with a 
single one of their rights or a single dollar they already possess. 
Although, we confess, such a just and equitable re-adjustment of 
the laws would make it less possible for a few to become 
suddenly very wealthy, or others equally industrious and sober 
and careful to become miserably poor. 

But our overly-conservative friend further inquires: "Is not the 
present social arrangement a necessity? What would the 
miserably poor do if it were not for the benevolence of the rich? 
How could railroads and large manufacturing establishments be 
built and conducted were it not for the immensely wealthy 
class?" 

We answer: There are plenty of people who have sufficient 
intelligence to conduct 

R1143 : page 2 

large manufactories, railroading, etc. Our United States 
Government is a practical illustration of the principle; and the 
Postoffice department is another. Where private interest and 
competition alone control, selfishness is sure to prevail. And the 
result must be to reduce labor to the lowest point and keep it 
there; and to produce combinations and trusts, to offset 
competition and add thereby to the wealth and influence of those 
who have capital, and to keep at the foot of the ladder those who 
have none. Nor would a reconstruction in this line imply the 
same reward for unskilled, uneducated labor as for skill and 
education: we have this also illustrated in the Government and 
in the Postoffice, where various salaries are paid according to 
proficiency and ability, but where selfishness and greed can 



reduce none to starvation wages, or unhealthy conditions, or 
oppressive over-work. 

That something is radically wrong with society as at present 
organized all must admit. It was probably at one time as good an 
arrangement as could have been made, and doubtless served a 
good purpose; but its usefulness has been outgrown with the 
general increase of knowledge. And instead of endeavoring to 
curb knowledge, in order that people may be happy and 
contented under the old conditions, we should increase the 
knowledge and change the social conditions to correspond. 

Look, for instance, at the great London strike; in which the 
laborers about the docks and wharfs are seeking to improve their 
condition, just a little. Note the reply of the managers of the 
Docking Company: that, though the advance asked was not very 
large for each laborer, yet, there being so large a number of 
them, it would mean a large sum of money in the aggregate, 
equaling the interest on a very large sum. If the small increase of 
salary to each man were granted, it would reduce the dividends 
of the Dock Company, and thus depreciate their property. But 
who or what is this Dock Company? It is a corporation which, 
by investing capital in building docks for shipping, in the port of 
London, long since gained a monopoly of the suitable water- 
front of the city, and which doubtless long since repaid to the 
investors the original investment with good interest and has 
probably "watered" its stock several times, but still maintains its 
hold upon its franchises; and which long ago ground down its 
laborers, who are of the poorest class of London's poor, to as 
little as would enable them barely to live, in order that its 
managers could return larger and larger dividends to the share- 
holders. And now, notwithstanding the increase of general 
blessings, conveniences and knowledge, the managers and 
stockholders would selfishly reap all the benefits, and would 
deny the poor laborers any. And their fear is not only for the 
present increase demanded, but for the future. They know that 
even at the advance the laborers are not sufficiently paid, and 
they fear another and another demand. "Give them an inch and 
they will want an ell" is the saying, and it is true; and inch by 
inch it must be given, until they get all that their labor and skill 
honestly entitle them to, which is not less than an economical 
but a comfortable living. 

Around those very docks of London charitable people have for 
years kept up cheap restaurants, and coffee and lunch wagons, 
from which many of these poor were supplied with one or two 
meals per day at much less than the cost of the food —one cent 
for a bowl of soup and one cent for a tin of pudding. These 
charitable arrangements speak loudly of sympathizing hearts 
who helped supply the additional cost, as well as of those of the 

R1144:page2 



attendants who take turns in giving their time to the benevolent 
work of serving these stalls, wagons, etc. Doubtless some who 
hold stock in the Dock Company, and who draw their dividends, 
use a portion in this or in some other "sweet charity," and thus 
show the noble side of their hearts. But, such should realize that 
the proper thing to do is, to so right and reconstruct society and 
its laws that such men as are industrious should be enabled to 
work, and that at such a moderate compensation as would enable 
them to have enough to eat without appealing to charity. There 
will be much less need for "sweet charity" (though still plenty of 
room for it) when sweet justice comes to be rightly seen and 
practiced. 

In this land, though justice is not yet quite even-handed, and 
though the laws have not yet been fully arranged to thwart 
monopolies and trusts, there is certainly much less room for 
complaint of injustice as well as much less opportunity for 
charity. It is in the old world that the greatest changes must be 
expected. Nor is it in England alone, or even specially, that the 
foretold "trouble" is brewing, as a result of growing intelligence 
and the effort of the masses to secure a fuller share of the 
bounties and blessings of our day: our readers saw recently in 
the secular press accounts of the greatest strike of coal-miners 
ever known in Germany. So intense was the feeling, and so 
widespread the strike, that a revolution was feared, if the poorer 
classes got to see their strength, and the Emperor of Germany 
condescended to assist in compromising the difficulty. The 
following, clipped from the New York Tribune, gives a picture 
of the condition of things in another part of Europe:— 

"Standing in one of the ante-rooms leading to the office of the 
Mayor of the city of Amsterdam on a January morning four 
years ago, a spectacle was presented which seems to an 
American citizen a proof that the Millennium has not yet 
arrived. The previous afternoon a meeting of the unemployed 
laboring men had been held in Vondel's Park, and the crowd was 
so immense that the city authorities became alarmed with the 
thought that a bread riot might take place at the close of the 
meeting, so the Burgomeester issued a proclamation informing 
the people that his office would be open for audience on the 
following day. Never before in the history of that city had an 
interview of the working-men with the Chief Magistrate been 
allowed; a certain proof of the somber political atmosphere 
overhanging Amsterdam. The City Hall was overflowing with a 
crowd of pale, emaciated- looking men, holding in their hands 
certificates signed by the Prefects of Police that the bearer was 
actually in sore need of bread. According to the official list, 
signed by the Mayor's secretary, 2,243 certificates of this 
description were handed in that day. "The streets leading to the 
City Hall were crowded with women and children, and when at 
4 o'clock in the afternoon the city fathers gave orders to 
distribute 1,500 loaves of bread, the scenes enacted defy 



description. Men and women fought like ravenous beasts to 
obtain a loaf of bread, and in fifteen minutes the supply was 
exhausted. In the Leydsche Straat, an American lady inquired 
the cause of the multitude of men, women and children rushing 
as if demented toward a common center of the city. Being 
informed that the amount of bread given out at the City Hall had 
not half supplied the hungry ones, she entered a bake shop and 
bought out the stock on hand. Seven hundred and three loaves of 
bread were passed out the door to the people, who by their 
instant sampling of the gift, proved that dry bread was an 
absolute necessity to them. 

"The city press in general deplored the situation of affairs, but 
being under the strict surveillance of the Government, were very 
careful to express their thoughts in guarded language. It was 
stated that a woman with three little children was found in a 
small room actually starved to death, her husband being unable 
to procure bread by labor and being too proud to beg for his 
dying family. Below this statement in the same newspaper 
column was a notice that the Foreign Missionary Society at their 
meeting the night previous had raised 25,000 gulden ($10,000) 
to supply the foreign field. To give the starving workmen of 
Amsterdam something to do seemed not so necessary as to 
supply the inhabitants of Africa with Bibles and missionaries, 
and yet Americans wonder that European workmen become 
socialists." 



How often the generous and the selfish elements of fallen men 
are thus displayed side by side. The $10,000 raised for the 
heathen, to help keep some of them, as the donors doubtless 
supposed, out of an eternity of torment, speak of a sympathy 
which we must commend; while the hungry thousands at their 
own doors speak of unjust social regulations and laws, and of a 
selfishness on the part of the wealthy class which, seeing this, 
refuses or neglects to rectify those laws, lest its own march to 
greater wealth and perhaps further subscriptions for foreign 
missions should be interfered with. 

In our next issue we may point out briefly some of the defects of 
present social laws and customs, but suffice it now that we have 
pointed out that the trouble now gathering, described by Daniel 
as "a time of trouble such as was not since there was a nation, " 
is coming just as he, under divine guidance, foretold— as the 
result of interchange among men and the consequent increase of 
knowledge, as we are now witnessing it on every hand. 

Just a word of exhortation: To the few brethren who have 
means, and to all according to ability, we would say— Remember 
first of all to practice justice in all your conduct; then be as 
charitable as the Master's funds in your hands will in your 
judgment permit of. Remember that you are merely a steward 



and are to handle the Lord's money according to his will as 
nearly as you can know it. The poorer brethren we exhort to 
peace, patience and charity. This conflict is not one in which the 
saints are to take part: it is the world's part in the "Battle of the 
Great Day. " Our part in the conflict is to uphold God's Word, 
truth against error; and we will have plenty to do in our own 
quarter, if faithful. Even if you feel that you are being unjustly 
dealt with, do the best you can, but live peaceably. The Lord 
will avenge any wrongs you may suffer, so far as that part is 
concerned; and in any case we can look with a great deal of 
sympathy upon the selfish, remembering and pitying their fallen 
condition and rejoicing that the grand time of righteousness and 
restitution is nigh, even at the doors.

EXTRACTS FROM 
INTERESTING LETTERS. 

New York. 

MY DEAR FRIEND:-I enclose $1.00 on my account. Please 
send me about 5 each of the July and August Towers. I am glad 
that you are showing from historical data the course of 
corruption of the doctrine of the church. That, however, is but 
one of many good things found in the August TOWER. 

Some of my remarks in prayer meeting have recently aroused 
opposition and one zealous brother wants me prevented from 
speaking. Another to whom I lent DAWN tells another that it is 
a dangerous book, and I guess it is, to some bad doctrines. This 
fearful saint is a deacon and not long ago he called on and asked 
me to accept a nomination for elder. He was horrified to learn 
that I was not a member of their church and more so to learn the 
reasons. Well, I hope to accomplish something; else, why am I 
here? I have a few sympathetic hearers. I have been privately 
considering the calling together of such as will come to study 
the Bible some weekday evening, a non-sectarian Bible class. 
Am in some doubt how best to do it, but hope to reach the result 
some way. 

In haste, Yours very truly, J. A. S. 

Grant Co., Ind. 

C. T. RUSSELL-DEAR BROTHER:- Judging you and others 
by myself, I thought I would offer a few words of cheer. Bros. 
Leigh and Deming, willing servants, stayed with us, some time 
ago, from Saturday till Monday. We spent the time pleasantly in 
discussing, for the most part, the objections the nominal church 
brings against us. We again met in Marion and spent a few hours 
together, very pleasantly. These noble Christians are, indeed, 



making a "willing sacrifice" of all. They need encouragement. I 
received a postal by last mail, stating they were suffering from 
malaria, but after two days rest, went to Hartford to canvass that 
city. I want to write to them and have them come home and stay 
until they recuperate. How pleasant it is to be with these dear 
brethren. I want to tell you, we do not feel so lonesome now, as 
we felt a year ago. There is a rift in the dark cloud, and the sun 
is shining in; others are seeing the light, and as Bro. Leigh says, 
we have a plan, and notwithstanding it is so broad, it is entirely 
protected by God's Word. 

Others are beginning to see this plan, which is so simple and so 
plain, and so harmonious with the Bible and the character of a 
great and good God; and the best of all, as soon as they begin to 
see its unfolding, they thirst for more and want others to come to 
the fountain and into harmony with the truth. 

Mrs. M. joins me in Christian love to you and yours. 

G. P. M. 

London, England. 

DEAR BRO. RUSSELL:-With thankfulness for the great 
blessing the TOWER has been in the past, we again renew our 
subscription, still rejoicing in its teachings as meat in due 
season. We rejoice that we have been freed from Babylon by the 
truth and can now look with wonder and admiration at Jehovah's 
plan. DAWN, Vol. II., with its time proofs, is a marvel of beauty 
and clearness, setting the time proofs so clear before all who 
will patiently search for truth. 

The truth is finding a few over here and spreading, we trust, 
though quietly and slowly. We are able to sell a few DAWNS, 
from time to time, and think if we can get some old theology 
tracts and Arps well circulated, others may begin to inquire. 
Yours in love and service, 

S. A. H 

Lamar, Ark. 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-I have received all the mail you 
sent; for which I return thanks. The truth has been such a 
blessing to me, I do not see how I could have made out without 
it. I was glad to get Vol. II. I wish I could express my feelings; I 
read and learn and rejoice, thanking the Lord for the blessed 
truths. I have read it through three times and began a fourth. I 
then got my Vol. I. home, which had been out on a mission, and 
I gave it another careful reading. 

Yours in Christian love, 

M. T.

[LETTERS CONTINUED.] 



Belvidere, Ills. 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-I enclose a list of orders for 
DAWN, Vol. I., with Postal Note for the amount of the 
memorandum. I have had much traveling to do lately in my 
Insurance business, more than I like; there is danger I fear of 
being overcharged; I must try to cut off some. And yet, though I 
have not had much time for meditation and study of the Word or 
for dispensing the truth to others, and therefore feel more lean, I 
am glad that it has not come from any loss of appetite or relish 
for the spiritual food or 

page 8 

service, for I am very hungry and anxious for opportunities and 
must make them. 

My Son Paul (now a Brother in Christ, you will be glad to 
learn), though only in his thirteenth year, gives good evidence of 
full consecration; he has made a start at the colporteur work of 
selling DAWN, Vol. I., and has had sufficient success to warrant 
the sending of my last order of 100 copies, which were for his 
use. 

I enclose the subscription of a minister, Rev. S . He 

sat down in the car seat with me to-day, and I gave him the Old 
Theology- Wages of Sin. After he had read it nearly through, he 
turned on me and said he thought I had better stop giving such 
stuff out. He asked me, if I had ever saved anybody with it. I 
asked him in return, if he had ever saved any one with his God- 
dishonoring errors about eternal torment. I told him all we knew 
of the future was contained in the Book, and defied him to name 
a single passage proving his doctrine. Then he hedged by 
saying, It is best to be on the "safe" side. This of course was 
easily answered by saying that it is best to teach the truth as we 
find it in God's Word, and it is not good policy to try to improve 
upon God's theology. Our talk was very brief, much less than 
five minutes, but much to my surprise he promised to read 
MILLENNIAL DAWN. 

W. M. WRIGHT. 

Mears, Mich. 

DEAR BRO. RUSSELL:-Second Volume of MILLENNIAL 
DAWN, cloth bound, was safely received, and for the past few 
weeks I have been feasting myself with its contents. I have 
always opposed the fixing of a particular time for the setting up 
and establishing of the Redeemer's Kingdom; but your data so 
plainly established from what has hitherto been held to be 
hidden and obscure and at the same time so much in harmony 
with itself and the truth now shining so clearly, compel me to 
accept it. And in accepting it I find myself both cheered and 
comforted, as I realize the time is so near. 



My health is too poor to permit me to travel, but I do all I can to 
spread the truth in my limited sphere. May the Lord richly bless 
you and crown your labor with abundant success is the prayer of 
yours in the faith and service of the gospel. 

T. B . 

Grand Rapids, Mich. 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-I will tell you briefly of my 
efforts here. Have been here two weeks and have been working 
in the business part of the city nearly all the time. I have sold 
300 DAWNS-nearly half of them being Vol. H When here two 
years ago, I sold only about 35 in the business part of the city. 
The increase, I think, is owing somewhat to the interest formed 
by hearing of the book; but perhaps more directly by a better 
presentation of its merits. It requires considerable tact, 
earnestness and experience to interest business men in a 
religious work. Though if once interested the influence is apt to 
be good, as they are generally at the head of practical and 
representative families. 

The principal object now, I think, is to find the "sheep" and 
minister unto them; but in doing this, we can do good unto all, 
as we have opportunity. I have not yet decided whether it will be 
well to canvass the whole city again now. If the exceedingly 
warm weather continues it will perhaps be better to work in 
smaller towns for a while. 

It is interesting to note the way in which the truth and harmony 
brought out in DAWN is being circulated and found out. Being 
good tidings, they who find it go and tell their own brother, 
sister or friend. These likewise go and tell others, even as it was 
when the Savior was first discovered among men. And how 
blessed are they who are permitted to publish these things ! 

I greatly enjoyed the "View" in last TOWER. Truly, the Elisha 
class will be more numerous than that of the Elijah. And though 
the former class will be highly favored, I am striving and hoping 
to be one of the overcomers. In considering the subject I have 
been interested in trying to trace the import and typical meaning 
of 2 Kings 2:10— where we read "If thou see me taken from thee; 
but if not, it shall not be so. " Will it be that the Elisha class will 
need to know, or see, when the Elijah class is taken from them 
in order that they may inherit a "double" portion of the spirit? 
[This would seem to teach that it will be only such as keep in 
fellowship with the Elijah class, such, therefore, as will know 
them and realize that they are being exalted, who will constitute 
the Elisha class and be inspired to fresh zeal and redoubled 
earnestness in the service of the truth from a realization of the 
facts.-EDITOR.] 

With Christian love to you and Sister R. and others of them that 
are His, I remain, Yours in service, S. D. ROGERS. 



Indianapolis. 

DEAR BRO. RUSSELL:-I enclose now $20 of which $5 is to 
be credited to my DAWN account and the other $15 is to be 
used to send Food and "Hail" to our dear Bro. H. I enclose his 
letter and order which of course you can fill much better and 
less expensively to him than I could. 

The return home to-day from my week's labors found all well, 
and I rejoice and praise the Lord for results. The whole week 
was a triumphal march of Immanuel's banner and cause against 
the hosts of sin, ignorance, superstition and unbelief. 

I told you that they had asked me to return to I., and give them 
another address on my way back home. I did so, and found that 
the interested ones had been unable to secure a church and had 
hired a hall and paid my board and all expense for the second 
discourse. I sold all my books and more, having to mail some 
back to-day. This morning I found them hanging on me still to 
have Scripture explained and I again preached to them from 7 
A.M. till train time at 10 A.M. I spoke three times on the trip, 
twice at great disadvantage, but my voice held out and grew 
stronger and my mouth was full of the high praises of our God. 

With kindest regards and remembrance joined by Sr. A. to you 
and Sr. Russell. In Christ the Lord, 

J. B. ADAMSON.

YIELD NOT TO FEAR. 

Poor, fainting spirit, still hold on thy way- 

The day is near! 

True, thou art weary; but yon brighter ray 

Becomes more clear. 

Bear up a little longer; wait for rest; 

Yield not to slumber, though with toil oppressed. 

"The coming night is mournful, but look on— 

The dawn is here! 

Soon will earth's shadowy scenes and gloom be gone; 

Yield not to fear: 

The mountain's summit will ere long be gained, 

And thy bright hopes with joy and peace attained. 

'Joyful through hope!' thy motto still must be- 

The dawn is here! 

What glories will that dawn unfold to thee! 

Be of good cheer! 

Gird up thy loins; bind sandals on thy feet: 

The way is short, though rough; the end is sweet. " 



R620 : page 3 



A little while, our fightings shall be over; 
A little while, our tears be wiped away; 
A little while, the power of Jehovah 
Shall turn our darkness into gladsome day. 

A little while, the fears that oft surround us 
Shall to the memories of the past belong; 
A little while, the love that sought and found us 
Shall change our weeping into heaven's glad song. 

A little while! Tis ever drawing nearer- 
The brighter dawning of that glorious day. 
Blest Savior, make our spirits' vision clearer, 
And guide, O guide us in the shining way.

A little while, O blessed expectation! 
For strength to run with patience, Lord, we cry, 
Our hearts up leap in fond anticipation; 
Our union with the Bridegroom draweth nigh. "

THE AUTHORSHIP AND 
CREDIBILITY OF THE BIBLE. 

While the Bible is generally accepted by Christian people as of 
divine authority, comparatively few are able to clearly state just 
why they so esteem it. The internal evidence of its truthfulness, 
and its grandeur of doctrine, are the principal evidences on 
which its testimony is, and should be, generally received; and 
truly these are strong, and convincing of its divine authorship 
and authority; yet the man of God who would be thoroughly 
furnished with the truth, and armed against every attack of 
skepticism, should endeavor to know all he can of the time, 
manner, circumstances, etc., under which it was written; 
whether it has been preserved free from corruption; and whether 
in its present condition it is worthy of full confidence. Let us, 
therefore, briefly consider what testimony we have to the 
credibility of the Sacred Writings. 

From numerous expressions, references and quotations in the 
New Testament by our Lord and the apostles it is evident 

R1145 : page 3 

that a certain body of writings was at that time considered to be 
of divine authority. The Sacred Scriptures then in existence are 
now characterized as the Old Testament Scriptures (the 



Scriptures of the Old or Law Covenant), while that which was 
added by our Lord and the apostles is termed the New 
Testament (the New Covenant) Scriptures. 

No other book which the world has ever known has such a 
history as the Bible. Its origin and authorship, its antiquity, its 
wonderful preservation in the midst of the unparalleled and 
continuous opposition which sought to destroy it, as well as its 
diversity and teaching, make the Bible the most wonderful book 
in existence. 

It is a collection composed of sixty-six separate books, written 
by about forty different writers, living centuries apart, speaking 
different languages, subjects of different governments, and 
brought up under different civilizations. Over 1500 years 
elapsed between the writings of Moses and of John. 

As no other reliable history dates so far back as the Bible, we 
are obliged to look mainly to its own internal evidence, as to its 
origin, authorship, and the reason for its existence, and indeed 
for its credibility in every respect; and further, we should look 
for such corroboration of its statements as reason, its own 
harmony with itself, and with other known facts, and subsequent 
developments furnish. And indeed this is the evidence of 
reliability on which all history must rest. To such evidence we 
are indebted for all our knowledge of past events and of all 
present events as well, except such as come under our own 
immediate observation. He who would cast away Bible history 
as unworthy of credence, must on the same ground reject all 
history; and to be entirely consistent, must believe nothing 
which does not come under his own personal observation. 

If its statements, thoroughly understood, are contradictory, or 
are colored by prejudice, or are proven untrue by a positive 
scientific knowledge, or if subsequent developments prove its 
predictions untrue, and thereby show the ignorance or 
dishonesty of the authors of the Bible, then we may reasonably 
conclude that the entire book is unworthy of confidence, and 
should reject it. But if, on the contrary, we find that a thorough 
understanding of the Bible, according to its own rules of 
interpretation, shows its statements to be in harmony with each 
other; if it bears no evidence of prejudicial coloring; if many of 
its prophecies have actually come true, and others admit of 
future fulfilment; if the integrity of its writers is manifested by 
unvarnished records, then we have reason to believe the book. 
Its entire testimony, historic, prophetic, and doctrinal, stands or 
falls together. Science is yet in its infancy, yet in so far as 
positive scientific knowledge has been attained, it should and 
does corroborate the Bible testimony. 



INTERNAL EVIDENCES. 

Those who will make a study of the Bible plan will be fully 
convinced of the conclusive evidence of the credibility of the 
Sacred Scriptures, which is furnished in the purity, harmony and 
grandeur of its teachings. Outside of the Scriptures we have 
nowhere to look for an account of the circumstances and 
motives of the earliest writers: but they furnish these items of 
information themselves, and their integrity and evident 
truthfulness in other matters is a sufficient guarantee of 
truthfulness in these. 

Our first definite information with reference to the Sacred 
Writings is afforded by the direction given to Moses to write the 
law and history in a book, and put it in the side of the ark for 
preservation. (See Exod. 17:14; 34:27; Deut. 31:9-26.) This 
book was left for the guidance of the people. Additions were 
made to it from time to time by subsequent writers, and in the 
days of the kings, scribes appear to have been appointed whose 
business it was to keep a careful record of the important events 
occurring in Jewish history, which records-Samuel, Kings, 
Chronicles -were preserved and subsequently incorporated with 
the Law. The prophets also did not confine themselves to oral 
teaching, but wrote and in some cases had scribes to record their 
teachings. (See, Josh. 1:8; 24:26; 1 Sam. 10:25; 1 Chron. 27:32; 
29:29,30; 2 Chron. 33:18,19; Isa. 30:8; Jer. 30:2; 36:2; 45:1; 
5 1 :60.) As a result we have the Old Testament Scriptures, 
composed of history, prophecy and law, written by divine 
direction, as these citations and also Paul's testimony (2 Tim. 
3:15,16) prove. These writings collectively were termed "The 
Law and The Prophets," and the Hebrews were taught of God to 
esteem them of divine authority and authorship, the writers 
being merely the agents through whom they received them. 
They were so taught to esteem them, by the miraculous dealings 
of God with them as a people, in confirmation of his words to 
them through the prophets, thus endorsing them as his agents 
(See, Exod. 14:30,31; 19:9; 1 Kings 18:21,27,30,36,39); and 
further by the establishment and enforcement of the law as 
proclaimed and recorded by Moses. 

The political interests and the religious veneration of the 
Israelites, under God's immediate overruling and protection, 
combined to preserve and protect these writings from 
contamination. Religiously, they were rightfully regarded with 
the deepest veneration, while politically they were the only 
guarantee which the people possessed against despotism. The 
Jewish copyists regarded these documents with great veneration. 
A very slight error in copying often led them to destroy it and 
begin anew. Josephus says that through all the ages that had 
passed none had ventured to add to, take away from, or 
transpose, aught of the Sacred Writings. 



In the degeneracy of the Jewish nation, under the idolatrous 
administration of the successors of Rehoboam, these Sacred 
Writings fell into disuse and were almost forgotten, though they 
seem never to have been taken from their place. In the 
reformation conducted by Josiah, they were again brought to 
light. Again, in the Babylonish captivity this book was lost sight 
of by the Israelites, though it appears that they were accustomed 
to meet together in little companies in Babylon to be instructed 
by the scribes, who either taught the Law from memory or from 
copies in their possession. On the restoration of the Jews to 
Jerusalem, the Scriptures were again brought out, and Ezra and 
his companions read the law to the people, commenting upon 
and explaining it. (Neh 8:1-8.) This public reading of the 
Scriptures was the only means of keeping them before the 
people, as printing was yet unknown and the cost of a 
manuscript copy was beyond the reach of the people, very few 
of whom could read. At the time of our Lord's first advent, these 
O.T. Scriptures existed substantially as we have them to-day, as 
to matter and arrangement. 

One of the strongest evidences of the authenticity of the O.T. 
Scriptures is found in the fact that the law and the prophets were 
continually referred to by our Lord and the apostles as authority, 
and that while the Lord denounced the corruptions of the Jewish 
Church, and their traditions, by which they made void the Word 
of God, he did not even intimate any corruption in these Sacred 
Writings, but commends them, and refers to and quotes them in 
proof of his claims. 

In fact, the various parts of the entire book are bound together 
by the mutual endorsement of the various writers, so that to 
reject one is to mar the completeness of the whole. Each book 
bears its own witness and stands on its own evidence of 
credibility, and yet each book is linked with all the rest, both by 
their common spirit and harmony and by their mutual 
endorsement. Mark, for instance, the endorsement of the account 
of creation in the commandment of the law concerning the 
Sabbath day.-Exod. 20:11. Also compare Deut. 23:4,5; Joshua 
24:9; Micah. 6:5; 2 Pet. 2:15; Jude 11-13; Isa. 28:21; Hab. 3:11; 
Matt. 12:40. 

THE NEW TESTAMENT. 

The earliest copy of the New Testament known is written in the 
Syriac language. Its date is estimated to be about the year A.D. 
100. And even at that early date it contained the same books as 
at present with the exception of the Second Epistle of Peter, the 
Third Epistle of John, Jude and the Book of Revelation. And 
these omitted books we know were written about the close of the 
first century, and probably had not been widely circulated 
among the Christian congregations at that time. All the books of 
the Old and New Testaments as we now have them appear, 



however, in the Greek, in the Sinaitic Manuscript, the oldest 
known Greek MS., whose date is about A.D. 350. 

The first five books of the N.T. are historical, and present a clear 
and connected account of the life, character, circumstances, 
teachings and doings of Jesus of Nazareth, who claimed to be 
the Messiah promised in the O.T. Scriptures, and who fully 
substantiated his claim. The four accounts of the Evangelists, 
though they differ in phraseology, are in harmony in their 
statements, some important items being recorded by each which 
seem to have been overlooked by the others. These Evangelists 
testified to that of which they had positive knowledge. The 
Apostle John says: That which we have seen and heard declare 
we unto you- "that which was from the beginning (the 
beginning of the Lord's ministry), which we have heard, which 
we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and 
our hands have handled of the Word of life; for the life was 
manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness." (1 John 1:1- 
3.) They testify also that they saw Christ after his resurrection. 
The fifth book presents a valuable account of the doings of the 
Apostles after their anointing with the Holy Spirit, of the 
establishment of the Christian Church, and of the first preaching 
of the good news to the Gentiles. 

R1146:page3 

The Apostolic Epistles were written to the various local 
congregations or churches, and were directed to be publicly 
read, and to be exchanged among the churches; and the same 
authority was claimed for them by their writers as that which 
was accorded to the O.T. Scriptures. (1 Thes. 5:27; Col. 4:16; 2 
Pet. 3:2,15,16; Heb. 1:1,2 and 2:1-4.) These letters and the five 
historical books were carefully preserved by the different 
congregations, and were appealed to as authority in matters of 
doctrine. 

The letters of the apostles, claiming, as they did, divine authority 
equal to that of the O.T. Scriptures, were treasured and guarded 
with special care by the various congregations of the early 
church. The New Testament was completed by the Book of The 
Revelation, about the close of the first century A.D., after which, 
these epistles, etc., began to be collected for more permanent 
preservation. 

The original copies of both the Old and New Testaments have, 
of course, long since disappeared, and the oldest manuscript (the 
Sinaitic) is reckoned to have been written about three centuries 
after the death of Christ. Those of earlier date were either 
destroyed in the persecutions under which the church suffered, 
or were worn out by use. These oldest manuscripts are preserved 
with great care in the Museums and Libraries of Europe. During 
the Middle Ages, when ignorance and corruption prevailed and 
the Bible was hidden in monasteries away from the people, God 



was still carrying on his work, preserving the Scriptures from 
destruction even in the midst of Satan's stronghold, the apostate 

R1146 : page 4 

Church of Rome. A favorite occupation of the monks during the 
Middle Ages was the copying of the manuscripts of the N.T., 
which were esteemed as relics more than as God's living 
authoritative Word;— just as you will find in the parlor of very 
many worldly people handsome Bibles, which are seldom 
opened. Of these manuscripts there are said to be now more than 
two thousand, of various dates from the fourth to the fifteenth 
centuries. The quiet seclusion of those monks gave them special 
opportunities for careful copying, and years were sometimes 
spent in the copying of a single manuscript. 

RELIABILITY OF PRESENT TRANSLATIONS. 

The idea exists in some minds that during the lapse of centuries 
the Scriptures have become largely corrupted, and therefore a 
very uncertain foundation for faith. They reason that this is 
surely to be expected of a book which has survived so many 
centuries, and which has been claimed as divine authority by so 
many different factions, and which can be read by the majority 
only from translations, made by somewhat biased translators. 
And the late revisions of the book are supposed to be an 
acknowledgment of the supposed fact. 

Those, however, who are acquainted with the manner in which 
the ancient manuscripts of the Scriptures have been preserved 
for centuries, carefully copied, diligently compared and 
translated by pious and learned linguists, whose work was 
thereafter subjected to the most learned and scrutinizing 
criticism of an age in which scholars are by no means few, are 
prepared to see that such an idea is by no means a correct or 
reasonable one, though to the uninformed it may appear so. 

It is a fact that the Scriptures, as we find them to-day, bear 
internal evidence of their original purity; and ample means, both 
internal and external, are now furnished so that the careful 
student may detect any error which might have crept in either by 
fraud or accident. While there are some errors in translation and 
a few interpolations in our common English translation, on the 
whole it is acknowledged by scholars to be a remarkably good 
transcript of the Sacred Word. 

Before the invention of printing, the copying of the Scriptures, 
being very slow and tedious, involved considerable liability to 
error in transcribing, such as the accidental omission of a word 
or paragraph, the substitution of one word for another, or the 
misunderstanding of a word where the copyist wrote from the 
dictation of another person. And again, sometimes a marginal 
note might be mistaken for a part of the text and copied in as 
such. But while a very few errors have crept in, in such ways, 



and a few others seem to have been designedly inserted, various 
circumstances have been at work, both to preserve the integrity 
of the Sacred Writings, and also to make manifest any errors 
which have crept into them. 

Very early in the Christian Era translations of the New 
Testament Scriptures were made into several languages, and the 
different factions that early developed and continued to exist, 
though they might have been desirous of adding to or taking 
from the original text in order to give their claims a show of 
Scriptural support, were watched by each other to see that they 
did not do so, and had they succeeded in corrupting the text in 
one language, another translation would make it manifest. 

Even the Douay translation, in use in the Romish church, is in 
most respects substantially the same as the King James 
translation. The fact that during the "dark ages" the Scriptures 
were practically cast aside, being supplanted by the decrees of 
popes and councils, so that its teachings had no influence upon 
the masses of the people who did not have copies in their 
possession— nor could they have read them if they had them— 
doubtless made unnecessary the serious alteration of the text, at 
a time when bold, bad men had abundant power to do so. For 
men who would plot treason, incite to wars and commit murders 
for the advancement of the papal hierarchy, as we know was 
done, would have been bold enough for anything. Thus the 
depth of ignorance in the dark ages served to protect and keep 
pure God's Word, so that its clear light has shone specially at the 
two ends of the Gospel age. (1 Cor. 10:11.) The few 
interpolations which were dared, in support of the false claims 
of Papacy, were made just as the gloom of the "dark ages" was 
closing in upon mankind, and are now made glaringly manifest, 
from their lack of harmony with the context, their antagonism 
with other scriptures and from their absence in the oldest and 
most complete and reliable manuscripts. 

RELATIVE VALUES OF ANCIENT MANUSCRIPTS. 

As to the relative values of ancient manuscripts, we quote the 
following comments from the pen of that eminent German 
scholar, Constantine Tischendorf, who spent many years of his 
life in diligently searching out and comparing the various 
ancient manuscripts and translations of the Scriptures in many 
languages, and who has furnished to the church the results of his 
investigation in a careful exhibit of the various departures of the 
English Authorized Version of the New Testament from the 
three oldest and most important manuscripts. 

Mr. Tischendorf says: "As early as the reign of Elizabeth the 
English nation possessed an authorized translation, executed by 
the Bishops under the guidance of Archbishop Parker; and this, 
half a century later, in the year 1611, was revised at the 
command of James the First by a body of learned divines, and 



became the present 'Authorized Version.' Founded as it was on 
the Greek text at that time accepted by Protestant theologians, 
and translated with scholarship and conscientious care, this 
version of the New Testament has deservedly become an object 
of great reverence, and a truly national treasure to the English 
Church. The German Church alone possesses in Luther's New 
Testament a treasure of similar value.... 

"The Authorized Version, like Luther's, was made from a Greek 
text which Erasmus in 1516, and Robert Stephens in 1550, had 
formed from manuscripts of later date than the tenth century. 
Whether those manuscripts were thoroughly trustworthy -in 
other words, whether they exhibited the Apostolic original as 
perfectly as possible— has long been matter of diligent and 
learned investigation. Since the sixteenth century Greek 
manuscripts have been discovered of far greater antiquity than 
those of Erasmus and Stephens; as well as others in Latin, 
Syriac, Coptic, and Gothic, into which languages the sacred text 
was translated between the second and fourth centuries; while in 
the works of the Fathers, from the second century downwards, 
many quotations from the New Testament have been found and 
compared.... One thing is agreed upon by the majority of those 
who understand the subject, namely, that the oldest copies 
approach the original text more nearly than the later ones. 

"Providence has ordained for the New Testament more sources 
of the greatest antiquity than are possessed by all the old Greek 
literature put together. And of these, two manuscripts have for 
long been especially esteemed by Christian scholars, since, in 
addition to their great antiquity, they contain very nearly the 
whole of both the Old and New Testaments. Of these two, one is 
deposited in the Vatican, and the other in the British Museum. 
Within the last ten years a third has been added to the number, 
which was found at Mount Sinai, and is now at St. Petersburg. 
These three manuscripts undoubtedly stand at the head of all the 
ancient copies of the New Testament, and it is by their standard 
that both the early editions of the Greek text and the modern 
versions are to be compared and corrected. 

"The effect of comparing the common English text with the 
most ancient authorities will be as often to disclose agreement as 
disagreement. True, the three great manuscripts alluded to differ 
from each other both in age and authority, and no one of them 
can be said to stand so high that its sole verdict is sufficient to 
silence all contradiction. But to treat such ancient authorities 
with neglect would be either unwarrantable arrogance or 
culpable negligence; and it would be indeed a misunderstanding 
of the dealings of Providence, if after these documents had 

R1147 : page 4 

been preserved through all the dangers of fourteen or fifteen 
centuries, and delivered safe into our hands, we were not to 



receive them with thankfulness as the most valuable instruments 
for the elucidation of truth. 

"It may be urged that our undertaking is opposed to true 
reverence; and that by thus exposing the inaccuracies of the 
English Version, we shall bring discredit upon a work which has 
been for centuries the object of love and veneration both in 
public and private. But those who would stigmatize the process 
of scientific criticism and test, which we propose, as irreverent, 
are greatly mistaken. To us the most reverential course appears 
to be, to accept nothing as the Word of God which is not proved 
to be so by the evidence of the oldest, and therefore most 
certain, witnesses that he has put into our hands. With this in 
view, and with this intention, the writer has occupied himself for 
thirty years past, in searching not only the Libraries of Europe, 
but the obscurest convents of the East, both in Africa and Asia, 
for the most ancient manuscript, of the Bible; and has done all in 
his power to collect the most important of such documents, to 
arrange them and to publish them for the benefit both of the 
present age and of posterity, so as to settle the original text of 
the sacred writers on the basis of the most careful investigation. 

"The first of these great manuscripts already referred to which 
came into possession of Europe was the Vatican Codex. Whence 
it was acquired by the Vatican Library is not known; but it 
appears in the first catalogue of that collection which dates from 
the year 1475. The manuscript embraces both the Old and New 
Testaments. Of the later it contains the four Gospels, the Acts, 
the seven Catholic Epistles, nine of the Pauline Epistles, and the 
Epistle to the Hebrews as far as 9:14, from which verse to the 
end of the New Testament it is deficient; so that not only the last 
chapters of Hebrews, but the Epistle to Timothy, Titus and 
Philemon, as well as the Revelation, are missing. The 
peculiarities of the writing, the arrangement of the manuscript, 
and the character of the text— especially certain very remarkable 
readings-all combine to place the execution of the Codex in the 
fourth century, possibly about the middle of it. 

"The Alexandrine Codex was presented to King Charles the 
First in 1 628 by Cyril Lucar, Patriarch of Constantinople, who 
had himself brought it from Alexandria, of which place he was 
formerly Patriarch, and whence it derives its name. It contains 
both the Old and New Testaments. Of the New the following 
passages are wanting: -Matt. 1:1 to 25:6; John 6:50 to 8:52; 2 
Cor. 4:13 to 12:6. ...It would appear to have been written about 
the middle of the fifth century. 

"The Sinaitic Codex I was myself so happy as to discover in 
1844 and 1859, at the convent of St. Catherine, on Mount Sinai, 
in the later of which years I brought it to Russia to the Emperor 
Alexander the Second, at whose instance my second journey to 
the East was undertaken. It contains both Old and New 
Testaments —the latter perfect without the loss of a single 



leaf.... All the considerations which tend to fix the date of 
manuscripts lead to the conclusion that the Sinaitic Codex 
belongs to the middle of the fourth century. Indeed, the evidence 
is clearer in this case than in that of the Vatican Codex; and it is 
not improbable (which cannot be the case with the Vatican MS.) 
that it is one of the fifty copies which the Emperor Constantine 
in the year 33 1 directed to be made for Byzantium, under the 
care of Eusebius of Caesarea. In this case it is a natural inference 
that it was sent from Byzantium to the monks of St. Catherine 
by the Emperor Justinian, the founder of the convent. The entire 
Codex was published by its discoverer, under the orders of the 
Emperor of Russia, in 1862, with the most scrupulous exactness, 
and in a truly magnificent shape, and the New Testament portion 
was issued in a portable form in 1863 and 1865. 

"These considerations seem to show that the first place among 
the three great manuscripts, both for age and extent, is held by 
the Sinaitic Codex, the second by the Vatican, and the third by 
the Alexandrine. And this order is completely confirmed by the 
text they exhibit, which is not merely that which was accepted in 
the East at the time they were copied; but, having been written 
by Alexandrine copyists who knew but little of Greek, and 
therefore had no temptation to make alterations, they remain in a 
high degree faithful to the text which was accepted through a 
large portion of Christendom in the third and second centuries. 
The proof of this is their agreement with the most ancient 
translations— namely, the so-called Italic, made in the second 
century in proconsular Africa; the Syriac Gospels of the same 
date, now transferred from the convents of the Nitrian desert to 
the British Museum; and the Coptic version of the third century. 
It is confirmed also by their agreement with the oldest of the 
Fathers, such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, Clement and Origen. 

"These remarks apply to the Sinaitic Codex- which is 
remarkably close in its agreement to the 'Italic' version— more 
than they do to the Vatican MS., and still more so than the 
Alexandrine, which, however, is of far more value in the Acts, 
Epistles and Apocalypse than it is in the Gospels.... 

"No single work of ancient Greek classical literature can 
command three such original witnesses as the Sinaitic, Vatican 
and Alexandrine Manuscripts, to 

R1147:page5 

the integrity and accuracy of its text. That they are available in 
the case of a book which is at once the most sacred and the most 
important in the world is surely matter for the deepest 
thankfulness to God. " 

OTHER MEANS OF VERIFICATION. 

Another remarkable means for preserving and verifying the 
New Testament writings is their copious quotation in other 



writings. Origen, who wrote in the early part of the third 
century, quotes 5745 passages from all the books in the New 
Testament; Tertullian (A.D. 200) makes more than 3000 
quotations from the N.T. books; Clement (A.D. 194) quotes 380 
passages; Irenaeus (A.D. 178) quotes 767 passages; Polycarp, 
who was martyred A.D. 165, after serving Christ 86 years, 
quoted 36 passages in a single epistle; Justin Martyr (A.D. 140) 
also quotes from the N.T. These were all Christian writers; and 
in addition to these, the Scriptures were largely quoted by 
heathen and infidel writers, among them Celsus (A.D. 150) and 
Porphyry (A.D. 304). Indeed the entire New Testament, with the 
exception of about a dozen verses, has been found scattered as 
quotations through various writings that are still extant. And if 
every copy of the N.T. had been destroyed by its enemies, the 
book could have been reproduced from these quotations 
contained in the writings of the early Christians and their 
enemies. 

While the means for the preservation of the Scriptures have been 
thus remarkably complete, and in view of the unparalleled 
opposition with which they have met give evidence of Divine 
care in their preservation, the means for their verification, and 
for arriving at an understanding of them in God's due time, are 
found to be none the less remarkable. No other book in the 
world has ever had such attention as this book. The labor that 
has been spent in the preparation of complete concordances, 
indexes, various translations, etc., has been enormous; and the 
results to students of the Bible are of incalculable value. And 
while we recognize the providence of God in all this, we should 
and do appreciate these labors of his children and their great 
service to us, though we utterly repudiate, as useless, the labor 
that has been spent on many so-called theological writings, 
which are nothing more than miserable efforts to support the 
vain traditions of men, the accumulated monstrous volumes of 
which would indeed form a monument of human folly. 

Just in "The Time of the End," when the prophet (Dan. 12:9,10) 
declares that "the wise (the meek and faithful children of God) 
shall understand," we find these wonderful aids coming forward 
to our assistance. And parallel with these has happened the 
general spread of intelligence and education and the placing of 
the Bible in the hands of the people, thus enabling them to use 
the helps provided. 

In view of these things, our only reasonable conclusion must be, 
that this wonderful book has been completely under Divine 
supervision in its preparation, and in its gradual and seasonable 
unfolding to the understanding; and yet it has all been 
accomplished through human agency. Those who are too 
careless, or too indifferent, or who permit themselves to be too 
much engrossed with the cares of this life to give it a studious 
examination, should not be expected to comprehend its weight 



of authority, and its full evidence of credibility. We are aware of 
the fact that in these days when the art of printing has flooded 
the world with literature of every description, good, bad, and 
indifferent, one might reasonably reply, We cannot examine 
everything. Very true, but this book has a claim superior to that 
of any other book in the world, and no man is as justifiable in 
laying it upon the shelf, as he would be in doing with the Koran 
or the Vedas. 

The very existence of such a book, animated with such a spirit 
of justice, wisdom, love and power, and disclosing such good 
tidings of great joy to all people, having such a history and 
authorship, and containing such varied information-historic, 
scientific, and moral; and so remarkably preserved for so many 
centuries, though so violently opposed, is sufficient to awaken at 
least a suspicion of its value, and to claim the attention and 
investigation of every reasoning mind. The claims of this book 
upon our attention are by far superior to those of any other, and 
these reasonable claims appear on its very surface, while every 
systematic and properly directed effort at investigation rewards 
the diligent student with copious and 

R1148:page5 

abundant proof, both of its truthfulness and of its value. 

THE INSPIRATION OF THE BIBLE. 

The Bible claims to be a book written under divine inspiration. 
The word inspire signifies to breathe in, to infuse, to fill, to 
inhale-as to inspire the lungs with air. (See Webster's 
Dictionary.) Hence, when it is said that certain scriptures, or 
writings of godly men, were given by inspiration of God (2 Tim. 
3:16), it signifies that those men were in some way, whether 
through miraculous or natural means, inspired by, or brought 
under the influence of God; so as to be used by him in speaking 
or writing such words as he wished to have expressed. The 
prophets and apostles all claimed such inspiration. Peter says, 
"The prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy 
men of God spake as they were moved by the holy Spirit. "-2 
Pet. 1:21. 

Through Moses we have the law of God and the only existing 
credible history of mankind from the creation of Adam down to 
his own time, covering a period of about 2500 years. While 
Moses and the other Bible writers were holy men, inspired with 
pure motives and holy zeal, and while personal pride, ambition, 
etc., were no part of their spirit, we learn that Moses was 
inspired with the knowledge of God's law, both in its great 
principles and also in the minutiae of its typical ceremonials, by 
direct revelation from God at Mount Sinai, and of some points 
of duty at the burning bush at Horeb, etc. 



As for his historical writings, Moses was evidently guided of 
God in the collation and presentation in its present complete and 
connected form of the history of the world down to his day, 
which was really in great part the history of his own family back 
to Adam with an account of the creation doubtless given by God 
to Adam while he was yet in fellowship in Eden. Nor does a 
correct handing down of family information, covering a period 
of over 2300 years, seem impossible, or liable, as it would now 
be, to have become polluted; for, aside from the fact that it was 
handed down through the God-fearing family line of Seth, it 
should be remembered that at that time the bodies, brains and 
memories of men were not so weak as they are now, and as they 
have been since the flood; and finally, because the long lives of 
two men link Adam with the family of Abraham, the family of 
covenant favor,— with Isaac, the typical seed of promise. These 
two men were Methuselah and Shem. Methuselah was over 200 
years old when Adam died, and had abundant opportunity, 
therefore, for information at first hands; and Shem, the son of 
Noah, lived contemporaneously with Methuselah for 98 years, 
and with Isaac for 50 years. Thus, these two living, God-fearing 
men acted as God's historians to communicate his revelations 
and dealings to the family in whom centered the promises, of 
which Moses was one of the prospective heirs. 

In addition to these facts, we have the statement of Josephus that 
Methuselah, Noah and Shem, the year before the flood, 
inscribed the history and discoveries of the world on two 
monuments of stone and brick which were still standing in 
Moses' time. 

As for the writings of the prophets, their devoted, godly lives 
attest their sincerity; their lives were spent for God and in the 
defense of righteousness, and not for gain and worldly honor. 
And as for proofs that God acted through them and that they 
merely expressed his messages, as Peter declares, it is to be 
found in the fulfillment of their predictions. These we need not 
enumerate here and now, as they are elaborated in 
MILLENNIAL DAWN, Volumes I. and H; and will be further 
discussed in Vol. III., now in course of preparation. 

This brings us to the examination of the inspiration of the New 
Testament. Of the four gospel narratives and the book of the 
Acts of the Apostles, which are merely historic narratives, it 
might with considerable force be argued that no inspiration was 
necessary. But we must remember that since it was God's will 
that the important doings and teachings of our Lord and his 
disciples should be handed down, for the information and 
guidance of his Church throughout the age, it was necessary that 
God, even while leaving the writers free to record those truths in 
their own several styles of expression and arrangement, should 
nevertheless exercise a supervision of his work. To this end it 
would appear reasonable that he would cause circumstances, 



etc., to call to the memory of one or another of them items and 
details which, otherwise, in so condensed an account of matters 
so important, would have been overlooked. And this was no less 
the work of God's spirit, power, or influence than the more 
noticeable and peculiar manifestations through the prophets. 

The Apostle Peter tells us that the prophets of old time often did 
not understand their own utterances, as they themselves also 
acknowledge (1 Pet. 1:12; Dan. 12:4,8-10); and we should 
remember that the twelve apostles (Paul taking the place of 
Judas-Gal. 1:17; 1 Tim. 2:7) not only filled the office of 
apostles —or specially appointed teachers and expounders of the 
Gospel of the New Covenant-but they also, especially Peter and 
Paul and John, filled the office of prophets, and were not only 
given the spirit of wisdom and understanding by which they 
were enabled to understand and explain the previously dark 
prophecies, but in addition to this we believe that they were 
under the guidance and supervision of the Lord to such an extent 
that their references to things future from their day, things 
therefore not then due to be fully understood, were guided, so as 
to be true to an extent far beyond their comprehension, and such 
consequently were as really prophetic as the utterances of the 
old-time prophets. Illustrations of this are to be found in the 
Revelations of the Apostle John, in Peter's symbolic description 
of the Day of the Lord (2 Pet. 3:10-13), and in numerous 
references to the same period by Paul also, among which were 
some things hard to be understood even by Peter (2 Pet. 3:16) 
and only partially then by Paul himself. The latter, however, was 
permitted to see future things more clearly than others of his 
time, and to that end he was given special visions and 
revelations which he was not allowed to make known to others 
(2 Cor. 12:1-4), but which, nevertheless, influenced and colored 
his subsequent teachings and his epistles. And these very items 
which Peter thought strange of, and called "hard to be 
understood," are the very items which now, in God's due time, 
for which they were intended, so grandly illuminate not only 
Peter's prophecies and John's Revelation, but the entire word and 
plan of God, -that the man of God may be thoroughly 
furnished.-2 Tim. 3:16,17. 

That the early church considered the writings and teachings of 
the apostles different from all others, in authority, is manifest 
from the early arrangement of these writings together and the 
keeping separate from these, as apocryphal, other good writings 
of other good men. And yet there were, even in the days of the 
apostles, ambitious men who taught another gospel and claimed 
for themselves the honors of special revelations and authority as 
apostles and teachers of no less authority than the twelve 
apostles. 

And ambitious men of the same sort have from time to time 
since arisen— Emanuel Swedenborg and many less able and less 



notable— whose claims, if conceded, would not only place them 
in rank far above Paul, the prince of the apostles, but whose 
teachings would tend to discredit entirely, as "old wives' fables," 
the whole story of redemption and remission of sins through the 
blood of the cross. These would-be apostles, boastful, heady, 
high-minded, have "another gospel," a perversion of the gospel 
of Christ; and above all they despise and seek to cast discredit 
upon the words of Paul who so clearly, forcibly and logically 
lifts up the standard of faith and points to the cross— the ransom- 
-as the sure foundation, and who so clearly showed that pseudo- 
apostles, false apostles, would arise and deceive many. 

It not only required an inspiration to write God's plan, but it also 
requires an inspiration of the Almighty to give an understanding 
of that revelation; yet this inspiration is of a different sort. When 
any one has realized himself a sinner, weak, imperfect and 
condemned, and has accepted of Christ as his Redeemer, and 
full of love and appreciation has consecrated his heart (his mind, 
his will) to the Lord, to henceforth please not himself but his 
Redeemer,— God has arranged that such a consecration of the 
natural mind brings a new mind. It opens the way for the holy 
mind or will of God, expressed through his written word, to be 
received; and as it is received into such a good, honest, 
consecrated heart, it in-forms that heart and opens the eyes of 
the understanding, so that from the new standpoint (God's 
standpoint) many things wear a very different aspect, and among 
other things the Scripture teachings, which gradually open up as 
item after item of the divine plan is fulfilled, and new features of 
the unfolding plan become due to be understood, and from the 
new standpoint appreciated and accepted. 

Just as with astronomers, the close observation of facts and 
influences already recognized often leads them to look in certain 
directions for hitherto undiscovered planets, and they find them, 
so with the seekers after spiritual truths; the clear appreciation 
and close study of the known plan lead gradually, step by step, 
to the discovery of other particulars, hitherto unnoticed, 

R1148:page6 

each of which only adds to the beauty and harmony of the truths 
previously seen. Thus it is that "The path of the just is a shining 
light which shineth more and more unto the perfect day. " 

Of course the writings of all such as have their wills fully 
subjected to the mind of God, as revealed in his Word, must be 
also somewhat inspired by God's spirit, received from his Word 
by their complete 

R1149:page6 

subjection to its leading. The spirit of the truth inspires and 
controls to a greater or lesser extent not only their pens but their 
words and thoughts, and even their very looks. Yet such an 



inspiration, common to all the saints, in proportion to their 
development, should be critically distinguished from the special 
and peculiarly guided and guarded inspiration of the twelve 
apostles, whom God specially appointed to be the teachers of the 
church, and who have no successors in this office. Only twelve 
were "chosen," and when one of these, Judas, fell from his 
honorable office, the Lord in due time appointed Paul to the 
place; and he not only has never recognized others, but clearly 
indicates that he never will recognize others in that office. -Rev. 
21:14. 

With the death of the Apostles the canon of Scripture closed, 
because God had there given a full and complete revelation of 
his plan for man's salvation; though some of it was in a 
condensed form which has since expanded and is expanding and 
unfolding and will continue to expand and shine more and more 
until the perfect day— the Millennial Day-has been fully ushered 
in. Paul expresses this thought clearly when he declares that the 
Holy Scriptures are able to make wise unto salvation, and that 
they are sufficient. 

As we consider, then, the completeness, harmony, purity and 
grandeur of the Bible, its age and wonderful preservation 
through the wreck and storms of six thousand years, it must be 
admitted to be a most wonderful book; and those who have 
learned to read it understanding^, who see in it the great plan of 
the ages, cannot doubt that God was its inspiring Author, as well 
as its Preserver. Its only parallel is the book of nature by the 
same great Author.

THE TWO SALVATIONS. 

"That now unto the principalities and powers in the heavenlies 
might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God."~ 
Eph. 3:10. 

"Blind leaders of the blind" in Babylon insist that the "manifold 
wisdom of God" is now apparent, and can be fully appreciated 
by all men, whereas the Lord Jesus, at his first advent, positively 
stated that only his disciples were able to even partially 
understand the truths he set forth. (Matt. 13:11; Mark 4:11; Luke 
8:10.) Before his crucifixion Jesus told his disciples further, that 
the same conditions would continue until the end of the Gospel 
age. (Matt. 24:3,31.) Paul explains that during the Gospel period 
the "manifold wisdom of God" is made known to the 
"principalities and powers in heavenly (not earthly) places, -to 
the church. (Eph. 3:10.) During the present reign of evil the glad 
tidings operate in the world to take out a people for the Lord's 
name. (Acts 15:14.) When these "people for a purpose" shall all 



have been taken out, and "The Christ," head and body, have 
been united (Gal. 3:16 and 29, and Eph. 4:15-16), God will 
inaugurate the work of restoring mankind to soundness of being, 
which is the salvation promised to the people of the world. - 
Acts 3:19-22. 

The instruments to be used in this grand work will be the "new 
creatures" whom God has chosen in Christ, with the Lord Jesus 
as their head, or chief. (Col. 1:18.) Through faith in him these 
"new creatures" have been "born from above, of water and 
spirit" (John 3:3-6, and 1 Peter 1:24), and thus during this life, 
by enduring trial and temptation, have been "translated into the 
kingdom of his dear Son" (Col. 1:13), and thereby they possess 
the promise of the "divine nature" (2 Pet. 1:4), which, until the 
resurrection, they have only in "earthen vessels." (2 Cor. 4:7.) 
When resurrected they will obtain this "divine nature" fully, and 
thus while having borne the "image of the earthy," they will then 
bear the "image of the heavenly." (1 Cor. 15:45,47,48 and 1 
John 3:2.) As above said, their work will be to restore those who 
remain, "of the earth, earthy," to earthy perfection (1 Cor. 
15:45,47,48) as each seed has its own kind of body.- 1 Cor. 
15:38; Acts 3:21; Gen. 1:27-28. 

Thus, when all shall have been raised up to perfection (the "new 
creatures" to the glory of the "divine nature," and the "earthy" to 
the glory of complete human nature), all that was lost in Adam 
will have been restored in Christ. (1 Cor. 15:22.) How luminous 
these truths make Paul's statement that "we trust in the living 
God who is the Savior of all men, specially [chiefly] of them 
that believe. " -1 Tim. 4:10. 

As the "new creatures" prove their love for their Lord by 
suffering with him now, so the "earthy" in their "due time" must 
show their love for and obedience to the same Lord when he is 
reigning with his saints. (Psa. 2:9; 49:14; Dan. 7:22; Rev. 2:27; 
12:5; 19:15.) Should any creature sin willfully after having 
received full light, and been given ability to live up to it, he will 
be "destroyed from among the people. "-Acts 3:23; Heb. 10:26; 
Jer. 31:29-31. 

Peter argues (1 Pet. 1:3-13): Blessed is the God and Father of 
our Lord Jesus Christ, who in his great mercy has begotten us to 
a hope of life by the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, into an 
inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the 
heavens for us, who are guided by the power of God, through 
faith, for a salvation prepared to be disclosed in the last season 
(Greek, kairos— fixed time). In which we rejoice, though now 
for a little while (it being necessary) we are distressed by 
manifold trials, in order that the proof of our faith, which is 
more precious than gold that perishes, even though tested by 
fire, may be found unto praise, and honor, and glory, at the 
revelation of Jesus Christ; whom, not having seen, we love: on 
whom, not now looking, but [on whom] believing, we rejoice 



with joy unspeakable and full of glory, receiving [Gr. komizo— to 
bring- hence to receive with the added sense of bringing along 
with] the end of our faith -salvation [soundness] of souls 
[beings]. Concerning which salvation prophets, who prophesied 
concerning this favor toward us, sought out and investigated, 
searching as to what things, or what seasons, the spirit that was 
in them was pointing out, when it testified beforehand the 
sufferings of Christ, and the glories to follow: to whom it was 
revealed, that not for themselves but for us they ministered those 
things, which are now declared through those who deliver the 
joyful message with the Holy Spirit sent from heaven: into 
which things angels earnestly desire to look. Wherefore, girding 
up the loins of our mind and being vigilant, let us hope perfectly 
for the gift to be brought to us at the revelation of Jesus Christ. 

How plainly this teaching of the Spirit sets forth the future for 
the "little flock," who are a "Chosen Race, a Royal Priesthood, a 
Holy Nation, a People for a Purpose." — 1 Pet. 2:9, Diaglott.

AN EMINENT BAPTIST'S AVOWAL. 

John Foster, the eminent Baptist minister of long ago, wrote to 
a young minister (See, his Life and Correspondence,- London 
edition) thus:— 

"Endless punishment! I acknowledge my inability (I would say 
it reverently) to admit this belief, together with a belief in the 
divine goodness-the belief that "God is love; " that "his tender 
mercies are over all his works." Goodness, benevolence, charity 
ascribed in supreme perfection to him, cannot mean a quality 
foreign to all human conception of goodness; it must be 
something analogous in principle to what he himself has defined 
and required as goodness in his moral creatures, that in adoring 
the divine goodness we may not be worshiping an "unknown 
God. " But if so, how would all our ideas be confounded, while 
contemplating him bringing, of his own sovereign will, a race of 
creatures into existence in such a condition that they certainly 
will and must,— by their nature and circumstances, go wrong and 
be miserable, unless prevented by especial grace,— which is the 
privilege of only a small proportion of them; and at the same 
time affixing on their delinquency a doom of which it is 
infinitely beyond the highest archangel's faculty to apprehend a 
thousandth part of the horror.... 

"A number (not large, but of great piety and intelligence) of 
ministers within my acquaintance, several now dead, have been 
disbelievers of the doctrine in question; at the same time not 
feeling themselves imperatively called upon to make a public 



disavowal; content with employing in their ministrations strong 
general terms in denouncing the doom of impenitent sinners. 

"For one thing, a consideration of the unendurable imputations 
and unmeasured suspicions apt to be cast on any publicly 
declared practical defection from rigid "orthodoxy" has made 
them think they would better consult their usefulness by not 
giving prominence to this dissentient point while yet they make 
no concealment of it in private communications and in answers 
to serious inquiries. When, besides, they have considered how 
strangely defective and feeble is the efficacy of the terrible 
doctrine itself, to alarm and deter careless, irreligious minds, 
they have 

R1150:page6 

thought themselves the less required to propound one that so 
greatly qualifies the blackness of the prospect. They could not 
be unaware of the grievous truth of what is so strongly insisted 
on as an argument by the defenders of the tenet- that 
thoughtless and wicked men would be sure to seize on the 
mitigated doctrine to encourage themselves in their impenitence. 
But this is only the same perverse and fatal use that they make 
of the doctrine of grace and mercy through Jesus Christ. If they 
will so abuse the truth we cannot help it. But methinks even this 
fact tells against the doctrine in question. If in the very nature of 
man as created, every individual, by the Sovereign Power, be in 
such desperate disorder that there is no possibility of conversion 
and salvation in the instances where that power interposes with a 
special and redeeming efficacy, how can we conceive that the 
main proportion of the race thus morally impotent (that is really 
and absolutely impotent) will be eternally punished for the 
inevitable result of this moral impotence?" 

Probably some excuse should be made for such uncandid 
conduct as this frank avowal indicates, because the morning had 
not yet begun to dawn; yet we cannot hold a Christian minister 
blameless in preaching and outwardly supporting a doctrine, 
which at heart, and in private, he denied as unreasonable, and a 
calumny against God's character. Years ago the light upon God's 
Word and the helps in its study were much less than now, when 
surely no one is very excusable for lacking a knowledge of the 
clear, reasonable and consistent teaching of the Bible on this 
subject-one in which every text, parable, symbol and dark 
saying finds a reasonable solution. 

Though John Foster lacked the "helps" and felt that some of the 
passages of the Bible (especially the modern translations, made 
by men who held this popular error) seemed, in symbolic 
language, to favor the popular theory of the eternal torment of 
all mankind except the saints, he should have been true to his 
own convictions; he should not have professed to believe, nor 



have attempted to teach, to any extent whatever, what he 
affirmed he did not and could not force himself to believe. 

He should have avowed candidly and publicly his disbelief and 
taken the consequences. And he should have begun a thorough 
and systematic study of the subject, from the Bible standpoint; 
seeking for the light necessary to harmonize the figurative and 
symbolic and parabolic passages with the plain and reasonable 
revelation of God's character. Had he thus hungered and thirsted 
after righteousness [after right-truth,] who will say that he 
would have been turned away empty and uncertain, when the 
Lord declares that such "shall be filled." Had he thus sought and 
knocked at the Lord's treasury of wisdom, who will affirm that it 
would have remained a "sealed" book (Isa. 29:1 1-14) to him, 
when the Lord declares that he that seeketh findeth, and to him 
that knocketh it shall be opened.— Matt. 7:7. 

Yes, "blessed are they" who are thus honest and earnest;-they 
shall be filled, and the treasure house shall be opened to them: 
but those not thus disposed, lose a great blessing from God 
while keeping the favor and honor of men and holding 
comfortable situations. 

John Foster says that he and others feared loss of influence, 
"usefulness," and the addition of "unendurable imputations." It 
is the old story: They had consecrated their lives (as every true 
Christian has done) to God's service, agreeing to be "living 
sacrifices;" yet, when the time came, when there was an 
opportunity to suffer for Christ's sake, they feared the suffering- 
the dying daily. These are evidently of the class mentioned by 
Paul, "who through fear of death [the sacrificial dying, as living 
sacrifices] are all their life-time subject to bondage." Such will 
be saved so as by fire; they will be part of the Second Company 
who will serve before the throne with palm branches (Rev. 
7:14,15); but they are not, so far as we may judge from their 
own profession, worthy of a place in that "little flock" of 
overcomers who shall reign with Christ. 

We may draw some of our most useful lessons from the failure 
and confessions of others, if careful to gauge our lessons by 
God's testimony, the Bible. This lesson to each one seeking to 
please God and to be blessed and honored of Him (now with a 
knowledge of His plan and by and by with a share in the 
Kingdom which will execute that plan) is, Be honest toward 
God, toward yourself and toward your fellow-creatures; profess 
and teach only what you fully believe; and hunger, thirst, 

R1150:page7 

seek, and knock for the truth at God's great store-house-the 
Bible. If God does not send the key to you direct, he will at least 
put you in contact with some of the servants who have the keys, 
and who, as his and your servants, are engaged in bringing forth 



things new and old— meat in due season for the household of 
faith. -Matt. 24:45; 13:52. 



R1150:page7 

NATURE'S TESTIMONY. 

I have just been feeding my stock— horses and colts, cows and 
calves, hogs and pigs. I feed them all with hay. They all ate it 
greedily, for it was good hay; and they all seemed to be doing 
well. While they were eating I was thinking. And as it is too wet 
to plow this morning, I will write my thoughts. These colts are 
growing. Growing means more bone, more muscle, more fat, 
more teeth enameled, more hoof, more hide, more hair, more 
mane, more tail, larger eyes, more tendons, lengthened arteries 
and veins, a proportional enlargement of the heart, the lungs, the 
digestive organs, the viscera, etc., etc. It takes a thousand things 
to make a colt, and there must be something added to each of 
these thousand things every day, as the colt increases in size, 
and becomes a horse. Now where does the colt get a little more 
all the time to add to these thousand things? All out of the hay. 
The dried grass that I feed him furnishes him bone and flesh and 
skin and hair; and it goes just where it is needed. It goes to the 
different parts of the animal in just the right proportions. It does 
not make too much of any one thing, or fail to make enough of 
any. 

Now take the dried grass to the most skillful chemist. Tell him 
to analyze it, and see if he can get flesh and bone and hair out of 
it as the colt does, and he will tell you that he cannot do any 
such thing. The wonder to me is that my colts, and every body 
else's colts the world over, can do what these men of science 
can't do. 

But there is something stranger yet: The calves eat the same hay, 
and they make out of it differently shaped bones and hoofs, 
different flesh and fat, from that which the colts make. They 
make horns, too, and the colts don't; and the cows, feeding 
beside the horses, make milk out of the hay, and milk is a very 
curious liquid. It contains caseine and albumen, and ever so 
many other ingredients, all of which come from the hay. Isn't 
there something strange about this? It seems to me that if I had 
in my barn at feeding-time one of the wise men who think they 
can explain everything; that we don't need any God; that their 
theory of evolution, and their laws of nature, are sufficient for 
making the world and for keeping it a-going,— it seems to me 
that I could puzzle him by just pointing to my horses and cattle. 

Now suppose I had three machines; that when I put hay into one 
of them and turned the crank awhile, out would come carpet of 
perfect texture and beautiful colors. Then, if I put the same kind 



of hay into another machine, and turned the crank awhile, out 
would come sets of porcelain, plates, cups, saucers, etc.,— all 
perfectly shaped, enameled, and painted. And, finally, if I 
should put hay into a third machine, the result would be books, 
well printed, elegantly bound, and profusely illustrated. What 
would the scientists who know all about making worlds say to 
my machines? Wouldn't they think there was something about 
them that was never dreamed of in their philosophy? 

But I have in my barn yard a score or more of machines fully as 
wonderful. They are working up the hay into hundreds of 
different things, and into just the right proportion of each, while 
I write. Did a law of nature make these machines? and do the 
laws of nature keep them a-going! Yea, verily, and herein is 
proof that a great First Cause, a wise and powerful Being, 
established these laws and superintends all their operations. 

It is said that Robespierre, when he saw the effects of atheism in 
France, exclaimed: "If there is no God, we must make one; for 
we cannot get along without him. " So must every man feel who 
has not permitted that "dangerous thing," a "little learning," to 
magnify his self-conceit and minify his common sense. 

The tendency of positivism, and of all the infidel philosophy of 
our day, is to sheer atheism. Men want to get rid of the idea of a 
personal God— a great, wise, and good Being who made, 
upholds, and governs all things. But grand, solemn and 
mysterious as that idea is, it is the simplest explanation of the 
wonders that we see around us. The grass is growing now all 
over our hills and plains. Why? The soil was full of seeds, we 
are told, and the rain has made them germinate. But water can't 
make grass out of seeds. Here is a chair factory all complete, 
and lumber piled up in it. And now fire is kindled 

R1151 : page 7 

under the boiler, and the wheels revolve; but no chairs are 
turned out. Why? The chair-maker has not come to put the 
lumber into the lathes. Nature during winter or a drouth is like 
that factory, full of lumber but without steam. Nature, when the 
sun shines and the rain falls, is like that factory when the steam 
is up, and the wheels are in motion. Nature is God's workshop. It 
is the grand factory in which he is making all the while the 
many, the numberless things that we speak of as growing. In 
everything that lives, and moves, and grows, and blooms, we see 
proof of the wisdom and the power of an omnipotent God.-

WE SHOULD SAVE OURSELVES. 

"Save yourselves from this untoward generation." -Acts 2:40. 

While Orthodoxy and Rome make strong and plain pleadings 
with mankind to save themselves from "Hell" and never-ending 
torture, the thinking Christian must have been struck with the 
fact that our Savior never made such plain entreaty. Jesus taught 
a punishment and trouble now, and in the future, for the wicked, 
but it was always by parable. The world misunderstood his 
teachings and continues to, but it was the blessed privilege of his 
disciples to understand. (Luke 8:10.) Those wholly consecrated 
now, and gladly following the "Lamb whithersoever he goeth," 
know that their Master will continue to give them "meat in due 
season," both in "things new and old," as they are "able to bear 
it "-John 14:26; Matt. 24:45; 13:52. 

While the apostles followed the Lord's injunction and preached 
the glad tidings of a coming kingdom in which would "dwell 
righteousness," they made no plain statement regarding an 
endless condition of conscious misery. Yet Paul assures us that 
he did not shrink from making known the whole counsel (will) 
of God. (Acts 20:27.) Peter, in the text quoted at the beginning 
of this article, exhorts, "Be saved from this perverse generation." 
(Rotherham's translation.) Not one word about being saved from 
a future, never ending misery, though the time was wondrously 
propitious for such a message, if such a doom awaits those 
refusing to be guided by the call. The Pentecostal blessing had 
just been received, and the Holy Spirit was present with gifts of 
power to aid in promulgating a gospel of fear, if there were need 
of preaching such a gospel. Peter, under the guidance of the 
Holy Spirit, simply pleads, "Save yourselves from this untoward 
generation." Will it not be wise for us to go to the Bible and ask 
our Master to free us from all prejudice and tradition, and give 
us the "pure milk of the word" in this matter? Many earnest 
lovers of the Lord, whose greatest desire is to "spend and be 
spent" in his service, so agonize in the thoughts of the future 
torture of those not now reached by the "Glad Tidings," that 
they cannot "be anxious about nothing," but in nervous dread 
spend days and months in distressing labor to "save souls," and 
find no rest. Others grow indifferent at the continued and 
growing apathy with which their message is received, and 
become lukewarm. A true understanding of the proclamation 
entrusted to them would enable all true Christians to more fully 
and joyously fulfill their service. 

Let us try to find in the Scriptures what there was "untoward" or 
"perverse" about the generation of Peter's day, and see if the 
same conditions yet prevail. In Eph. 2:2, Paul says, "Wherein in 
times past ye walked according to the course of this world, 
according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that 
now worketh in the children of disobedience." Do we not find 
here the cause for the "perverse generation" of Peter's time, and 



while we now have different manifestations, does not the same 
spirit work in the present "children of disobedience?" In the 
same epistle (6:12), Paul further explains that the spirit is due, 
not only to depraved human nature, but also to the influence of 
the devil and his angels. The work of this spirit in the flesh is 
clearly set forth in Gal. 5:19-21, and in verses 22-23 is 
contrasted the fruits of the new spirit in those who have been 
saved from this "untoward generation. " In this connection also 
study carefully Eph. 4:17-32 and Col. 3:1-17. These Bible 
teachings set forth grandly what message of salvation the 
Christian is to proclaim, and give us an incentive to walk 
humbly in love before our God now, knowing He will exalt us 
"in due time. " 

Those who have been "delivered from the power of darkness, 
and translated into the kingdom of his dear Son" (Col. 1:13), do 
not "commit (practice) sin, but purify themselves, even as he is 
pure" (1 John 3:3-8), and thus are saved from this evil 
generation now. While they may be "overtaken in a fault," or 
through the wiles of the devil be led for a while to wander, their 
Lord will watch and discipline them, to lead them back into the 
fold, and if they heed his leadings, they will overcome these evil 
influences, because "greater is he who is in them, than he who is 
in the world. "-1 John 4:4. 

To be "saved" is to have all the desires of the flesh (those proper 
and right, as well as the sinful ones) under subjection, and laid 
daily on God's altar, a willing sacrifice (Rom. 12:1), that we 
may make up in the flesh that which is "behind in the sufferings 
of Christ. "-Col. 1:24. 

With this Scriptural teaching showing salvation to be a present 
condition, which reaches into the age to come, how the mist 
clears, and how precious becomes our privilege to be "new 
creatures in Christ Jesus." Becoming associates of the Lord 
Jesus, and "followers of God, as dear children," we come into a 
perfect love which casts out all fear, for fear has torment (1 John 
4:18), and we find ourselves possessed, not of a spirit of 
bondage again to fear, but we receive a spirit of adoption 
whereby we cry "Abba, Father." (Rom. 8:15.) No necessity now 
for going along fearfully, wondering if we are saved: we have 
His spirit "witnessing with ours that we are the children of 
God." We know daily that it is our meat and drink to do our 
Master's will. Every day's experience demonstrates that we are 
saved from the spirit that "now worketh in the children of 
disobedience. " We long to be perfectly obedient, and but for our 
realization that Christ is our "wisdom and righteousness and 
sanctification and redemption" (1 Cor. 1:30), the sense of our 
shortcomings would be unbearable. Our Master gives us his 
peace, which the world can "neither give nor take away," and 
thus takes the burden of our frailty and incompetency from us, 
and we are able to stand complete in him. 



We thus rest in Him in the present and for the future, knowing 
that He has "all power in heaven and on earth." Believing that 
while we were "without strength, in due time Christ died for the 
ungodly," so too do we believe that "in due time" his ransom 
will be testified unto all men. (1 Tim. 2:6.) He is not dependent 
on sinful flesh and blood to perfectly carry out the divine plan of 
"Justification of Life" for all men. (Rom. 5:18.) 

As our Lord Jesus offered himself a sacrifice first, and was then 
exalted, so now, during this Gospel age, he permits the "called" 
who fulfil their consecration and become the "chosen" (Matt. 
22:14) to suffer with him, that they may reign with him, when 
he has established his kingdom on earth. (2 Tim. 2:12.) During 
this present evil age only those who "love righteousness and 
hate wickedness" (Heb. 1:9) receive the spirit of God, and only 
those who have this spirit can understand the things we speak, 
for "the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, 
for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, 
because they are spiritually discerned. Now, we have received 
not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we 
might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which 
things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom 
teacheth, but which the Holy Spirit teacheth; comparing spiritual 
things with spiritual. Howbeit we speak wisdom among them 
that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the 
princes of this world, that come to nought; but we speak the 
wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which 
God ordained before the world unto our glory, which none of 
the princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they 
would not have crucified the Lord of Glory. But he that is 
spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. 
For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct 
him? But we have the mind of Christ.- 1 Cor. 
2:14,12,13,6,7,15,16. W. E. P.

VIEW FROM THE TOWER. 

KNOWLEDGE INCREASED AND ITS RESULTS. 

-CONTINUED FROM SEPTEMBER. - 

Let us point out briefly some of the faults of the present social 
structure. Though in doing so we shall most frequently refer to 
social conditions prevalent in Europe, it is not because America 
has a perfect social system, but because our system being 
already a great reform over the others, the evils of the old 
system will thus be made the more apparent. Consider then,- 

(1) The Law of Primogeniture-under which among the "Royal" 
and "Noble" families the eldest son or eldest daughter inherits 
the honorable station and titles and landed estates, while the 
younger sons are provided with sinecures, in the way of military 
or naval office, or a ministry in the Established Church, at good, 
comfortable salaries. 

By this means, the vast land-holdings of Great Britain and other 
countries of Europe (the basis of all power and wealth) are 
retained in the hands of the favored families, just as royalty is. 
And it is by the power and influence of these favored families 
that the majority of the important and profitable and honorable 
political and ecclesiastical offices are filled by their faithful 
relatives and henchmen- often regardless of the value of their 
services, or even of their capacities for service. 

The public, without their consent, directly or indirectly, pay for 
the maintenance of these "royal" and "noble" families, whose 
services though sometimes valuable are often useless, because 
that is and has been the form or arrangement of society there for 
centuries past; and because to rebel against it would be regarded 
as treason, and would involve a revolution and probably a civil 
war. For the grandees of the long-favored class have come to 
regard it as their God-given right to rule "the common people" 
and to tax them, for their maintenance above them in every 
respect. 

And while the "noble" and "royal" class is actually a minority, it 
is a plurality in influence, because there is always a multitude of 
hangers-on who either as tradesmen, servants, clerks, appointees 
or tenants have their interests joined with it, and thus share 
indirectly the fortunes of the favored class. These constitute the 
large class of "conservatives," whose interests are mixed, and 
who wisely seek to preserve peace and to bring about gradually 
a social reform which will clip the wings of royalty and nobility, 
one feather at a time, and elevate the common people, and give 
them their rights and privileges as men, piecemeal. 



Nowhere in Europe has this conservative reform worked so well 
as in Great Britain. Gradually the people have sought and very 
gradually they have been attaining their rights, until now they 
have a voice and share in the government of themselves. But the 
more their knowledge increases, the more they realize that the 
privileges accorded them in the past were forced from the grasp 
of aristocracy, and were not favors at all, but their just rights. 
And the more they study the subject, the more they realize 
(especially in the light of the example of "Liberty enlightening 
the world, " in the great Republic of America) that they have not 
yet obtained all their God-given rights; for they are gradually 
learning that the present power, titles, influence and landed 
estate of the favored class were not obtained as the gifts and 
favors of God, nor generally by honest industry and frugality; 
but were "seized" and appropriated in the long-ago by the 
ancestors of the present holders,— at a time when the motto was, 
"MIGHT makes RIGHT." 

As the people come to see that the land is the basis of power and 
wealth, they realize that they are largely at the mercy of the 
aristocratic land-lords upon whose lands they raise their food 
and upon which they have built their houses. They see that every 
child born in the land increases the value of the land and thus its 
rental value, and thus also the wealth of the lords and nobles, 
and the wealth, the influence and the power of all of the favored 
class, and decreases proportionately the value of labor and its 
influence. They see that governmental reform has gone about as 
far as it possibly can go under the present organization of 
society. They see that the land-power must in some manner be 
revolutionized, so that it will be more evenly divided among the 
sober, industrious, and growingly intelligent people. 

All thoughtful men can see that because of the increased light it 
will be necessary to distribute the power, influence and other 
advantages accruing from ownership of the soil more generally 
than at present among the people; otherwise all respect for title 
to land from possession will soon be lost, and public sentiment 
will cease to protect by jury- verdicts, or by police and army 
service, the extravagant claims and titles of the few, as against 
themselves, the public, the many. 

There is in mankind in general a sense of honor and honesty 
which under favorable circumstances is disposed to respect the 
rights of each other: (1) To all improvements, representing 
either mental or physical or machine labor put upon land to the 
enhancement of its value, such as buildings, fencing, shrubbery, 
cultivation, etc. (2) To possession of land of which a man is said 
in law to be "seized;" whether he got first possession by original 
discovery when the land was wild, unclaimed and unused, or 
whether it represents by purchase the energy and frugality of 
one or more generations. (3) Even if it could be proved that the 
title to property in the remote past came by fraud or by war, 



during the "dark ages," the majority of public sentiment agrees 
not to ignore present titles and interests of present innocent and 
honest holders. 

Nevertheless there is a limit to honor, honesty and generosity 
among the masses of men, beyond which it would be imprudent 
for the land-holding element to permit their case to go. When it 
comes to the point, as it has now done in Great Britain, where 
the population is greater than the soil under tillage will support 
in later-day decency and comfort, and where the landlords 
refuse to sell, and where the tenants would be unable to 
purchase by reason of long paying as rent all that the land would 
produce over the actual and bare necessities of life, the danger 
line is reached. There is danger not only of the masses refusing 
to protect the few in their claimed and hitherto recognized 
"rights" and wrongs, but there is danger of the sense of honor 
and respect for vested rights becoming soured into the very 
vinegar of hatred and envy, which would cancel and abolish 
forever all present claims and titles to the soil, as well as to 
royalty and general favoritism. 

Ah! laugh the Lords, such a prognostication is contradicted by 
all history. There have been agitations on the land question and 
other questions in the past very similar to these now in progress 
in Ireland and Scotland. History repeats itself. The results of 
present agitations will be the same as those of the past— the 
survival of the fittest. Royalty has not only the land, but the 
money and the brains and the control. We will stick to our 
colors. The result will favor us. We have conceded to the people 
all we can or will concede; for the more we concede the more 
they demand. To concede more than at present, would be to 
concede and give up all our power and advantage; and we will 
never do that. The people must learn to respect the law of supply 
and demand, and must not come whining to us of what they 
would like and what they do not like. If they do not want to live 
on our lands and pay the rents we demand, let them emigrate to 
America or elsewhere. As long as they have oats and potatoes 
they need not starve. What need have they for more? Ambition 
and knowledge are curses to the poor; they get dissatisfied with 
their lot in life and the station in society assigned them by 
Providence. If their families become too numerous for such 
portions of the soil as we wish to rent, let them break their 
families and their family ties and let them remember that they 
have no rights whatever that we and our families are bound to 
respect. The facts that for centuries they and their fathers have 
lived upon the soil and have really given it its value, and that 
they have paid us and our fathers rents which would amount to 
hundreds of times the value of the lands, and that upon these 
rents our families have lived in elegance and luxury,— all this 
passes for nothing. We have the power; the present organization, 
its present laws and regulations, recognize our authority under 
the general law of supply and demand. The supply of people is 



plentiful and ever increasing, and the demand and value is 
consequently on the decrease. The supply of land is limited and 
its proportion of acreage to population decreasing, and the 
demand and value is consequently increasing. This law of 
supply and demand suits us, and it cannot be changed under the 
present organization of society. And we hold the key of power 
and do not fear a revolution. We have the Church, and the 
influence and wealth which secures the army and navy, and we 
have all the intelligent people upon our side, who all see that 
they would risk much in our overthrow. 

But, "when they shall say, 'Peace and safety,' then sudden 
destruction cometh upon them as travail. " They seem to 
overlook the fact that times are changed; that many are running 
to and fro, and knowledge is increased greatly among the 
common people. Superstitions and reverence for men and laws 
and customs are 

R1153:pagel 

fading out fast. History, in its records of the past efforts of the 
people for liberty and rights, social, financial and political, states 
the fact that the few could and did gain the victory over the 
many, because of the greater intelligence of the few which 
enabled them to use the leverage 

R1153:page2 

of power upon the fulcrum of superstition and thus to control the 
masses. The conditions are all changed, as we have seen the 
Prophet Daniel foretold, by the increase of knowledge. 
"Knowledge is power!" It sets free the slaves of superstition. It 
tells them that the earth is the Lord's, and that he gave its soil as 
well as its air and its water to the children of men in common, 
and not to a favored class; and that each may seize and hold only 
so much as he can and will use and cultivate; especially after 
vacant or "wild" lands are all taken up. It tells them that though 
all men are not equal, (some men having a superiority and 
fitness, moral, mental or physical, over and above other men, 
which qualifies them for the more important positions and 
honors and trusts of the public service,) yet all men are free to 
do anything that is right or good in the service of their fellow- 
men that they may be found the most capable of doing. In a 
word, knowledge shows that class distinctions which make 
anything else than character and ability the tests of the right to 
do all the ruling of the world, are not to be tolerated, and are not 
authorized either by reason or by God's Word. 

The fact that we have cited Great Britain as an illustration 
should not be understood as implying that its aristocracy and its 
common people exhibit the extremes on this question. Quite to 
the contrary. The extremes of society are much wider in other 
countries of Europe, and the injustice practiced upon the 
common people greater, because, more degraded, they will 



submit to it. Increase of knowledge is the remedy for all. The 
following clipping from the Fortnightly Review tells of a much 
wider difference in Hungary. The correspondent says:- 

"Aristocratic traditions still prevail, and a nobleman thinks 
nothing of flogging a peasant whom he finds straying in his 
park, or directing his game-keeper to set man-traps for poachers. 
A friend of mine, who lately rented some shooting from a 
Hungarian nobleman, was informed by the game-keeper of the 
latter how he had treated a poacher whom he once found in his 
master's preserves with some wires in his hand. He twisted the 
wires into a noose, with which he hung the man to a tree, and 
waited till his victim's face became black before letting him 
down. This process he repeated three or four times, until he 
considered the punishment adequate. 

"It is sad to see the wretched peasants, who are requisitioned as 
'beaters,' paraded before a battue on a bitterly cold morning, and 
again paraded in the evening, while their clothing is searched by 
the gamekeeper before they are given their scanty pay and 
allowed to return to the villages, sometimes many miles distant, 
from which they have been summoned. " 

And the same or even worse conditions prevailed in France until 
the Revolution, in the end of the last century, when the people 
arose and confiscated property and abolished the privileges of 
the aristocratic class. All know of the terrible state of affairs that 
overthrow of aristocracy and royalty caused. The streets literally 
ran with blood and for a while anarchy prevailed. And as the 
Lord shows us through the Prophet Daniel that the knowledge 
now being shed abroad will bring about the great time of 
trouble, such as was not since there was a nation, so he shows 
through the symbols of John the Revelator that the French 
Revolution was a picture and foretaste of that great trouble 
coming upon the whole civilized world. 

The coming trouble will be a period of divine judgment upon the 
kingdoms of so-called "Christendom" and upon the nominal 
church so closely yoked to them, none the less because it comes 
about in a natural way. It will render vengeance and justice to 
those who have misrepresented God's character and plans for the 
upholding of their own false systems political and ecclesiastical; 
and who in the name of God's church, in the name of Christ's 
kingdom, and in the name of his law and authority, have abused 
their power and influence selfishly, and frequently presented 
more of the spirit and methods of Satan than of Christ. 

Beloved, followers of Christ, avenge not yourselves. Wait ye on 
the Lord. He will establish a righteous administration of 
government shortly, and is already preparing his implements 
(unknown to the world) by which the present rule shall be 
brought to an end and the control of earth given to a truly royal 
class (Christ and the Church), whose perfection and love shall 



secure to men every advantage, and shall bring the willing and 
obedient up by restitution to that grand perfection of Eden, lost 
by sin. And then the dominion of earth shall again be given to 
again competent man. 

(To be continued.)

EXTRACTS FROM 
INTERESTING LETTERS. 

[The following letter from a Brother who is a minister and the 
editor of a prominent religious journal will be read with interest. 
As it was not written for publication we withhold the name of 
the writer and his journal. -EDITOR.] 

Excelsior, Mo. 

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-For the first time in my life 
have I found my own views so forcibly presented as you present 
them. In so far as I have this day read MILLENNIAL DAWN, 
Vol. I., I certainly will want Vol. II. I have with an open Bible 
figured out substantially the same Plan of Salvation, as set forth 
by your felicitous pen and warm hearted intelligence. I may 
write you more fully when I have gone through your entire 
course. To tell you plainly, I have hesitated about advocating my 
views, though clear to me, for so great difference exists as 
compared with the received theology, and the mass of the 
nominal church, that I have hesitated, needing more light, 
backbone or perhaps spirit, to declare fully what I believed I saw 
as the Plan of God. 

I have not read enough of your book to really now know that we 
are together, but such have been my own exercises, yea, I might 
say, ordeals as this most captivating system beautifully unfolded 
to my mental, moral and spiritual vision, as I studied Holy Writ. 
Excuse haste; I am on the eve of leaving home for a few days, 
but felt I must write you. 

Your Brother.

DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:-Last winter I read a copy of 
ZION'S WATCH TOWER and found it so interesting that I at 
once subscribed for it and sent for a copy of THE PLAN OF 
THE AGES. I found what I had been seeking for, the truth in 
regard to the real purpose of God. Now I see that in Adam we 
lost all and through Christ, the second Adam, we regain "that 
which was lost. " I see the present position and relation of man 
toward his Creator, the real object of the present dispensation, as 



well as the time and object of the second advent. Also in regard 
to eternal torment, the present accountability or free moral 
agency of man, the fate of those who die in infancy, the insane, 
the heathen and the unbelievers; also why there is so much 
indifference manifested in regard to the religion of Jesus Christ, 
and how to account for the disgraceful, hypocritical and 
inconsistent conduct of many of those who profess to be 
Christians. I had long since suspected that there was something 
wrong in so-called Orthodoxy, but owing to religious 
impressions inculcated in early days, the opposition manifested 
by the clergy and professed Christians in general, when 
explanation was demanded or doubts expressed in regard to the 
correctness of the doctrines as formulated in their church creeds, 
and the want on my part of sufficient light on these subjects, I 
could not find my way out of Babylon, but was left groping in 
darkness, till it pleased God through your instrumentality to lift 
up the veil, when, behold! old things of darkness passed away 
and all things became new. 

To-day I feel as a new man, free from the spirit of sectarianism 
and formalism, emancipated from all bondage to the creeds and 
traditions of men. Hence all things are looked at from a different 
standpoint. Society in all its ramifications, whether it be 
considered in a religious, political or social sense, has an 
entirely different aspect from what it formerly had. A flood of 
light has been thrown over the world, and though darkness yet 
covers the earth, those who are watching can see that "the 
morning cometh. " All who earnestly desire to know the truth 
and abide therein who read THE PLAN OF THE AGES and 
THE TIME IS AT HAND, receive such blessings and partake of 
such joys as tongue cannot express. 

May God's blessing rest upon you and your companion. Yours 
in Christ, 

R. E. W . 

Seward, Neb. 

TOWER TRACT SOCIETY:-Fortunately I got hold of the little 
tract on The Wages of Sin, and I find it contains more good 
sound sense than I am used to hearing. I wish you would send 
me something else equally good, and prices. I will order the 
PLAN OF THE AGES soon.

BRETHREN-THOUGH STRANGERS :-By mere accident, or 
providentially, I have just met your Tract, "Old Theology," on 
CALAMITIES, and I hunger for more of this bread. I am an old 
pastor of the M. E. Church and am packing up for a journey near 



at hand, being 75 years old. I am sorry I had not met you or your 
Old Theology years ago. Pray, who are you? Some of like faith I 
met in London and in Paris a year ago and admired much. 

Can you send me your two Tracts (a copy of each) Nos. 1 and 2, 
with any other short publications that will tell me of your faith? 
Do you publish a paper? If so send me a sample copy, and I will 
try to extend your list. 

I am delighted with your Tract No. 2, and hope to learn more of 
Bible truth from your standpoint. By sending more in this line 
you will cheer and comfort. Yours in the Master, 

G. C. B .

TOWER TRACT SOCIETY, FRIENDS :-On last Sunday 
morning as the writer was boarding the street car, a pleasant 
looking gentleman handed him a little tract-The Old Theology- 
"CALAMITIES, AND WHY GOD PERMITS THEM." It was 
read with very much interest; and I drop this line to inquire what 
particular sect it is that is spreading this interpretation of the 
Scriptures? I am not a member of any church, unless a birthright 
in the Hicksite Quaker Church would make me one; but Jesus is 
the adoration of my soul, and the perfect ideal of my conception. 
How strange that the Church in main understandeth him not, and 
how strange that the Bible seems to be a sealed book to most of 
its members. 

Will you kindly send to the above address a copy of the paper 
mentioned on page 32 of above named tract, and oblige Yours 
sincerely, 

C. B . 



[The above three letters are given as samples of letters 
continually coming to hand, which show that the Old Theology 
Tracts are reaching some who have ears to hear the good tidings. 
Tract No. 2 seems to give the best results with new ears. All 
who have not seen it should order a sample copy, free. Tract No. 
3- "PROTESTANTS, AWAKE!" will be ready shortly.]

DEAR BRO. RUSSELL:-Your kind letter received. Of course I 
am rejoiced to see your appreciation of the service we are 
enabled to do; hope the Lord is pleased with our efforts. 

At Frankfort my box on the street (pulpit) was below the level of 
the side walk and over this high curb which lined the walk one 
man laughingly remarked, how the people with bright, open 
eyes and eager manner stretched their necks to hear, not losing a 
word. Who could hesitate to preach with such listeners? No 
doubt you would like to be out in this preaching field also— How 



I wish you could be. It quickens me greatly to see an interest so 
keen. Some think me a powerful preacher, but I am not; but the 
truth has made me free, and the poor sheep are so hungry. 

I shall make an effort to sell more of DAWN, Vol. II. I see with 
Bro. Rogers how much we need a few who have the whalebone 
effect of the two DAWNS. I sold two Vol. II. to-day on the 
merit of Vol. I., and to such we do a great service, a double 
service, as Bro. Rogers also says. 

I enclose Bro. Weimar's letter. His family are among the things 
to be left behind, but when we see how he loves them, his 
sacrifice, as seen in his long absence from them, is sweet to 
God. 

I find the workers all encouraged though difficulties abound- 
less hurry and strife on their part, and more confidence and 
continuousness and trust to God to produce results. 

I think many might find old or young colporteurs to represent 
them, and ought to do so. I have one lady agent here who has 
sold some. If we had many agents and each sold but a few the 
aggregate would be large. 

Mrs. A. wishes to join in kind regards and Christian love to you 
and Sister Russell. Dear Bro. Russell, much love, and may grace 
and peace in the Holy Spirit be yours. Ever in Christ, 

J. B. ADAMSON. 

Steubenville. 

DEAR BRO. RUSSELL:-As this is a day of rest, I have a little 
leisure to write. I must let you know that the words of the holy 
Scriptures (1 Pet. 4:1-7) which you proclaimed on the first 
Lord's day of this month [Sept.] are still stimulating me for the 
service of the Anointed. 

I met two brethren at East Liverpool who were at the Passover 
last April. We had of course an "Emmaus" talk together, 
conversing about the things which are being brought about 
through the invisible parousia of the Chief and Head Reaper- 
the King of kings and Lord of lords- our glorious Spirit- 
Bridegroom! O what a privilege to be in the great harvest-work 
that is now going on. I also met a distant relative of yours, a 
physician, and had a short conversation with him. Before I got 
through he bought the first and second Vols. He read several 
chapters of Vol. I. before I left the town. I met him again just 
before leaving, and he said that he was well pleased with the 
contents of the work so far. I then recommended the Z.W.T. to 
him. 

I also met a certain Israelite, a God-fearing man, who upon my 
introduction of MILLENNIAL DAWN was all ear to hear, 
especially when I told him about the "restitution," and that the 
God of heaven through their Messiah was about to "set up" the 



long-promised Kingdom as foretold through Daniel, the prophet, 
and all through the Holy Writings. I asked him whether he 
believed what God had declared. He answered very 
emphatically -"Yes!" He also believed in the restoration of the 
Jewish race to Palestine, and I was surprised to find him well 
informed and versed on these topics according to the Law and 
the Prophets. After the conversation with him, he bought the 
first and second Vols, and said: "If I like it, I will also get that 
journal," which I meanwhile had recommended to him. And 
leaving him he said, "I am glad that I have met you," to which I 
responded and wished him the Hebrew-departure. 

I also met an old soldier who was much taken with name and 
contents of MILLENNIAL DAWN. He bought the first Vol., 
and as my lodging-place was near his home I had opportunity to 
talk to him several times and he was willing to hear. 

Monday, the 9th of this month, I left L , and arrived 

safely at Steubenville. I went right to work, beginning at the 
depot, and sold the remainder of that day 18 copies of DAWN; 

Tuesday 22; Wednesday ; Thursday 32; Friday 18; 

and Saturday 31. On Wednesday I toiled all day, a long day, too, 
but I "caught nothing." It reminded me of John 21:3. But on 
Thursday I did well, as you see. 

Yours in the service of the Anointed, and with kind regards to

THY WILL BE DONE. 

We see not, know not; all our way 
Is night; with thee alone is day. 
From out the torrent's troubled drift, 
Above the storm our prayer we lift, 
Thy will be done! 

The flesh may fail, the heart may faint; 
But who are we to make complaint, 
Or dare to plead in times like these 
The weakness of our love of ease? 
Thy will be done! 

We take with solemn thankfulness 
Our burden up, nor ask it less, 
And count it joy that even we 
May suffer, serve, or wait on thee, 
Whose will be done! 



Though dim as yet in tint and line, 
We trace thy picture's wise design, 
And thank thee that our age supplies 
The dark relief of sacrifice, 
Thy will be done! 

And if in our unworthiness 

Thy sacrificial wine we press, 

If from thy ordeal's heated bars 

Our feet are seamed with crimson scars, 

Thy will be done! 

If, for the age to come, this hour 
Of trial hath vicarious power, 
And, blest by thee, our present pain 
Be liberty's eternal gain, 
Thy will be done! 

Strike, thou the Master, we thy keys, 
The anthem of thy destinies ! 
The minor of thy loftier strain, 
Our hearts shall beat the old refrain, 
Thy will be done! 

-Whittier.

MR. TALMAGE'S VISION 
OF THE MILLENNIUM. 

"The night is far spent; the day is at hand." -Rom. 13:12.— 

In the midst of the great revolutions of thought in this 
wonderfully revolutionary period which the Scriptures term 
"The Day of Jehovah"- "the day of his preparation" for the 
Millennial reign of Christ, it is refreshing to observe that the dim 
outlines of God's real purpose are already beginning to dawn 
upon the minds of sincere thinkers who are not yet prepared for 
such a radical transformation of their theological views as God's 
plan of the ages makes manifest to others of God's believing 
watchmen on the towers of Zion. 

While echoes from the pulpits of eminent theologians in the 
great cities savor strongly of the rankest infidelity, which strikes 
at the very foundation doctrine of Christianity-the atonement 
through the precious blood of Christ- we see that a few are 
beginning to get their eyes open to the real truth. They begin to 
see "men as trees walking;" and as the signs of the Master's 
presence become more and more manifest in the events of this 
day of his presence, all who preserve the attitude of disciples 
will be led into clearer light more or less rapidly, according to 
the measure of their earnestness, diligence and freedom from 



sectarian and other prejudices. Below we give some extracts 
from Mr. Talmage's discourse of Sunday, Sept. 8th, on the 
above text— "The day is at hand" —which we consider quite 
remarkable. 

They give evidence that Mr. Talmage is getting awake, though 
he has not yet arisen from the old creed bed which is evidently 
too short for him and its coverings uncomfortably narrow. (Isa. 
28:20.) Yet, rubbing his eyes, he recollects the divine promise of 
coming day as he hears the great clock of the ages strike the 
hours of early morning, and sincere faith and the noble impulses 
of a generous nature catch the inspiration of the prophet-apostle, 
and he re-echoes his words- "The night is far spent; the day is at 
hand!" While we cannot endorse all that this eminent Christian 
brother says on the subject, but must here and there offer 
criticism, yet we rejoice that the gentleman and his thousands of 
hearers and readers have been brought face to face with so much 
truth so forcibly and so widely promulgated. Mr. Talmage said:- 

"I find a ray of the dawn in the compression of the world's 
distances. What a slow, snail-like, almost impossible thing 
would have been the world's rectification with 1,400,000,000 of 
population and no facile means of communication; but now, 
through telegraphy for the eye and telephonic intimacy for the 
ear, and through steamboating and railroading, the 25,000 miles 
of the world's circumference are shriveling up into insignificant 
brevity. Hong Kong is nearer to New York than a few years ago 
New Haven was; Bombay, Moscow, Madras, Melbourne within 
speaking distance. Purchase a telegraph chart, and by the blue 
lines see the telegraphs of the land, and by the red lines the 
cables under the ocean. You see what opportunity this is going 
to give for the final movements of Christianity. A fortress may 
be months or years in building, but after it is constructed it may 
do all its work in twenty minutes. Christianity has been planting 
its batteries for nineteen centuries, and may go on in the work 
through other centuries; but when those batteries are thoroughly 
planted, and those fortresses are fully built, they may do all their 
work in twenty-four hours. 

"The world sometimes derides the Church for slowness of 
movement. Is science any quicker? Did it not take science 5,652 
years to find out so simple a thing as the circulation of the 
human blood? With the earth and the sky full of electricity, 
science took 5,800 years before it even guessed that there was 
any practical use that might be made of this subtle and mighty 
element. When good men take possession of all these scientific 
forces, and all these agencies of invention, I do not know that 
the redemption of the world will be more than the work of half a 
day. Do we not read the queen's speech at the proroguing of 
Parliament the day before in London? If that be so, is it anything 
marvelous to believe that in twenty- four hours a divine 



communication can reach the whole earth? Suppose Christ 
should descend on the nations- many expect that Christ will 
come among the nations personally— suppose that tomorrow 
morning the Son of God from a hovering cloud should descend 
upon these cities. Would not that fact be known all the world 
over in twenty-four hours. 

"Suppose he should present his Gospel in a few words saying: 'I 
am the Son of God. I come to pardon all your sins and to heal all 
your sorrow; to prove that I am a supernatural being, I have just 
descended from the clouds; do you believe me, and do you 
believe me now?' Why, all the telegraph stations of the earth 
would be crowded as none of them were ever crowded, just after 
a shipwreck. I tell you all these things to show it is not among 
the impossibilities or even the improbabilities that Christ will 
conquer the whole earth, and do it instanter, when the time 
comes." 

Here, after drawing an excellent lesson, Brother Talmage greatly 
mars it by one of his astounding suppositions. His difficulty is, 
that he is depending too much upon his own imagination and has 
not noted that God's Word reveals exactly what his great work 
is, and how it will be done when his "due time" shall have 
arrived, and that he has not left us to our various and imperfect 
suppositions. 

It is a fact abundantly supported by Scripture as well as by 
common sense, as Mr. T. intimates, that the past six thousand 
years have been God's time for preparing the world (by many 
sad disappointments) for his blessing and kingdom, and also for 
preparing those who shall be God's agents and instruments in 
that work of general blessing. The first 1656 years of earth's 
history, down to the Deluge- the period of the ministration of 
angels— showed to angels and to men the inability of angels to 
recover fallen man. In fact, by the fall there of some of the 
angels (Compare Heb. 2:5; Jude 6; and 2 Pet. 2:4,5, with Gen. 
6:2-4.) it became manifest that evil was very contaminating and 
demoralizing even to the pure, and could only be dealt with as a 
plague —stamped out. During the Jewish age, God illustrated 
through Israel and the Law that by the deeds of the law no flesh 
could be justified in God's sight and that the blood of bulls and 
goats can never take away sin, but were at the very most types 
or illustrations pointing forward to the "better sacrifices" which 
God had intended from the very first. Thus 4000 years elapsed 
before even a basis of reconciliation between God and his 
condemned human creatures had been provided. And yet, the 
delay had not been too long, for the record is that it was "in due 
time God sent forth his Son" to redeem the world and thus to lay 
the foundation for their reconciliation with God. Now over 1 800 
years more have elapsed, and God's Word declares that his work 
during this period has been the electing or selecting of a very 
choice class from among men— a worthy remnant of Israel who 



received Messiah at his first advent (including the apostles) and 
a similarly faithful and tried class from among all nations since— 
in all a "little flock," "a peculiar people," "a royal 

R1155 : page 3 

priest- hood. " And these have been "called" under the express 
promise that when a fore-ordained number shall have been 
selected and tried and found worthy, then this select company 
shall be made glorious spiritual beings and be united with Christ 
Jesus their Lord, in order that as joint-heirs with him they may 
be the promised "Seed" (Gen. 12:2,3; compare Gal. 3:16,29) in 
which all the families of the earth shall be blessed. These are 
"called" to suffer with Christ in the present time (to thus show 
their love and devotion to him and the truth) and to reign with 
him in an age to follow this, in which, they are told, they are to 
judge [grant trial to] the world and also angels. (See 1 Cor. 
6:2,3.) And it is to the end that they may be very sympathetic 
judges and teachers (kings and priests unto God and for men) 
that, as their leader was, they now are required to be tempted in 
all points. 

But while agreeing that the past 6000 years have gotten fully 
ready for the conquest of the world for God, we must dissent 
from the view expressed by Brother Talmage, that this conquest 
will be accomplished in a day of twenty-four hours. That 
Immanuel, the new king, who is to take his great power and 
reign, establishing that Kingdom of God, for which he taught us 
to pray, "Thy Kingdom come," could, if he desired, introduce it 
by a marvelous demonstration in the sky that would affright the 
world and convince all men of his "all power in heaven and in 
earth," we do not for one moment question. And that by such a 
process he could wring from every throat the cry, "I believe, " we 
do not dispute. But such is not the work which our Lord comes 
to do, is our objection. The Scriptures declare a different object 
and a different method. To bend the knee and cry, "I believe," is 
not the sum of God's requirements. If so, Christ's reign might 
indeed terminate quickly-in a day of twenty-four hours. But if it 
is to be thus sudden and by an outward display of power, where 
was the use of the long preparation? Why spend 1 800 years 
selecting and educating and disciplining the elect church for that 
oft declared work of reigning with Christ and judging the world 
in righteousness, if the entire period of reigning and judging is 
to be twenty-four hours? And if the plan should be carried out as 
Mr. Talmage suggests, wherein would be found the usefulness 
of the great preparations God has been making for this coming 
work?-the telegraphs and telephones and printing presses, etc.: 
would they not be next to useless for such a conquest? If this be 
the method, it might have been carried out without any of these 
latter-day preparations and long ago. Had such been his method 
our Lord could have appeared in such a cloud and waiting there 
for 24 hours, he could in thunder tones have spoken to and been 



seen by every living creature of earth far more forcibly than by 
descending to one of the great cities, to telegraph and telephone 
his arrival all over the world, or to have newspaper Extras of his 
proclamation gotten out on lightning presses and sent by 
Limited Mail trains. 

But no; with no such unseemly haste will God's great plan, for 
which the past six thousand years have been only the 
preparatory steps, be consummated. How apt we are to get into a 
hurry and to expect God to do so too. How apt we are to forget 
what the prophet declared and the apostle repeated that a 
thousand years in God's sight are but as yesterday, a day with 
the Lord as a thousand years with men. Christ comes to reign; 
"he must reign until he has put all enemies under his feet;" and 
he shall reign, and the church of the first resurrection with him, 
for "a thousand years. "-1 Cor. 15:25; Rev. 20:2,4. 

When he who redeemed all in due time, shall likewise in due 
time set up his kingdom, it will be so ordered that it will afford 
ample opportunity for the overcoming saints, as his joint-heirs, 
to put fully into exercise in dealing with the sick, deaf and blind 
world all the preparatory lessons which they have received in 
the present age;-restoring the willing ones back to all the favors 
and blessings lost in Adam and redeemed for them by Christ's 
all-sufficient ransom-sacrifice. 

The telegraph, telephone, improved printing presses and rapid 
mail service will each and all, too, have their part to do in that 
great work of carrying the "good tidings of great joy, which 
shall be to all people" (Luke 2:10); in testifying in due time, to 
all, the ransom accomplished, the reconciliation possible, and 
the conditions of the new covenant; in causing the knowledge of 
the Lord to fill the earth as the waters cover the sea. -1 Tim. 
2:5,6; Isa. 11:9; Hab. 2:14. 

It will not be sufficient that men shall cry out, "I believe;" for 
devils also believe and tremble. The reign of Christ will not be 
for the purpose of showing how many can be brought to believe; 
but for the purpose of testing and trying the world, after they 
have come to a knowledge of the truth— after they have 
"believed, " to prove whether they shall will to be in harmony 
with God and obedient to him and his perfect law of love. God 
proposes to give back through Christ perfect life and all that 
man lost through disobedience, but only to such as accept of 
Christ, as Redeemer and King, and who, surrendering self-will, 
shall come so fully into harmony with God that they will hate 
sin and love righteousness. And before giving everlasting life to 
any, God proposes to take more than a mere profession; hence 
the coming age is called an age of judgment— an age of trial and 
testing, in which all mankind (except the few who have full 
knowledge, and hence full trial, now) will be tried fully, justly, 
impartially, with every favorable opportunity, before Christ, the 



Judge of all. (Acts 17:31.) Then these who love sin and will to 
serve it will be separated as 

R1155 : page 4 

goats from those "sheep" whose delight is in the law of the Lord 
(love). The one class shall receive the blessing and gift of God- 
everlasting life- while the other shall receive the penalty of sin- 
death— this time "the second death," the result of the second 
trial, as the first death was the result of the first trial of our race 
representatively in Adam. But, because an individual 
condemnation, the result of a full, complete, individual trial, 
under full knowledge and with every advantage, it is a finality 
with them-an everlasting cessation of life, from which there 
will be no awakening, from which none will ever be redeemed— 
for "Christ dieth no more." (Rom. 6:9.) His work is to be so 
thorough and complete as to need no patching. He will reign 
until all enemies are put under his feet— subdued, destroyed. (1 
Cor. 15:25.) Let us note, however, that the word enemies here 
applies not to the ignorant millions who have never known the 
Lord, but only to those who, when brought to a full knowledge 
and full ability, are willingly and knowingly the opponents of 
righteousness. So then, the great work, just at hand, is not the 
work of a twenty-four hour day, but the great, grand, God-like 
work of the Millennial day. It is this great "Day of Christ" that is 
at hand; announced by the great clock of the ages. Look further, 
look closer, Brother Talmage! 

But though not clearly discerning the particulars of the great 
day, Mr. T. sees much, and much more clearly than many 
others. He continues:— 

"There are foretokenings in the air. Something great is going to 
happen. I do not think that Jupiter is going to run us down or 
that the axle of the world is going to break, but I mean 
something great for the world's blessing, and not for the world's 
damage, is going to happen. I think the world has had it hard 
enough. Enough, the London plagues. Enough, the Asiatic 
choleras. Enough, the wars. Enough, the shipwrecks. Enough, 
the conflagrations. I think our world could stand right well a 
procession of prosperities and triumphs." 

Ah yes ! Men should begin to see that the imperfections of 
climate, and disturbances and irregularities of air, sea and land 
are not the best that God has power to do for man, and would 
not be good enough for the friends of God; but they are parts of 
the curse, parts of the penalty of sin, which are to be done away 
under the glorious reign of Immanuel, when, through him, God 
shall wipe away all tears, and when there shall be no more curse. 
But Brother Talmage is in error, when he says, "Enough" of 
these has been already experienced. God's Word declares that 
there is yet a great and final shaking up of church and world to 
take place. (Heb. 12:26-28.) Daniel's prophecy speaks of it and 



locates it right here, saying, "At that time shall Michael [Christ] 
stand up [assume control], and there shall be a time of trouble 
such as was not since there was a nation." (Dan. 12:1.) The 
apostle James (5:1-7) also foretold this trouble. Thank God that, 
though a severe lesson, it will be a final one, bringing the world 
to its senses. After it the peoples will beat their swords into 
plowshares and their spears into pruning-hooks and say, "Come, 
let us go up to the mountain [kingdom] of the Lord. He will 
teach us his ways and we will walk in his paths. "-Isa. 2:2-4. 

Mr. Talmage continues:— 

"Better be on the lookout. Better have your observatories open 
toward the heavens, and the lenses of your most powerful 
telescopes well polished. Better have all your Leyden jars ready 
for some new pulsation of mighty influence. Better have new 
fonts of type in your printing-offices to set up some astounding 
good news. Better have some new banner that has never been 
carried, ready for sudden processions. Better have the bells in 
your church towers well hung, and the rope within reach, that 
you may ring out the marriage of the King's Son. " 

Good! Brother Talmage. We are glad to see that you with us are 
looking for the union of the Bridegroom to his long-espoused 
bride, the church. Yes, then the marriage bells, the joyous bells, 
may well be rung ! for then the Spirit and the Bride shall say, 
Come, and whosoever will may come and take of the water of 
life freely. -Rev. 22:17. 

R1156:page4 

But Mr. Talmage seems to get a still closer and a clearer view 
of coming events, and their results, as he proceeds, for he adds:- 

"Cleanse all your court-houses, for the Judge of all the earth 
may appear. Let all your legislative halls be gilded, for the great 
Lawgiver may be about to come. Drive off the thrones of 
despotism all the occupants, for the King of heaven and earth 
may be about to reign. " 

What is this we hear? Has Mr. Talmage turned "Socialist?" Hear 
him: "Drive off the thrones of despotism all the occupants; for 
the King of heaven and earth may be about to reign. " Aye, this 
is socialism— of the heavenly, Bible sort, however. Surely the 
utterer of these words remembered that it was written by the 
prophet, "In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set 
up a kingdom which shall break in pieces and consume all 
these." (Dan. 2:44.) It is a mistake to suppose that the great ones 
of earth, now in power, will recognize the principles of the new 
era, the Day at hand, and voluntarily resign the power and 
offices which at so great cost they have so long held on to. No; 
as Mr. Talmage puts it, they will have to be driven off their 
thrones. [The saints, however, fight not with carnal weapons and 
will have nothing to do with this driving.] It is this necessary 



driving of the political kings and money kings of the world out 
of power, this cleansing of legislation and the courts of justice, 
that must come so surely as the new King comes, and the new 
Day, that will cause the great time of trouble foretold by the 
apostles and prophets. He continues :— 

"One more ray of the Dawn I see in facts chronological and 
mathematical. Come now, do not let us do another stroke of 
work until we have settled one matter. What is going to be the 
final issue of this great conquest between sin and righteousness? 
Which is going to prove himself the stronger, God or Diabolus? 
Is this world going to be all garden or all desert? Now let us 
have that matter settled. If we believe Isaiah and Ezekiel and 
Hosea, and Micah and Malachi, and John and Peter, and Paul 
and Christ, we believe that it is going to be all garden. " 

Hark! That is the Restitution note, Vox Jubilantel Praise the 
Lord! Brother Talmage must have been studying as well as 
resting during his summer vacation. He has found a stop in the 
Grand Organ of divine harmonies that he never found before. 
Praise the Lord! we are delighted to know that he has an ear and 
a voice for this restitution music— the new song. He has, no 
doubt, given attention to the Apostle Peter's announcement; for 
in his words above, he almost quotes Peter's expression in Acts 
3:19-21: "Times of refreshing shall come from the presence of 
the Lord; and he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was 
preached unto you, whom the heaven must retain until the times 
of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth 
of all his holy prophets since the world began." Well begun, go 
on, Brother Talmage and, as promised, let us hear from you this 
vox jubilante of restitution frequently hereafter.* Mr. Talmage 
proceeds:— 

"But let us have it settled. Let us know whether we are working 
on toward a success or toward a dead failure. If you are in a 
cyclone off the Florida coast, and the captain assures you the 
vessel is staunch and the winds are changing for a better quarter, 
and he is sure he will bring you safe into the harbor, you 
patiently submit to present distress with the thought of safe 
arrival. Now I want to know whether we are coming on toward 
dismay, darkness and defeat, or on toward light and blessedness. 
[Surely one or the other.] You and I believe the latter, and if so, 
every year we spend is one year subtracted from the world's 
woe, and every event that passes, whether bright or dark, brings 
us one event nearer a happy consummation: and by all that is 
inexorable in chronology and mathematics I commend you to 
good cheer and courage. If there is anything in arithmetic, if you 
subtract two from five and leave three, then by every rolling sun 
we are going on toward a magnificent terminus. Then, every 
winter passed is one severity less for our poor world. Then, 
every summer gone by brings us nearer unfading arborescence. 
Put your algebra down on the top of your Bible and rejoice. " 



No; no, Brother Talmage, it is the Bible, not the algebra, that is 
fulfilling. Let us, then, keep the Bible on top-and let us keep it 
open. It is the light to our path, the lantern to our footsteps; 
therefore we are not in darkness that that day should overtake us 
as a thief. (1 Thes. 5:4.) Let us lift up the lamp and keep it 
uncovered. Let the light shine. He proceeds: 

"It is nearer morning at three o'clock than it is at two; if it is 
nearer morning at 4 o'clock than it is at three, then we are nearer 
the dawn of the world's deliverance. God's clock seems to go 
very slowly, but the pendulum swings and the hands move, and 
it will yet strike noon. 

"There is a class of phenomena which makes me think that the 
spiritual and the heavenly world may, after a while, make a 
demonstration in this world which will bring all moral and 
spiritual things to a climax. Now, I am no spiritualist; but every 
intelligent man has noticed that there are strange and mysterious 
things which indicate to him that perhaps the spiritual world is 
not so far off as sometimes we conjecture, and that after a while 
from the spiritual and heavenly world there may be a 
demonstration upon our world for its betterment. We call it 
magnetism, or we call it mesmerism, or we call it electricity, 
because we want some term to cover up our ignorance. I do not 
know what that is. I never heard an audible voice from the other 
world. I am persuaded of this, however, that the veil between 
this world and the next is getting thinner and thinner, and that 
perhaps, after a while, at the call of God-not at the call of the 
Davenport Brothers, or Andrew Jackson Davis-some of the old 
spiritual warriors, some of the spirits of other days, mighty for 
God-a Joshua, or a Caleb, or a David, or a Paul-may come 
down and help us in this battle against unrighteousness. 

"Oh, how I would like to have them here-him of the Red Sea, 
him of the valley of Ajalon, him of Mars Hill. History says that 
Robert Clayton, of the English cavalry, at the close of a war, 
bought up the old cavalry horses, lest they be turned to drudgery 
and hard work, and bought a piece of ground at Navesmire heath 
and turned those old war horses into the thickest and richest 
pasture to spend the rest of their days for what they had done in 
other days. One day a thunderstorm came up, and these war 
horses mistook the thunder of the skies for the thunder of battle, 
and they wheeled into line-no riders on their backs-they 
wheeled into line ready for the fray. And I doubt me whether, 
when the last thunder of this battle for God and truth goes 
booming through the heavens, the old Scriptural warriors can 
keep their places on their thrones. Methinks they will spring into 
the fight and exchange crown for helmet, and palm branch for 
weapon, and come down out of the King's galleries into the 
arena, crying: 'Make room! I must fight in this great 
Armageddon.'" 



After removing much of the rich hyperbole and rhetorical 
clothing from this mental picture, we find beneath it all 
something more real perhaps than even Brother Talmage 
realized in this passage. The Lord, the apostles and all the 
overcomers of the Gospel age will indeed be present in the earth 
and take a part in the great conflict, figuratively called "the 
Battle of the Great Day of God Almighty." But not visibly, nor 
with carnal weapons, need they be looked for, but as spirit- 
beings, powerful and yet invisible, like the angels, as we have 
found the Scriptures to plainly teach. (See DAWN, Vol. II.) 
There is indeed to be, and that ere long, a great demonstration 
by the heavenly church and a restoration of olden-time 
communication between heaven and earth (Gen. 18:1,2; 19:1; 
Luke 22:43; Matt. 4:11) of which Spiritism's lying wonders and 
communications are but slanderous counterfeits of Satan, to 
deceive and lead into error and to the rejection of the Redeemer, 
if it were possible, the very elect. Thank God, his Word shows 
clearly and positively that the enemy hath now but a short time 
and will soon be bound, restrained, that he can deceive no more 
during the thousand years of Christ's reign. 

And there will be others here toward the close of this "battle"- 
the patriarchs and prophets of old, "until John," will be joining 
in at the last, after the last members of the body of Christ have 
been "changed" from human to spiritual beings. And these, 
though not bloody warriors, will be visible men— perfected 
MEN. "Ye shall see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the 
prophets in the kingdom. " Not from the skies shall these light 
down, but from the dust of the earth they shall be awaked 
perfect men, samples of the grand estate to which all may attain 
by obedience to the regulations of that Millennial Kingdom— of 
which these perfect ones will be the earthly representatives and 
exponents. 

As the overcomers of the Gospel age are to be joint-heirs with 
Christ, sharers of the new spiritual dominion over earth, which 
is to bless all the families of the earth, so the overcomers of the 
previous time, though not called to heavenly honors and nature, 
are to be associated in the Kingdom work of blessing as the 
earthly seed of Abraham, who shall inherit the earthly portions 
of the promises made to Abraham (Rom. 4:12-16,17), that the 
promise might be sure unto all (both parts of) the seed, not to 
that only which is of the law, but unto that also which is of the 
faith of Abraham [aside from the Law] -who typified him in 
whom he believed, even God. 

R1157:page4 

Of these noble old patriarchs [fathers] in whose genealogy 
Mary and Jesus are found, it is written: "Instead of thy fathers 
shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes [rulers, 
chief ones] in all the earth." (Psa. 45:16.) And this will be 
literally fulfilled when Christ as King appoints those resurrected 



and perfected men as the rulers, exemplars, and teachers of men. 
For they were his fathers in the sense of being Mary's 
progenitors, and they will become Christ's children and he their 
everlasting father, and father to all men who shall be restored to 
the Eden- lost perfection and to everlasting life, in that he who 
redeemed the world 

R1157:page5 

is to be also the Restorer and Life-giver (Father) to all the 
willing and obedient. Mr. Talmage closed his discourse thus:— 

"Brother! brother! all I am afraid of is, not that Christ will lose 
the battle, but that you and I will not get into it quick enough to 
do something worthy of our blood-bought immortality. O 
Christ! how shall I meet Thee, Thou of the scarred brow, and the 
scarred back, and the scarred hand, and the scarred foot, and the 
scarred breast, if I have no scars or wounds gotten in the 
service? It shall not be so. I step out to-day in front of the battle. 
Come on, you foes of God, I dare you to the combat. Come on, 
with pens dipped in malignancy. Come on, with tongues forked 
and viperine and adderous. Come on, I defy you! Come on! I 
bare my brow, I uncover my heart. Strike! I cannot see my Lord 
until I have been hurt for Christ. If we do not suffer with Him on 
earth we cannot glorify with Him in heaven. Take good heart. 
On! On! On! See! the skies have brightened! See! the hour is 
about to come! Pick out all the cheeriest of the anthems. Let the 
orchestra string their best instruments. "The night is far spent, 
the day is at hand. " 

Grand sentiments, noble resolves, which our hearts, one and all, 
we trust, re-echo- faithfulness to Christ, self-sacrifice in his 
service, in the service of the truth, at any cost, gladly, heartily, 
quickly, before "the night cometh, wherein no man can work. " 
For, though the glad morning is drawing close, the prophet 
warns us that the short, but sharp, terrible time of trouble 
precedes it, saying: The morning cometh, but a night also. 

But heed not the shadows, fear not the trouble, if you are a 
member of the faithful consecrated, "The King's Own," for he is 
on your side as well as you on his side. He has promised, I will 
never leave thee nor forsake thee. He has, even when telling us 
of the troubles impending at the present time, said, "Then lift up 
your heads and rejoice, for your redemption draweth nigh." And 
praise God for the light which now shows that the redemption or 
glorification of the church, the body of Christ, is but the first 
step in the great Redeemer's saving and restoring work, and that 
full opportunity of deliverance from sin and death shall yet be 
granted to every creature by the great Deliverer.

THE PRESBYTERIAN CREED. 

The New York Herald, discussing the proposed change of the 
creed of the Presbyterian Church, makes the following editorial 
comment on the subject:— 

"If the Christian of a century ago were to return to New York he 
would find almost nothing to remind him of his own time except 
the creed of the Presbyterian Church, and he would wonder 
why, in the progressive evolution, visible everywhere else, that 
alone remains unchanged. If he caught the spirit of our time he 
would see that we are just as eager for the eternal verities, far 
broader in our charities, more generous in our bequests, and 
quite as earnest in our pleas for public and private morality as he 
and his contemporaries were. For that matter he would discover 
with mingled surprise and gratitude that the chief reason why 
young men turn away from a clerical career is that they are too 
conscientious to subscribe to doctrines which neither brain nor 
heart will allow them to accept. 

"Here, for instance, is an illustrious example of the stern 
theology of the old school. We take it from Edwards' works, and 
from a sermon which curdled the blood of the last generation. 
The preacher singed the sinner with the flames not of an 
avenging but rather of a revengeful justice. Dr. Edwards says:— 

"The God that holds you sinners over the pit of hell, much as 
one holds a spider or some loathsome insect over the fire, abhors 
you. He will crush you under his feet without mercy. He will 
crush out your blood and make it fly, and it shall be sprinkled on 
His garments so as to stain all his raiment.' 

"After a sermon on that line of thought it would seem to be 
somewhat difficult to repeat the Lord's Prayer. The Fatherhood 
of God would not be easily established on that statement, and 
the parable of the shepherd wandering in the dark over hill and 
through dale to find the one lost sheep after the ninety nine had 
been safely folded is robbed of all its significance. 

"Imagine, if you can, Dr. John Hall or Dr. Howard Crosby, the 
soundness of whose faith is beyond question, indorsing such 
language and pronouncing it a fair description of God's relation 
to the human race. And yet it is strictly within the limits of the 
creed of a century ago, a creed which the younger Presbyterians 
desire to have modified. If it is true, why not emphasize it 



boldly, and if it is not true, why not revise the dogmas which 
appear to have raised a revolt in the Church? 

"The doctrine of foreordination, with its logical consequences, 
has broken many a man's head and heart. The picture of a 
burning lake, where writhing wretches curse the day of their 
birth and execrate the Deity who doomed them to unending 
misery 'for His own pleasure,' seals the lips of an ardent man 
who is filled with the desire to bless and help and save a falling 
world. His eloquence would be that of despair without a ray of 
hope. He turns from the pulpit and chooses the profession of the 
law. 

"From a purely secular point of view the picture is simply awful. 
What kind of a government could we have on earth if an 
emperor should throw three-quarters of his subjects into a prison 
house, to be tortured, including your father or mother or sister, 
and then require you to sing his praises and rejoice at their 
torments? The direful experiment has never been tried, and if it 
were tried we should either approach the sovereign with servile 
sycophancy or rebel with the courage of desperation. It would be 
as impossible to call him wise as it would be false to call him 
good. 

"It is no more strange, then, that the Assembly should be asked 
to revise such dogmas than that our fathers should have accepted 
them as true. That the demand is made in the name of vacant 
pulpits, only shows that to-day is more reverent than yesterday 
was, that fear of God is giving place to love, and that the world 
yearns to think of Him as Our Father, with all the words imply. 

"Holmes touches the heart of the new age in "The Chambered 
Nautilus," and we commend these lines to the Assembly as 
indicating the changes that should be made in the creed of the 
Presbyterian Church:— 

'Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul, 

As the swift seasons roll! 

Leave thy low vaulted past! 

Let each new temple, nobler than the last, 

Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast, 

Till thou at length art free, 

Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea!' 



It strikes us as scarcely fair to say that the only reminder of the 
"eternal torment theory" is to be found to-day in the 
Presbyterian Church and its creed. It was their candor and 
honesty to their convictions which led the framers of the 
Westminster Confession to state themselves so pointedly; and 
however much we feel their views to be erroneous, we should 
respect them for their candid statement of them. Other 
denominations believed as fully as the Presbyterians in the 



doctrine of eternal torment, and still do, and just as zealously 
now claim to be "orthodox" on this subject- that they now hold 
the teachings of the founders of the various sects. It is this very 
candor, too, no doubt, which prevents many Presbyterians from 
now changing, to suit the public, a creed which still expresses 
their honest convictions of the teachings of the Bible. Let us 
honor and respect their candor, however much we may 
disrespect their creed. 

We wish it were true that all other Christians had outgrown that 
horrible nightmare conceived by Papacy during the dark ages. 
But it is not true: the majority of Christian people, including the 
ministers, still hold to this horrible doctrine though their reasons 
and hearts rebel against it. The reason is, that they think it to be 
the teaching of the Bible, and it is their very desire to remain 
anchored to God's Word, that (through a false interpretation of 
its parables, dark sayings and symbols,) holds them to a doctrine 
which they feel keenly is a slander upon the character of any just 
and holy being. 

Under these circumstances doubts and fears take possession of 
their minds. They doubt the Bible and everything and yet they 
fear that to let go their hold would plunge them into infidelity, or 
perhaps atheism. Their next resort is to stand perfectly still,— to 
go neither forward, nor backward; to neither affirm, nor deny; to 
neither believe, nor disbelieve anything; and on all doctrinal 
subjects they say, "Let us alone! We are not 

R1158:page5 

theologians and don't want to bother ourselves on such 
subjects." And this is the attitude of Christian people in general 
to-day. They do not really and heartily believe the Bible (being 
hindered by their erroneous view of its teachings), and hence are 
uniting more and more upon a social and moral platform as 
sects, instead of on the grand doctrines of God's inspired 
revelation. 

Their attitude calls for sympathy and pity and tender help over 
their misunderstandings, rather than for abuse and cutting and 
lashing sarcasm, from those who have escaped from the horrible 
nightmare which still enthrals them. But we must not let them 
alone as they desire us to do; love for them, and for our Master's 
honor, and for the Truth, compels us to cry aloud and spare not, 
but show God's people their errors (Isa. 58:1), and cause such as 
really are earnest and honest and seeking for the truth, to see the 
beauty and grandeur of God's Word and his gracious plan 
therein revealed. 

Nor must those who have the harmonizing truth be slack in this 
work: the time for labor is short. If not soon convinced of the 
true teachings of the Bible, which so fully satisfies and 
convinces the sanctified reason, they will soon openly reject it. 
The opportunity for convincing them of the real grandeur of the 



Scriptures is while they yet hold on to them and to some extent 
respect them. They cannot stand still; for if those who have the 
truth should, as they so much desire, let them alone, the devil 
and the world and awakening reason will not let them alone, but 
will upset all their faith in the Bible and leave them naught but 
faith in men and in sects of human organization. 

Let every soldier of the cross press nobly on for the deliverance 
of his brethren, for the honor of his King and for the uplifting of 
the one and only Standard of truth—God's Word. 



R1158:page5 



FAITH AND WORKS. 



"What advantage, my brethren, has anyone, though he say he 
has faith, but have not works? This faith is not able to save 
him. "-James 2:14. 

We are taught that "without faith it is impossible to please 
God," and if faith without works is of no advantage, the 
inference is plain, that without works it is equally impossible to 
please God. And yet, we may have both faith and works and not 
be pleasing or acceptable to God. It is all-important that we have 
the right kind of faith and that our works should be the 
development and outgrowth of that faith. 

What, then, is faith? We answer, True faith is the reasonable and 
accepted conclusion of a logical argument based on a reasonable 
premise or foundation. And more, it is the only reasonable 
conclusion to which such a logical argument could lead. Thus, 
reasoning on the principle of cause and effect, a principle firmly 
established in all the operations of natural and moral law, we see 
in the whole realm of nature the evidences of an intelligent 
Creator. We know that such effects as appear in the order of 
nature— as for instance the order of the spheres, the succession of 
the seasons, and of day and night, the growth of vegetation, etc., 
etc., -could not be produced without an intelligent first cause. 
And so undeniable is the basis of fact thus furnished in nature's 
testimony, and so logical the reasoning from cause to effect, that 
the conclusion -that there is an intelligent, wise and powerful 
Creator-is so palpable and irresistible that the Scriptures declare 
the man a fool who does not accept it.— Psa. 14:1. 

And yet no man has ever seen God, nor can see him. (John 1:18; 
1 Tim. 6:16.) From these data alone we should have faith in 
God, even if he had given us no written revelation of himself. In 
a similar manner our faith in his written revelation and in all that 
it contains is established. For all that God expects us to believe 
beyond the realm of our senses and observation, he has given us 
an undeniable foundation of tangible fact, upon which he invites 
us to use our reasoning powers to arrive at conclusions of which 



we would otherwise be ignorant. Thus faith is a conviction of 
things unseen, based on the logical deductions from known 
facts— a most reasonable thing. 

There is nothing more common or necessary among men than 
faith. We exercise faith in the laws of nature and act upon it 
constantly. We till the soil and sow the seed in full faith in a 
future harvest to be brought forth by the continued operation of 
natural law, reasoning that the sun which shines to-day will 
shine again to-morrow, that the showers of yesterday will be 
repeated, and that vegetation will still be true to the old law of 
development and growth under these favorable conditions. Who 
thinks of questioning these things? No one. Why? Because we 
have become thoroughly acquainted with these methods in the 
past, and faith in them for the future is reasonable; while, on the 
other hand, doubt and unbelief would be unreasonable and 
foolish. The man who would refuse to plant for fear the sun 
would not rise again or the rain fall, would be rightly considered 
a fool. Why? Because faith is the only reasonable thing where 
the ground of faith is so well established. Even a child would 
laugh at another child who could not trust his parents for to- 
morrow's necessities when to-day's and yesterday's 

R1158:page6 

were abundantly provided for. His lack of faith would be so 
unreasonable. And just so when we have become acquainted 
with God, as all may who will study his works and ways in 
nature and revelation, to doubt is foolish, and full, perfect 
confidence in his wisdom, justice, love and power, is the only 
reasonable conclusion. 

Therefore it is that "without faith it is impossible to please God." 
Thus faith, being a reasonable conviction of things unseen, 
becomes a basis of hope for the things which God has promised. 
As Paul expresses it, "Faith is a basis of things hoped for, a 
conviction of things unseen." (Heb. 11:1.) With the same 
confidence, therefore, with which we look for an autumnal 
harvest from our spring-time seed-sowing, before we see any 
sign of it, we should also look for the fulfillment of all God's 
promises in due season, even before we see the slightest 
indication of their fulfilment. 

There is no difficulty in exercising faith in God and in any and 
all of his promises if we acquaint ourselves with his character. It 
should be as unwavering as our confidence that to-morrow's sun 
will rise. Thus it was in the cases of some commendable 
example to which the Apostle Paul refers (Heb. 1 l)-of Abel, 
Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Gideon, Barak, 
Samson, Jephthah, David and Samuel, and the prophets, who by 
faith in the promises and directions of God subdued kingdoms, 
shut lion's mouths, quenched the power of fire, raised dead ones 
to life, and in hope of a better resurrection submitted to 



privations, persecutions and ignominious deaths, having faith in 
the promise of God to reward their loyalty to him and the grand 
principles of truth and righteousness, in due time. If God 
declares that a flood is coming and commands the building of an 
ark, the reasonable course is to build and to warn men, though 
the flood and every indication of it should tarry for a hundred 
and twenty years. When God commanded Abraham to sacrifice 
his son, it was reasonable for Abraham to comply, and to leave 
the fulfillment of the promises, which centered in that son, to 
God. When he commanded Lot to flee out of Sodom, it was 
reasonable for Lot to make haste and depart, though the morning 
was gloriously fair. 

These were commendable acts of simple, child- like, implicit 
faith. But observe that in every instance of faith commended in 
the Bible, there was good ground for faith: there was a clear 
command of God, a well defined principle of truth and 
righteousness; and no foolish imaginations or vague impressions 
were blindly followed. How foolish Noah would have been to 
spend a hundred and twenty years building an ark and warning 
the people, if he had only imagined that a flood was coming. 
How culpable Abraham would have been in laying his son on 
the altar of sacrifice, had he only imagined God desired him to 
do so. And how simple Lot would have been to run out of 
Sodom that bright morning declaring that the city would be 
destroyed, if he had no positive information of it. 

But notice that in each instance of unusual requirement God 
gave clear evidence of his will, either by an angel, a vision, or 
some remarkable circumstance —ways, however, which are not 
now necessary since the completed Scriptures of the Old and 
New Testaments form a perfect guide to faith (2 Tim. 3:15-17), 
and which, therefore, are not now resorted to. And in the 
instances of suffering and martyrdom cited, God's will was 
clearly expressed in the principles of truth and righteousness 
which he ordained. These illustrations should be specially 
marked by very many who claim wonderful faith in God, when 
the chief wonderment about it is their ability to believe so much 
on so slight a foundation. 

In many enterprises, too, undertaken under the name of works of 
faith, and successfully carried on financially, faith has a better 
foundation in the sympathies of philanthropic people, than in the 
plan, methods and promises of God. If Christian people make 
public statements that they are starting a benevolent enterprise 
for the amelioration of the present woes of suffering humanity, 
they may do it with a large degree of faith in the support of 
benevolent people; even the worldly are often fully as active in 
these directions as Christians-for instance, mark the responses 
to calls for help in great calamities and disasters. 

Success in these directions of popular benevolence we do not 
regard as proofs 



R1159:page6 

of remarkable faith in God, though those so engaged are doing 
good works, and public appeals for assistance in such work are 
right and proper, under some circumstances at least. A far more 
remarkable manifestation of faith in God is that humble 
confidence which espouses his unpopular cause, which 
perseveres in pursuing it in the face of all opposition and 
without human encouragement, and which patiently endures 
whatever of reproach, discouragement, privation, and even 
persecution it may bring, assured of ultimate triumph according 
to his promise, and finding in his blessed truth and in his 
approval all the present reward and incentive desired. 

One expression of the Apostle Paul should not be forgotten 
among us: It reads, "Hast thou faith? have it to thyself." (Rom. 
14:22.) If we advertise our faith and our needs and thus make 
capital out of them by eliciting the sympathies and assistance of 
men, it is not resting in God to a very great extent; and such 
soon make manifest to observing Christians that they are 
endeavoring to be pleasers of men. There is much in the way of 
profession of great faith and in the relating of really improper 
proceedings and their results as wonderful feats of faith, which 
often does great harm to both speakers and hearers. 

While a true faith is pleasing to God, what often passes for faith 
among Christians must be correspondingly displeasing to him. 
Many, without careful observation and study of God's ways, 
jump at hasty conclusions, often greatly out of harmony with the 
spirit of divine truth, and acting and teaching accordingly, 
dishonor the Lord and bring reproach upon his cause. Among 
such, too, are often found the loudest boasters of faith. Their 
faith is so strong, so rooted and grounded and established in 
what God did not say, that they have no inclination to hear or 
heed what he did say. In such instances God would be honored 
far more by the sealing of the lips. Rather let our faith be 
expressed to God, and let our confidence be manifest to him; 
and to our brethren let it be manifested more by faithfulness in 
his service than by words. Thus was the faith of the ancient 
worthies attested. Where is boasting then? It is excluded by the 
law of faith. (Rom. 3:27.) The very nature of pure, true faith is 
opposed to boastfulness. In fact, a humble, faithful walking with 
God excludes every mean disposition, and elevates the character 
far beyond them. 

Let us endeavor to have more of that pure, true faith 

Which bears unmoved the world's dark frown, 
Nor heeds its scornful smile; 
Which seas of trouble cannot drown, 
Nor Satan's arts beguile. 

- the faith which overcomes the world, and the spirit of the 
world in us, which will remove mountains of difficulty, and 



secure all that our hearts desire, since it is written, "Ye shall ask 
what ye will [our wills being in harmony with the will of God], 
and it shall be granted unto you. " 

When we see, thus, how reasonable a thing faith is, how God 
through his natural and written revelation of himself appeals to 
the highest faculty of our nature and bids us follow its leading 
and rest in and act upon its proper conclusions in studying his 
works and ways, we realize truly that without faith in him and in 
his reasonable revelation of himself, in nature and through his 
apostles and prophets, it is impossible to please him; because we 
have here a broad and firm foundation for faith.

AN ALLEGORY. 



I sat down in my arm-chair, weary with my work; my toil had 
been severe and protracted. The church wore an aspect of thrift 
and prosperity; and joy and hope and courage were the 
prevailing sentiments on every hand. As for myself, I was 
joyous in my work; my brethren were united; my sermons and 
exhortations were evidently telling on my hearers; my church 
was crowded with listeners; the whole community was more or 
less moved with the prevailing excitement; and so the work 
went on. I had been led into exhausting labors for its promotion. 

Tired with my work, I soon lost myself in a sort of half forgetful 
state, though I seemed fully aware of my place and 
surroundings. Seemingly a stranger entered the room, without 
any preliminary tap, or "Come in. " I saw in his face benignity, 
intelligence and weight of character; but though he was passably 
well attired, he carried suspended about his person measures and 
chemical agents and implements, which gave him a very strange 
appearance. 

The stranger came toward me, and extending his hand said, 
"How is your zeal?" 

I supposed, when he began his question, that the query was to be 
for my health; but was pleased to hear his final word; for I was 
quite well pleased with my zeal, and doubted not the stranger 
would smile when he should know its proportions. Instinctively 
I conceived of it as a physical quantity, and putting my hand into 
my bosom, brought it forth and presented it to him for 
inspection. 

He took it, and placing it in his scale, weighed it carefully. I 
heard him say, "One hundred pounds !" 

I could scarce suppress an audible note of satisfaction; but I 
caught his earnest look as he noted down the weight; and I saw 



at once that he had drawn no final conclusion, but was intent on 
pushing his investigation. 

He broke the mass to atoms, put it in his crucible, and put the 
crucible into the fire. When the mass was thoroughly fused, he 
took it out, and set it down to cool. It congealed in cooling, and 
when turned out on the hearth, exhibited a series of layers or 
strata; which all at the touch of the hammer fell apart, and were 
severally tested and weighed; the stranger making minute notes, 
as the process went on. 

When he had finished, he presented the notes to me, and gave 
me a look of mingled sorrow and compassion, as, without a 
word, except, "May God save you ! " he left the room. 

I opened the note and read as follows: 

"Analysis of the zeal of Junius, a candidate for a crown of 
glory: weight, in mass, 100 lbs., of which, on analysis, there 
proves to be, viz.:— 

Bigotry 10 parts 
Personal ambition 23 parts 
Pride of talent 14 parts 
Love of praise 19 parts 
Pride of denomination 15 parts 
Love of authority 12 parts 
Love of God 4 parts 
Love of man 3 parts 

I had become troubled at the peculiar manner of the stranger, 
and especially, at his parting look and words; but when I looked 
at the figures my heart sank as lead within me. I made a mental 
effort to dispute the correctness of the record, but was suddenly 
startled into a more honest mood by an audible sigh, almost a 
groan, from the stranger, who had paused in the hall, and by a 
sudden darkness falling upon me, by which the record became at 
once obscured and nearly illegible. I suddenly cried out, "Lord, 
save me!" 

I knelt down at my chair, with the paper in my hand, and my 
eyes fixed upon it. At once it became a mirror, and I saw my 
heart reflected in it:— The record is true!-I saw it; I felt it; I 
confessed it; I deplored it; and I besought God, with many tears, 
to save me from myself: and, at length, with a loud and 
irrepressible cry of anguish, I awoke.— Selected. 



Since all of Gods consecrated saints are his ambassadors, 
ministers of his truth, and members of the royal priesthood, this 
allegory may be of profit to all. Love of God and love of our 
fellow-men are the only elements of real zeal in the above 
analysis. All the other parts are detestable dross in God's sight 
and will be in ours, as we take God's standpoint of criticism. Let 



each servant who desires to stand approved of God, examine his 
own heart, analyze his own zeal, his own motives. 



R1159:page6 

THE CLEARER VISION. 

I have often remarked to my friends on the wonderful change 
that took place in my mind immediately after hearing the "good 
tidings"-after being shown the narrow way to life in the gospel 
age, and the restitution of all things in the age now dawning. To 
compare great things with small, I will illustrate it by another 
life-experience. 

It was my lot to be endowed with power of vision far from 
perfect— with eyes that were "near-sighted." How much pleasure 
I lost because of this, I could not tell. I knew there were distant 
beauties spread before me which from this cause I could but 
poorly appreciate, and that the delicate features, the intricate 
combinations and the nice details of nearer objects were lost to 
my eyes. 

But there came a change. A few years ago for the first time I 
used glasses to aid the eyes. What a transformation! O happy 
change! That which was beautiful before had now an added 
charm, and 

R1160:page6 

what was gloomy, dim, obscure, now stood out in such clearness 
that it seemed a new world was around me, or I a new being, 
that I could thus behold it. 

Now, all these years, what was mental vision showing me? Oh! 
some perplexing scenes. I looked across the way and saw a 
family whose future lot I vainly tried to trace. The father was 
profane, passionate, unkind. The mother was uncultured, 
overburdened with cares, little inclined and almost wholly unfit 
to train the children under her care. They were wayward and 
disobedient. Anger, contention, unkindness, marked their daily 
life; and self-denial, peace, gentleness, were virtues unknown. 
Observation taught that likely these children would come to 
dishonor, unhappy marriage, law-breaking —some of the many 
forms of sin or 

R1160:page7 

crime, with all their bitterness and pain. I could not see further, 
but many whose vision was thought clear declared that for this 
earthly life of evil there was a fearful condemnation-that for 
these who were reared in ignorance, lived in misery, and died in 
shame, there was punishment inexpressible and endless, 
prepared by their Creator, and awaiting them. I could not see, 
but many told me this. 



Down the street, in a home of elegance, lived a very different 
family. Pride, haughtiness, love of wealth and honors pervaded 
all things there. The daughter gave herself up to the frivolities of 
fashion, and was found in the ball-room rather than in the house 
of worship. The son chose the pleasures of the gaming table, the 
race course and the club room. Finally he brought woe and 
shame upon all, for in his passion he slew a man. For the crime 
he died on the scaffold, and thus two lives went out early, in 
darkness and unfitness for future happiness. 

An aged widow, whose life was one of faith and good works, 
ceased not to plead with God that some of her children who 
were unconverted might be brought into the fold before death 
came to them, lest while part of her dear ones attained the 
endless bliss of heaven some would be consigned to unutterable, 
endless anguish. 

All things showed that humanity was borne down by an awful 
burden of sin, while it was required of them, "Without holiness 
no man shall see the Lord." The most thoughtful might well ask, 
"Is life worth living? Oh! who shall deliver us from this death?" 

The zeal which once warmed my heart to serve the Lord had 
given way to stoical determination to try to do right and abide 
the consequences. Not only "I craved what the world never 
gave, " but I sought for what the churches had not to offer. To 
me a guiding hand was sent by God, lifting the veil that had 
shrouded the pages of His Word, pointing me to the "good 
tidings of great joy. " 

I saw how the world is learning the exceeding sinfulness of sin; 
that being saved from the prison of death by Him who "gave 
himself a ransom for all," when they "come again from the land 
of the enemy" they may know, and fear and shun the way of 
evil; that "as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made 
alive;" and that the dark problem of human misery finds solution 
in the day now being ushered in by the dark hour before the 
dawn-the day when "the earth shall be filled with the 
knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea. " 

Now, for the first time, I saw not only that justification by faith 
in the ransom of Jesus saves from the penalty in the coming age, 
but that to consecrate and sacrifice our justified lives to do the 
will of God leads, during the Gospel age, to a higher life, 
spiritual, divine, immortal. 

O reader, rejoice with me that having gained the standpoint of 
belief in "the restitution of all things," the providence of God in 
the past and his written plan for the coming age are seen in 
matchless harmony. Rejoice with me that He has "opened our 
eyes, that we may behold wondrous things out of His law. "

CHRISTIAN INFLUENCE. 

There is no preaching of the truth more forcible than the silent 
influence of a consistent Christian character, bearing in richness 
and luxuriousness the fruits of the Spirit, which are love, joy, 
peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, fidelity, meekness, and 
self-control. And no preaching of the truth, however eloquent, 
reasonable, and logical, is likely to be productive of results to 
the glory of God, if not backed by the silent yet potent influence 
of a consistent Christian life. 

Here is a way of preaching the gospel which may be measurably 
overlooked by some who are anxious to do more active service 
in the cause we love. Let us not forget that golden opportunities 
lie all about us. Ye are indeed living epistles, known and read of 
all men. Our families, our relatives, our neighbors, are judging 
of the truth by its effects upon us. Let us not forget this for a 
moment. We must be transparent and let the light of God's truth 
shine through all our doings.

OUR LORD'S AGE AT BAPTISM 
AND HIS PRE-EXISTENCE. 

Central Falls, R.I. 

BRO. C. T. RUSSELL;-In MILLENNIAL DAWN, Vol. II., on 
page 66, 1 find the following- "Which was at thirty years, 
according to the Law, under which he was born and to which he 
and every Jew was subject. " Please show me— where the law is 
recorded that required Jesus or any prophet, priest, or Levite, to 
submit to the rite of immersion before beginning his office 
work. 

Again, on page 107, last paragraph and ending on page 108, 
"Was made flesh." If Jesus of Nazareth was a pre-existent being, 
personally present with the Father ages before the creation of the 
world, how can he be the promised seed of the woman, who is to 
crush the serpent's head? 

Perhaps you will answer through the TOWER. Yours in hope of 
speedy redemption, bought by the Woman's Seed. 

R. L. J . 



DEAR BROTHER:-I see that you do not get the idea in the 
sentence to which you refer, on page 66, Vol. n. The passage 
reads thus:-"He was anointed with the holy spirit immediately 
on coming out of the water. This was when he had attained 
manhood's estate, which was at thirty years, according to the 



Law, under which he was born, and to which he and every Jew 
was subject, until he ended its dominion by fulfilling its 
conditions- nailing it to his cross. " The claim here is simply that 
at the age of thirty years a man was considered of age, according 
to the law of God under which all Israel was placed. 

No Levite was permitted to engage in the work of the tabernacle 
under thirty. (See Num. 4:3.) And so Christ did not begin the 
work of the antitypical tabernacle (the work of atonement) until 
he was thirty. (Luke 3:23.) Our Lord then symbolized his 
consecration by immersion, but not because he or any other Jew 
was commanded to do so. He there instituted this simple 
ceremony as a fitting symbol of his consecration even unto 
death, and his faith in Jehovah's power to raise him out of death. 

It is uncertain at just what time immersion was instituted as a 
symbol of repentance and reform. John the Baptist used it thus, 
and it is claimed followed a custom, for some time in vogue 
among Jewish reformers. Our Lord Jesus, however, gave 
immersion a wider and a deeper meaning than any other teacher 
when he, with no sins to repent of or to reform from, was 
immersed. It there came to be the symbol of entire consecration 
to God's will; a symbol of death in God's service and of a 
resurrection reward— a symbol of the death of human self-will 
and of the beginning of a life entirely conformed to the will of 
God. 

With reference to your last question- "How could the pre- 
existent one be the promised seed of the woman?"— permit me to 
suggest that whether you or I can understand how, or not, if we 
have faith in God's Word, we must admit the fact. There are 
many facts the philosophy of which we cannot understand, as 
for instance, the growth and development of plant and animal 
life. We cannot understand the philosophy of the first creation, 
nor of the resurrection, the new creation. There are some facts, 
you see, which are beyond the scope of human reasoning. That 
our Lord had a pre-existence, we are most positively assured by 
the following scriptures:— John 6:38, "I came down from heaven, 
not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. " Verse 
51, "I am the living bread which came down from heaven. " 
Verses 61,62, "Jesus said unto them, Doth this offend you? 
What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was 
before?" John 8:14,23,42,54,55, "I know whence I came and 
whither I go.... I am from above, I am not of this world;... I 
proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, 
but he sent me. ...It is my Father that honoreth me, and if I 
should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar. " 

"Then said the Pharisees, Art thou greater than our father 
Abraham? Jesus answered, Your father Abraham rejoiced to see 
my day, and he saw it and was glad. Then said the Jews unto 
him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen 
Abraham? (who had been dead 2000 years). Jesus said unto 



them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I 
am." John 8:53,56-58. See also John 17:5, "And now, O Father, 
glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had 
with thee before the world was." Here he only asked to be 
restored to what he was before; but the Father, in rewarding his 
obedience even unto death, "highly exalted him, " far beyond 
that previous glory. See also 2 Cor. 8:9; Phil. 2:7; Rev. 1:8; 
3:14; 21:6; 22:13 and Col. 1:15-17. 

The Scriptures are also clear in their testimony that he was "the 
seed of the woman," of which you are convinced. And since the 
facts are established on God's authority, the how is to us a minor 
matter. If you have the TOWER for Sept. 1885 notice article 
"The Undefiled One. " I think it will help you. Our supply of this 
number is exhausted, but we hope to treat the subject in all its 
revealed and its reasonable phases in DAWN, Vol. IV. 



R1160:page7 

ISRAEL'S "DOUBLE." 

A Brother who has been reading DAWN, VOL. II., and who 
sees clearly that much of the strength of the argument in Chapter 
VII. -Parallel Dispensations— lies in the word "double," raises a 
question the answer to which may interest and strengthen others. 
We, therefore, give below the question and our answer to it. 

He asks: "Is there any danger of mistake in your method of 
applying the word 'double.' Perhaps we should begin to count 
Israel's favor at the time of their deliverance from Egypt. Can it 
be said that Israel was in favor while suffering under the task- 
masters of Egypt? If not, would not this cut short their 
dispensation of favor 198 years (the period from Jacob's death to 
the coming of Israel out of bondage —out of Egypt, as you show 
it, vol. ii., p. 231), and leave it only 1647 years long instead of 
1845? But then, if we begin Israel's national career and favor at 
the Exodus, we must still admit the turning point of their history 
was at the rejection of Christ, and as you so clearly show (vol. 
ii., p. 225) the very day that he rode to Jerusalem on the ass, five 
days before the crucifixion, is marked by the prophet as the date 
when the second part of their 'double' began. And if the first half 
of their 'double' was only 1647 years long, the other half must be 
the same; which would make their double end 1647 years after 
A.D. 33, that is, in A.D. 1680. But here I meet the difficulty that 
nothing in the nature of events to be expected at the end of their 
double occurred in 1680. Divine favor did not return to Israel 
and the fullness of the Gentiles (the end of the Gospel call) did 
not occur there. 

"In a word, I am all mixed up. I have nothing regarding the 
'double' to suggest myself— no reasonable or Scriptural solution 



to offer. And I have no fault to find with your applications and 
deductions, except the one point first stated, viz.: I cannot see 
how the first half of Israel's national experience from the death 
of Jacob to the death of Christ, 1 845 years, was wholly either a 
period of chastisement or a period of favor. Can you straighten 
me out and show me where my difficulty lies? If you can, I will 
be thankful, as I prize the forcible and blessed conclusions of 
this chapter on the Parallel Dispensations greatly, and wish to 
have the subject clear." 

Our reply may be brief; not much is necessary. The question is 
well stated and shows that the Brother has well digested the 
subject. We wish that all readers were as earnest and as 
thorough in their examination of these great subjects, that their 
faith might rest in the Word of God. We can help the Brother. 
We see just where he misses his footing, and it is an error very 
common to God's children against which all should studiously 
guard. The Brother has erred in reading into the Word of God, 
and into the DAWN account, something about the "double" 
which neither the DAWN nor God's Word say about it. Neither 
the DAWN nor the Bible anywhere say that the "double" was 
either a double of chastisement or a double of favor, nor that one 
half was of favor and the other half of chastisement. It is merely 
a time "double," regardless of the favors and disfavors, the 
chastisements and blessings they experience during their 
"double" time. 

Get the thought: Israel as a nation at the death of Jacob became 
heirs of a promise, the Abrahamic promise; and under its 
provisions they expected a great personage to arise among them 
who, under special, divine favor, would become the great ruler 
of earth; who would more or less use them, his own nation, in 
subduing all things unto himself; and they expected thus, also, a 
share in his glory and influence as his special family nation. 
They clung more or less to this hope through centuries, and as 
Moses arose and did great things for them and yet died telling 
them that the great one was yet to come, and that his 
achievements for them were merely typical representations of 
the greater work of the coming Messiah (Deut. 18:15); as Joshua 
and Samuel and Saul and David and Solomon in turn passed 
away, we can see that the question with them must have been a 
question of time. When will God's time come for the 
establishment of the Messianic Kingdom so long promised and 
hoped for? This time came at the first advent, in one sense, 
when Messiah offered himself to his own nation and sent his 
disciples among them with the message, "The Time is at Hand- 
believe the good news [gospel] and repent. " And when their 
national trial and sifting ended unfavorably to them, and the 
Master, as their King mounted on the ass, exclaimed, "Your 
house is left unto you desolate"— 

R1160:page8 



there the opportunity of furnishing the Messiah with a Bride 
class of joint-heirs, a complete Cabinet for the promised 
kingdom, passed from that nation; their worthy ones were 
accepted, but did not fill the fore-ordained number which God 
has since been completing by selections from among all nations. 

Since Israel was unprepared to furnish Messiah a complete 
cabinet of faithful ones, and since he would not set up his 
kingdom until his cabinet or Bride is complete, therefore Israel 
as a nation must wait for its promised and longed-for share of 
work and honor, under Messiah. How long a time must they 
wait because of their failure to have ready a prepared people, fit 
for joint-heirship with Messiah? God through the prophet 
answers, I will render unto you double because of your sins. 
Shout O daughter of Zion, behold thy King cometh unto thee- 
(but God, foreseeing his rejection, except by the few, causes the 
prophet to continue) Even to-day do I declare it — I will render 
unto you double: You must now wait as long again. 

R1161 : page 8 

With this thought of the "double" referring to nothing but 
duration, time, waiting, read again carefully the chapter entitled 
Parallel Dispensations, and you will have no difficulty. The fact 
that God has shown Israel no favor during the last half of their 
"double," and the fact that he foretold that it should be so, has 
nothing to do with the double of time. It is not a double time of 
favor, nor a double time of disfavor, but simply and only a 
double of time;— waiting for the promised kingdom. 



R1161 : page 8 

THE PLOWMAN SHALL 
OVERTAKE THE REAPER. 

"Behold the days come, saith the Lord, that the plowman shall 
overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth 
seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills 
shall melt."-Amos 9:13. 

What a wonderful day is this Day of the Lord. During the long 
centuries of the Gospel age the appointed work of the age has 
been steadily and quietly progressing; the message of salvation 
and the high calling have gone forth; the called who have 
heeded and answered the call have been tried, disciplined, 
developed and tested, and one by one laid to rest until the 
appointed time for the gathering and rewarding of the whole 
body of the Anointed. And while in the midst of a crooked and 
perverse generation the body of the Anointed has been 
developing, evil has been permitted to flourish and to exalt and 
spread itself, while the (embryo) kingdom of heaven has 
suffered violence. Tares have been permitted to overrun and 



almost take possession of the wheat-field, and the mystery of 
iniquity has wonderfully developed and prospered. By sure and 
steady steps, and unhindered by divine interference, the powers 
of darkness have strongly entrenched themselves, and have long 
been regarded, both by themselves and all mankind, as 
immovably fixed. 

But now the Day of the Lord has come. Earth's rightful King 
takes his great power and begins his reign, while yet the powers 
of darkness hold their places- "In the days of these kings, shall 
the God of heaven set up a kingdom" (Dan. 2:44) -and the two 
cannot long stand together. Already the thrones of earth tremble 
to their very foundations; the kings of the earth set themselves 
and the rulers take counsel together, and statesmen and thinking 
men in general begin to realize that a strange, strong power is at 
work in every direction. All organizations, whether civil, social, 
or religious, however old, or wealthy, or formerly esteemed 
among men, feel the disturbing shock of a mighty tread hitherto 
unknown. It is none other than the Son of God, under whose 
power all must shortly fall, and above their ruins shall be 
established his own glorious kingdom. 

True to every jot of prophecy concerning this day are the events 
as they now transpire. The harvesting began with the presence of 
the Lord of the harvest (in 1874), who at once began to appoint 
and direct the reapers, sending them forth with the sharp sickle 
of truth. Wonderful has been the work since that time. While the 
church nominal has been sinking lower and lower in the mire of 
worldliness, the saints, the true wheat, are being gathered out of 
her and fed and strengthened and set to work among the 
harvesters; and thus the Lord of the harvest is daily sending 
forth more laborers into his vineyard. The saints are seeing their 
privilege, hearing and heeding the Master's directions, and 
taking hold with a hearty good will, and the results of their 
labors are even now largely apparent. 

As a result of the united labors of the consecrated ones in 
hundreds of ways, as varied as are their circumstances and 
talents, hundreds of cases come under our own observation, of 
saints who are encouraged, strengthened and stimulated to make 
their election sure, of backsliders reclaimed, of worldly people 
turned to God, and of honest skeptics now established in the true 
faith of the gospel. 

While the harvest work goes steadily forward, we need but to 
cast our eyes about us, when we see another portion of the work 
going on preparatory to the speedy establishment of the 
Redeemer's kingdom. Not only is the harvesting of the fruit of 
the Gospel age being accomplished, 

R1162:page8 



but the plowing and seed sowing for the Millennial season is 
already begun, as foretold by the prophet— "Behold the days 
come that the plowman shall overtake the reaper." 

Various agencies are now at work plowing the field— which is 
the world-and preparing men's hearts for the reception of the 
truth. And many of the poor, distracted world, even now, show a 
willingness to receive a little of the balm and consolation which 
the truth affords. 

The troubles coming upon the world and upon the nominal 
church, the distracting questions that are stirring up thought, and 
the opposing forces that are everywhere developing, are already 
doing the plowing; and these plowers are close upon the heels of 
the reapers now reaping the harvest of the Gospel age-gathering 
God's elect together; and soon the treader of grapes (the forces 
engaged in the final combat) shall overtake the sowers of the 
seed of truth; and the great trouble will close the door of all 
opportunity for either seed-sowing or harvesting. 

But though such is the calamitous outlook for the near future, 
there will be a blessed outcome to its short work; for in the 
midst of it the mountain (kingdom) of the Lord's house shall be 
established and shall be exalted above the melting hills 
(kingdoms) of the old dominions; and its blessed re-invigorating 
influence is significantly referred to in the prophet's statement - 
the mountains shall drop sweet wine.

DAWNS IN CLOTH BINDING. 

AT A SPECIAL PRICE TO TOWER READERS. 

Many TOWER readers, deeply interested in MILLENNIAL 
DAWN, are among the poor of this world, and have not, 
heretofore, felt that they could afford to purchase the various 
volumes in the more substantial cloth binding. We propose to 
help over this difficulty by hereafter supplying all TOWER 
readers the cloth bound books at 50 cents a copy, postage free. 
This rate will apply to Vols. I. and II. in English, and Vol. I. in 
German. Order all you want of these and have something 
substantial for your own reading, for reference and for loaning 
to neighbors. 

The price to the public will remain as heretofore $1.00 per copy; 
at which rate DAWN is as good value as any book of its kind, 
surely. 

The public, if they choose, may subscribe to the TOWER for a 
year (50 cents) and one volume of the books (50 cents), and thus 
obtain both for the price of a book alone.

CONCERNING THE GERMAN TOWER. 

During the past four years, by the assistance of Brother Zech as 
translator, we have published a small sized TOWER in the 
German language; chiefly translations from the English edition. 
We published quantities of these and scattered them through the 
mails-probably 200,000 copies or more. The result has been the 
finding of here and there some German friends who could not 
read English who gladly received the truth in their own 
language. For the sake of these also Vol. I. of DAWN was 
translated into German and published in both cloth and paper 
binding, also German translations of the Arp Tract. 

We feel that we have done what we can for our German- 
speaking brethren and sisters, and hence have discontinued the 
German Tower. We will still, however, supply the German 
translation of DAWN, Vol. I., and of the Arp slips. The former 
at same prices as the English edition; the latter free, to all who 
will circulate them judiciously. 

THE HARVEST SICKLE. 

This (in German, Die Ernte-Sichel) is the name of a new paper 
in the German language, designed to take the place of the 
German Tower; but it is much larger, and the price will be 50 



cents per year. It is under the control of Brother Zech, and 
proposes following the same lines of truth that the TOWER has 
all along pursued, pointing out the way of the cross— the 
ransom— as the only way to God, to everlasting life and joys. 

We bid the Harvest Sickle God speed: as the successor of the 
German Tower, may it be still more successful in turning many 
to righteousness and the Truth and Love and Grace of our God- 
out of darkness into his marvelous light.

VIEW FROM THE TOWER. 

KNOWLEDGE INCREASED AND ITS RESULTS. 

-CONTINUED FROM OCTOBER.- 

On the other hand, it is well to remember that in our present 
imperfect condition, all, no matter how honest, or how anxious 
for the truth, are liable to fall into erroneous views, and to see 
only one side of a subject. We have been looking at the falsity of 
that view which would make a few men, and not because of 
special mental or physical qualification, rulers and masters, 
landlords and kings over others because of a supposed 
birthright. Let us now notice the other side of the question, 
which we will introduce by what to Americans will seem, at first 
glance, an astonishing statement, viz., that all men are not born 
free and equal. 

No one can dispute that the many more or less bound by 
ignorance and superstition are far from full freedom. And no 
man can look about him, thoughtfully, and not admit that the 
common view, that all men are equal, is a gross error. All men 
have not an equal amount of physical strength. So far from all 
being equal, it might be said that no two men are exact equals. 
Nor can it be said that men are equal in the sense of the qualities 
of one being an offset or equivalent to the different qualities of 
another. As a matter of fact, brain and muscle are not separate 
and independent; some have very little of either power and 
hence are very far from the equals of those who have 
considerable of either or of both. 

If we could suppose two men, one all physical power and the 
other all brain power, we could not class them as equals; for the 
former certainly is far inferior to the latter. The lower animals 
have muscle; and machinery, steam and electricity, under brain 
direction, can do much and sometimes more than muscle can do. 



Hence muscle must and should be servant to brain. It always has 
been, it always should be, and it always will be inferior and 
subjected. 

How many men have the muscular ability to wheel or cart a 
piece of iron who have not the additional ability and intelligence 
necessary to hammer it to shape, and to size and temper it for its 
work? How many of the latter lack the education and inherited 
mental talent or ability to plan, design and arrange the sizes, 
shapes and strength of those irons for bridges, buildings, 
shippings, etc.? This is a still higher order of intelligence and 
skill, and requires more educational preparation. Does all this 
persistent study and natural ability count for naught? Is this 
successful architect or engineer only the equal of the intelligent 
iron- worker, and of the non-intelligent laborer? Similar 
comparisons could be instituted between all brain- workers and 
all muscle- workers; and while there are drones and slovens in 
each field of labor, it cannot be disputed that those who have 
largest mental capacity and who develop it by application- by 
study and use— are quite the superiors of those who have less of 
it, even though the latter have superior physical strength. 

(On just one subject does this rule fail; that is in religious 
matters-in an appreciation of the will and plan of God. This is 
beyond human wisdom,— it is a matter of revelation; and the 
more humble the man the easier for him to be "taught of God." 
Hence, not many great, not many wise, not many learned make 
greatest progress in the divine knowledge. We do not in this, 
either, disparage mental ability and culture-on the contrary, 
these will be very helpful and will increase the ability as 
servants of the truth, provided they are backed by humility and 
consecration, which will enable such to be like him who was 
meek and lowly of heart, and to learn of him. We would merely 
point out here that mental capacity plays a different part in the 
religion of Christ from what it does in the worldly affairs of 
men. God himself has the mental capacity for carrying out his 
own plans; and to become his children, at present, requires only 
so much mental capacity as to be able to understand and accept 
his testimony, and to will to act accordingly. But with such a 
consecration to God, and with such humility and teachableness 
of mind, the more brain capacity the better; -the greater the 
appreciation the greater the service, and the greater the joy-but 
only in proportion; for the capacity for appreciation, the capacity 
for service and the capacity for joy are proportionate.) 

There are two mental qualities which often fail of popular 
appreciation, because they are more of natural gifts than the 
results of education; and because, as result of this, many with 
very slight education are among the most successful in them. 
We refer (1) to the mental quality exhibited in planning and 
invention and construction, which make some men (often 
without education) inventors and constructors of articles of great 



advantage to mankind; and (2) to those other, but somewhat 
similar mental gifts, but with other mental combinations, which 
constitute business talent, exhibited in men whose genius is seen 
not in the constructing and organizing of machinery, but in the 
construction, organization and successful operation of extensive 
works and commercial enterprises which furnish to hundreds of 
fellow-men (laborers, tradesmen, architects, engineers, 
overseers, book and time keepers, etc., etc.) steady and 
remunerative employment. 

Without the mechanical inventors and contrivers with their 
peculiar mental talent, the world would be without its 
telephones, telegraphs, railroads, steamboats, and ten thousand 
other conveniences which go to make our day so far superior to 
the days of water-power and ox-teams. It is, therefore, to the 
advantage of the whole world that we say to these who have 
such talent-We will give you a patent right to the product of 
your genius for a period of years. We will not rob you, but will 
protect and pay you for the fruit of your genius and of your 
hours and perhaps years of patient study and labor. This is 
presumed to be a just compensation, with the understanding that 
at the expiration of that time the invention or discovery shall 
belong to the public. Surely this is but a just recognition of the 
inventor's rights; and the expedience of thus doing justice has 
been manifested in the great increase of inventions which it has 
helped to stimulate. 

And mankind is similarly indebted to the constructive, inventive 
and organizing skill manifested by the manufacturers and 
financiers of the world. They, too, are inventors and 
constructors, but in a different line. Instead of thinking out 
mechanical combinations which will give beneficial results, 
these have that peculiar and excellent talent of bringing together, 
combining and co-operating for the general good, machinery 
and muscle-workers and brain-workers. This talent is really and 
rightly the master quality among men; because it is the one upon 
which the amalgamation and co-operation of society depends. It 
is this quality which in another field constitutes the real 
statesman. 

We do not claim that this ability is always directed in 
accordance with the golden rule; but neither is that of the artisan 
and others. Nor do we claim that they organize men, and plan 
and arrange great enterprises, and invent ways and 

R1162:page2 

means of accomplishing great results, from the purely 
benevolent motive of giving steady and profitable employment, 
and thus many of the comforts of life, to thousands who have 
not that organizing and executive talent. Nor will any one claim 
that laborers, artisans, farmers, attorneys and others are laboring 
daily and hourly 



R1163:page2 

from purely benevolent motives. We do not question that 
financial ability is sometimes misused to the public injury, in 
wrecking corporations financially, for individual gain; but is the 
same not true in other lines? Do not laborers sometimes use their 
muscles contrary to the public good? Do not inventors plan 
contrivances for war, etc., which bring death and sorrow to 
thousands— consequences a thousand fold more injurious than 
the financial wrecking of a railroad? And do not mechanical 
engineers and artisans, clerks and attorneys, help forward the 
work of constructing the evil, death-dealing machines, etc.? And 
no one can deny that all do it for the same end— from selfishness, 
from greed of gain. 

It must, however, be conceded that notwithstanding their talent 
is sometimes misused like those of other men, there is no class 
more valuable to the world than its merchants and 
manufacturers. No other talents among men are so essential to 
financial prosperity as their inventiveness, and organizing 
ability. Without theirs, all mechanical inventions and discoveries 
would be mere theories and suppositions, not put into practice: 
we would have no railroads, no steamships, no telegraphs, no 
telephones, no sewing machines, no harvesting machines, —no 
machines of any kind. Hence, without this class the world would 
have few of the luxuries it now possesses. Nay, more, we hold 
that, if men possessed of this commonly called "business talent" 
were all to die to-day, within three years telegraphs, railroads, 
mills, etc., would be bankrupt and stopped; and while the barns 
of the West would be overflowing with grain the cities of the 
East would be starving and idle. 

The instructions of the Scriptures, though given to the church, 
are often applicable to the world in general. For instance, we can 
apply to the world our Lord's words to the church— "He who 
would be greatest among you, let him become servant of all. " As 
the church is to esteem and honor its members according to their 
ability and usefulness as servants to the whole body, so with 
mankind in general: in the world each person should be 
esteemed and honored in proportion as he has and uses his 
abilities, and in proportion as these are important and useful to 
mankind in general. The Apostle Paul expressed the same 
thought, when he said, Esteem them very highly for their works' 
sake (even though there be other qualities or weaknesses which 
you may neither admire nor endorse); and, "Render, therefore, to 
all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom 
custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor."— Rom. 13:7. 

But should not the manufacturer divide up with the skilled 
laborers, mechanics, etc., each year or each month whatever 
profits he may realize? We answer, No; no more than the skilled 
mechanic who gets $5 per day should divide evenly with the 
day- laborer who receives $1.60, or with the boy who receives 



$1. To introduce such a policy, now, would be to strangle 
enterprise and stop the wheels of progress. The laborer would 
have no ambition to learn a trade or to prepare his children for a 
higher plane of usefulness in the world. The mechanic would 
lose ambition for proficiency, and would refuse to tax his 
energies and strain every resource to become a small 
manufacturer and by and by a greater one, if he had already a 
pro rata share of all profits without the care and difficulties, and 
without any share of losses, fear of panics, etc. 

But while the general public welfare and prosperity demand that 
each man shall have freedom to use whatever and all the talents 
he possesses, it has also the right to demand that those whose 
greater talents naturally give them greater power, shall deal 
justly by their fellow-creatures dependent upon them; exacting 
only reasonable hours of labor, providing reasonably healthful, 
comfortable and safe places of work, and paying at least living 
wages— even to the most illiterate and unskilled laborer. The 
public also has the right to prevent the strangling of healthful 
competition by the formation of gigantic trusts. And these things 
are done or are being done gradually but surely in this country; 
and if they could proceed for the future as in the past, society, 
under the influence of the increase of knowledge, would soon 
right and regulate itself. But one thing is lacking; and that one 
thing will, as the Scriptures show, ere long put an end to 
progress in the right direction, and instead of peace and safety, 
of which the world fondly dreams, will bring about the great 
trouble such as was not since there was a nation. That one thing 
is selfishness; and it hinders and will hinder both the parties of 
the coming conflict from recognizing each other's rights, and 
from granting freely even those which they do see. 

Selfishness includes approbativeness and pride as well as special 
self-care and disregard of others in other respects. Selfishness is 
now the ruling principle in the world. It is the opposite of the 
law of the New Covenant, which is love to God and to our 
fellow-men. Selfishness will lead and is leading the more able of 
men to abuse present increased knowledge and advantages by 
organizing selfish and powerful combinations, trusts, 
monopolies, etc., which will be grinding and oppressive upon 
the masses; who, in turn, governed by the same selfishness, 
under the same increase of knowledge, will seek and are seeking 
by means of labor organizations, laws, etc., to rule, and to 
tyrannize, and to dictate to capital and brains; in vanity claiming 
that they are fully the equals of any in ability, and merely not so 
favorably circumstanced. Here the struggle will come; and only 
the results will show clearly to the masses what we have here 
pointed out of the actual inequalities among men and the 
necessity on both sides for the mutual recognition of each other's 
rights and abilities. By means of this long foretold trouble the 
Lord will give the world a great and a lasting lesson, which will 
benefit all, and fit all for the kingdom which he will set up. 



The superiority of mind over muscle has long been recognized— 
and properly. Men have long realized that some of the race have 
fallen lower than others, and have admitted that those retaining 
the vigor of mind to the largest degree should be the rulers of the 
world. They see that it would be to the general interest of all that 
the ablest and wisest should have control. And taken as a whole 
(always excepting the Lord's true church, which the world has 
never known as such), the world has had its strongest, brightest 
and ablest men in power. And as a whole the ruling and 
aristocratic classes of to-day are in education and natural ability, 
as well as in time and opportunity, far superior to the average of 
the people for whom they make and execute laws. 

Why, then, do we find fault?-Because their wisdom and ability 
are used so selfishly —for their close family relatives, almost 
exclusively, and not for mankind in general, as one family. As 
shown (September and October Views) they have shaped the 
laws and customs of society for their own perpetuation as a 
class, and have turned all the streams of wealth and influence 
toward their own quarter. This condition of things, veiled by 
ignorance and superstition, was not realized by the masses in the 
past, nor is it clearly and fully realized yet; but knowledge is 
increasing, the heat and steam of public sentiment are rising, and 
something ere long must give way. This great explosion and 
revolution of society will precipitate the impending trouble, 
pointed out by the prophet as the great finale of sinful man's 
attempt at self-government. But above the ruins of present 
kingdoms the Kingdom of Christ will rise. 

But contrary to the expectations of some, this great government 
will be, not a republic, not a socialistic arrangement in any 
sense, but a monarchy. Nay, it will not even be a limited 
monarchy, but an imperial and autocratic one. Jehovah our God 
will be the Autocrat and his will shall be enforced in the earth; 
and all who will not gladly and heartily obey his righteous laws 
when granted ample knowledge and ability, shall be cut off- 
shall die the second death, have life forever extinguished. And 
there will be an aristocratic class then, too; a class whom the 
great Autocrat will exalt to power and great glory and 
distinction, and to whom he will commit the ordering of this 
world's terribly disordered affairs. This class is the Church of 
God, of whom Christ Jesus is Lord and Chief. All power will be 
claimed and exercised (Matt. 28:18; and Rev. 2:26; 11:17,18); 
and infallible laws will be rigorously enforced. Then every knee 
must bow and every tongue must confess. That will be the 
strictest government the world has ever known; absolutely no 
liberty will be granted to do wrong. 

If this kingdom were of the same character as present 
governments, operated upon the same selfish principles, it 
would be all the worse for the increase of power. But it will be 
based upon other principles. Not injustice and selfishness, but 



principles of justice and love will be the foundation of that 
throne. And backed, as it will be, by divine wisdom and power, 
good results, everlasting blessings, will result to the upright in 
heart. All its power and all the wisdom of its rulers will be 
exercised lovingly and justly, for the good of the fallen human 
family, for the elevation to perfection of all the willingly 
obedient; to the intent that when this Millennial reign of Christ 
is finished, all such being perfected may then be given the 
control of earth as kings or sovereigns in common, subject to 
God's general government-as in a limited republic the citizens 
of the several states arrange their own affairs subject to the laws 
and regulations of the general government;- while the 
disobedient, unworthy of life, shall be cut off from life in the 
second death. 

R1164:page2 

Thus the original dominion of earth, lost by Adam through sin 
and redeemed by Christ's ransom-sacrifice, is to be fully 
restored to such as shall be found worthy of it by their Redeemer 
in the close of his Millennial reign-God's due time. 

Only those who see God's plan of the ages can appreciate the 
care with which he is now selecting and disciplining every 
member of that "little flock" for the important positions and 
work of that kingdom -to be kings and priests unto God and to 
reign on the earth as joint-heirs with Jesus Christ their Lord. "A 
peculiar people" they will indeed be, very different from the 
haughty, proud, arrogant aristocracy of the present time. None 
of the proud and haughty (1 Pet. 5:5), and not many rich or great 
or noble hath God chosen, but the poor of the world, rich in faith 
and love and humility, to be joint-heirs with Christ in the 
coming kingdom. 

None of the candidates for these coming honors and 
opportunities of blessing the world need wonder, then, at the 
course of instruction, discipline and experience to which they 
are now subjected, as though some strange thing happened unto 
them. (1 Pet. 4:12.) But let them rejoice that they are counted 
worthy of the discipline and seek to make their calling and 
selection sure by permitting the promises and providences of 
God to work in them to will and to do his good pleasure. Let all 
such remember that love in them is to take the place of 
selfishness, otherwise they will be unfit for the coming glory 
and service. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is 
love. And hereby know we that we dwell in God and he in us, 
because he hath given us of his spirit -love.— 1 John 4:7-19. 

Verily, too, God is about to show the world the true and 
beneficial operation of the law of Primogeniture, which they 
borrowed in part from the typical characters and customs of Old 
Testament times and misapplied, to the world's enslavement and 
class exaltation. The Church of the FIRSTBORN (whose head is 



Christ Jesus, and whose members are the humble, faithful 
overcomers of the world and its spirit of selfishness,) is soon to 
have the entire inheritance, as well the land as the power and 
dominion, the glory and the honor. -Psa. 2:8; 1 Cor. 3:22,23; 
Rev. 21:7; Matt. 5:5. 

A happy day it will truly be, when God's little ones, his humble 
ones, his thoroughly tested ones, perfected in their new bodies 
like unto their Lord, shall become earth's aristocracy and rulers. 

O hail, happy day, that ends earth's tears and sorrows, 

That brings her joy without alloy; 

O hail, happy day! 

There peace shall wave her scepter high, 

And love's fair banner greet the eye, 

Proclaiming Victory! O hail, happy day! 

It is for this grand consummative development of God's plan of 
the ages that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain 
together until now, waiting [though ignorantly] for the 
manifestation of the sons of God, in whom all the families of the 
earth shall be blessed. And even we ourselves also [who hope to 
be those glorified sons] groan within ourselves, waiting [also, 
for the same glorious epoch] for the adoption, [or full 
introduction to the glories and honors of our Father, the King of 
kings, which according to his plan belong to us, the Bride of 
Christ, his firstborn, and heir according to his many exceeding 
great and precious promises], to wit the redemption of our [one] 
body, the body of Christ. -Compare Rom. 8:17-22,23; Gal. 
3:16,29. 

Primogeniture, then, as selfishly applied, and adapted by fallen 
men to selfish ends, serves to enslave and oppress and injure 
men. But primogeniture, as designed of God, and as he will use 
it in his great plan, operated upon the great bed-plate of love (the 
fullness of all law), will work the greatest good for all, and be 
the power of God and the wisdom of God unto human recovery- 
-unto deliverance from sin and death of all now "His people, " 
and all who shall become "His people. "

HE THAT SCATTERETH INCREASETH. 

Is thy cruise of comfort failing? 
Rise and share it with another, 
And through all the years of famine 
It shall serve thee and thy brother. 

Love divine will fill thy storehouse, 
Or thy handful still renew. 
Scanty fare for one will often 
Make a royal feast for two. 

For the heart grows rich in giving; 
All its wealth is living grain; 
Seeds which mildew in the garner, 
Scattered, fill with gold the plain. 

Is thy burden hard and heavy? 
Do thy steps drag wearily? 
Help to bear thy brother's burden, 
God will bear both it and thee. 

Numb and weary on the mountains, 
Wouldst thou sleep amidst the snow? 
Chafe that frozen form beside thee, 
And together both shall glow. 

Art thou stricken in life's battle? 
Many wounded round thee moan; 
Lavish on their wounds thy balsams, 
And that balm shall heal thine own. 

Is thy heart a well left empty? 
None but God its void can fill; 
Nothing but a ceaseless Fountain 
Can its ceaseless longings still. 

Is the heart a living power? 

Self entwined, its strength sinks low. 

It can only live in loving, 

And by serving love will grow. 



-Mrs. Charles.

PRESBYTERIAN CREED REVISION. 

"The wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the 
understanding of their prudent men shall be hid."— Isa. 29:14. 

The various Presbyteries of the United States are severally 
discussing pro and con the proposed revision of the Westminster 
Confession of Faith. The meeting of the New Brunswick (N.J.) 



Presbytery is one of the more notable, because it includes 
Princeton College, an institution under Presbyterian control. We 
extract the following from the report of the discussion published 
in the New Brunswick News:- 

"The Princeton faculty members were out in force at the meeting 
of Presbytery, all prepared to discuss the question, and among 
them was Dr. McCosh, the venerable ex-President of the 
College. The greatest interest was, of course, felt in what he 
should say on the subject. 

"Dr. McCosh expressed himself wholly in favor of revision. 
'There is danger,' he said, 'in stirring up this matter, but there is 
more danger in ignoring it or postponing it. The movement in 
favor of revision has been pushed very earnestly by the young 
men, and it will as surely be pushed in the future. Revision 
seems likely to come, and if it must come it is better that there 
should be no hesitancy, but that the movement should be guided 
by the older and more conservative men, and guided 
courageously and openly. 

'"It may be doubted if some passages are contained in the word 
of God. Now in logic it is law that there shall be nothing in the 
conclusion for which there is not a foundation in the premise, 
hence what is not in the word of God must not be in the 
confession.' 

"Dr. McCosh spoke briefly of the language of the clause 
declaring that 'God, for his own glory, hath fore-ordained some 
men to everlasting life and some to everlasting death,' and then 
continued: 'There is a want in our confession of a clear and 
prominent utterance such as we have in the Scriptures 
everywhere of the love of God to all men and of the free gift of 
Jesus Christ and of salvation to all men, not to the elect alone. I 
find that some of our best and soundest young men are turned 
from their inclination to enter the ministry, or having entered 
upon it are annoyed and hindered, by a few obnoxious phrases 
that keep staring them in the face, and by the absence of the 
complete recognition of the infinite love and mercy of God. 
Leave out, then, these obnoxious phrases, and put in the very 
front as the most prominent expression of our doctrine this one 
of God's love to all and of the free offer of salvation. Our 
confession meets the heresies of the seventeenth century, but not 
the heresies of the nineteenth.' 

'"I confess, too, that I should like to have in the Presbyterian 
Church a shorter and clearer creed than the Westminster 
Confession. Our theologians do not accept it as a whole. I know 
these theological seminaries; I know them. Some reject one part, 
some reject another, all reject something.' In conclusion the ex- 
President spoke of the nature of the fight which the church in 
this age is entering upon as an argument for the revision. He was 
too old, he said, to enter into a fuller discussion of the subject, 



but he thought the time had come when all should take a stand 
on it; do it honestly and not be a coward. 

"There was a pause when Dr. McCosh had concluded, and then 
Mr. Slaid, a prominent Trenton layman, arose. 'What do we ask,' 
he said, 'when we demand revision? Are we going to throw the 
confession aside? Are we going to put it at naught? No, we are 
merely to place it in the hands of a picked body of men, who 
will bring it into conformity with the best thought of this century 
and make it express what we believe.' 

"In conclusion Mr. Slaid said: 'One of two courses is open to us; 
to put this confession aside as a relic, that shall only show what 
people believed centuries ago; or to put it in shape for use now. I 
care not which is done: if I have any preference it is putting it in 
use. But if it is to be kept as a relic let us have it understood that 
it is a relic and nothing more. Let us not keep it as a relic and yet 
pretend to use it.'" 

In one sense these are noble, bold words, as well as words of 
truth and soberness. And yet, one cannot help wondering that 
these gentlemen, and others who took the same side of the 
question with them, should manifest their boldness only in 
words. They surely have not reached present conclusions 
suddenly; they probably have held them for months or for years. 
Why, then, have they remained Presbyterians in name while at 
heart they utterly repudiate those tenets which represent 
Presbyterianism? Why do they now stand before the world as 
the slaves of a sect and its creed, praying the majority to ease up 
some of the tighter bonds which gall and fret them? Why, if 
really courageous soldiers of the Truth, do they not step out of 
sectarian bondage into the liberty wherewith Christ makes free 
all who appreciate his work and doctrines? Really, instead of 
considering these men as brave heroes, we cannot help pitying 
them in their ludicrous position, when we see that the bonds 
which hold them, and 

R1165 : page 3 

against which they so vehemently declaim, and from which they 
pray to be released, are not really chains of rusty steel which are 
cutting the flesh but only some old paper chains, hard and ugly 
and strong looking from age, but really so fragile that the 
smallest "babe in Christ" could shatter them, yet so grim and 
horrible to look upon that they terrify many gray haired 
ministers and college professors, so that while some weep and 
pray that the burden be lifted, the majority decide that the chains 
are too sacred and too strong to be touched. 

On the other side of this question, Dr. Warfield, professor of 
theology in Princeton Seminary, is reported to have "opposed 
the revision, on the ground that the present Confession is the 
correct expression of the general sentiment of the Church, and a 
satisfactory interpretation of Scriptural faith, if itself properly 



interpreted. " This agrees well with a statement made by Rev. I. 
N. Hays before the Pittsburgh Presbytery, discussing the same 
question. He said: "I am a Calvinist through and through. There 
is not a doctrine essential to our system which I would have 
altered, modified or softened, if I had the power to do so. As I 
see it, the Bible is just as full of God's sovereignty as it is of free 
grace. To get the Calvinism, which is in it, out, you must get a 
new Bible." 

From these and from the expressions of many Presbyterians, it is 
our opinion that there are four parties in the denomination: (1) a 
radical class which believes as thoroughly as Calvin ever did 
that in the counsels of eternity, before man was created, God 
predetermined not only the creation, but also fixedly determined 
who should be so "effectually called" to salvation and so 
thoroughly environed by circumstances, etc., that they could 
neither will nor do anything which would in any way affect or 
alter that predetermination to land them in glory; and that 
regarding the others of mankind God just as fixedly 
predetermined that they should not get an effectual call, and 
should have no opportunity for salvation, and that nothing that 
they could either will or do could prevent them from being 
everlastingly tortured— that they might thus by unending groans 
and curses illustrate God's power and sovereignty, as the elect 
would illustrate (by no work or merit of theirs, they claim) God's 
sovereign power to save whom he would: (2) a class which says, 
quietly, Calvin was probably all right, we do not dispute it, but 
we prefer not to think or talk on this side of the subject; let us 
rather talk about God's goodness and love to the elect, and hope 
that we and our friends are not of the non-elect who are to be 
tormented; and especially let us not make this election doctrine 
prominent; let us revise the creed, not because it really belies 
our faith, but because in this day of refined sensibilities the 
creed expresses our views too clearly and shocks outsiders as 
well as grates harshly upon our own feelings: (3) another class 
totally repudiating the above doctrines and vainly endeavoring 
to prove to themselves and others that Calvin never believed 
thus. They construct for their finer sensibilities an election 
without any special predestination of individuals, and contrary 
to Calvinism they recognize the freedom of the human will and 
the importance of the individual both willing and doing 
according to his ability. These think themselves capable of 
twisting and turning and explaining away the objectionable 
features of Calvinism, and object to a creed revision, claiming 
that it would show weakness and fallibility to change it, and that 
it really needs no change, but should be understood not logically 
and as it reads but according to the gloss they are able to put 
upon it. These represent the majority of the educated men and of 
the ministers. (4) A fourth class is represented by Dr. Schaff, of 
New York. They hold practically the same views as class three, 
except that they are too honest or too logical to claim for 



Calvinism and the old Westminster Confession of Faith any 
other meaning than their plain statements will honestly and 
logically justify. These admit that Calvin and their creed teach 
what in the present light they can clearly see is a horrible, God- 
dishonoring doctrine of which they are heartily ashamed. This 
class, to a man, desire the revision. 

But why do men of so different ideas cling together so 
tenaciously and insist that they are all Calvinists, all 
Presbyterians, while really only classes 1 and 2 are such? Is it 
from loyalty to Christ? No; Christ never told any to believe in 
Calvinism or to call themselves Presbyterians. Quite the 
contrary, indeed, loyalty to Christ would lead to the 
remembrance that "one is your Master" and teacher, even Christ, 
and would show that fealty to Calvin and the owning of his 
name as their great teacher is really disloyalty to Christ-the 
putting of another in the place of the true head of the Church. 

Can their anxiety to stay together as one be accounted for as 
love of the Truth or love of each other? No; they admit as above 
that they are not agreed as to what is Truth and often find in 
other denominations fully as congenial persons for associates. 
What then holds them thus? It is sectarianism and the fact that 
they have a sure thing of a certain amount of honor, support, 
etc., where they are, which they would run, at least, a risk of 
losing by changing. Besides, would it not prove that they were 
fallible teachers and that they and others whose teachings they 
had endorsed had really taught more or less error? This would 
be very much more humbling to pride than to stick to the old 
creed, claim that it is infallible and seek to turn and twist its 
various declarations to keep pace with the growing 
enlightenment of the people, which they cannot restrain. Would 
that we could see some of the noblest step entirely out from all 
man-made creeds, and declare themselves disciples (learners) at 
the feet of Christ, students of his Word (and not learned D.D.'s), 
and see them seeking and planning as diligently how to 
harmonize God's Word, as they now are seeking to sustain the 
false doctrines of mistaken men. 

Concerning the real import and ultimate effect of changes, at 
present under consideration by great religious systems, the 
secular press seems to be fully aware. They realize the situation 
as fully as the theologians, and much better than many of them. 
The editor of a New York daily thus reviews the matter:- 

"The General Convention of the Episcopalians now in session at 
St. George's will not be disturbed by controversies over 
questions of doctrine. Such differences of opinion as there may 
be will be concerning matters of form; the revision of the prayer 
book and hymnal, the basis of representation in the Convention, 
and also a change in the title of the Church. 



"Meantime, in the Presbyterian Church the movement for a 
more or less radical revision or transformation of the standard of 
faith is gaining force, and this subject of controversy will 
unquestionably occupy the chief attention of the next General 
Assembly as the most important which has arisen in the 
communion during all its recent history. Even President McCosh 
of Princeton expressed the opinion at the meeting of the New 
Brunswick Presbytery on Tuesday last that this discussion is 
bound to come, and that it will be more dangerous to try to head 
it off than to give it encouragement. He went further and 
declared himself squarely in favor of revising the Westminster 
Confession of Faith. It seems to him too harsh, and as lacking in 
'a clear and prominent utterance, such as we have in the 
Scriptures everywhere, of the love of God to 

R1165 : page 4 

all men and of the free gift of Jesus Christ and of salvation to all 
men, not to the elect alone.' The younger Presbyterian clergy, 
according to Dr. McCosh, 'find the doctrine of election as 
expressed in the Confession a serious stumbling block in their 
way. They are unable or unwilling to defend it, and for his own 
part he discovers that it meets the heresies of the seventeenth 
century, but not the heresies of the nineteenth.' 

"The same feeling prevails in Scotland and England. There also 
the doctrine of election is becoming more and more unpalatable, 
especially when it is put thus remorselessly in the Westminster 
Confession:- 

'"By the decree of God, for the manifestation of His glory, some 
men and some angels are predestinated to everlasting life, and 
others foreordained to everlasting death. 

"These angels and men, thus predestinated and foreordained, are 
particularly and unchangeably designed; and their number is so 
certain and definite that it cannot be either increased or 
diminished.'" 

Certainly, the unscriptural doctrine of a hell of torment for any 
to suffer in eternally must go along with or shortly after the 
doctrine that God predestinated a fixed number of his creatures 
to endure such an eternity. Because the foreknowledge of God, 
at least, must be admitted; and if he foreknew such an eternity 
for any, why did he create them; or to put the matter in another 
form, Why should God— a just and loving God— foreknow that 
he would do thus with the willfully wicked? Why should he not 
make a much more reasonable plan and arrange to destroy and 
not preserve such wicked ones, and foreknow that? Such, as we 
have frequently shown in these columns, is God's plan and such 
an end of the wicked he foreknew and has foretold by the 
prophets, by his Son, and by his apostles.* 



But some great theologian will perhaps answer, -God cannot 
destroy a man. He 

R1166 : page 4 

can destroy all lower animals' lives, but man is immortal and 
must therefore live forever somewhere; and since such could not 
be allowed to mar the harmony and bliss of the righteous, God 
had to provide a place for such to spend their eternity, and that 
place we theologians call hell. 

Well, well! Who would have expected that a wise God would so 
overdo his work of creation as to make creatures whose 
existence he could not terminate. But do not all theologians 
agree with us that God is infinite in power and in wisdom? But, 
if infinite in wisdom, he would not have made man so great as to 
be beyond his own control. And, if infinite in power, it follows 
true that there is nothing that he has not the power to destroy- 
angels or men. Theologians have a theory on this subject of 
man's power and God's weakness, as well as on the subject of 
the predestination of the non-elect to everlasting torment. But 
both theories are erroneous; both are thoroughly opposed to 
Scripture teachings; both are dishonoring to God and injurious 
to the church and to the world; and both are belittling to the 
reason and common sense of the great theologians who 
concocted such flimsy subterfuges,— subterfuges which any man 
of unfettered reason and any knowledge of the Bible, or 
willingness to study it with the help of a concordance, can today 
easily and quickly see through. 

In this connection we give the views of another celebrated 
Presbyterian minister, of Union Theological Seminary, 

PROFESSOR SCHAFF D.D. 
COMMENDS DR. M'COSH'S POSITION. 

To a Tribune reporter who called upon him on Saturday Dr. 
Schaff said that he was in favor of a revision of the creed, and 
was willing to state his reasons for his belief that the time had 
come for a change in the Standards of the Church. In the main 
he agrees with Dr. McCosh. 

He said, "I am glad that the Tribune published the testimony of 
this venerable scholar in favor of a revision. His testimony will 
have great weight, owing to his long experience and 
representative position. Not only for Princeton University, but 
also for Ireland and Scotland can he speak. He is certainly right 
when he asserts that revision must come sooner or later. He 
touches the vital point in the Westminster Confession when he 
says: 'There is a want in our Confession of a clear and prominent 
utterance such as we have in the Scriptures everywhere of the 
love of God to all men, and the free gift of Jesus Christ and of 
salvation to all men, not to the elect alone.' 



Reporter. -"What are the special parts of the Confession that 
need revision?" 

Dr. Schaff.-'The chapters that relate to predestination and the 
loss of non-elect infants are specially under fire now, but I am in 
favor of dropping the reference to the pope as 'Antichrist,' and 
the two hundred millions of communicants in the Roman 
Catholic Church as 'idolaters.' Such a judgment is untrue, unjust, 
uncharitable and unsuitable in any Confession of Faith. But that 
is not the special point to which attention is called. Let us keep 
to the text. Take the subject of 'elect' and 'non-elect' infants. You 
cannot escape the logical conclusion that if there are 'elect' 
infants, there must be 'non-elect' infants, that may be lost. Now, 
it is the general belief of the Presbyterian Church to-day that all 
infants dying in infancy are saved, while in the seventeenth 
century all Calvinist divines believed that some of them were 
lost forever. But the opponents of revision do not teach or 
preach this doctrine now; why, then, have it in the Confession?" 

THE WONDERFUL LOVE OF GOD. 

Reporter. -"Is not the Westminster Confession broad enough to 
include all men?" 

Dr. S.— "It is a Confession framed for the benefit of the elect, 
while, at the same time, the most prominent and the most 
cheering doctrine, which may be read on every page of the New 
Testament, is this: 'God loves all men; God made absolute 
provision for the salvation of all men; God wishes no man to be 
lost, but would have every one come to a knowledge of the 
truth.' I scarcely need to quote a verse to prove this, though 
many might be given, which are not used as proof texts in the 
Confession, because that doctrine is not contained in the text. 

'"How often,' said the Savior, 'would I have gathered thy 
children together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her 
wings, and ye would not:' the emphasis is on the 'would not' of 
the people. 'God so loved the world,' the whole world, not the 
elect merely, 'that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever 
[embracing all men] believeth on him should not perish, but 
have everlasting life.' 'God, our Savior, willeth that all men 
should be saved.' 'The Lord is long-suffering to you- ward not 
wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to 
repentance,' and so I might go on." 

Reporter. -"But if this doctrine is emphasized, does it not 
destroy Presbyterianism, and make us all Methodists?" 

Dr. S.-"By no means. The doctrine of divine sovereignty is still 
maintained; the doctrine of election is not destroyed, but 
alongside of these important doctrines is placed that other, the 
groundwork of our religion, namely, the doctrine of the 
universal love of God. The Calvinist to-day, whatever be his 
theory as a theologian, stands on this basis. He preaches and 



works as if salvation depended on men; he prays as if all 
depended on God. The Calvinist preaches like an Arminian, and 
the Arminian prays like a Calvinist. " 

Rep. -"But is this not inconsistent?" 

Dr. S.— "If it be logically inconsistent, it has the high support of 
the great Apostle to the Gentiles, who bids men work out their 
own salvation with fear and trembling, adding, 'For it is God 
who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good 
pleasure.' That seems inconsistent, but it is Scripture." 

In the above expressions by Dr. Schaff we find two points for 
brief comment. (1) Note that he objects to Papacy being 
considered Antichrist; he considers this unjust, untrue and 
uncharitable. In this he merely follows the liberal worldly 
sentiment which is rapidly spreading over and influencing the 
judgments of the entire nominal church of all denominations of 
Protestants. As we have attempted to show before, Protestants 
to-day are such only in name; they hold so much of doctrine, 
custom and form in harmony with Papacy, that neither they nor 
the world see any reason for either one to call the other 
antichrist; for in so doing they practically implicate themselves 
as at least blood-relatives of antichrist. Nevertheless, as we have 
sought clearly to show in DAWN, Vol. II. , (and will further 
show in Vol. III.,) there is the strongest of grounds for knowing 
that Papacy is the great antichrist system of the Bible, and for 
getting farther and farther from her and her false doctrines of the 
dark ages, which continue to stain and taint every Protestant 
creed to the extent that it contain, much or little of the same 
false doctrines. 

(2) We object to Dr. Schaff s concluding remark, relative to the 
Apostle Paul's teaching. We have no right nor wish to object to 
the branding of Dr. Schaff s theories on the subject of election as 
illogical as well as inconsistent; for that is just what any 
sensible, thinking man must conclude; but we do object when by 
his claims that greatest and most logical and inspired writer, 
Paul, is made to appear foolish and illogical also, by the claim 
that his words agree with the confessedly illogical and 
inconsistent theory of Dr. Schaff and Calvinists generally, of all 
shades, on this subject of election. 

We cannot here discuss this question in detail. We have already 
done so, and refer the reader to the TOWER for March 1886, 
pages 3 and 4. Suffice it here that we very briefly notice the two 
texts which seem to Dr. S. to be illogical and inconsistent, thus:- 

We find the Scriptures everywhere teaching that God has a plan 
or fixed arrangement for human redemption and recovery from 
sin and death, according to which he is working; and that all his 
purposes in that plan shall be accomplished in his own due time. 
In that plan he arranged that our Lord Jesus was to be the great 



and chief divine agent in the work of redemption and recovery. 
In that predetermined plan he had provided, also, that a few, a 
"little flock," should be chosen or selected from among the 
many of the redeemed world, to be the bride, joint-heirs, under- 
priests and co-workers with Christ Jesus, their Lord and Chief- 
priest, in the execution of God's great plan of blessing all the 
families of the earth by bringing all men to a full knowledge of 
God (1 Tim. 2:4-6) and restoring to mental and physical 
perfection (Acts 3:19-21-23) all who, when they know the Lord 
fully, shall delight to serve and obey him. 

This "little flock" God had not only predetermined should be 
selected from among redeemed men, but he had also 
predetermined that only such should be of that select band as 
should in a trial develop a spirit of loyalty and full consecration 
to him; in other words, they must each be "copies of his Son," 
their Redeemer. (Rom. 8:29.) The trial or testing time of this 
"little flock" has been during this Gospel age. These are not only 
being tried to prove their worthiness of everlasting life, but also 
to prove whether they shall, by very full, hearty, prompt and 
faithful obedience to the very spirit of God's will, manifest the 
likeness of Christ Jesus and be accounted worthy to be of the 
little flock, his select (elect or chosen) joint-heirs in the coming 
kingdom. 

It is for this that they must "strive," "run," "seek," "fight," "lay 
hold," 

R1167:page4 

and "work," for to "make your calling and election sure:" "So 
run that ye may obtain" the prize: "Work out your own salvation 
with fear and trembling [careful lest you should fail of this great 
favor of God to which you have been called]; for it is God that 
worketh among you both to will and to work his good pleasure. " 
In other words, -Highly esteem the high calling to the great 
honor set before you in your call to joint-heirship with Christ in 
his Millennial kingdom. Slight it not; esteem it not lightly. 
Remember that the call is of God, that it is his exceeding great 
and precious promises that have worked and are working in you 
to will to do God's will and become copies of the great 
Redeemer; and remember, too, that the same promises are still 
the power of God, and will enable you, not only to will, but also 
to do, what would be pleasing to God. 

The great mistake made by so many, on the relationship of work 
and salvation, is this: they see properly, though very indistinctly, 
that the work of redemption, the giving of the ransom, is entirely 
a work of Christ, our Lord, in which we can have no share, but 
which we must accept and appropriate by faith alone. There is 
no room at all in that redemptive work for our works to come in. 
We must accept it as a gratuity in full, or not at all, as the poet 
truly expresses it: 



In my hand no price I bring: 
Simply to thy cross I cling. 

This work of Christ cancels the original condemnation, to 
everlasting destruction, which had passed upon all through the 
disobedience of Adam, our father and representative. It entitles 
every man to a fresh trial-an individual trial-and offers life 
everlasting to each one who (after accepting of Christ's finished 
work) shall by his will and his works prove his willingness to be 
obedient to God. Here faith has its part, in which works cannot 
share,-in accepting of Christ's work; then the works of the 
redeemed, justified ones, come in and join hands with faith to 
make use of the benefits provided freely by the grace of God in 
Christ. 

The trial of the world in general waits until the trial of the 
church, which is much more severe, is complete. Then the 
chosen, the elect, the bride with her Lord, shall judge and bless 
all the families of earth. 

Thus seen, the selection of the church means the very reverse of 
a curse upon the great remainder of mankind. Though 

R1167:page5 

the close of the selection, when the last one of the predetermined 
number has been tried and approved, will reprobate or cut off 
the remainder of mankind from all hope of sharing with Christ 
in the honors of his great restitution work of blessing the 
masses, it is far from the ordinary idea of reprobation. An 
illustration of this reprobation is found in politics. When the full 
number of members of Congress or Parliament, fixed by law, 
has been selected or elected, the remainder of the people are 
reprobates thereto. But are they injured thereby? No, they are 
blessed; for the selection of the few is for the benefit and not for 
the injury of the many. And much more so God's selection of the 
Parliament and ministry of the Millennial Kingdom, under and 
as co-workers with Christ Jesus the King of kings-they are 
elected for the expressed purpose of blessing all the families of 
earth. -Eph. 2:5-10; Gal. 3:16,29.

THE "DIVINE DECREES" 
THE BACK-BONE. 

The Rev. Dr. Shedd, Professor of Systematic Theology in the 
Union Theological Seminary-Presbyterian- when interviewed 



by a reporter of the Tribune, expressed himself freely against a 
revision of the Presbyterian Confession of Faith. He evidently 
sees that a revision means a general reform or the complete 
breaking up of the denomination. He fears this and opposes all 
reform of thought and expression. We give a part of the 
interview:- 

Reporter.-"If they cannot agree to everything contained in the 
Book, would you favor a loose subscription,' signing with 
mental reservation?" 

Dr. Schedd.-"I would choose the lesser evil and go for revision 
first. Some propose 'loose subscription' as a remedy for the ills 
complained of; that is, leave the standards as they are, and when 
candidates of lax or unsettled views present themselves for 
licensure or ordination, let them reserve certain parts which they 
cannot agree to sign. This is demoralizing and kills all simplicity 
and godly sincerity. Better a thousand times for a denomination 
to alter its creeds than to allow its ministry to 'palter with words 
in a double meaning;' than to permit an Arian subscription to the 
Nicene symbol, an Arminian subscription to the Westminster 
Confession, a Calvinist subscription to the Articles of Wesley, a 
Restorationist subscription to the doctrine of endless 
punishment. " 

Rep.-"Dr. Schaff says that he subscribed liberally to the 
Westminster Standards when he became a professor in the 
Union Seminary, after consulting with two prominent members 
of the faculty." 

Dr. S.-"I noticed that statement and I failed to understand it, for 
according to the charter which governs the Board of Directors, 
no such thing as 'loose subscription' is known. I have been a 
professor in this seminary for twenty-six years, and once in 
every five years, the Board of Directors, who themselves 
subscribe to the Confession, have summoned me before them 
and, in accordance with the constitution, have required me to 
affirm, 'in the presence of God and of the directors of the 
Seminary,' that I 'solemnly and sincerely receive and adopt the 
Westminster Confession of Faith as containing the system of 
doctrine taught in the Holy Scriptures." 

WHAT WILL THE END BE? 

Rep.-"If the question of revision carries in the Presbyteries, 
what will the end be?" 

Dr. S.-"No living man can tell. And that is one of the points 
which I make against the whole matter. I am more interested in 
the abstract question of a revision than in the details of the 
problem. Revision is inexpedient, because there is no end of the 
process. It is like the letting out of water. The doctrine of the 
Divine Decrees is the particular one selected by the Presbytery 
whose request has brought the subject of revision before the 



General Assembly. But this doctrine runs entirely through the 
Westminster documents, so that if changes were made merely in 
chapter iii. of the Confession, this chapter would be wholly out 
of harmony with the remainder. Effectual calling, regeneration, 
perseverance of the saints, are all linked in with the Divine 
Decrees. The most cursory perusal will show that a revision of 
the Confession on this one subject would amount to an entire 
recasting of the creed." 

Rep.-'The advocates of revision think their conservative 
brethren are needlessly alarmed." 

Dr. S.— "It seems to me that they are not counting the cost of 
their advocating a revision. In representing the Confession to be 
positively erroneous on two very important points, Dr. Van 
Dyke, for example, is proving too much. He is giving aid and 
comfort to the enemy. He is virtually telling the opponents of 
Calvinism that they are correct in their aspersions on the 
Westminster symbol; in their assertion that it is a hard and 
repellant system. " 



R1167:page5 

"THEY GNAW THEIR TONGUES" 

[CONTRADICT EACH OTHER]. 

Rev. Mr. Williamson, of Cleveland, favors a revision of the 
Confession and is quoted in the Cleveland Leader thus:- 

"We may not get a system of doctrine that dovetails together 
with perfect accuracy, but what is better, we get more perfectly 
into the heart of Christ and his teaching. Doctrinal system is not 
ignored or underestimated, but in order to the completeness of 
its logic it must not be allowed statements and syllogisms which 
are not in harmony with the general tenor of the Scriptures. The 
only document of the past to which we are willing to be 
shackled is the Bible. 

"No sweeping changes seem to be thought of by any. Although 
its forms of statement in many instances are not those of the 
present day, they are not thought to be of such a nature as to 
make necessary any retouching. Not so, however, in several 
instances, particularly chapter third, on God's Eternal Decrees, 
and chapter ten, section third, on Elect Infants. Some of the 
opponents of revision show how wonderfully logical they are, 
and how admirably phrased, so as to suit supralapsarian and 
sublapsarian, and that any change would tend to narrowness 
rather then breadth of statement. I have read their arguments, 
and been much impressed by them, and then I have re-read 
chapter third, and in spite of their arguments my moral sense has 
been no less shocked than when in my boyhood days I first read 



the Confession. Indeed, I find my soul recoiling from these 
statements with increasing rather than diminishing force. I read 
of the distinction between pretention and reprobation which is 
here so nicely allowed for, but I find my mind still almost 
fiercely rebelling against the 

R1168:page5 

dogmatic statements I here find. I find also, on comparing notes 
with those who, like myself, know little and care less about the 
theological subtleties, that the idea of God which this chapter 
presents is utterly abhorrent to them. And I cannot help feeling 
that there is something in their experience of moral revulsion 
that is as worthy of being taken into account as the logic of the 
systematic theologian. If, as some of us believe, we have 

GONE BEYOND THE WRITTEN WORD 

in order to the completeness of our system, the quicker we get 
back there the better. It is proposed to insert in this chapter third 
something concerning the love of God which will, and specially 
as inserted here, relieve the hardness of the Confession, and do 
what many believe it now fails to do as it ought— put God before 
the world more as the New Testament reveals him. But we are 
told this is altogether unnecessary; that this truth is by no means 
lost sight of, and to prove it a number of clauses are gathered 
together from different portions of the Confession expressive of 
this truth. Inasmuch as they have been picked out and put 
together we shall have to confess that they are there, but we 
should never have surmised it, from the simple reading of the 
Confession. This truth, it strikes me, is of enough importance to 
be put where we can find it without searching for it. It ought to 
stand forth so plainly that no one could help seeing it. I am glad 
if there are any upon whom the Confession already makes this 
impression. There are a good many of us upon whom it does 
not. 

"As for the section on elect infants, I for one do not care, except 
as a matter of historical knowledge, what meaning it was 
intended originally to convey. I know what meaning it would 
convey to the average mind of to-day, and I doubt whether any 
amount of historical information will make him believe it means 
anything else, and that is that, of those who die in infancy, some 
are elected to salvation and some are not. The Presbyterian 
Church does not believe this." 



And yet, if you ask a Presbyterian what he believes, he will 
refer you to the Westminster Confession and Catechism. And if 
you attend an installation service, you will hear the vow of the 
ordained man that he will believe and preach only what this 
creed declares to be the truth. Notwithstanding this, Dr. Schaff 
declares that he subscribes to it with mental reservations; and 



Mr. Williamson probably the same way. And the latter publicly 
tells us that the Presbyterian Church as a whole disbelieves it. 
What can be the object of this beating about the bush, much of 
which is misrepresentation, if not downright fraud? It is to 
perpetuate the sect, not its doctrines, of which they are 
becoming ashamed. 

Why not abandon all such human systems and confessions, now 
used for tying men's tongues and consciences, and let each other 
stand free to study God's Word untrammeled, and to build, each 
for himself, such a creed as he shall find authorized in God's 
Word; adding to his creed or subtracting therefrom continually, 
as he continues to grow in grace and in knowledge and in love 
of God. This is the attitude which God designed: this is the 
liberty wherewith Christ made us all free. Why surrender our 
liberties and enslave our consciences and tongues to a sect, or 
the decisions of majorities in sects? If all of God's children were 
really free, thus, it would not be long before they would be at 
perfect oneness of heart and nearly at one in faith and work -the 
only true union. 



Arise and shine in youth immortal; 
Thy Light is come, thy King appears. 
Beyond the centuries' swinging portal 
Breaks a new dawn— The Thousand Years.

PROPERTY IN LAND. 



The National Economist makes the following extracts from 
John Stuart Mills' "Principles of Political Economy," as 
illustrative of its own views:— 

"The essential principle of property being to assure to all 
persons what they have produced by their labor and accumulated 
by their abstinence, this principle can not apply to what is not 
the produce of labor-the raw material of the earth. If the land 
derived its productive power wholly from nature and not at all 
from industry, or if there were any means of discriminating what 
is derived from each source, it not only would not be necessary, 
but it would be the height of injustice, to let the gift of nature be 
engrossed by individuals. The use of land in agriculture must, 
indeed, for the time being be, of necessity, exclusive; the same 
person who has plowed and sown must be permitted to reap; but 
the land might be occupied for one season only, as among the 
ancient Germans; or might be periodically re-divided as 
population increased; or the states might be the universal 



landlord, and the cultivators tenants under it either on lease or at 
will.... 

"But, though land is not the produce of industry, most of its 
valuable qualities are so. Labor is not only requisite for using, 
but almost equally so for fashioning, the instrument. 
Considerable labor is often required at the commencement to 
clear the land for cultivation. In many cases, even when cleared, 
its productiveness is wholly the effect of labor and art. The 
Bedford level produced little or nothing until artificially drained. 
The bogs of Ireland, until the same thing is done to them, can 
produce little besides fuel. One of the barrenest soils in the 
world, composed of the materials of the Goodwin Sands, the 
Pays de Waes in Flanders, has been so fertilized by industry as 
to have become one of the most productive in Europe. 
Cultivation also requires buildings and fences, which are wholly 
the product of labor. The fruits of this industry can not be reaped 
in a short period. The labor and outlay are immediate, the 
benefit is spread over many years, perhaps over all future time. 
A holder will not incur this labor and outlay when strangers and 
not himself will be benefited by it. If he undertakes such 
improvements, he must have a sufficient period before him in 
which to profit by them; and he is in no way so sure of having 
always a sufficient period as when his tenure is perpetual. 

"These are the reasons which form the justification, in an 
economical point of view, of property in land. It is seen that they 
are only valid in so far as the proprietor of land is its improver. 
Whenever, in any country, the proprietor, generally speaking, 
ceases to be the improver, political economy has nothing to say 
in defense of landed property as then established. In no sound 
theory of private property was it ever contemplated that the 
proprietor of land should be merely a sinecurist quartered on it. 

"When the 'sacredness of property' is talked of it should always 
be remembered that any such sacredness does not belong in the 
same degree to landed property. No man made the land. It is the 
original inheritance of the whole species. Its appropriation is 
wholly a question of general expediency. When private property 
in land is not expedient, it is unjust. It is no hardship to any one, 
to be excluded from what others have produced; they were not 
bound to produce it for his use, and he loses nothing by not 
sharing in what otherwise would not have existed 

R1170:page6 

at all. But it is some hardship to be born into the world and to 
find all nature's gifts previously engrossed, and no place left for 
the new comer. To reconcile people to this, after they have once 
admitted into their minds the idea that any moral rights belong 
to them as human beings, it will always be necessary to 
convince them that the exclusive appropriation is good for 
mankind on the whole, themselves included. But this is what no 



sane human being could be persuaded of, if the relation between 
the land owner and the cultivator were the same everywhere as it 
has been in Ireland. 

"Landed property is felt, even by those most tenacious of its 
rights, to be a different thing from other property; and when the 
bulk of the community have been disinherited of their share of 
it, and it has become the exclusive attribute of a small minority, 
men have generally tried to reconcile it, at least in theory, to 
their sense of justice, by endeavoring to attach duties to it, and 
erect it into a sort of magistracy, either moral or legal. But if the 
state is at liberty to tread the possessors of land as public 
functionaries, it is only going one step further to say that it is at 
liberty to discard them. The claim of the land owners to the land 
is altogether subordinate to the general policy of the state to 
deprive them of it. To that their claim is indefeasible. 

"To me it seems almost an axiom that property in land should be 
interpreted strictly, and that the balance in all cases of doubt 
should incline against the proprietor. The reverse is the case 
with property in movables, and in all things the product of labor. 
In these the owner's power both of use and of exclusion should 
be absolute, except where positive evil to others would result 
from it; but in the case of land no exclusive right should be 
permitted in any individual which can not be shown to be 
productive of possible good. To be allowed any exclusive right 
at all over a portion of the common inheritance while there are 
others who have no portion, is already a privilege. No quantity 
of movable goods which a person can acquire by his labor 
prevents others from acquiring the like by the same means; but, 
from the very nature of the case, whoever owns land keeps 
others out of enjoyment of it. The privilege, or monopoly, is 
only defensible as a necessary evil; it becomes an injustice when 
carried to any point to which the compensating good does not 
follow it. 

"When land is not intended to be cultivated, no good reason can 
in general be given for its being private property at all; and if 
one is permitted to call it his, he ought to know that he holds it 
by the sufferance of the community, and on an implied condition 
that his ownership, since it can not possibly do them any good, 
at least should not deprive them of any thing they could have 
received from the land if it had been unappropriated. Even in the 
case of cultivated land, a man whom, though only one among 
millions, the law permits to hold thousands of acres as his single 
share, is not entitled to think that all this is given to him to use 
and abuse, and deal with as if it concerned nobody but himself. 
The rents or profits which he can obtain from it are at his sole 
disposal; but with regard to the land, in everything which he 
does with it, and in everything which he abstains from doing, he 
is morally bound, and should, whenever the case admits, be 
legally compelled to make his interest and pleasure consistent 



with the public good. The species at large still retains, of its 
original claim to the soil of the planet which it inhabits, as much 
as is compatible with the purposes for which it has parted with 
the remainder. " 



R1168:page6 

AN ALARMING PROPOSITION. 

And still they travel the road to Rome. We have frequently of 
late given in these columns instances of the way in which 
Catholicism is absorbing Protestantism, or rather the way in 
which Protestantism is plunging headlong into Catholicism, and 
now we have another step to record. In the Christian at Work of 
April 12, Prof. Charles A. Briggs, D.D., of Union Theological 
Seminary, New York, had an article entitled "Is Rome an Ally, 
an Enemy, or Both?" Starting out with the assertion that "the 
Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches are agreed 
in nine-tenths or more of the contents of Christianity," Doctor 
Briggs makes some statements concerning the Reformation, and 
then says:— 

"We are agreed as to the essentials of Christianity. Our common 
faith is based on the so-called apostles' creed, our worship on the 
Lord's prayer, and our morals on the ten commandments and the 
sermon on the mount. Who will venture to say that the Roman 
Catholic Church is not as faithful to these foundations of our 
common religion as Protestants? Taking our stand on the 
apostles' creed, we must add to the articles of faith on which we 
are agreed, all the doctrinal achievements of the church for 
fifteen centuries, the doctrine of the unity of God, the person and 
work of Jesus Christ, the Holy Trinity, original sin and human 
depravity, salvation by divine grace, the absolute need of the 
atonement of Jesus Christ. On all these great doctrines of our 
religion, Romanism and Protestantism are one. Here we are 
allies, and it is our common task to proclaim these doctrines to 
the heathen world, and to overcome by them all forms of 
irreligion and infidelity in Christian lands. And differences 
about justification by faith, and salvation by the divine grace 
alone, and the authority of the church as regards the 
determination of the canon of Scripture, and its interpretation, 
ought not to prevent our cooperation and alliance in the great 
work of indicating and proclaiming the common faith. Our 
conflict over the doctrines in which we differ would be more 
fruitful in good results, if our contest should be based upon 
concord and alliance in the common faith. If our contest could 
be narrowed to the real points of difference, and that contest 
could be conducted in a brave, chivalrous, and loving manner, 
the results would be more fruitful. 



"Taking our stand upon the Lord's prayer, we observe that as to 
the greater part of Christian worship we are agreed. We worship 
God in common, in morning and evening assemblies, by prayer, 
songs of praise, the reading and preaching of the Scriptures, and 
the celebration of the sacraments of baptism and the Lords 
supper. All this is common. Furthermore, we take the liberty of 
affirming that the matter of all this worship is for the most part 
common in both these great bodies of Christians. I have heard 
sermons in Roman Catholic churches of Europe which were 
more evangelical and less objectionable than many sermons I 
have heard in leading Protestant churches in Berlin, London and 
New York. It is well known that the Protestant books of liturgy 
contain a considerable amount of material derived from the old 
mass-books, and they are all the more valuable for that. Roman 
Catholic baptism has many superstitions connected with it, but 
the essentials of baptism are there in the baptism by the minister 
in the name of the Holy Trinity. Roman Catholic observance of 
the Lord's supper is connected with the worship of the materials 
of the supper under the doctrine that they are really the body and 
blood of the divine Lord; but who can deny that pious souls by 
faith really partake of the body and blood of Christ in his holy 
sacrament, notwithstanding the errors in which it is enveloped? 
If we look with eyes of Christian charity upon the Lutheran and 
Zwinglian views, which are regarded as serious errors by the 
standards of the Reformed churches, and do not deny to the 
participants real communion with Christ, why should we deny 
such communion to pious Roman Catholics? 

"In all matters of worship we are in essential concord with 
Roman Catholics, and we ought not to hesitate to make an 
alliance with them so far as possible, to maintain the sanctity of 
the Sabbath as a day of worship, and to proclaim to the world 
the necessity of worshiping God in his house, and of becoming 
members of his church by baptism, and of seeking union and 
communion with the Savior by Christian worship, the study of 
the Scriptures, and the observance of the Lord's supper. With 
this recognition of concord, Protestants can then debate with 
Romanists in a friendly manner, and seek to overcome their 
errors, remove the excrescences they have heaped upon the 
simple worship in the spirit and in truth, which seems to us more 
in accordance with the Scripture and with the wishes of the 
Savior. 

"We should also note that in the great constituent parts of 
prayer-the invocation, adoration, thanksgiving, confession of 
sin, petition, intercession, and consecration -Roman Catholic 
and Protestant worship are agreed, and consequently the matter 
of prayer is essentially the same, the differences are less than 
most people imagine. In Christian song the differences are still 
less. If our hymnbooks were stripped of hymns from the ancient 
and mediaeval church, and from modern Roman Catholics, they 
would be bare indeed. 



"Looking now at the sphere of morals, we take our common 
stand on the ten commandments and the sermon on the mount. 
As to the vast majority of all questions of morals, Romanism 
and Protestantism are agreed. It is true there 

R1169 : page 6 

is a great deal of immorality in the Roman Catholic Church in 
some countries, and we think it may be shown that as a rule 
Protestantism is productive of better morals than Romanism; but 
this, after all, is a question of more or less, and to say the least, 
Protestantism has little to boast of. On all these questions it is of 
the highest importance that the Roman Catholic Church and 
Protestant churches should make an alliance. Their joint efforts 
would have an influence upon public and private morals such as 
the world has not yet witnessed. We may agree to differ and 
debate on all questions of morals where there is discord. But 
when we are agreed on the vast majority of questions that come 
before the public, it is sheer folly for us to waste our energies in 
antagonism when co-operation and alliance would be productive 
of vast good. 

"We hold, therefore, that the Roman Catholics and the 
Protestants ought not to hesitate to ally themselves for the 
maintenance and the protection of those great principles of 
Christian doctrine, Christian worship, and Christian morals that 
they hold in common. " 



The proposed alliance with Rome, the necessity for which 
Doctor Briggs reiterates so often, is a noteworthy sign of the 
times, and we could not ignore it and be true to our name. The 
Doctor seems to base his plea for alliance quite largely upon the 
fact that Protestantism is about as bad as Catholicism. He says 
above that Protestantism has little to boast of over Roman 
Catholicism, in the way of morality; and elsewhere in the same 
article he says:— 

"Why should we complain of the persecutions that our ancestors 
suffered from Rome, when we have to lament that others of our 
ancestors were merciless to Roman Catholics? Roman Catholic 
intolerance and bigotry may be matched by Protestant 
intolerance and bigotry. I doubt whether God looks with any 
more favor upon these detestable vices in the one than in the 
other." 

This is, no doubt, a valid reason why Protestantism and Roman 
Catholicism should join; for when Protestantism becomes as bad 
as Catholicism, we can see no necessity for maintaining a 
separate existence. For ourselves we think that there is yet quite 
a difference between the two bodies; but when a prominent 
professor in one of the leading theological seminaries in the land 
can see no difference between the Lord's supper as celebrated 



according to the divine command, and the Roman Catholic 
mass, and when he endorses "all the doctrinal work of the 
[Catholic] Church for fifteen centuries," the point of perfect 
union cannot be far off. 

What an array of names we now have in favor of Protestant 
union with Catholicism -Doctors Hodge, Hitchcock, Schaff, 
Patton, Briggs, Field, etc. But who has heard or read of a 
Catholic priest clamoring for Catholic union with Protestantism? 
-Nobody. Why not? Would not the Catholic Church be willing 
to enter into such an alliance as these Protestant doctors of 
divinity propose?-Most certainly it would be, but the movement 
must all be made by the Protestants. The Catholic Church will 
gladly receive the Protestant churches to her bosom; she will 
accept their aid in the furtherance of her peculiar schemes; but 
she can afford to wait till they come of their own accord, for if 
they make the proposal, she can dictate the terms. 

One more thought. What must we conclude will be the effect of 
an alliance between Protestantism and Catholicism, when we 
remember that one of the strongest pleas for such an alliance is, 
not that Catholicism is as good as Protestantism, but that 
Protestantism is nearly, if not quite, as bad as Catholicism? 
Those who know anything of Rome's peculiarities do not need 
to have an answer given them. 

Some may say that we are alarmists. Indeed we are; and we 
think that any one who sees such danger approaching and does 
not sound an alarm, deserves to suffer all the ill that may follow. 
Our only wish is that we might sound the alarm so loud that it 
would awaken the thousands who seem to be asleep, and who 
are in danger of being taken in the snare. 

—Signs of the Times. 



Surely Protestants are rapidly losing their hold of those 
doctrines of Christ and the apostles which once so clearly 
indicated Papacy to be the great Antichrist system of the Bible. 
All who doubt the correctness of that application are respectfully 
referred for evidences to the last chapter of MILLENNIAL 
DAWN, Vol. II. As for that corner stone of all false doctrine, 
"the sacrifice of the mass," it will be treated in the next volume 
of DAWN, and its mention by the prophet, as the 

R1169:page7 

desolating abomination, will be clearly shown. 



R1169:page7 



DRIVING SHARP BARGAINS. 

Selfishness is a prolific weed which has sprung up and 
flourished for six thousand years in the midst of the thorns and 
thistles where man with weariness and sweat of face has been 
compelled to earn his daily bread. In the endeavor to obtain the 
necessities and comforts of this life, the idea of getting as much 
as possible for as little as possible, or, to use a common phrase, 
of driving close bargains, has well nigh crushed out every noble 
impulse. 

If selfishness flourished only among the miserably poor, it 
would be at least measurably excusable; but it flourishes no less 
in the hearts of the rich and comfortably circumstanced. The 
weed has grown and strengthened its roots and branches so 
wonderfully from generation to generation that it has come to be 
regarded largely as a legitimate and natural trait of human 
nature. It is not surprising, therefore, that the saints, when they 
diligently compare themselves with the perfect standard of 
uprightness presented in the Word of God, find this weed in 
their own hearts, and that as they endeavor to purify themselves, 
even as their Pattern is pure, they find this one of the most 
difficult weeds to eradicate. How great is the inclination, even 
among the children of God, to permit this weed and to eat of its 
fruit. Would that all could realize more fully how unbecoming it 
is in the Royal Family. 

One of the worst forms of the evil, however, is that which 
manifests itself toward God. Accustomed to getting as much as 
possible for the amount paid, or paying as little as possible for 
the thing secured in daily life, the same disposition often 
manifests itself in dealing with God for the "Crown of Life," the 
"glory, honor and immortality," promised to the faithful 
overcomers. 

God covenants with those justified by faith in the redemption 
which is in Christ Jesus, that if they consecrate and sacrifice 
themselves wholly to his service, he will give them, at once, 
"exceeding great and precious promises," and in the future the 
blessed realities. Our little all is indeed a meager pittance. How 
little remains of our three-score- years-and-ten! how little of 
mental vigor! how little of physical strength! how little of 
money and influence! And yet that little all, however great or 
insignificant it is to us, is all that God requires in exchange for 
his great favor. It is by no means an exchange of equivalent 
values, but it is nevertheless an exchange which will prove to 
the fullest extent our love and devotion to God. 

We confess that it is a great bargain— such exceeding riches and 
glory for a price so mean as to be unworthy to be compared with 
it; and yet shall we, like Ananias and Sapphira, be found 
endeavoring to keep back part of the price? 



According to our covenant, we should do our best to use in 
Jehovah's service "all our mind, all our soul, and all our 
strength," which of course includes the products of these— all our 
influence, all our money and all our time as well. Yet how apt 
are we in action to say to the Lord— I know it is cheap, but can 
you not take a little less? I think you will not deny me the prize, 
even though I keep back part of the price. 

Thus many desire a crown of life and glory, if they can get it 
cheap; if they can get it for less than their little all; if they can 
hold on to their money, their good name, and fare none the less 
and if possible a little better than formerly. O shame! such 
meanness, such a low appreciation of our Father's grace, is 
unworthy of the high exaltation to which we are called. And 
surely, if our own hearts condemn us as unworthy because of the 
incompleteness of our sacrifice, the Lord, before whom all 
hearts are open, and who is looking for a loyal and loving bride 
whose heart is already wedded to his, and who counts no 
possible sacrifice too great to express the strength of her 
devotion to him, will not choose such. He does not desire for 
that blessed relationship one who is mean and selfish. 

Consider well, therefore, dearly beloved, what the sacrifice of 
all implies to you; consider it, not in the light of your past 
conduct and that of other professors, but in the light of your 
covenant and of the examples of our Lord and the apostles; and 
count not your ease, your comfort, your good name, your 
friends, your property, your business, your money, your health, 
your life, or anything dear to you; but, esteeming them all as 
dross in comparison, be zealous in your endeavor to 

R1170:page7 

testify your love and devotion by your deeds as well as by your 
words. If you are loyal and zealous, be not surprised if you are 
counted fanatical. Men esteem those fanatical who think and act 
outside the beaten track of custom, and in whose course they see 
no reasonable end in view; but we must think and act as seeing 
him who is invisible and the glory and honor of being joined 
with him as co-heirs and co-laborers— reasons which the world 
and worldly church cannot appreciate and which are therefore 
foolishness unto them. 

Selfishness, while detestable always, is especially so in 
connection with our covenant relationship to God. Let us rather 
be very ambitious to increase our capacity that we may thereby 
increase our service and sacrifice, saying with the Apostle: "I 
count all things but refuse, for the excellency of the knowledge 
of Christ Jesus my Lord; for whom I have suffered the loss of all 
things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ... that I 
might know him and [experience] the power of HIS 
RESURRECTION [to spiritual being], and the fellowship of his 
sufferings, being made conformable unto his death: If by any 



means I might attain unto THE resurrection out from among the 
dead. "-Phil. 3:8-11. 

"This is the first [chief] resurrection," and it includes all the 
overcomers of the Gospel age— all the blessed and holy. These 
are they who are gladly sacrificing all they have in the service of 
the Lord and the truth, who are not trying to keep back part of 
the price in violation of their covenant. "They shall be mine, 
saith the Lord, in the day that I come to make up my jewels"— 
the covenant-keeping sacrificers. (See, Psa. 50:5 and Mai. 3:17.) 
These shall be with the Lord and behold and share his glory. 
"They that are with him are called and chosen and faithful. "-- 
Rev. 17:14. 

As we seek to be just toward God in fulfilling our covenant, our 
hearts will be drawn into closer and closer union with our 
Lord's, and we shall become more generous, less selfish, in our 
dealings with our fellow-men. It will lead us nearer and nearer 
to that grand statement, that golden rule, of our duty to our 
fellow-men, voiced by our great Teacher— Do unto others as you 
would that they should do unto you. And obedience to this rule 
will work a blessing upon ourselves also; for if we learn to deal 
generously and justly with our fellow- men, it will help us also to 
exercise the same principle in our dealings with God. 

Let us, then, learn to be just in carrying out our own obligations, 
and generous in our exactions from others. And while so dealing 
with God and our neighbor, let us not forget the same rule in our 
homes. It is surprising and lamentable that many show less 
justice and less generosity in their dealings with their own 
families than with others, and are more willing to take advantage 
of their own flesh and blood than of others. No wonder that such 
lose influence over each other and lose respect for one another. 

Beloved, let us more and more strive to be God- like,— just and 
generous.

ROME AGGRESSIVE. 



Although Protestant Churches have been engaged in the Punjab 
with constantly increasing numbers and efficiency ever since Dr. 
J. C. Lowry entered the field in 1832, the Romanists had until 
this year left the territory uninvaded in so far as work amongst 
the Hindus and Mussulmans is concerned. But in these latter 
days a golden opportunity seems to have been descried in the 
turning of the masses to Christ-the result of long years of 
patient, prayerful effort on the part of Protestant Christendom. 

Sialkote has been fixed upon as a center. Priests-I know not 
how many— have begun the visitation of the Christians in the 



outlying villages, and do not scruple to employ most 
questionable means to win the people and induce them to enter 
the fold of Rome. Money, it is said, is being freely used, and no 
less than six hundred perverts from Protestantism to Romanism 
have been made. It is true that the Protestant missionaries may 
take comfort from the reflection that those who have gone from 
them are the tares which were choking the wheat; nevertheless 
they cannot but realize that they have a new enemy to fight and 
that troublous times are before them. The Catholics make no 
pretense of preaching the gospel to the non-Christian population, 
but unblushingly avow as their policy the proselytizing of those 
who have been brought to a knowledge of the truth through the 
efforts of Protestants. -Presbyterian Banner.

EXTRACTS FROM 
INTERESTING LETTERS. 

Liberia, West Coast of Africa. 

DEAR BROTHER IN CHRIST:-I am glad to advise you of our 
compliance with the request of the heathen chief at Gramay, 
referred to in my letter to you, as the one who had sent for us to 
baptize him. On Sunday Brothers Brunot, Brown, Clark and 
myself went down to the appointed place on the beach. 

Instead of one candidate, we found two ready to outwardly 
symbolize their union with the Lord by immersion. These we 
examined as to their faith in Christ's death as their redemption- 
price, and found fit subjects for baptism into his name, and 
immersed them into the name of Christ, in the presence of the 
whole town-people who came out to witness the ceremony. 

The baptized having changed their dresses, we had a divine 
service in the open air, and I preached to the congregation from 
John 3:16; and Rom. 6:3,4. After which Brother Bruno spoke- 
indorsing and confirming the sermon, which we hoped had 
made a lasting impression upon the people. 

Having made the two converts, we, after the manner of the 
apostles, resolved to hold weekly service here, in order to feed 
our "new born babes" in Christ who desire and need the sincere 
milk of the Word that they may grow thereby. — 1 Cor. 3:1; 1 
Pet. 2:2. 

Before leaving the town, we had a strong assurance from the 
people that ere long we will be called upon to baptize more 
people therein. May the good Lord give us grace to be faithful in 
the harvest work for his own glory, and crown our feeble efforts 
with such success as will most honor him. 

Yours in Christ's service, S. W. SETON.

TOWER TRACT SOCIETY:-I am entirely unable to express 
my gratitude for the help received from you since first I saw a 
copy of ZION'S WATCH TOWER. I have been receiving the 
TOWER, etc., by your generosity since 1887. I find great 
satisfaction in reading it, although unable to pay for it. I wish I 
were able to materialize my gratitude into dollars. 

Not long ago I received a book entitled "The Time is at Hand. " 
My feelings will never be expressed. I lifted my heart in prayer 
to God that he might reward and bless his servants and 
instruments, the givers. Later I received a tract called "The Old 
Theology," treating on a subject which has given me more 
trouble than all my afflictions and other troubles beside-"Do the 
Scriptures Teach that Eternal Torment is the Wages of Sin?" 

I am so glad to know that God is too good to create or permit 
such a terrible place as some describe hell to be. 

I don't like to beg, but if you feel disposed to send me anything 
to read, it will be thankfully received, and it may be, by and by, 
you will be rewarded by me. You will be, if I should get so I can 
work. I don't know what to do ! I seem to be almost alone, as 
people here can't see things as I now do. I have been compelled 
to withdraw from the M.P. church, as their doctrine and 
traditions seemed so adverse to Bible teaching. 

Again I say, God bless you in your labor of Love. I am 
gratefully yours, 

S. C. J . 

Bay View. 

DEAR FRIENDS:- Your book, MILLENNIAL DAWN, was 

given me to read by our friend, Mr. Barnes. After reading once 
and proving it, as I went along, I had no peace of mind until I 
read it the second time. The light began to come with the first 
reading, but I began to shrink from the sacrifice, and then Satan 
took his chance to torment and tempt me, saying, It is well 
enough to read the book but it is not necessary to give up your 
church. Shut your eyes and ears when they preach doctrine 
contrary to what you now think true. I let the book alone and 
went to church as usual, when I could, but I was not satisfied. I 
then said, I will ask my Savior to guide me and show me the 
way so plainly I could not go astray, and, thank God, my eyes 
were opened and I commenced to read the book over, and it 
seemed to me I was so rejoiced, I wanted to send the glad 
tidings to everybody. I am reading the second volume and am 
ready to give up everything for my Savior. I ask him to guide 
me into all truth. I do not get much time to read or write, but 
thought, after the little ones were asleep, I must at least try to let 
you know, and to subscribe for the TOWER. I had hoped to 
send for the Diaglott as well, but I must wait a little while longer 



for it. I enclose money for the TOWER; for the balance please 
send some Old Theology Tracts. Wishing you joy in the service 
of the Master, I am Your Friend, 

Mrs. E. C . 

Allegan, Mich. 

DEAR BROTHER IN CHRIST:-I have read with pleasure 
MILLENNIAL DAWN, Vols. I. and II. When I began to read 
Vol. I. it was through mere curiosity. I was prejudiced against 
your writings before I read them, because I well knew then, as I 
also know now, that the world is being flooded with worthless 
writings of sectarians, to build up some fence to separate the 
freeborn children of God; but, thank God, I found it not so in the 
DAWN, but the reverse. I found it to be true. Thank God that I 
read DAWN, Vol. I. It created a thirsting for the second volume, 
which I received and read with pleasure. It has, indeed, been 
food to me. I have believed and preached much of the doctrine 
contained in DAWN for the last twelve years, and now I feel 
strengthened to go on telling the good tidings of the wonderful 
things that will shortly take place. I am glad to read in the 
WATCH TOWER of so many coming out of Babylon. Enclosed 
find 25 cents 

page 8 

for another copy of DAWN, Vol. II., paper covered, for a friend. 

Your brother in Christ, S. S . 

Michigan. 

GENTLEMEN:-By the kindness of a friend a volume, entitled 
MILLENNIAL DAWN, was handed to me. I have carefully read 
it three times; and I am much, very much, pleased with its 
contents. They meet my preconceived ideas, from my many 
years of study of God's Word. Raised by Roman Catholic 
parents and educated in that religion with a design to the 
ministry, I with God's help read myself out of it. But for 35 
years I have been like Noah's dove. Sects confused my mind and 
infidelity offered no cure. So I have tried to live the true life 
outside of them all. 

I would like to have more light; but I am poor in this world's 
goods, but thankful that you remember the poor, as the true 
follower of the Lord always does. I, therefore, address you in 
hopes to receive more light at your hands. Will you kindly send 
me the second volume of MILLENNIAL DAWN, also any 
tracts or papers you think good for me or others to read. 

I have for many years held forth the Word in my own weak way, 
but with no organization to back me, and found it hard, uphill 
work. Thank God for help in your publications. 

Hoping to hear from you soon, I subscribe myself yours truly in 
the one hope of Eternal Life, 



J. H. DONNELON. 

Kansas. 

DEAR FRIENDS :-I have been very much strengthened and 
encouraged by the clear, pointed and abundant evidence which 
DAWN, Vol. II., discloses of Christ's presence and the final end 
of Gentile times and the setting up of Christ's kingdom. O what 
a stimulant to faithfulness when we can see the preparations 
going on all around us for the ushering in of that glad day. 
While the time in some sense looks long, yet I believe that the 
industrious faithful-ones will find intervening time well filled up 
with the unfolding of truth and light of the dawning Day, so as 
to be continually feasted and refreshed. Seeing what we do, we 
may well lift up our heads and rejoice and be glad, not only that 
we shall be so greatly blessed, but that the whole groaning 
creation shall also be blessed at that Day. 

I am reading Vol. II. through the third time. The opposition and 
trial I daily meet with, both at home, in my own house, and in 
the world, is no less bitter and determined, yet I rejoice greatly 
that my strength to bear them is increasing. I believe, as you say, 
after awhile we will be made fire-proof, and this we are to some 
extent already through prayer. That your usefulness in feeding 
the little flock may be continued to the end, I am yours in the 
truth and light of those lively hopes. 

A. B. PERINE 

P.S. Enclosed I send you $3 to apply in keeping my subscription 
good for TOWER -balance for tract fund.

A Brother in the Lord, whom Brother Adamson was largely 
instrumental in interesting in the Truth and in its service, writes 
to him as follows of his new experience as a colporteur, with 
DAWN. Just as he was starting out he suffered earthly loss in 
the great conflagration which destroyed the town of Spokane 
Falls, W.T. 

DEAR BROTHER ADAMSON:-Your kind postal came to us 
in due time, but while in a state of much confusion, on account 
of the fire at Spokane. You will not be surprised, if I should tell 
you that every dollar I have been able to save since I met you in 
Indianapolis has gone up in smoke. Our loss in dollars, as best 
we could foot it up, is $840. No insurance. 

We will say no more about this now, as, doubtless, you wish to 
know what we are doing. I say we, Mrs. H. and myself, for she 
is with me, preferring to share the pleasures and displeasures to 
which we are subjected. We have not been altogether idle, but, 
that we are in the harvest now, bless the Lord. We arrived here a 
few days ago, equipped with all the armor which our Father in 
his infinite goodness has seen fit to give us, and with hearts full 



of love to our blessed Savior and our fellow-creatures. We put 
out Arp slips a part of two days, going out Saturday with 
DAWNS, rather timid at first, but taking fresh courage as we 
went from house to house, Mrs. H. taking one side of the street 
and I the other. You would be encouraged to see with what vim 
and cheerfulness she goes about the work, which we followed 
closely all day, working about 8 hours, and selling 22 DAWNS. 
Very tired at night, this being the first. Becoming acquainted 
with the Pastor of the United Brethren Church, I was asked to 
preach for them. Accepting the invitation, I did so in the evening 
(Sunday), to a very attentive audience, the announcement having 
been given out at morning service. This was my first sermon 
from an orthodox pulpit. I will preach on next Sunday, at 3 
P.M., to the prisoners at the State Prison, God willing. This may 
not reach you by that time; however, let your prayers be that the 
good seed sown may bring forth an hundred fold. May we have 
your daily prayers for God's blessing upon our weak efforts in 
the work out here. Monday, the 14th inst., not working all day, 
sold 33 DAWNS, making 55 sold, leaving 45 on hand. Thus you 
see we shall soon be out of DAWNS, so we order 200 more to 
this place, sending to the Tower Publishing Co. money for these 
and for two TOWER subscriptions. 

Mrs. H. is very much delighted with traveling and selling 
DAWNS. Our little girl, Georgia, is at Corvalis, Oregon, going 
to school, and we are free from the common hindrances of this 
life, and thank God for his kind providence. We are at work 
selling DAWN and talking of the truth as we have opportunity. 

I have many things to ask you, but can not worry you any 
longer. Mrs. H. joins in love to Mrs. A. and yourself. Write as 
you have opportunity. 

Yours in Christian Fellowship and Work, 

H. H. HYATT. 

Portsmouth. 

DEAR BRO. RUSSELL:-Until the glad tidings came to me 
through DAWN, doubt and unbelief held sway. I could never 
reconcile God's Word and love with orthodox teachings, and 
consequently was groping in darkness. After a careful reading 
and study of The Plan of the Ages, I am convinced that it is the 
key to the proper interpretation of the Scriptures. Harmony 
could never prevail to the extent it does, unless truth were the 
foundation. My whole nature has been changed in reference to 
the future, and I can now serve God through love, without a fear 
that when I am laid away I will be consigned to eternal torment. 
I now see clearly that God has something grand in store— an 
accumulation of six thousand years of work, all for the benefit 
of our race during the next thousand. What a glorious time the 
Millennium will bring to those who want to be saved. 



I enclose an order to the TOWER CO. for fifteen copies each of 
DAWN, Volumes I. and II., which I want for friends and 
neighbors. 

Yours in hope, 

C. W. W .

OLD THEOLOGY TRACTS. 



These tracts are published quarterly, at a very low price, by the 
Tower Tract Society. They are designed for general circulation 
among Christian people. They are on live topics, calculated to 
awaken interest in the study of God's Word and plan. 

All of God's children, interested, are welcome to assist in this 
work in any way they may choose. These as pebbles from the 
brook may do more sometimes in the hands of God's faithful 
than can greater institutions. (1 Sam. 17:40.) Let this "hail" be 
freely scattered— not to injure but to liberate and bless God's 
people and to bring them out of the short beds of human 
tradition, whose narrow hopes expose them ever to the chills of 
fear and hinder true rest and confidence and trust. (Isa. 28:19- 
21.) These tracts we believe are helping many, delivering them 
from the torment of fear (which must be "a vexation unto them, 
until He shall make them to understand doctrine") into the light 
and liberty and love of a fuller appreciation of their Father's 
character and plan. 

TOPICS TREATED. 

No. 1-Do the Scriptures Teach that Eternal Torment is the 
Wages of Sin? No. 2-Calami ties, -Why God Permits Them. No. 
3-Protestants, Awake!-How Priestcraft Now Operates. 

TERMS ON OLD THEOLOGY TRACTS. 

For terms see second page of each tract. 



The Tract Society offers as follows:— It will supply five tracts, 
quarterly, free, to each of the Lord's Poor of the Watch Tower 
List, or one tract, quarterly, to any poor person who may write 
mentioning this offer. 

*** 

The Tract Society also offers to employ 



CHILD-COLPORTEURS. 

to sell these Tracts. They may sell them at the popular price of 
one cent each, at which rate hundreds can be sold everywhere— 
in depots, stores, street-cars and at the door-step. For use in this 
particular way, the tracts will be supplied 50 assorted for 25

"THE PLAN OF THE AGES." 

MILLENNIAL DAWN, VOL. I. 

This work is specially designed to make plain the divine plan. It 
begins at the beginning of the subject, by establishing the faith 
of the reader in God and the Bible as his revelation, and 
proceeds to trace the glorious plan therein revealed, and to show 
which parts of that plan are already accomplished, and which 
will be accomplished during the Millennial age, the manner of 
its introduction, and its objects and methods. 

We know of nothing to compare with this book, as a "Bible 
Key"-" A Helping Hand for Bible Students." The One Hundred 
and Twentieth Thousand is now on the press, and many who 
have read it carefully and prayerfully, declare that if they could 
not obtain another they would not part with their copy, and the 
hopes it has enkindled, for millions. 

It contains 352 pages, clear type, good paper, etc. Price in cloth 
covers $1.00 (or together with one year's subscription to this 
journal, Zion's Watch Tower, $1.25). Price in paper covers 25 
cents, reduced from 50 cents to bring it within reach of all. 
These prices include postage. 

Only Watch Tower subscribers are desired to act as colporteurs 
or agents for this book, and to thus preach with each book 
sixteen sermons more effectively than in any other way, and to 
classes not otherwise accessible. Some loan these books in 
quantities, others give them to their friends, and others sell them. 
The latter plan is often best, because people will more surely 
read what they have paid something for. 

Some of our readers, who can afford it, pay the above low prices 
by the hundred copies, and some do more and contribute to the 
TOWER TRACT FUND, enabling us to make the following 
terms on the paper covered books to those whose circumstances 
are such that they can greatly increase their time and labor in 
this work by taking advantage of the allowance, as all 
subscribers are at liberty and welcome to do, each according to 
his own judgment. 



The terms to Colporteurs are as follows:— To such as desire 
these books for loaning or giving away, and to those who can 
spend more of their time in selling them by reason of this 
arrangement, the Tract Fund grants an allowance of 10 cents per 
book, in lots of not less than 10 books AT A TIME- that is 
$1.50 for 10 books, $3.00 for 20, etc. This allowance is made to 
enable those of limited means to do more in the work of 
spreading the truth than they could otherwise do. 

To such as give their entire time to this ministry of the truth, 
traveling from town to town and engaging in no other business 
for support, the Tract Fund grants an allowance of 12-1/2 cents 
per copy (called "Expense Money" to pay the traveling and 
living expenses of colporteurs), -in lots of not less than 20 books 
AT A TIME-that is $2.50 for 20 books, $5.00 for 40, etc. 

When ordering state plainly which terms you accept, otherwise 
we shall reckon 25 cents each. 

A GERMAN TRANSLATION OF THE ABOVE AT SAME 
PRICES AND ON SAME TERMS, except that colporteurs will 
be permitted to order one half the minimum quantities, -5 for 75 
cents, etc., or to regular colporteurs 10 for $1.25. 



"THE TIME IS AT HAND." 

MILLENNIAL DAWN, VOL. II. 

[In English only.] 

Prices are terms same as Vol. I. This volume is intended only 
for those who have carefully and thoroughly studied Vol. I. All 
such whose interest is awakened, will surely want this volume 
and succeeding ones which are in course of preparation, as well 
as the regular issues of the WATCH TOWER. 

FOREIGN TERMS. 

Though foreign postage is higher, we must not increase the 
price; for money elsewhere is more scarce among the poor than 
here, and the poor we want specially to reach, since we know 
that "not many rich or great" are among the Lord's chosen. 

Our foreign friends may, therefore, hereafter, reckon our terms 
in English money, thus:- 

25 cents = 1 shilling. 50 cents = 2 shillings. 

$1.00 = 4 shillings. $1.25 = 5 shillings. 1.50 = 6 shillings. 

2.50 = 10 shillings. 3.00 = 12 shillings. 5.00 = 20 shillings. 

Upon this arrangement the WATCH TOWER will hereafter be 
2 shillings instead of 3 shillings per year. 



CREDIT FOR THE POOR. 

Those unable to purchase the Dawn (and there are some we 
find— even at this low price) can have a copy of either volume on 
loan, upon promise to read it and to return it. 

All who would engage in the work of ministering as colporteurs, 
but who lack the means to purchase the quantities mentioned 
above, can take their sample book and begin by taking orders, 
payable on delivery. If you can write us that you have secured 
orders for 5 we will let you have 10 books on credit; if you get 
orders for 10 we are willing to let you have 20; if you get 20 we 
will let you have 40 books on credit. 



Write your order on a separate piece of paper from that upon 
which your letter is written. Write very plainly— especially your 
name and address. The name of the town is not always the same 
as the name of the post office: be sure to give the name of the 
Post Office to which you wish books sent. Give us plenty of 
time by ordering several days before you want the books, as we 
are very busy.

THE EMPHATIC DIAGLOTT. 

We are in receipt of many letters asking, whether this work is of 
any value to English readers who have no knowledge of the 
Greek. We answer, Yes; it is specially designed for such: and 
the Diaglott, together with Young's Analytical Concordance, are 
worth more than a year's study of the Greek. Both should be in 
the hands of every Bible student; but if you cannot afford both, 
the Diaglott is the most valuable-indeed almost indispensable. 

Many orders come for the Diaglott from persons not subscribers 
to the TOWER, and for extra copies for friends from those who 
are subscribers. Hence, we must explain particularly, why we 
can supply this work to TOWER subscribers only, and to these 
only one copy each, at the special price $1.50. The reasons are 
as follows: 

Some years ago a Brother, who is a great friend to the TOWER, 
and a great admirer of the Emphatic Diaglott also, suggested 
that, Every student of God's plan, as presented in the TOWER, 



ought to have the aid which the Diaglott affords. The difficulty 
which seemed to stand in the way was, that it is of necessity an 
expensive work (Retail price in cloth binding $4.00, postage 16 
cts. = $4.16.) and the great majority of our readers are far from 
wealthy, like the majority of the saints in all ages. To meet this 
difficulty, the Brother proposed to the TOWER PUB. CO., that, 
if they would be at the trouble and expense of mailing the books, 
he would supply one copy each to all TOWER subscribers, at a 
price to bring the book with the reach of all, viz. $1.50, 
including postage. 

This was begun when our subscription list was much smaller 
than now, and is still continued: New readers of either 
DIAGLOTT or TOWER need both. Subscribers will please save 
us the annoyance of refusing, and returning their money, by 
ordering only one copy of the Diaglott: unless your first copy 
has worn out,-in which case, in ordering another, mention this 
fact. The only way for others to get the book at this special price 
is to subscribe for the TOWER: and the Diaglott must be mailed 
direct to the subscriber and not to another person. 



YOUNG'S ANALYTICAL CONCORDANCE. 

Our supply of this valuable work, at $3.50, is now exhausted. 
Hereafter, we can give our subscribers the benefit of a wholesale 
price only, as competitive editions are about exhausted, and the 
"Author's Edition" is able to command its price,-which, the 
value of the work considered, is very cheap. The retail price of 
the book is $5.00, with postage 55 cents added-$5.55. Our price 
to our readers will hereafter be $4.25 by mail, postage prepaid 
by us; or $3.70, if sent by express at your charges. As it is quite 
a large volume (weight seven pounds), it will be cheapest for 
most purchasers, to get it by mail. 



LEESER'S TRANSLATION OF THE O.T. 

This is a translation of the Old Testament Scriptures into the 
English language by a Hebrew. It is chiefly valuable for 
comparison in studying. This lot we can supply— postage paid by 
us-at $1.50, in sheep binding.

Our meetings are held in G.A.R. Hall, over the Third National

friends will be warmly welcomed. Preaching every Lords-day

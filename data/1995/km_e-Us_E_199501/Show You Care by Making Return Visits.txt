Show You Care by Making Return Visits
1 Searching out interested persons from door to door demonstrates your desire to give others the opportunity to hear the Kingdom message. So be sure to follow up the literature placements you make during the month of January, as this is a fine way to show you care about others.
2 If you left the book “Let Your Kingdom Come,” you could try to resume your conversation this way:
▪ “Previously we talked about God’s Kingdom and what it will do for us. That Kingdom will soon make this earth a paradise. Since we have never seen a paradise, it may be hard to visualize it. Here is what it might look like. [Refer to the illustration on pages 4 and 5.] Such a paradise is promised in the Bible.” Read Psalm 72:7. If there is interest, turn to page 175, paragraphs 3 and 4, and point out what we must do if we want to live in the coming Paradise.
3 Here is a suggestion for following up your placements of the book “Happiness​—How to Find It”:
▪ “All of us would like to be happy. Many feel that genuine happiness is an impossibility in this world. How do you feel about that? [Allow for response.] It has been said that happiness is a state of mind. If our minds are filled with love for others, respect for God, and a sure hope for the future, we can experience genuine happiness in spite of our problems.” Read Psalm 119:1, 2. Explain that a study of the Bible teaches us how to love others, show respect for God, and find a comforting hope for the future.
4 You might follow up a placement of the book “True Peace and Security​—How Can You Find It?” with a brief presentation something like this:
▪ “World leaders today have been unable to bring peace and security. Jehovah God is the only one who can do that. The Bible shows us what we need to do. [Discuss points in paragraphs 1 and 2 on page 175, and then read Isaiah 26:4.] I’d like to show you how this book can help you.”
5 You might follow up a placement of the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?” with this suggestion:
▪ “Previously I left you a copy of this brochure, which raises a vital question: ‘Does God really care about us?’ After reviewing this brochure, what conclusion did you come to? [Allow for response.] Likely you were encouraged by reading the scriptures that promise a paradise new world, where we can live in peace. [Show the illustrations on pages 2 and 3, and point out some of the appealing features of the new world.] I feel sure that you and your loved ones would like to live in such a world. Notice what paragraph 16 on page 31 says about this.” Read the paragraph, and point out that searching for Jehovah means learning more about him and his purposes by studying his Word, the Bible.
6 Jehovah has set a perfect example as a loving Shepherd who cares for his sheep. (Ezek. 34:11-14) Our sincere effort to imitate his loving care pleases him, demonstrates our love, and brings blessings to others.

Making Good Use of Our Older Books
1 Jehovah has provided us with an abundance of rich spiritual food. Much of this material has been in the form of 192-page books that have been published in recent years. During January we will be offering any 192-page book that was published prior to 1982. Do you have some of these at home that are still in good condition? Does the congregation have some in stock? If so, it would be good to review their contents and pick out some talking points you can use in your presentation.
2 If you are using the book “Let Your Kingdom Come,” you might begin by saying:
▪ “Christians have prayed for the coming of God’s Kingdom for almost 2,000 years. What do you think the Kingdom will do for mankind? [Allow for response. Turn to the box on page 25, and point out some of the blessings that will be realized under Kingdom rule.] This book discusses things the Kingdom will accomplish and explains how you and your loved ones can benefit. If you would like to read it, I will be pleased to leave you a copy.”
3 If you are featuring the book “Happiness​—How to Find It,” you might try this approach:
▪ “Most people have difficulty finding happiness in this world because there are so many problems. Do you think it is possible to be happy under present conditions? [Allow for response. Turn to page 41, and point out some common problems that give us cause for anxiety.] The Bible shows how we can cope with these problems and eventually enjoy unending happiness in a peaceful new world. [Turn to page 190, and read Isaiah 32:17, 18.] The Bible gives specific counsel that can help us find greater happiness in living. This book reviews that counsel and explains how we can apply it.”
4 If you are using the book “True Peace and Security​—How Can You Find It?,” you might like to try this:
▪ “Everyone would like to live in a world where there is peace and security. Sad to say, we have not experienced that in our lifetime. What do you think we need to do to make peace and security a reality? [Allow for response.] God has the power to bring peace to this earth, and he has promised that he will do it.” Turn to the picture on page 98, and then read Micah 4:3, 4. If there is good response, explain more about the Kingdom hope, offer the book, and make arrangements for a return visit.
5 You might choose to use the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?” If so, you could say this:
▪ “Many people wonder why God permits so much suffering in the world. Since he is almighty, why doesn’t he do something to bring an end to our distress? How do you feel? [Allow for response.] The Bible assures us that God has not abandoned us.” Turn to page 27, paragraph 22, and read Psalm 37:11, 29. Point out the appealing illustration depicting what we can look forward to. If the brochure is accepted, offer to return to show how it can be used for Bible study.
6 Our literature has motivated thousands of people to examine the Bible more closely. What they have learned has brought them hope for a happy future. (Ps. 146:5) It is our privilege to help them.

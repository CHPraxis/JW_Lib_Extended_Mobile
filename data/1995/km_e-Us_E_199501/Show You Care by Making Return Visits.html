<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “Previously we talked about God’s Kingdom and what it will do for us. That Kingdom will soon make this earth a paradise. Since we have never seen a paradise, it may be hard to visualize it. Here is what it might look like. [Refer to the illustration on pages 4 and 5.] Such a paradise is promised in the Bible.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:7-19:72:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 72:7</a>.

[Discuss points in paragraphs 1 and 2 on page 175, and then read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:4-23:26:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 26:4</a>.] I’d like to show you how this book can help you.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>You might follow up a placement of the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?” with this suggestion:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “Previously I left you a copy of this brochure, which raises a vital question: ‘Does God really care about us?’ After reviewing this brochure, what conclusion did you come to? [Allow for response.] Likely you were encouraged by reading the scriptures that promise a paradise new world, where we can live in peace. [Show the illustrations on pages 2 and 3, and point out some of the appealing features of the new world.] I feel sure that you and your loved ones would like to live in such a world. Notice what paragraph 16 on page 31 says about this.” Read the paragraph, and point out that searching for Jehovah means learning more about him and his purposes by studying his Word, the Bible.</p>

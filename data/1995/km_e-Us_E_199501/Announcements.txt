Announcements
▪ Literature to be used during January: Any 192-page book published prior to 1982 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that do not have the older books in stock should offer True Peace and Security​—How Can You Find It? February: You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth will be featured. Placements of this book should be followed up with return visits, and efforts should be made to start Bible studies. March: Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! April and May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. For territory that is covered frequently, any brochure (except the School brochure) may be used. Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. NOTE: Congregations that have not yet requested the above-mentioned campaign items should do so on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S-14). The pre-1982 publications mentioned above are not available in Brooklyn.
▪ Congregations should make convenient arrangements to celebrate the Memorial this year on Friday, April 14, after sundown. While it is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial celebration, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. The Memorial should not start so late that newly interested people find it inconvenient to attend. Further, the schedule should not be so tight that there is no time before or after the celebration to greet visitors, make arrangements for continued spiritual assistance for some, or enjoy a general interchange of encouragement. After thoroughly considering all factors, the elders should decide what arrangements will best help those who attend the Memorial to benefit fully from the occasion.
▪ On Sunday, April 23, 1995, a special public talk will be given in all congregations. The title will be “False Religion’s End Is Near.” Be sure to invite all those who attend the Memorial this year. A special effort will be made to help the millions of students with whom home Bible studies are being conducted. Information to be presented following the meeting that day will stimulate them and our brothers in general to anticipate having a share in distributing a special tract. At the same time, it will point out problems individuals are facing and the need to act decisively in accord with God’s Word.
▪ Starting in February, and no later than March 5, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Divine Teaching Triumphs Worldwide.” This will be a slide presentation highlighting the special international “Divine Teaching” Conventions that were held during the 1993 and 1994 service years. In those areas where the slides will not be made available until a later date, circuit overseers will give the talk “Trust in the God of All Comfort” and continue with it until such time as the slides are received. When all congregations have had the slide talk, circuit overseers will continue giving the talk “Trust in the God of All Comfort” until the next new circuit overseer talk is scheduled for early in 1996.
▪ At the Service Meeting the week of January 9, all baptized publishers present will have made available to them a personal copy of the Advance Medical Directive/​Release card and Identity Cards for their children.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Court Case  </strong>I cannot hold back from expressing my appreciation for the article “Christians Face Jerusalem’s High Court Again.” (November 8, 1994) I read it several times and was thrilled by what took place. Because Ariel Feldman took a firm position in favor of what is right, a marvelous witness was given.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Batteries  </strong>I work with batteries for a living and would like to thank you for the “Watching the World” item “Dangerous Batteries.” (August 22, 1994) But there was one important detail missing from the jump-​starting instructions given by <em>Snow Country </em>magazine, namely, that the black cable should be the last connection made.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>Thank you for the safety tip.​—ED.</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong><em>Awake! </em>Brings Comfort  </strong>I read the article “Magazines That Give Practical Comfort” (January 8, 1995), and I too have had success offering back issues of <em>Awake! </em>Generally people are grateful for any help they can get with their problems. One woman told me her son had Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. I placed the issue “Understanding Difficult Children” (November 22, 1994) with her, and she requested another 30 copies to share with friends!</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">After reading the article “Magazines That Give Practical Comfort,” I went through my older magazines to see if I could find some to leave with professionals. So far I have visited a day-​care center, a couple of funeral homes, a youth detention center, a public school, and the county board of education. I quickly ran out of magazines!</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>Singleness  </strong>Thank you for the article “The Bible’s Viewpoint: When Singleness Is a Gift.” (February 8, 1995) Where I live, marriage is a big thing; Christian brothers and sisters push you toward it. I never thought much about marriage until I turned 30. Then I started feeling the need for a companion. I am grateful to Jehovah for providing this article at a time when I felt I could no longer endure.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sj">E. M. A., United States</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Two years ago I became a pioneer, a full-​time evangelizer, and as time passes I realize more and more how satisfying it is to serve Jehovah “without distraction.” I decided to make room for singleness​—the article arrived at exactly the right time.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>Fads  </strong>In your article “Young People Ask . . . Fads​—Should I Jump on the Bandwagon?” (December 8, 1994), you mentioned tattooing. I was surprised that you did not make reference to the command at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:28-3:19:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:28</a>: “You must not put tattoo marking upon yourselves.”</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><em>These words do indeed give a measure of insight into God’s thinking on this matter. Of course, Christians are not under the Mosaic Law. </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:14-51:2:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><em>Colossians 2:14</em></a>) <em>Still, individuals would do well to bear this scripture in mind when deciding what to do in this regard. The reported health risks and the impression wearing a tattoo might give to others are additional factors that a Christian should weigh very seriously.​—ED.</em></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Six months ago I jumped on the fad bandwagon and hopped off with a tattoo on my ankle. Every time I look at my ankle, I am reminded of my decision. I can only wonder what doubts others might now have about my character. I also worry if I might be a cause for stumbling to others in the congregation. I’ll think more carefully next time the fad bandwagon pulls around.</p>

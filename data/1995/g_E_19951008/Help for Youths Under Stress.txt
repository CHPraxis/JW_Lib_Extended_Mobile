Help for Youths Under Stress
When a young girl in a New Jersey, U.S.A., school became upset and ran from the classroom, a classmate followed her to the girls’ room. “When I got to her,” the classmate said, “she was crying and told me about some of her family problems. Her parents were getting a divorce, and she said it was getting hard for her to concentrate on her schoolwork. She told me she wanted to run away from home.”
The classmate told the distressed girl that she would like to bring her the book Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work. The next day she did, circling for her friend such chapter titles as “Why Should I ‘Honor My Father and My Mother’?,” “Why Did Mom and Dad Split Up?,” “How Can I Cope With Peer Pressure?,” and “Should I Leave Home?”
“When I gave her the book,” the classmate said, “two other girls saw it and were curious. They asked if they too could have a copy. So I gave them each a copy of the book. Other kids in my class saw one of the girls flipping through the book, and they all wanted to see it. The book ended up traveling all around the classroom with the teacher’s approval.”
If you would like to have a copy of Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work or would like to have a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.

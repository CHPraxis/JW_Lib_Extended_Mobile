<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Commenting on the series in the February 22, 1995, <em>Awake!, </em>“A Better Understanding of Menopause,” a reader from Kentucky, U.S.A., wrote: “I recently attended a three-​hour seminar on this subject. It was put on by the education departments of two major hospitals. The program was very informative, but I learned more in 30 minutes by reading <em>Awake! </em>than I learned in three hours at the seminar (and it didn’t cost $15).”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Another reader of <em>Awake! </em>noted: “I’ve read a number of books and articles on menopause in the last three years. Afterward I always had unanswered questions. Your articles answered all my questions pertaining to this subject.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>Awake! </em>provides information that helps its readers cope with today’s problems. Most important, it builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful new world.

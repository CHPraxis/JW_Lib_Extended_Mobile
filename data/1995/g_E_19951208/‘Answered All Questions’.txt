‘Answered All Questions’
Commenting on the series in the February 22, 1995, Awake!, “A Better Understanding of Menopause,” a reader from Kentucky, U.S.A., wrote: “I recently attended a three-​hour seminar on this subject. It was put on by the education departments of two major hospitals. The program was very informative, but I learned more in 30 minutes by reading Awake! than I learned in three hours at the seminar (and it didn’t cost $15).”
Another reader of Awake! noted: “I’ve read a number of books and articles on menopause in the last three years. Afterward I always had unanswered questions. Your articles answered all my questions pertaining to this subject.”
Awake! provides information that helps its readers cope with today’s problems. Most important, it builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful new world.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">JEHOVAH rejoices in his creative works. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:31-19:104:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 104:31</a>) The deep satisfaction he derives from the act of creating is expressed at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 1:31</a>: “God saw everything he had made and, look! it was very good.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah did not keep this joy to himself. He gave Jesus the privilege of being the agent, or instrumentality, through whom all other things were created. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:3-43:1:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:16-51:1:17" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Colossians 1:16, 17</a>) As “a master worker,” Jesus was also “glad before [Jehovah] all the time.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:30-20:8:31" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:30, 31</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But creative ability does not exist only in heaven. “It is built into the human species,” writes Eugene Raudsepp in his book <em>How Creative Are You? </em>This is no coincidence, for man was made in God’s image. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:26" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 1:26</a>) Jehovah has thus endowed mankind with satisfying creative abilities.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">James 1:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Not surprisingly, therefore, the Bible speaks highly of singing, dancing, weaving, cooking, craftsmanship, and other creative endeavors. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:35:25-2:35:26" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Exodus 35:25, 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:8:13-9:8:13" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1 Samuel 8:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:6-9:18:7" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 18:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:2:13-14:2:14" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 2:13, 14</a>) Bezalel, a craftsman, used his talent in “designing devices” to assist in building the tabernacle. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:31:3-2:31:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Exodus 31:3, 4</a>) The shepherd Jabal may have been the inventor of the tent, a creative convenience for nomadic living. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:20-1:4:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 4:20</a>) David was not only a musician and a composer, but also a developer of new musical instruments. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:7:6-14:7:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 7:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:7:17-19:7:17" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Psalm 7:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:6:5-30:6:5" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Amos 6:5</a>) Miriam may have choreographed the jubilant dancing that celebrated the Israelites’ miraculous deliverance through the Red Sea.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:15:20-2:15:20" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Exodus 15:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Creativity is often an asset in promoting true worship. Jesus creatively employed illustrations and object lessons to communicate his message. His followers are likewise urged to “work hard in speaking and teaching.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:17-54:5:17" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:17</a>) Yes, their preaching work is not a mere routine. It is an art that requires creative teaching methods. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:6-51:4:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Colossians 4:6</a>) This is especially vital when teaching one’s children.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:6-5:6:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Ephesians 6:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Thus, Jehovah shares with others the joy that creating gives him. What a generous gift!</p>

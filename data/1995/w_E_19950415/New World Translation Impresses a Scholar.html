<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ACCORDING to classical Greek scholar Dr. Rijkel ten Kate, Dutch Bible translations fail to render certain words accurately. For example, in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:1-42:2:52" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke chapter 2</a>, we find three different Greek words (<em>breʹphos, pai·diʹon, </em>and <em>pais</em>) employed to describe the successive stages of Jesus’ growth. Each of these words has a different shade of meaning. However, in many Bibles, two or all three of these words are vaguely rendered “child.” What is the correct translation?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Dr. ten Kate explains that in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:12-42:2:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lu 2 verse 12</a> the Greek word <em>breʹphos </em>means “a newborn, or baby.” <em>Pai·diʹon, </em>used in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:27-42:2:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Lu 2 verse 27</a>, means “little boy or child,” and <em>pais, </em>found in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:43-42:2:43" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Lu 2 verse 43</a>, should be rendered “boy.” “As far as I know,” wrote Dr. ten Kate in the March 1993 issue of <em>Bijbel en Wetenschap </em>(Bible and Science), “not one Dutch translation has rendered this adequately, that is to say, completely in harmony with the original text.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Later, Dr. ten Kate was shown the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>which is available in 12 languages, including Dutch. His reaction? “I am very surprised,” he said, “that there is actually one Dutch Bible in which the different use of the three Greek words <em>breʹphos, pai·diʹon, </em>and <em>pais </em>is rightly taken into account.” Does the <em>New World Translation </em>translate these verses in harmony with the original Greek text? “Completely in agreement,” responds Dr. ten Kate.</p>

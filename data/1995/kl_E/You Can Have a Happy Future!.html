<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="qu"> 1, 2. What does your Creator want for you?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb">A WARM embrace from someone you love. Hearty laughter during a good meal with dear friends. The pleasure of watching your children cheerfully at play. Moments like these are bright spots in life. For many, however, life seems to present one serious problem after another. If that has been your experience, take heart.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[31]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>It is God’s will that you enjoy lasting happiness under the best conditions in wonderful surroundings. This is no mere dream, for God actually offers you the key to such a happy future. That key is knowledge.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="qu"> 3. What knowledge is the key to happiness, and why can we be sure that God can provide that knowledge?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>We are talking about a special kind of knowledge that is far greater than human wisdom. It is “the very knowledge of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:5-20:2:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:5</a>) Nearly 2,000 years ago, a Bible writer said: “Every house is constructed by someone, but he that constructed all things is God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:4-58:3:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 3:4</a>) Think of the knowledge that the Maker of all things must possess! The Bible says that God counts and names all the stars. What a staggering thought, since there are hundreds of billions of stars in our own galaxy, and astronomers say that there are about a hundred billion other galaxies! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:4-19:147:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 147:4</a>) God also knows all about <em>us, </em>so who else could provide better answers to life’s important questions?—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:30-40:10:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 10:30</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 4. Why should we expect God to provide instructions to guide us, and what book fills this need?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span><sup>4 </sup>Picture two men trying to repair their cars. Frustrated, one man throws down his tools. The other calmly corrects the problem, turns the ignition key, and smiles as the engine starts up and runs smoothly. You would not have a hard time guessing which of the two men had an instruction manual from the manufacturer. Does it not make sense that God would provide instructions to guide us in life? As you may know, the Bible claims to be just that—a book of instruction and guidance from our Creator, designed to impart the knowledge of God.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 5. How valuable is the knowledge that the Bible contains?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>If the Bible’s claim is true, think of what treasures of knowledge that book must contain! At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:1-20:2:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:1-5</a>, it urges us to seek wisdom, to dig for it as we would for a hidden treasure—not in the soil of human thinking, but in God’s own Word. If we search there, we will “find the very knowledge of God.” Since God understands our limitations and needs, he gives us instruction that will help us to lead peaceful, happy lives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:14-19:103:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 103:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Isaiah 48:17</a>) Furthermore, the knowledge of God offers us exciting good news.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>EVERLASTING LIFE!</strong></p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 6. What assurance did Jesus Christ give regarding the knowledge of God?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>The well-known historical figure Jesus Christ described this feature of the knowledge of God in clear terms. He said: “This means <em>everlasting life, </em>their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) Imagine—knowledge that leads to everlasting life!</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 7. What evidence is there that God did not intend for us to die?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Do not quickly dismiss everlasting life as a mere <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>dream. Instead, look at the way the human body is made. It is splendidly designed to taste, hear, smell, see, and feel. There is so much on the earth that delights our senses—delicious food, pleasant birdsong, fragrant flowers, beautiful scenery, delightful companionship! And our amazing brain is far more than a supercomputer, for it enables us to appreciate and enjoy all such things. Do you think that our Creator wants us to die and lose all of this? Would it not be more reasonable to conclude that he wants us to live happily and to enjoy life forever? Well, that is what the knowledge of God can mean for you.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>LIFE IN PARADISE</strong></p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 8. What does the Bible say about the future of mankind?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>What the Bible says about the future of the earth and mankind might be summed up in one word—Paradise! Jesus Christ spoke of it when he told a dying man: “You will be with me in Paradise.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 23:43</a>) The mention of Paradise no doubt brought to that man’s mind the happy state of our first parents, Adam and Eve. When God created them, they were perfect and lived in a gardenlike park that the Creator had designed and planted. It was fittingly called the garden of Eden, which name denotes pleasure.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 9. What was it like to live in the original Paradise?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>How delightful that garden was! It was a real paradise. Among its beautiful trees were those bearing delicious fruit. As Adam and Eve explored their domain, drank from its sweet waters, and gathered fruit from its trees, they had no reason to be anxious or fearful. Even animals posed no threat, for God had placed the man and his wife in loving dominion over all of them. In addition, the first human pair had vibrant health. As long as they remained obedient to God, an eternal, happy future lay before them. They were given the satisfying work of caring for their wonderful Paradise home. Further, God <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>gave Adam and Eve the mandate to “fill the earth and subdue it.” They and their offspring were to extend the borders of Paradise until our entire planet became a place of beauty and delight.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">10. When Jesus spoke of Paradise, what did he have in mind?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>When Jesus mentioned Paradise, however, he was not asking a dying man to think about the distant past. No, Jesus was speaking about the future! He knew that our entire earthly home would become a paradise. God would thus fulfill his original purpose for mankind and our earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:10-23:55:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:10, 11</a>) Yes, Paradise will be restored! And what will it be like? Let God’s Word, the Holy Bible, answer.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>LIFE IN THE RESTORED PARADISE</strong></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">11. In the restored Paradise, what will happen to sickness, old age, and death?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup><em>Sickness, old age, and death will no longer exist. </em>“At that time the eyes of the blind ones will be opened, and the very ears of the deaf ones will be unstopped. At that time the lame one will climb up just as a stag does, and the tongue of the speechless one will cry out in gladness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:5-23:35:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 35:5, 6</a>) “God himself will be with [mankind].

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">12. Why can we be sure that there will be no crime, violence, and wickedness in the future Paradise?</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">14, 15. What does the Bible say about housing, work, and food in the restored Paradise?</p>

After all, if you had the power to end the misery and injustice so prevalent in the world, would you not do so? Would we expect God to do less? Actually, the Bible speaks in vivid terms of a time when God will remove this strife-ridden system and replace it with a perfect, righteous rule. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>) But the Bible does much more than tell us about all of this.

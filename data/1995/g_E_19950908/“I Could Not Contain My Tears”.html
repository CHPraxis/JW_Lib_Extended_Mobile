<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“A few moments ago, I finished reading the brochure <em>When Someone You Love Dies, </em>and I could not contain my tears.” Why was Alicia, a Mexican lady, so affected by this publication? She answers: “The explanations and the experiences that it contains express the feelings that I had when my father died nine years ago and when I had a miscarriage about 18 months ago.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What particularly helped her in her anguish? The box entitled “Miscarriage and Stillbirth​—Mothers Grieve” and the sections “How Can I Live With My Grief?” and “How Can Others Help?”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Alicia also wrote: “The account regarding Lazarus’ resurrection was very touching and reaffirms in a vivid way my faith in the resurrection.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>.</p>

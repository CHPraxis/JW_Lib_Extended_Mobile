“I Could Not Contain My Tears”
“A few moments ago, I finished reading the brochure When Someone You Love Dies, and I could not contain my tears.” Why was Alicia, a Mexican lady, so affected by this publication? She answers: “The explanations and the experiences that it contains express the feelings that I had when my father died nine years ago and when I had a miscarriage about 18 months ago.”
What particularly helped her in her anguish? The box entitled “Miscarriage and Stillbirth​—Mothers Grieve” and the sections “How Can I Live With My Grief?” and “How Can Others Help?”
Alicia also wrote: “The account regarding Lazarus’ resurrection was very touching and reaffirms in a vivid way my faith in the resurrection.”​—John 5:28, 29.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A YOUNG woman from Arizona, U.S.A., said that she had been a churchgoer but had become disillusioned with religion. She finally told God in prayer: “I’m not going to any more churches. I’m going to live my life the best I know how, and I will try to be a good person.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The woman explained what happened later: “My aunt telephoned and said that she would be in the area to attend a special assembly day of Jehovah’s Witnesses. She asked whether she and my cousins could spend the night at my apartment. And she asked: ‘Would you like to go with us?’ I remember my reply: ‘Why not? I have nothing better to do.’ My interest in religion was nearly dead.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I was always told to be cautious of Jehovah’s Witnesses. So during the assembly, I remember being very observant. Yet, there was no mystery regarding what was being said about God’s original purpose to have a paradise earth and that God’s purpose hadn’t changed. I sat there with this warm feeling as I observed families sitting together and displaying such a spirit of unity. I bowed my head and quietly asked God: ‘Is this the truth? Is this what I’ve been searching for?’</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“As I left that day, I watched people hugging and kissing good-​bye with smiles that lit up the place. I could see in their faces that there wasn’t a doubt in their mind or heart about their belief and about who Jehovah is and what he has done for them. From that day on, I started to attend the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses and haven’t stopped since. The following special assembly day, in 1988, I publicly symbolized my dedication to Jehovah by water baptism and became a part of this beautiful family.”</p>

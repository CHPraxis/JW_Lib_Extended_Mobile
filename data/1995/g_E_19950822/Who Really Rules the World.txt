Who Really Rules the World?
That arresting question is the title of a tract that is distributed by Jehovah’s Witnesses. Last year a woman from Mississippi, U.S.A., wrote: “When a young man asked me that question, I was undecided on my answer.” She noted: “It seemed to me that the world is hardly run as God would have it.”
Then she added: “I see from the Scriptures given in that tract that I had not fully understood before what the Bible tells us on that matter. One of our Christmas carols, ‘Joy to the World,’ says God rules the world, which, as a matter of truth, is deceptive.”
The woman concluded: “I do not usually write this sort of letter but felt you should be assured that in at least this instance, your work is appreciated.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses direct people to what the Bible says on important subjects that affect our lives. If you would like a copy of the above-​mentioned tract or desire a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.

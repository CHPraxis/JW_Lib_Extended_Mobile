<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That arresting question is the title of a tract that is distributed by Jehovah’s Witnesses. Last year a woman from Mississippi, U.S.A., wrote: “When a young man asked me that question, I was undecided on my answer.” She noted: “It seemed to me that the world is hardly run as God would have it.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Then she added: “I see from the Scriptures given in that tract that I had not fully understood before what the Bible tells us on that matter. One of our Christmas carols, ‘Joy to the World,’ says God rules the world, which, as a matter of truth, is deceptive.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The woman concluded: “I do not usually write this sort of letter but felt you should be assured that in at least this instance, your work is appreciated.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses direct people to what the Bible says on important subjects that affect our lives. If you would like a copy of the above-​mentioned tract or desire a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

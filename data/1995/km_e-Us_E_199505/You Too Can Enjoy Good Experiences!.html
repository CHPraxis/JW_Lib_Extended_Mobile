<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Some publishers always seem to have interesting, encouraging experiences to relate about a nice call or a return visit that has brought them much joy. Good experiences usually do not come by accident. Most are the result of diligent and sustained effort. They are not necessarily limited to publishers who are more fluent or more capable.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Here are some of the things that have been observed in those who have the most success: (1) They share in field service on a regular basis, usually several times each week, which assures them of many opportunities to make contact with interested persons; (2) they maintain a positive attitude toward householders, not concluding in advance that they will not respond; (3) they have an outgoing manner, displaying a warm, genuine interest in those who listen; (4) they are diligent and persistent in calling back on return visits as well as not-at-homes; and (5) they have the goal of starting Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">After analyzing your activity, perhaps you can see how you can enjoy more of those delightful experiences that do so much to make the ministry productive and satisfying.</p>

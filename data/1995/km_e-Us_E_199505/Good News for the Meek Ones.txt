Good News for the Meek Ones
1 We live in a time of impending judgment. (Ezek. 9:5, 6) It is urgent that meek people everywhere be informed so that they can prepare for what is coming. In his loving-kindness, Jehovah has commissioned his people “to tell good news to the meek ones.” (Isa. 61:1, 2) Our magazines help us declare this good news far and wide.
2 The Watchtower and Awake! provide solid spiritual food that strengthens and motivates us. The Watchtower comforts meek ones with the good news that God’s Kingdom will soon turn the earth into a paradise. Awake! builds confidence in the Creator’s promise of a peaceful and secure new world. Widespread distribution of these journals is one of the fastest ways to bring the good news to the meek ones. What talking points can we highlight in the latest issues?
3 You could present the May 1 “Watchtower” by pointing to the article “Benefiting From Daily Bible Reading” and asking the question:
▪ “What benefit do you think we can derive from reading the Bible? [Allow for response.] The Bible itself, at Romans 15:4, helps us to reason on that question. [Read Romans 15:4.] Most people in our community have a Bible, but few find time to read it regularly. We believe that the only sure hope for the future is to be found in the Bible, and we will be blessed if we read it.” Make additional appropriate comments, and then offer the magazines.
4 The May 15 “Watchtower” features an intriguing article entitled: “A New Life for Our Ancestors.” You might be able to stir interest with this introduction:
▪ “Many have often wondered what their ancestors were like. Since they are dead and gone, most people conclude that we will never know. Do you think there is any possibility that we will ever get to know our ancestors?” Allow for response. Read John 5:28, 29, and explain how God has promised to give them a new life in a paradise earth.
5 You could offer the May 8 “Awake!” by asking a question:
▪ “What do you think it would take to make life really worth living?” Allow for response. Refer to the article “What Is the Meaning of Life?”, page 26, and read Solomon’s words at Ecclesiastes 2:11. Then, point out his advice at Ec chapter 12, verse 13. Invite the householder to accept the magazine.
6 If you are working with the magazines prior to May 14, be sure to carry copies of Kingdom News No. 34 and offer them to anyone who has not yet received a copy. In distributing the magazines, we should remember that householders are welcome to give a small contribution toward the support of our work if they wish. We should always be ready to share our literature, realizing that it may be read by others in the family as well as by friends who may visit them. (1 Tim. 6:18) The good news we bring to the meek ones may save their lives.​—1 Tim. 4:16.

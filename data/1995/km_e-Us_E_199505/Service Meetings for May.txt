15 min: Local announcements. Offer suggestions that will encourage publishers to try to read a Scripture text as part of their presentation at the doors. Many people have respect for the Bible and are willing to listen when it is read. Its counsel carries weight and will motivate someone who is sincere. It may be appropriate to have the Bible in hand when approaching the door. Texts should be read with feeling and fluency.​—See School Guidebook, pages 32-3, paragraphs 12-15.

Point out illustrations on pages 6, 236-7, 243, and 245, and show how these might be used to start conversations. Have a capable publisher demonstrate a presentation that explains the choice each one must make to gain everlasting life, using the thoughts and scriptures on pages 250-1. Remind everyone to pick up copies for use in service this weekend.

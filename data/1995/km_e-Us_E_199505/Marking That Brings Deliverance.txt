Marking That Brings Deliverance
1 Before executing his righteous judgments, Jehovah always gives warning and provides the meek ones with a way of escape. In Ezekiel’s day, there were those who were sighing and groaning about all the detestable things being done. Jehovah caused such deserving ones to be marked for deliverance. (Ezek. 9:4-6) Our preaching work today accomplishes the same purpose. We can play an important role.
2 Locating sincere people is just the first step. We arrange for a return visit. Preparation for the return visit is made on the first call by noting the placement and the subject discussed. Our success in calling back will largely depend on what we are prepared to say and do when we return.
3 In following up the placement of “The Watchtower,” you could focus on its main theme:
▪ “Note that on the front cover of The Watchtower appears the statement ‘Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom.’ What makes this magazine unique is that it advocates God’s Kingdom as the only solution to the world’s problems. It explains what God’s Kingdom will accomplish when God’s will is done on earth. This is the good news that Jesus said would be declared in all the earth.” Read Matthew 24:14, and explain how The Watchtower can be obtained regularly and used for personal Bible study.
4 You might prefer to focus simply on the Bible itself and stress the need to read it regularly. You could say:
▪ “It seems that just about everyone we know would appreciate some practical advice on how to cope with the problems of everyday living. Where do you think we can find advice that we can trust? [Allow for response.] Many who have put their trust in the advice of friends or who have paid for professional counsel have been sadly disappointed. On the other hand, millions of people have found the Bible to be the only source of advice they can really trust. The Bible provides instruction on how to cope with any problem we may face. [Read 2 Timothy 3:16, 17.] Although you may have found the Bible difficult to understand, let me show you how you can use it to open up a treasure-house of wise counsel.” Continue by turning to “Love” in the section “Bible Words Indexed” in the back of the New World Translation, and point out some of the references that show how love can help us resolve differences with others.
5 With the goal of starting a Bible study, you might choose to use the book “You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth,” using this introduction:
▪ “We love our families and want the best for them. How would your family benefit from living in a world like this?” Show the illustrations on pages 156-7. Read one or two of the scriptures quoted on those pages, and explain that these are promises made by Jehovah God, who cannot lie. Refer to the list of chapters on pages 5-6, and ask the householder which subject interests him most; turn to the chapter he selects, and discuss one or two paragraphs.
6 Would you like to help another person to be marked for deliverance? Success lies in ‘fully accomplishing your ministry’ by preparing well and promptly following up all the interest you find.​—2 Tim. 4:5.

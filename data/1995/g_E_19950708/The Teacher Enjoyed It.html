<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“LAST year in my tenth-​grade English class, we spent a few days studying the wide diversity of religions in the world,” wrote a youth from Michigan, U.S.A. The boy brought a copy of the book <em>Mankind’s Search for God </em>to school. He explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I mainly thought my teacher would find it interesting for himself. I was happy to see him reading the book while the students were working. You can imagine, though, how surprised I was when, before the hour was over, my teacher stopped the class from what they were doing and read the whole first chapter out loud to us. He even had us take notes on it.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“A few days later, he used the book again in classroom instruction, assigning students to do another report, telling them they could use the book <em>Mankind’s Search for God </em>as a basis. The book was put to use for the entire hour.”</p>

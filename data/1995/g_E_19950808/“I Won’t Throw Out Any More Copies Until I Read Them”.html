<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A man wrote the publishers of <em>Awake! </em>explaining: “I recently found a copy of the April 8, 1994, <em>Awake! </em>in my screen door. Wow! What has happened? You have created an up-​to-​date, informative ‘90’s’ publication. I find the transition staggering, and for the first time, I actually read the articles. (I would normally think, ‘Oh, they were here again,’ and toss it.) There was something there for everyone.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In conclusion he wrote: “You are on the right track. Keep up the good work, and I promise I won’t throw out any more copies until I read them.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If you would like a copy of <em>Awake! </em>mailed to your home or desire a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

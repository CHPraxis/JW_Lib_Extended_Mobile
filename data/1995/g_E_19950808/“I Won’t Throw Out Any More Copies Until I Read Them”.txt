“I Won’t Throw Out Any More Copies Until I Read Them”
A man wrote the publishers of Awake! explaining: “I recently found a copy of the April 8, 1994, Awake! in my screen door. Wow! What has happened? You have created an up-​to-​date, informative ‘90’s’ publication. I find the transition staggering, and for the first time, I actually read the articles. (I would normally think, ‘Oh, they were here again,’ and toss it.) There was something there for everyone.”
In conclusion he wrote: “You are on the right track. Keep up the good work, and I promise I won’t throw out any more copies until I read them.”
If you would like a copy of Awake! mailed to your home or desire a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.

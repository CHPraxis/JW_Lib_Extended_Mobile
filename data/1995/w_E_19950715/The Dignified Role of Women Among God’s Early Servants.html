<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Jehovah God went on to say: ‘It is not good for the man to continue by himself. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:18-1:2:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">GENESIS 2:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 1. How does a Bible dictionary describe the lot of women in ancient times?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb">“NOWHERE in the ancient Mediterranean or Near East were women accorded the freedom that they enjoy in modern Western society. The general pattern was one of subordination of women to men, just as slaves were subordinate to the free, and young to old. . . . Male children were more highly esteemed than female, and baby girls were sometimes left to die by exposure.” That is how one Bible dictionary describes the lot of women in ancient times.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 2, 3. (a) According to one report, what is the situation for many women today? (b) What questions are raised?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The situation is not much better in many parts of the world today. In 1994, for the first time, the U.S. State Department’s annual human rights report focused on the treatment of women. “Data on 193 Countries Show Day-to-Day Discrimination Is a Fact of Existence,” stated a <em>New York Times </em>heading regarding the report.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Since large numbers of women with diverse cultural backgrounds are associated with the congregations of Jehovah’s people earth wide, some questions arise: Is the treatment just described the kind that God originally intended for women? How were women treated among worshipers of Jehovah in Bible times? And how should women be treated today?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>“A Helper” and “a Complement”</strong></p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 4. What observation did Jehovah make after the first man had been in the garden of Eden alone for some time, and what did God then do?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>After Adam had been in the garden of Eden alone for some time, Jehovah observed: “It is not good for the man to continue by himself. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:18-1:2:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 2:18</a>) Even though Adam was a perfect man, something else was needed in order to carry out the Creator’s purpose. To <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>fill the need, Jehovah created the woman and performed the first marriage.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:21-1:2:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 2:21-24</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 5. (a) How is the Hebrew noun rendered “helper” often used by the Bible writers? (b) What is indicated by the fact that Jehovah referred to the first woman as “a complement”?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Do the words “helper” and “complement” indicate that the woman’s God-assigned role was demeaning? On the contrary. Bible writers often apply to God the Hebrew noun (<em>ʽeʹzer</em>) rendered “helper.” For instance, Jehovah proves to be “our helper and our shield.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:20-19:33:20" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 33:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:18:4-2:18:4" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Exodus 18:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:33:7-5:33:7" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Deuteronomy 33:7</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:13:9-28:13:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hosea 13:9</a>, Jehovah even refers to himself as Israel’s “helper.” As for the Hebrew word (<em>neʹghedh</em>) rendered “complement,” one Bible scholar explains: “The help looked for is not just assistance in his daily work or in the procreation of children . . . but the mutual support companionship provides.”</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 6. What was said after the creation of the woman, and why?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>There is thus nothing demeaning in Jehovah’s describing the woman as “a helper” and “a complement.” The woman had her own unique mental, emotional, and physical makeup. She was a suitable counterpart, a satisfying complement for the man. Each was different, yet each was needed to “fill the earth” in accord with the Creator’s purpose. It was evidently after the creation of both the man and the woman that “God saw everything he had made and, look! it was very good.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:31-1:1:31" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 31</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 7, 8. (a) With the introduction of sin in Eden, how would the role of the woman be affected? (b) What questions are raised regarding the fulfillment of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:16-1:3:16" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Genesis 3:16</a> among worshipers of Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>With the introduction of sin, things changed for the man and the woman. Jehovah pronounced sentence on both of them as sinners. “I shall greatly increase the pain of your pregnancy,” Jehovah told Eve, speaking of the eventuality he permits as though it were done by him. He added: “In birth pangs you will bring forth children, and your craving will be for your husband, and he will dominate you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:16-1:3:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 3:16</a>) Since that time, many wives have been dominated, oftentimes harshly, by their husbands. Instead of being valued as helpers and complements, they have frequently been treated more like servants or slaves.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>What, though, did the fulfillment of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:16-1:3:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 3:16</a> mean for female worshipers of Jehovah? Were they relegated to a place of subservience and humiliation? Far from it! But what about Bible accounts that tell of customs and practices affecting women that might seem unacceptable in certain societies today?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>Understanding Biblical Customs</strong></p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 9. When we consider customs involving women in Bible times, what three things should we keep in mind?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Women were well treated among God’s servants in Bible times. Of course, in considering customs involving women in those days, it is helpful to keep several things in mind. First, when the Bible tells of unpleasant situations that developed because of selfish domination by wicked men, that does not mean that God approved of such treatment of women. Second, although Jehovah tolerated certain customs among his servants for a time, he regulated these in order to protect women. Third, we must be careful not to judge ancient customs by modern standards. Certain customs that might appear unpleasant to people living today were not necessarily viewed as demeaning by women back then. Let us consider some examples.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">10. How did Jehovah view the practice of polygamy, and what indicates that he never abandoned his original standard of monogamy?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span><sup>10 </sup><em>Polygamy:</em><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> According to Jehovah’s original purpose, a wife would not share her husband with another woman. God created only one wife for Adam. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:21-1:2:22" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 2:21, 22</a>) After the rebellion in Eden, the practice of polygamy first appeared in the line of Cain. Eventually it became a custom and was adopted by some worshipers of Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:19-1:4:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 4:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:16:1-1:16:3" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 16:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:29:21-1:29:28" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> 29:21-28</a>) Although Jehovah allowed polygamy and it served to increase Israel’s population, he showed consideration for women by regulating the practice so that wives and their children would be protected. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:10-2:21:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Exodus 21:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:21:15-5:21:17" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>) Moreover, Jehovah never abandoned his original standard of monogamy. Noah and his sons, to whom the command to ‘be fruitful and fill the earth’ was repeated, were all monogamous. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:7-1:7:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 7:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:9:1-1:9:1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 9:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:5-61:2:5" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 2 Peter 2:5</a>) God portrayed himself as a <em>monogamous </em>husband when symbolizing his relationship with Israel.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup><em>Paying a bride-price: </em>The book <em>Ancient Israel​—Its Life and Institutions </em>states: “This obligation to pay a sum of money, or its equivalent, to the girl’s family obviously gives the Israelite marriage the outward appearance of a purchase. But the [bride-price] seems to be not so much the price paid for the woman as <em>a compensation given to the family.” </em>(Italics ours.) So the payment of a bride-price served to compensate the woman’s family for the loss of her services and for the effort and expense required of her family in caring for her. Instead of demeaning the woman, then, it affirmed her value to her family.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:34:11-1:34:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 34:11, 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:22:16-2:22:16" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Exodus 22:16</a>; see <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1989045/1-25$p/E:1989046/"><em>The Watchtower, </em>January 15, 1989, pages 21-4</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:20:3-1:20:3" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Genesis 20:3</a>) These expressions are thereafter at times used in the Scriptures, and there is no indication that pre-Christian women found them offensive.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:22:22-5:22:22" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>) Wives were not to be treated as pieces of property, though.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>What, then, was the role of women among God’s servants in pre-Christian times? How were they viewed and treated?

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Women were to be respected. God’s Law to Israel commanded that both fathers and mothers be respected.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>Jehovah expects his male worshipers to respect women, for he respects them. Indications of this are found in scriptures in which Jehovah uses the experiences of women illustratively and likens his own feelings to those of women.

What was Isaac’s reaction? “Consequently,” says the account, “Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and commanded him and said to him: ‘You must not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.’” Yes, even though Rebekah had not offered formal advice, her husband made a decision that took her feelings into account.

<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="qu">22. By the time Jesus was on earth, how had the role of women changed, and what questions are asked?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>In the centuries following the completion of the Hebrew Scriptures, the role of <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>women changed among the Jews. By the time Jesus appeared on earth, rabbinic traditions had greatly restricted women in their religious privileges and their social life. Did such traditions influence the way Jesus dealt with women? How should Christian women be treated today? These questions will be discussed in the next article.</p>

<div id="fn1" class="fcc"><p id="p30" data-pid="30">According to <em>Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, </em>“polygamy” refers to a “marriage in which a spouse of either sex may have more than one mate at the same time.” The more specific term “polygyny” is defined as “the state or practice of having more than one wife or female mate at one time.”</p></div>
<div id="fn2" class="fcc"><p id="p31" data-pid="31">Throughout the Hebrew Scriptures, married men and women are referred to far more often as “husband” (Hebrew, <em>ʼish</em>) and “wife” (Hebrew, <em>ʼish·shahʹ</em>). In Eden, for example, the terms Jehovah used were, not “owner” and ‘owned one,’ but “husband” and “wife.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:24-1:2:24" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Genesis 2:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:16-1:3:17" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 3:16, 17</a>) Hosea’s prophecy foretold that after returning from exile, Israel would repentantly call Jehovah “My husband,” and no longer “My owner.” This may suggest that the term “husband” had a more tender connotation than “owner.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:16-28:2:16" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Hosea 2:16</a>.</p></div>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“I just opened my March 8, 1995, <em>Awake! </em>and read the article on the back cover offering the brochure <em>When Someone You Love Dies. </em>The article was entitled ‘It Has Been So Difficult to Grow Up Without Him.’ Tears rolled down my face as I read the comments from the young person in Austria who lost her father ten years ago. I am 50 years old, and I lost my father when I was 7. He died of cancer at the age of 39. I just started to grieve his death when I was hospitalized for major depression six years ago. I have been in therapy for the last five years and have had to learn how to cope with some very difficult issues.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Until I read this letter from Austria, I believed that there was something drastically wrong with me or with my faith. I thought I was the only person who had this huge hole inside and an enormous ache of loneliness for my father. It is so encouraging to know that I am not alone and that there are others who feel the same way I do.</p>

“Tears Rolled Down My Face”
“I just opened my March 8, 1995, Awake! and read the article on the back cover offering the brochure When Someone You Love Dies. The article was entitled ‘It Has Been So Difficult to Grow Up Without Him.’ Tears rolled down my face as I read the comments from the young person in Austria who lost her father ten years ago. I am 50 years old, and I lost my father when I was 7. He died of cancer at the age of 39. I just started to grieve his death when I was hospitalized for major depression six years ago. I have been in therapy for the last five years and have had to learn how to cope with some very difficult issues.
“Until I read this letter from Austria, I believed that there was something drastically wrong with me or with my faith. I thought I was the only person who had this huge hole inside and an enormous ache of loneliness for my father. It is so encouraging to know that I am not alone and that there are others who feel the same way I do.
“I read the brochure When Someone You Love Dies from cover to cover. It was, in my opinion, the best publication ever written for my needs.”​—Mrs. A. G., Connecticut, U.S.A.

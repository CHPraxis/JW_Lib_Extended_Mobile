<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I am 18 years old. My father was killed in a car accident when I was eight, and even though this was ten years ago, I still have such a loneliness inside. It has been so difficult to grow up without him. There are so many things I’ve wanted to tell him, share with him, find out about him. How incredibly comforting to be reminded of Jehovah’s loving resurrection hope! It brings tears to my eyes. Thank you once again for renewing my hope.”​—A young Witness in Austria.</p>

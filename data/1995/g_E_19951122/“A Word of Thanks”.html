<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a young student in Japan wanted to express. She explained that she had received special prizes at school for essays that she based on articles she read in <em>Awake!</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Until then,” she added, “I had been storing the magazines in my home without storing the information in my head. When I thought of how useful the magazines had been to me, I said to myself, ‘These are the magazines I haven’t been reading.’ Feelings of regret overwhelmed me. Since then, I have been reading the magazines as I should.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In appreciation, this student wrote further: “The magazines are very useful in helping me handle all the different trials I face in school. Thank you for always providing such wonderful articles. I will continue to look forward to receiving them.”</p>

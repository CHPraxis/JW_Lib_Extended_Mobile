<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A HANDBOOK on snakes in Alabama describes the rat snake as an accomplished climber. This one is showing his skill by climbing the brick side of a building. He is apparently a young one, since he fits nicely into the grooves between the bricks. He loves to dine on rats and mice.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>The Audubon Society Encyclopedia of Animal Life </em>reveals his special skill in climbing: “Rat snakes have weakly keeled ventral plates. At least one function of the keel is to provide a sharp corner or projection that the snake can press against bark and thus obtain better purchase. It can climb up the trunk of a large tree by wedging its body between the ridges of bark and hitching upward at least partly by means of the keeled ventrals.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">His presence on a tree may make him the target of a flock of screaming, dive-​bombing blue jays. A trek up the side of this building will probably not end with birds or bird’s eggs on the menu, but it could provide a siesta on warm bricks.</p>

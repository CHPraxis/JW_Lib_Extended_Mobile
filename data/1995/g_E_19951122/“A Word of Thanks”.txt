“A Word of Thanks”
That is what a young student in Japan wanted to express. She explained that she had received special prizes at school for essays that she based on articles she read in Awake!
“Until then,” she added, “I had been storing the magazines in my home without storing the information in my head. When I thought of how useful the magazines had been to me, I said to myself, ‘These are the magazines I haven’t been reading.’ Feelings of regret overwhelmed me. Since then, I have been reading the magazines as I should.”
In appreciation, this student wrote further: “The magazines are very useful in helping me handle all the different trials I face in school. Thank you for always providing such wonderful articles. I will continue to look forward to receiving them.”
Awake! regularly features articles that help youths cope with problems they face at home and in school. If you would like a copy of Awake! or would like to have someone call at your home to help you find Bible-​based answers to problems you may have, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.

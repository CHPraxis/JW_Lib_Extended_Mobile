<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">SUPPOSE that money grew on trees and that you owned such a tree. Now imagine that your tree was planted alongside a path traveled by dozens of your neighbors each day. How long do you think the money would remain on your tree?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">If all your neighbors were Jehovah’s Witnesses, your money tree would be secure. Why do we say so? Because Jehovah’s Witnesses follow the Biblical injunction to conduct themselves honestly in all things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:18-58:13:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:18</a>) A recent incident illustrates this.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In Nigeria, West Africa, a five-​naira note was found on the road a hundred yards <strong>[91m] </strong>from the nearest building of the Watch Tower Society’s branch office complex. The finder tied it to the frond of a nearby coconut palm, thinking that the person who had lost the money might return to look for it.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Though the money could be clearly seen by dozens of Jehovah’s Witnesses who passed daily, no one claimed it. After many days it was removed and put in the Society’s contribution box.</p>

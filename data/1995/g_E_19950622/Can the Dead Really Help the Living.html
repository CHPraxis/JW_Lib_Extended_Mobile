<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">People who drove by the Mother of Good Counsel Catholic Church in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S.A., in the spring of 1994 might have drawn that conclusion. For there they could have read the sign seen here: “PRAY TO YOUR BELOVED DECEASED. THEY CAN HELP.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Does the Bible teach that the dead can help the living? Do the dead only appear to die but live on in another form? Are they really living somewhere, and are they able to help us?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Such questions are answered in the tract <em>What Hope for Dead Loved Ones? </em>If you would like to receive a copy or to have a free home Bible study, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

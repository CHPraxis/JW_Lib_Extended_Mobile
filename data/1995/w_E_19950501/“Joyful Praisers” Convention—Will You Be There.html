<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">JOY! Does that word sound strange, even foreign, in this trouble-filled time? Certainly the newspapers do not give many reasons for joy. Ethnic warfare, widespread hunger, unemployment, dangerous pollution, political instability, crime​—these are not things to fill the heart with joy, are they?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Most people today snatch whatever pleasure they can from life. But joy? Joy has been described as a “state of happiness; exultation.” Not too many have experienced real joy, and when they do, it is often very temporary.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Yet, looking forward to our day, the Bible foretold: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah has said: “Look! My own servants will rejoice. Look! My own servants will cry out joyfully because of the good condition of the heart.”’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:13-23:65:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:13, 14</a>) How can that be?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">To find the answer, we invite you to attend one of the district conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses to be held in 1995. The theme of the conventions is “Joyful Praisers,” and attendance is free. The program of the three-day convention will consist of Bible-based talks, demonstrations, discussions, and more. Throughout the program, the theme of joy will be highlighted.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The conventions start in the United States in June and will continue in cities around the world until early 1996. Likely, there will be one near you. Why not ask the Witnesses of Jehovah who live in your area? We warmly invite you to be there.</p>

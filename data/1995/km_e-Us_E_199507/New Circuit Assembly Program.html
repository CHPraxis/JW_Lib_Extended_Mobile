<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Beginning in September, the theme for circuit assemblies will be “Listen and Learn to Carry Out God’s Word.” This theme, based on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:12-5:31:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 31:12, 13</a>, provides a fitting basis for the entire program to highlight lessons we need to learn and apply.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Although most people today listen to misleading inspired expressions, there is a vital need for each of us to listen to God’s Word and learn to carry it out. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:28-42:11:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 11:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:1-54:4:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 4:1</a>) With this in mind, the circuit assembly program has been designed to provide encouragement and help for publishers, families, elders, and pioneers. On Saturday, there will be a four-part symposium on the subject “Coping With Our Problems​—By Paying Attention to God’s Word.” And on Sunday morning, there will be a symposium entitled “How the Scriptures Discipline in Righteousness.” The entire program will present spiritual encouragement that you and your family should not miss.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>On both Saturday and Sunday, practical suggestions for the field ministry will be offered and demonstrated. Encouraging and instructive experiences and interviews will also be presented. Thus, by being present and listening with a view to putting into practice what you learn, you will be in a better position to carry out fully the commands of God’s Word.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>One of the highlights of the circuit assembly will be the baptism of newly dedicated brothers and sisters. Well before this public declaration of their dedication, the candidates should express their desire for baptism to the presiding overseer so that he can arrange for the elders to meet with them.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The public talk for this circuit assembly series is entitled “Why Be Guided by the Bible?” Invite interested persons to attend. In anticipation of the much-needed encouragement and assistance you and your family will receive, make definite plans to be present for the entire program.</p>

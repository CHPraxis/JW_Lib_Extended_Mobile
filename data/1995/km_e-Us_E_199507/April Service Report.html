The 19,340,511 hours reported is a new peak and represents an increase of 3.5 percent over the previous peak of April 1989. The 5,910,318 return visits is also a new peak and represents an increase of 2.1 percent over the previous peak of April 1992. Our diligent efforts have resulted in congregation publishers averaging 11.2 hours in the ministry. We pray that Jehovah will bless our continued efforts to follow up the interest shown by those we contacted during the month of April.</p>

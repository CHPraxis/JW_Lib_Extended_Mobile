<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The apostle Paul commended the Philippians because they ‘revived their thinking in his behalf.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:10-50:4:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Phil. 4:10</a>) If we use their example as a model for the field ministry, we will ‘revive our thinking’ in behalf of those to whom we witness and be prompted to make return visits.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>If you placed the brochure “The Government That Will Bring Paradise,” you might say something like this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “I was thinking about the conversation we had the other day, and two scriptures came to mind that I would like to share with you. You may recall that we talked about God taking over the rulership of the earth. In the Bible, Jehovah God has promised that this will take place. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>.] Do you believe that could really happen? [Allow for response.] Listen to what God says about his ability to fulfill his promises. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:11</a>.] Shouldn’t that encourage us to put our trust in God’s Kingdom? But when will God fulfill his promises?” Explain that you will answer that question on your next visit.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>You might take this approach when making a return visit on a person who took the brochure “When Someone You Love Dies”:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “I made a special effort to return, in view of our discussion about losing someone in death.” Show illustration on page 30 as you say: “Remember this happy scene of people being resurrected and reunited with their loved ones? I left you with the question about where this is to take place, in heaven or on earth. Perhaps you found the Bible’s answer on page 26 of this brochure.” Discuss the main points in the third through the fifth paragraphs, and read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:21-43:5:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 5:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 28, 29</a>. As time permits, read any of the remaining scriptures on the page.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>Did you start a study in “Look! I Am Making All Things New”? On the return visit, you could do this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ Refer again to page 30, and point to the question: “In what ways is the Bible outstanding?” Turn to pages 3 and 4, and review paragraphs 1-4 as well as the illustration on the cover of the brochure. Read one or two scriptures cited in the footnote on paragraph 4. Explain that the Bible is the only book that offers such a marvelous hope. Make arrangements for your next visit. After the third session, if it looks like the study will continue, you can start reporting a new study!</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>You might resume a discussion on “The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever” this way:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “Previously, I was able to show you God’s name in the Bible. Knowing and using the name Jehovah is a vital part of our worship.” Turn to page 31, review the main points in the last four paragraphs, and read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 17:3 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:5-33:4:5" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Micah 4:5</a>. Explain that we provide a Bible study program that can show how God’s name will be sanctified in a proper way and how we can enjoy the blessings of a paradise earth.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>So, revive your thinking in behalf of those you have contacted. Be persistent in going back, and prepare something beneficial to share. You can be one “who really does bear fruit” in making new disciples.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:23-40:13:23" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 13:23</a>.</p>

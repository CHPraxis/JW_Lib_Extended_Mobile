<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>People today are interested in a variety of subjects. As you engage in field service during July, you could have with you several different brochures, using a specific one that would appeal to people in the territory. Perhaps you would like to try one of these presentations:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>In offering the brochure “The Government That Will Bring Paradise,” you could ask:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “What do you think the world would be like if God were the only ruler? [Allow for response.] Having God take over the rulership of the earth is exactly what we are asking for when we pray the Lord’s Prayer, or Our Father, that Jesus Christ taught us. [Turn to page 3, and read the first paragraph, which quotes <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10</a>.] If you would like to live in a world like that, you should read this brochure.” Offer to leave it.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>“When Someone You Love Dies” could be featured in this way:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “Do you think the day will ever come when none of us will have to lose a loved one in death? [Allow for response.] This beautifully written brochure has comforted millions with the Bible’s sure promise that such a day is coming in the near future. [Turn to page 5, and read the fifth paragraph, including <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:21-46:15:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:21, 22</a>. Then turn to the illustration on page 30.] Here the artist has captured the joy we may experience in welcoming back our dead loved ones in the resurrection. But where will that happy scene take place? This brochure will show you the Bible’s answer to that question.” If the brochure is accepted, you might add: “I would like to return later and discuss this subject further.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>You might feature the brochure “Look! I Am Making All Things New,” using this direct approach to start a Bible study:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “Many people have questions about the Bible. You may have wondered about the answer to one of these. [Open to page 30.] This last question has stirred the interest of many: ‘How may you prepare for everlasting life in Paradise?’” If you discuss paragraphs 57-8 on pages 29-30 and read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>, you will have laid the groundwork for starting a Bible study. Conclude by leaving the brochure and arranging for a return visit when you can discuss some of the other questions.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>You might like to try this simple presentation with the brochure “The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever”:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “One of the first things I learned from the Bible was God’s name. Do you know what it is? [Allow for response.] Let me show you. It’s here in the Bible at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a>. [Read.] This brochure shows how God’s name, Jehovah, appears in many different languages. [Show the box on page 8.] If you would like to learn more about Jehovah and his purposes, you should read this brochure.” Hand the brochure to the householder.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>With such a variety of fine brochures to use, we certainly are well equipped “to tell good news to the meek ones.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:1-23:61:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 61:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jesus was masterful in his use of introductions. He knew what to say to stimulate interest. On one occasion he initiated a conversation with a Samaritan woman by simply asking her for a drink of water. This immediately captured her attention because ‘Jews had no dealings with Samaritans.’ The ensuing conversation eventually helped her and many others to become believers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:7-43:4:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 4:7-9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:41-43:4:41" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 41</a>) We can learn from his example.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>When preparing to offer the <em>Live Forever </em>book, ask yourself, ‘What are the immediate concerns of people in our territory? What will appeal to a teenager, an older person, a husband, or a wife?’ You could prepare more than one introduction and plan to use the one that seems most fitting for the situation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>Since the deterioration of family life concerns many, you might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ “Daily pressures of life have put great strains on families today. Where can they find assistance? [Allow for response.] The Bible can be a real help to us. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>.] The Scriptures offer beneficial guidelines that can help families survive. Note what is stated in paragraph 3 on page 238 of this publication, <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.” </em>Read paragraph 3, and make offer.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>If you are using a local news item, you might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ “Did you hear the news report about [mention item of local concern]? What did you think about that? [Allow for response.] It makes you wonder what this world is coming to, doesn’t it? The Bible foretold such things as evidence that we are living in the last days.” Then consider information in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="20" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989108/8-31"><em>Live Forever </em>book, pages 150-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>Many are concerned about the growing crime problem. You could use the first introduction under the heading “Crime/​Safety” on </em></strong><a class="xt" data-xtid="21" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989202/6-16:131"><strong><em>page 10 of the “Reasoning”</em></strong></a> <strong><em>book:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ “We are talking with folks about the matter of personal safety. There’s a lot of crime around us, and it affects our lives. What do you think it would take for people like you and me to feel safe on the streets at night?” You might read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11</a> and point out blessings that God’s Kingdom will bring, using <a class="xt" data-xtid="22" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989109/6-21">pages 156-8 of the <em>Live Forever</em></a> book.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong><em>If you prefer a simpler approach, you might use an introduction similar to that found at the top of </em></strong><a class="xt" data-xtid="23" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989202/26:137-36:131"><strong><em>page 12 in the “Reasoning”</em></strong></a> <strong><em>book:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">▪ “We are encouraging our neighbors to consider the grand future that the Bible holds out to us. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>.] Does this sound good to you? [Allow for response.] Chapter 19 of this publication highlights other blessings obedient mankind will experience under God’s Kingdom.” If there is interest, offer the <em>Live Forever </em>book.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature to be used during <strong>February: </strong><em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em>Placements of this book should be followed up with return visits, and efforts should be made to start Bible studies. <strong>March: </strong><em>Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! </em><strong>April and May: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. For territory that is covered frequently, any brochure (except the <em>School </em>brochure) may be used. Where interest is found on return visits, subscriptions may be offered. NOTE: Congregations that have not yet requested the above-mentioned campaign items should do so on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S-14).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the hour requirement, the elders should arrange for assistance to be given. For suggestions, review Society’s letters (S-201) of October 1, 1993, and October 1, 1992. Also, see paragraphs 12-20 of the August 1986 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>insert.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The Memorial celebration will be held on Friday, April 14, 1995. Although the talk may start earlier, please remember that the passing of the Memorial bread and wine <em>should not begin until after sundown. </em>Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. No meetings other than those for field service are to be held on that date. If your congregation normally has meetings on Friday, you may want to switch those to another day of the week if the Kingdom Hall is available.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ At the conclusion of congregation meetings as well as circuit assembly and special assembly day programs on April 23, 1995, an announcement will be made concerning a special work to get under way with the widespread distribution of a four-page tract containing a timely message. Publishers will be encouraged to give special attention to honesthearted ones who seriously reflect on the perplexing problems facing them and who seek reliable guidance. Every publisher, including new ones who will start out in field service during March, April, and May, will want to participate fully and give support to this special campaign.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ In response to many requests from publishers and interested ones, the Society has prepared a magazine-size brochure entitled <em>Planned Giving to Benefit Kingdom Service Worldwide. </em>Those planning to make a special gift now or leave a bequest at death to the Society may find this information helpful, especially if they wish to accomplish some family goal or estate-planning objective while using tax benefits to minimize the cost of the gift or bequest. A copy of the brochure may be obtained by writing or calling Watch Tower Society, Planned Giving Desk, 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson, NY 12563-9204, telephone (914) 878-7000.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ Publishers who wish to serve as auxiliary pioneers in March, April, and May should make their plans now and turn in their application early. This will help the elders to make necessary field service arrangements and have sufficient literature on hand.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ On Saturday, May 13, 1995, the Society’s facilities in Brooklyn, Wallkill, and Patterson, New York, will be closed for spring cleaning. Therefore, there will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on that day.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ New Braille Publications Available:</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong>Grade-two English: </strong><em>Examining the Scriptures Daily​—1995 </em>(four volumes); <em>Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 1995 </em>(one volume).</p>

1995 District Convention Simplification
1 How thrilling it is to be present at spiritual feasts, whether at congregation meetings, circuit assemblies, special assembly days, or district conventions! Why? Fellowship with God-fearing persons is refreshing, and the spiritual matters presented on such occasions remind us of the more important things.
2 Increasing thousands have been drawn to such spiritual gatherings in recent years. Between the years 1985 and 1994, the number of congregations worldwide increased over 50 percent, from 49,716 to 75,573. As Jehovah speeds up the ingathering work, the number of district conventions and circuit assemblies increases accordingly. (Isa. 60:22) Even the increase in the number of conventions held just in the United States branch territory, from 113 in 1985 to 168 in 1994, is a reflection of this tremendous growth in the number of congregations. The resulting work involved in arranging for and handling these conventions has been escalating. Since we assemble to benefit from the spiritual program prepared for these feasts, it is wise to simplify as far as is practical in caring for the physical arrangements.
3 Further Steps to Be Taken: We look to Jehovah for his blessing as we move forward progressively. We are happy to see that he has given his people the needed spirit of wisdom and understanding. We must agree that through the faithful slave class, Jesus Christ has directed matters efficiently for the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose in a marvelous way. (Matt. 24:45-47; Col. 1:9, 10) An announcement in the December Our Kingdom Ministry stated: “Beginning with the 1995 district conventions and the September 1995 circuit assemblies and special assembly days, there will be no food served. Each one is to bring his own food and drink.” Circuit assemblies and special assembly days will continue with their present simplified food service arrangements through August 1995. There has been a positive response to this announcement. You may be interested in knowing how this change will be of benefit. Perhaps the following review of adjustments that have been made in recent years will prove to be a good reminder of the benefits we have already received by simplifying the work at conventions.
4 Previous Adjustments to Simplify: Prior to the implementation of standardized and simplified district convention arrangements, such as food service, volunteer service, and rooming, much work was required on the part of thousands of local brothers and sisters in preconvention work. In view of the pressures and demands made on our brothers by daily living and the continued growth of the organization, adjustments to simplify the work were indeed necessary. Additionally, as a result of simplifying our food service operation in the United States in 1978, over 70,000 brothers and sisters who used to work hard during the sessions to provide us with food were able to listen to the program. In 1987 further simplification procedures were implemented with regard to food service at conventions and during the following service year at Assembly Halls. Later, food items were made available at conventions and assemblies at no charge to those attending. What fine adjustments these were, making the work lighter and allowing more attention to be given to the spiritual aspects of the convention, with the workers being able to listen and enjoy more of the program. (Deut. 31:12) Those faithful ones among us with many years of loyal service well remember these advancements and have expressed appreciation for the direction received. But what work could further be eliminated to make it possible for even more to benefit fully from the spiritual program?
5 Anticipated Changes: During the years that a simplified menu was prepared and served, it was seen that relatively “few things” were truly “needed.” (Compare Luke 10:38-42.) However, multiplying such few things times the number attending still represented a great volume of supplies and work, as well as added expensive equipment. Then, too, a very large number of volunteers were needed to organize and support the arrangements. Food storage and distribution centers had to be provided. Additionally, some municipal health departments have been extreme in their requirements for serving food, and this has been a burden to the brothers in charge. The Society’s refrigerated trailers have had to be loaded with consignments of food, transported many miles, and unloaded. All of this has involved liabilities of great concern to the Society. The trailers have also required maintenance, storage, and routing that involve work, time, and expense. With further simplification, there will be no need to have refrigerated trailers for convention use or tractors to move these trailers. Furthermore, many brothers will be relieved of the large task of maintaining this equipment.
6 The willing service of those who have served as volunteers in these related areas has been of inestimable value and very much appreciated. However, with this further simplification, those thousands serving in the field doing maintenance and driving trucks as well as purchasing, preparing, expediting, and serving the food will be able to use their time in other necessary Kingdom pursuits, including enjoying fellowship at the conventions more fully. Those volunteers who used to serve in Food Service will now be able to assist in other departments, such as Attendants and Cleaning. This will lighten the load for everyone and will not require that many work late at night, early in the morning, or during the sessions, as was the case with a number in Food Service.
7 Supporting the Arrangements: The Society appreciates very much the fine support you brothers and sisters have given “with a complete heart” over the years to the convention arrangements, including food service. (1 Chron. 29:9) This has helped in many ways. It has made it possible to rent good buildings and care for the convention expenses. It has also enabled those attending to remain at the convention site during the short noon break so as to obtain food conveniently, be refreshed, and then be present for the spiritual program. And no doubt the generosity and support that has been shown by the brothers and sisters in contributing for these provisions will continue. It has been an expression of their appreciation in a practical way.​—Prov. 11:25; Luke 16:9.
8 Caring for Your Food Needs: With these further adjustments, however, it will be necessary for individuals and family groups to provide just for themselves what is needed in the way of material sustenance during our noon break. We highly esteem the fine benefits of the spiritual program. To let physical food assume undue importance would be unwise. It is vital that each one “make sure of the more important things” in this regard. (Phil. 1:9, 10a) Recent large conventions of Jehovah’s people in Poland, Russia, and Ukraine, as well as in other places, have been held with fine success without food service arrangements. Additionally, some circuits in this country have held their assemblies and special assembly day programs without food service because of local circumstances. In each case the delegates brought their own food for lunch. We will find that if we bring just a light noon snack, it will contribute to our having an alert mental state, enabling us to derive full benefit from the afternoon program. In harmony with this, everyone should bring food that is simple and nourishing. For example, when Jesus fed the crowds, he provided just two items, bread and fish. (Matt. 14:16-20; see also Luke 10:42a.) To that end, we are pleased to offer some suggestions as to what might be appropriate and practical in view of the shortened noon break and the type of facilities we use.
9 Since there will no longer be food service arrangements at the convention, with good planning those attending will be able to enjoy breakfast with their family either at home or at a local eating place. By getting sufficient rest the night before, you should be able to rise early enough to obtain what is necessary for morning nourishment and arrive at the convention in plenty of time to enjoy fellowship with other delegates. Another benefit of the new arrangement is that the doors to the facilities will not need to be staffed and opened as early as when food service volunteers were admitted along with their families. The doors to the buildings will open at 8:00 a.m. for all delegates, with the exception of those few with specific work assignments that make it necessary for them to enter earlier. As previously, there will be no need for any to rush to the convention site looking for seats, for there has been adequate seating planned for the estimated crowd.
10 The noon break will be somewhat shorter than at previous conventions. However, it will still provide an opportunity to take in some light nourishment, as well as time for some association with others. Our brothers and sisters who live in the convention city or nearby and who daily return home in the evening will readily be able to prepare a small amount of food for each member of the family to bring for the day’s noon break. This would be much the same as the lunch youths take to school, perhaps a sandwich and a piece of fruit, a cookie, and something to drink. Many people take similar lunches to their secular jobs.
11 This will no doubt present more of a challenge for those attending from localities outside the convention city, as some advance planning for their noon food items will be necessary. Perhaps such items as napkins and disposable paper cups for those traveling in your group could be brought from home. Some may find that a light snack of some fresh fruit or vegetables would be enough to satisfy their needs, and this could be brought from home as well. Other food needs for each day’s noon break may be obtained at a grocery store in the convention city. Of course, we realize that refrigeration of an extended menu will not be possible for those staying in hotels.
12 As a reminder, please DO NOT COOK IN HOTEL ROOMS unless they have a kitchenette for that purpose. It is dangerous and illegal to do so and can damage room furnishings with stains and grease. It produces odors that are hard to remove from the room for days. All of this makes it difficult for the hotel to rent the room again without the expense and work of cleaning and deodorizing it. That is why it may be wise to consider purchasing nonperishable items, such as nuts, dried fruit, and crackers, or you may choose to bring along baked items, such as bread, rolls, or muffins. If a lunch item, such as a sandwich, is desired, perhaps the food store you locate may have a delicatessen section where these items are prepared. Purchasing this type of item already made would eliminate food preparation in hotel rooms or vehicles.
13 Inasmuch as the convention site actually becomes a large Kingdom Hall during the convention, it is also wise to avoid developing a picnic atmosphere during the noon break. And just as we do not eat during meetings at the Kingdom Hall, neither would we be eating or drinking during convention sessions. Large family-size picnic coolers will not be permitted in the facility where the convention is held. They could create hazards and cannot be left in aisles or placed on seats. Perhaps reusable tote bags or disposable paper sacks would be better suited to the light snack items that will be needed for our noon break. If necessary, a small cooler that can be placed under, not on, a seat might be used.
14 Caution also needs to be exercised with regard to the types of drink containers we choose to bring to the convention site. Hot drinks may be brought in thermoses. Glass containers of any kind can prove to be a hazard. Many facilities even prohibit their use. We request, therefore, that NO GLASS CONTAINERS be brought on the premises. If your selected cold beverage cannot be purchased in a plastic or aluminum container, it would be best to pour it into another type of small nonbreakable container that would fit under your seat.
15 Additional Benefits: Truly we can see the wisdom of such adjusted arrangements. All will be able to give full attention to the receiving of spiritual benefits​—the real purpose of our assembling. These benefits are provided in the association we enjoy as well as the program itself. So instead of leaving the facility at the noon break to seek food, how beneficial it will prove to be to bring something with us. This will make it possible to enjoy the fellowship of our brothers and sisters and will prevent us from missing any of the afternoon program.
16 Being spiritually refreshed following the afternoon program, some might enjoy continuing Christian fellowship and conversation about the good things learned while taking in a more substantial meal with family and friends in local eating establishments. Others may just pick up something in a grocery store or a delicatessen. Those who are able to return to their own home may choose to have an evening meal there, much as they do other days that they spend in secular work or field service.
17 We truly enjoy the spiritual banquet at these assemblies and conventions, where we receive new publications, fine teaching, and practical counsel. These blessings are what everyone remembers, along with the joy of being with God’s assembled people. Proverbs 10:22 says: “The blessing of Jehovah​—that is what makes rich, and he adds no pain with it.” This is because as Jehovah’s people, we do not attend conventions with material wants and comforts in view. We assemble with the positive desire to gain the greatest benefit possible in a spiritual way, and Jehovah richly rewards us for the spirit we show.​—1 Tim. 6:6-8; Heb. 11:6.
18 These occasions for encouragement also remind us of the progress of the spiritual harvest. (John 4:35, 36) The opening words of Isaiah chapter 54 call upon Jehovah’s wifelike organization to prepare for joyous increases. Further growth, expansion, and renewed strength are in the offing as Isaiah prophesied: “Make the place of your tent more spacious. And let them stretch out the tent cloths of your grand tabernacle. Do not hold back. Lengthen out your tent cords, and make those tent pins of yours strong. For to the right and to the left you will break forth.” Fulfillment of this exciting prophecy has resulted in the phenomenal expansion of true worship that we now see.​—Isa. 54:1-4.
19 It truly does appear to be the course of good judgment to implement this further simplified convention arrangement so that with less distraction all will be able to enjoy the spiritual program that has been prepared. We trust that this also will have Jehovah’s blessing, since it will allow for more efficient handling of further growth. By focusing on what is needed, we will be able to enjoy our planned days of happy fellowship and spiritual good things. It is our sincere prayer that Jehovah will bless all our efforts as we continue to convene and be fed at his table.​—Compare Deuteronomy 16:14, 15.

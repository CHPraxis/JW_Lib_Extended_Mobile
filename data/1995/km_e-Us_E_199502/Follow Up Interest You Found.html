(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>) In order to teach effectively on the return visit, we need to review what we discussed on the first call and then prepare for further discussion.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>If you discussed deteriorating world conditions on your initial call, you might follow that up by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “I’m sure you will agree that big changes are needed if we’re ever going to live in peace. The Bible shows that Satan is the primary cause of our problems. Many wonder why God has permitted him to continue for so long. What do you think?” Allow for response. Turn to <a class="xt" data-xtid="25" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989092/18-19">page 20, paragraphs 14 and 15, in the <em>Live Forever</em></a> book, and explain why Satan has not yet been destroyed. Then read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:20-45:16:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 16:20</a>, which shows what we can expect in the near future.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “God’s Kingdom will bring wonderful blessings to the earth and mankind. These blessings are well illustrated here on pages 12 and 13. What do you see that appeals to you? [Allow for response.] Think what it would be like to live in a world like this.” Read paragraph 12. If there is interest, ask the question on paragraph 13, and discuss the answer. Point out that this chapter answers more questions about Kingdom blessings and that you will be pleased to discuss them on your next visit.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>You might be able to start a study by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “Many people have found answers to their Bible questions with the use of this book.” Turn to the table of contents, and ask: “Which subject here interests you the most?” Allow for a response, turn to the chapter that caught their interest, and read the first paragraph. Explain how the questions at the bottom of each page highlight the main points in each paragraph. Illustrate by discussing one or two more paragraphs, and then make arrangements to call again.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Following up interest in the <em>Live Forever </em>book demonstrates our desire to accomplish our ministry fully.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jesus provided what his disciples needed. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:45-42:24:45" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 24:45</a> reports: “He opened up their minds fully to grasp the meaning of the Scriptures.” He knew that if they wanted to have his Father’s approval, it was essential for them to study and understand God’s Word, the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) Our preaching work has the same objective. Our goal is to start Bible studies, where we can ‘teach people to observe all the things Jesus commanded.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:20-40:28:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 28:20</a>) With this in mind, the following are some suggestions on what might be helpful when you make return visits.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>If you initially discussed the book “The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?” you might continue your discussion this way:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “I would like to show you something else that illustrates the practical value of Bible counsel. Many people find it difficult to get along well with others. What can we do to develop a better relationship with those around us? [After a response, turn to pages 167-8, paragraph 15, and read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:12-40:7:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 7:12</a>. Add thoughts expressed in paragraph 16.] This is another example of the wisdom found in Bible counsel. The next time I call, I’d like to show you advice the Bible offers to help married couples to find greater happiness in their relationship.” Make arrangements to return to discuss pages 170-2, which show what the Bible recommends for a happy family life.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>If you spoke to someone who showed interest in the Bible, then perhaps this approach might be effective in getting a study started:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “Virtually all those you talk to will tell you that they would like to have a peaceful and secure world in which to live. If that’s what everybody wants, why do we have a world that’s filled with so much turmoil and violence? [Allow for response.] The <em>New World Translation </em>shows you where in the Bible you can find the answer to that question.” Turn to page 1659, and point to “Bible Topics for Discussion” No. 43a, “Who is responsible for world distress.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:4-47:4:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>. Explain how God will destroy the Devil and will bring a world of lasting peace and happiness. Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>. You can then say: “The next time I call, I would like to show you some scriptures that explain why you can look forward to a world without distress.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>If you used the direct approach to start a study and there was a good response, you might say this when you return:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “When we spoke previously, we discussed some reasons why it is beneficial to study the Bible. A sincere effort to do more of this can help us appreciate what God has in store for us. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.] We have developed a Bible study program that has assisted thousands to learn more about what God has promised and how we can please him.” Display the <em>Knowledge </em>book, review the chapter titles, and demonstrate how we conduct a Bible study.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>If you can help sincere persons to appreciate the excelling value of God’s Word, you have helped them in the best way possible. The wisdom they can learn by a study of its pages can be “a tree of life,” which will bring them much happiness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:18-20:3:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Prov. 3:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Opinions about the Bible’s value are many and varied. However, we are convinced that within its pages lie the answers to mankind’s perplexing problems as well as reliable guidance for our personal course in life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 3:5, 6</a>) The wisdom of its counsel is unequaled. The moral standards it advocates are unsurpassed. Its message is powerful, “able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>) How can we help others to see the need to take this book off the shelf and give it careful scrutiny? You may wish to try some of the following suggestions when offering the <em>New World Translation </em>with the book <em>The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? </em>during November.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>Since many people worry about meeting their basic needs, perhaps this approach would get their attention:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “Many people I talk to these days are worried about meeting their financial obligations. Many are caught up in the pursuit of material things, and this results in stress. Where is the best place to turn for advice on such matters? [Allow for response.] I have found that the Bible offers practical advice that can help us avoid unnecessary problems. Let me show you an example.” Turn to <a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989042/5:141-7">page 163 in the book <em>The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?</em></a> and read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:9-54:6:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:9, 10</a>, quoted in paragraph 3. Make further comments on paragraph 4, and then offer the book.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>Here is another suggestion you might consider:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “Every time we read the paper or listen to the news we hear about another distressing problem that makes us feel anxious. [Mention some disturbing event reported recently in the news.] How can we cope with problems like this? [Allow for response.] Back in 1983 the then president of the United States [Ronald Reagan] said that the Bible has the greatest message ever written and that ‘inside its pages lie all the answers to all the problems that man has ever known.’ What he said brings to mind what the Bible itself states. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>.] Let me show you why we can have confidence in the Bible.” Point out some highlights from the tract <em>Why You Can Trust the Bible. </em>Offer to return later to discuss how remarkable it is that Bible prophecies are being fulfilled in current world events.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>If there are many nonreligious people in your territory, you might try this approach:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “Many people in this area view certain holy books as contradictory and as nothing more than myths. They have seen so many bad things done in the name of religion that they do not trust even the Bible. In fact, more and more people are wondering whether the Bible is God’s Word or man’s. What is your opinion?” Allow for answer. Depending on householder’s response, turn to a portion of the book <em>The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? </em>that deals with the objection or viewpoint of the householder, and discuss one or two points. For example, you may have occasion to use paragraphs 27-9 beginning on page 66, under the subheading “Jesus​—A Real Person.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WITH hundreds of religions, sects, and cults in the world today, how can you possibly identify the religion approved by God? It might seem like looking for a needle in a haystack. But do you need to check the haystack straw by straw? No. You can use a process of elimination. God’s Word, the Bible, acts as the magnet that helps you to identify that “one faith.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:5-49:4:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In a previous issue of this magazine, under “Have You Ever Wondered?” (January 8, 1994, page 13), we covered the question of the immortal soul. By the use of Biblical reasoning, we proved that man does not have an immortal soul that is blessed or that suffers after death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 9:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:10-21:9:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:4-26:18:4" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> Ezekiel 18:4</a>) With that simple truth, we can eliminate any religion that teaches that man has an immortal soul. That leaves very few religions in our search for the one approved by God. So let us apply some more questions that can help us to reduce the list even further, simply by looking up and reasoning on the Scripture texts cited below.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sm"> <strong>1. </strong>Would true worship exalt, glorify, and unduly honor human religious leaders, even assigning them unscriptural titles?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:96:5-19:96:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 96:5-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:6-40:23:12" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matthew 23:6-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:5-46:3:9" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 3:5-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sm"> <strong>2. </strong>Should the true religion be a profit-​oriented enterprise, so that its leaders can live in luxury?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:19-40:6:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 6:19-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:1-59:2:4" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> James 2:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:1-59:5:3" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 5:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sm"> <strong>3. </strong>Should the true religion be identified by a single teaching (such as Baptist, Pentecostal), by its geographic origins (such as Roman, Southern, Church of England), by its imperfect founder (Luther, Calvin, Wesley) or by the form of rule it employs (such as Presbyterian, Episcopal, Congregational)?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:10-23:43:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:12-23:43:12" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:26-44:11:26" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Acts 11:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sm"> <strong>4. </strong>Would true worship try to hide or replace God’s revealed name?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:12:4-23:12:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 12:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Matthew 6:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:26-43:17:26" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> John 17:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sm"> <strong>5. </strong>(a) How should the true religion view the Bible?

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sm"> <strong>6. </strong>To what and to whom do true worshipers direct attention for salvation?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:1-19:27:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 27:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Matthew 6:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:25-45:16:27" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Romans 16:25-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:27-46:15:28" data-bid="9-4" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:27, 28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="9-5" class="b"> Revelation 11:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sm"> <strong>7. </strong>What kind of conduct should the true religion produce as a result of its teachings?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:40" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 22:37-40;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:23-49:4:29" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Ephesians 4:23-29</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Galatians 5:19-21</a> with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ga 5:22, 23</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sm"> <strong>8. </strong>Would the worldwide brotherhood of true worshipers of God be involved in divisive politics and nationalism?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:14-27:7:14" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 7:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> John 18:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:17-45:16:17" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> Romans 16:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:10-46:1:10" data-bid="13-5" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 1:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sm"> <strong>9. </strong>Would the worship approved by God permit participation in wars and racial or tribal killings?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:13-2:20:13" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Exodus 20:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:2-23:2:4" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Isaiah 2:2-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> John 13:34, 35</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sm"><strong>10. </strong>Who today worldwide show true Christian love? Are not divided by politics, race, or nationalism? Do not glorify human leaders? Do not exploit people for wealth and position? Do not participate in wars? Have a Biblical name?

But you, do not you be called Rabbi, for one is your teacher, whereas all you are brothers. Moreover, do not call anyone your father on earth, for one is your Father, the heavenly One. Neither be called ‘leaders,’ for your Leader is one, the Christ. But the greatest one among you must be your minister.

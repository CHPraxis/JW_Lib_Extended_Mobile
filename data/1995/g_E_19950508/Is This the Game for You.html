The recent addition​—Doom II—​is expected to become a top seller even at $69.95. Is this type of game appropriate for peace-​loving Christians? Lewis’ continuing description may help you to decide.</p>

The Marine has to maneuver through labyrinthine hallways, . . . punching, shooting, roasting and chain sawing the demons and former humans at nearly every turn. . . .</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The Bible writer James said: “The wisdom from above is first of all chaste, then peaceable, reasonable, ready to obey, full of mercy and good fruits.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:17-59:3:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">James 3:17</a>) Parents, have you checked the home computer games your children use lately? Need we say more?</p>

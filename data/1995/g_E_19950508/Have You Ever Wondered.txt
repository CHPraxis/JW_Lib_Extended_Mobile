Have You Ever Wondered?
WITH hundreds of religions, sects, and cults in the world today, how can you possibly identify the religion approved by God? It might seem like looking for a needle in a haystack. But do you need to check the haystack straw by straw? No. You can use a process of elimination. God’s Word, the Bible, acts as the magnet that helps you to identify that “one faith.”​—Ephesians 4:5.
In a previous issue of this magazine, under “Have You Ever Wondered?” (January 8, 1994, page 13), we covered the question of the immortal soul. By the use of Biblical reasoning, we proved that man does not have an immortal soul that is blessed or that suffers after death. (Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10; Ezekiel 18:4) With that simple truth, we can eliminate any religion that teaches that man has an immortal soul. That leaves very few religions in our search for the one approved by God. So let us apply some more questions that can help us to reduce the list even further, simply by looking up and reasoning on the Scripture texts cited below.
 1. Would true worship exalt, glorify, and unduly honor human religious leaders, even assigning them unscriptural titles?​—Psalm 96:5-7; Matthew 23:6-12; 1 Corinthians 3:5-9.
 2. Should the true religion be a profit-​oriented enterprise, so that its leaders can live in luxury?​—Matthew 6:19-21; James 2:1-4; 5:1-3.
 3. Should the true religion be identified by a single teaching (such as Baptist, Pentecostal), by its geographic origins (such as Roman, Southern, Church of England), by its imperfect founder (Luther, Calvin, Wesley) or by the form of rule it employs (such as Presbyterian, Episcopal, Congregational)?​—Isaiah 43:10, 12; Acts 11:26.
 4. Would true worship try to hide or replace God’s revealed name?​—Isaiah 12:4, 5; Matthew 6:9; John 17:26.
 5. (a) How should the true religion view the Bible? (Psalm 119:105; Luke 24:44, 45; Romans 15:4; 2 Timothy 3:14-16) (b) How should it view so-​called post-​Biblical revelations?​—Galatians 1:8, 9.
 6. To what and to whom do true worshipers direct attention for salvation?​—Psalm 27:1; Matthew 6:33; Romans 16:25-27; 1 Corinthians 15:27, 28; Revelation 11:15.
 7. What kind of conduct should the true religion produce as a result of its teachings?​—Matthew 22:37-40; Ephesians 4:23-29; compare Galatians 5:19-21 with Ga 5:22, 23.
 8. Would the worldwide brotherhood of true worshipers of God be involved in divisive politics and nationalism?​—Daniel 2:44; 7:14; John 18:36; Romans 16:17; 1 Corinthians 1:10.
 9. Would the worship approved by God permit participation in wars and racial or tribal killings?​—Exodus 20:13; Isaiah 2:2-4; John 13:34, 35.
10. Who today worldwide show true Christian love? Are not divided by politics, race, or nationalism? Do not glorify human leaders? Do not exploit people for wealth and position? Do not participate in wars? Have a Biblical name? Advocate God’s Kingdom rule as the permanent solution to mankind’s problems?​—Isaiah 43:10, 12.
Have You Ever Wondered? The Bible’s Answers
The following are some of the texts cited with the questions on page 20:
 1. “They like the most prominent place at evening meals and the front seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces and to be called Rabbi by men. But you, do not you be called Rabbi, for one is your teacher, whereas all you are brothers. Moreover, do not call anyone your father on earth, for one is your Father, the heavenly One. Neither be called ‘leaders,’ for your Leader is one, the Christ. But the greatest one among you must be your minister. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”​—Matthew 23:6-12.
 2. “Stop storing up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal. Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” (Matthew 6:19-21) “Come, now, you rich men, weep, howling over your miseries that are coming upon you. Your riches have rotted, and your outer garments have become moth-​eaten. Your gold and silver are rusted away, and their rust will be as a witness against you and will eat your fleshy parts.”​—James 5:1-3.
 3. “‘You are my witnesses,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘even my servant whom I have chosen, in order that you may know and have faith in me, and that you may understand that I am the same One.’” (Isaiah 43:10) “It was first in Antioch that the disciples were by divine providence called Christians.”​—Acts 11:26.
 4. “Give thanks to Jehovah, you people! Call upon his name. Make known among the peoples his dealings. Make mention that his name is put on high. . . . This is made known in all the earth.” (Isaiah 12:4, 5) “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.”​—Matthew 6:9.
 5. (a) “From infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through the faith in connection with Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness.” (2 Timothy 3:15, 16) (b) “Even if we or an angel out of heaven were to declare to you as good news something beyond what we declared to you as good news, let him be accursed.”​—Galatians 1:8.
 6. “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.” (Matthew 6:33) “The kingdom of the world did become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will rule as king forever and ever.”​—Revelation 11:15.
 7. “‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’ This is the greatest and first commandment. . . . ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’ On these two commandments the whole Law hangs, and the Prophets.” (Matthew 22:37-40) “The fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-​suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-​control. Against such things there is no law.”​—Galatians 5:22, 23.
 8. “Jesus answered: ‘My kingdom is no part of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought that I should not be delivered up to the Jews. But, as it is, my kingdom is not from this source.’”​—John 18:36.
 9. “You must not murder.” (Exodus 20:13) “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”​—John 13:34, 35.
10. “‘You are my witnesses,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘even my servant whom I have chosen, in order that you may know and have faith in me, and that you may understand that I am the same One. . . . So you are my witnesses,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and I am God.’”​—Isaiah 43:10, 12.

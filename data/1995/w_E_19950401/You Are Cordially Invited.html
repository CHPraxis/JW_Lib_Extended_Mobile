<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The death of the man Jesus Christ over 1,900 years ago was the most important event in human history. It opened up the prospect of attaining everlasting life on a paradise earth. During a simple ceremony, Jesus used unleavened bread and wine as symbols of his loving human sacrifice. Then he told his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19</a>) Will you remember this important event? Jehovah’s Witnesses warmly invite you to join them in observing this Memorial celebration. It will be after sundown on the date that corresponds with Nisan 14 on the Bible’s lunar calendar. You may attend at the Kingdom Hall nearest to your home. Check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place. The date for the celebration in 1995 will be Friday, April 14.</p>

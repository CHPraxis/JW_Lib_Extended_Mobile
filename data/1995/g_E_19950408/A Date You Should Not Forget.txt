A Date You Should Not Forget
The evening before he died, Jesus shared a loaf of unleavened bread and a cup of wine with his apostles and said: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”​—Luke 22:19.
This year the observance falls on Friday April 14 after sunset. As a result of Jesus’ command, millions of Jehovah’s Witnesses and interested persons around the world will be gathered this special night to repeat this Memorial in the manner Jesus directed. You are most warmly invited to assemble with us. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place of the meeting.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>It is not enough to “hear” the words of the prophecies in the book of Revelation. To benefit fully, one must “observe” what is written. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:3-66:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 1:3</a>) Placing literature is just an initial step toward making disciples. Once we have found interested ones who are willing to hear, we should go back promptly to assist them in learning more. What can we talk about on our return visit?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>If you spoke about the symbolic four horsemen on your initial visit, you might begin your conversation this way:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “Previously we talked about the book of Revelation and how its prophecies are being fulfilled today in world events. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:1-66:6:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation chapter 6</a> foretold the ride of the symbolic four horsemen, which would result in much violence and distress in the earth. We have seen this take place right before our eyes. Many wonder when this distress will end so that we can enjoy life in a peaceful world. What is your opinion? [Allow for response.] Jesus’ disciples were interested in the answer to this question.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3</a>, where the question is raised, and then <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:34-40:24:34" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Mt 24 verse 34</a>, where Jesus gave the answer. If the response is positive, explain more about the last days.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>If you discussed God’s Kingdom on the first call, you may decide to continue by asking this question:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “In your opinion, what kind of government is needed to satisfy all mankind’s needs? [Allow for response. Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jeremiah 10:23</a>.] As you can see, God never intended that man should direct his own affairs. Attempts to do that without God’s help are the cause of most of our problems. God’s Kingdom is the only government that can provide what we need.” Turn to <a class="xt" data-xtid="22" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989242/39:122-49:58">page 230 in the <em>Reasoning</em></a> book, and discuss the scriptures under the first subheading. Continue the discussion by explaining why we can put our full trust in God.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ Show the illustration on <a class="xt" data-xtid="23" href="jwpub://p/E:1101988042/34-36">page 302 of the <em>Revelation Climax</em></a> book, and explain: “Mankind will enjoy these conditions when God’s will is done on the earth as it is in heaven. However, some fear that bad conditions will come back again. That will be impossible because all the wicked ones will be gone.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11</a>. Invite the householder to take advantage of our Bible study program to learn more.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “If we want to live in a world like that, there is something important that we must do.” Read the last paragraph, and offer the <em>Revelation Climax </em>book.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Since our objective is to start Bible studies, we need to make effective return visits. Schedule time for them, and prepare well. In this way we can truly help the honesthearted.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:6-66:22:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rev. 22:6, 7</a>.</p>

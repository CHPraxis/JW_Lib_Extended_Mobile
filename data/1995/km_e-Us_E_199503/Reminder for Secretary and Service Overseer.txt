Reminder for Secretary and Service Overseer
Each year an announcement in the February issue of Our Kingdom Ministry directs the secretary and the service overseer to “review the activity of all regular pioneers.” What is the purpose of this review? It is to determine who may need help to meet the hour requirement before the service year ends.
Regular pioneers are required to devote 1,000 hours each year to the ministry. By the end of February, some pioneers find that they have fallen behind, and this can lead to discouragement. The elders can often be helpful to pioneers, giving them encouragement and practical suggestions. This can make the difference between pioneers successfully meeting their requirements for the year or dropping off the list.
The pioneers will certainly appreciate the genuine concern of the elders in this regard. The congregation will also benefit by having pioneers who are happy in their ministry, faithfully sticking to their assignment.

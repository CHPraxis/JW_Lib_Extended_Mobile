Proclaiming ‘the Words of the Prophecy’
1 We are living in a time when prophecies in the book of Revelation are being fulfilled. Many are seeking to understand the meaning of the disturbing events taking place. They can benefit from ‘hearing the words’ of the prophecy of Revelation. (Rev. 1:3) During the month of March, we have opportunity to assist them by featuring the Revelation Climax book. When offering it we should keep in mind that the problems facing mankind today were foretold in the book of Revelation. What, then, can we say?
2 This approach might be effective:
▪ “War, famine, and disease have plagued mankind in this 20th century. Why do you think that is so when man has made so much technical advancement? [Allow for response.] Many are surprised to learn that these conditions were foretold in the Bible. Likely you are familiar with the expression ‘the four horsemen of the Apocalypse.’ What the Bible says about these horsemen is actually a prophecy that is being fulfilled in world events today. [Open the Revelation Climax book to chapter 16, and point out the illustrations on pages 91-7.] While this prophecy predicts a time of great distress, it also offers hope. [Read Revelation 6:2 in paragraph 3.] The Rider on the white horse is Jesus Christ. He has promised to conquer wickedness and bring about a world of happiness and peace through the Kingdom that he taught us to pray for.” Offer the book.
3 Perhaps this question might prompt a meaningful discussion:
▪ “What do you feel is needed to remove the bad conditions in the world? [Allow for response.] Most people agree that there is a need for drastic changes if this world is going to survive. The Bible shows that God knows how to solve our problems and has promised to help us.” Turn to the Revelation Climax book, page 171, and read Revelation 11:15 in paragraph 1. Turn to the illustrations on pages 302 and 308, and point out the blessings that will be realized under Kingdom rule by Christ. Then explain how the householder can personally benefit.
4 You might feel comfortable saying something like this:
▪ “Many people who have read the Bible book of Revelation found it difficult to understand. It describes a variety of unusual and significant events. This book, Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand!, provides a verse-by-verse consideration of the entire book of Revelation and shows how we are personally affected by the fulfillment of its prophecies.” Open the book to page 15, paragraph 2, and point out Revelation 1:1, in bold type. Explain that specific comments of this kind are provided on every single verse in the book of Revelation and that this information will help him to understand these remarkable prophecies. Offer to leave the book if there is a favorable response.
5 If the person is busy or you are not certain there is sufficient interest, you might leave a magazine or a tract. When you return and interest is shown, the book could be offered.
6 The message contained in Revelation affects all mankind. Everyone needs to hear the words of the prophecy. May we do all we can to proclaim this vital message.

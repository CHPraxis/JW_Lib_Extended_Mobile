Question Box
â–ª What attention needs to be given to the equipment we use in the witness work?
1 Although having an appropriate Scriptural presentation in mind, a publisher of the good news might be unprepared when it comes to the equipment he uses. When at the door, he may not have the current literature offer. The magazines, brochures, and tracts in his witnessing case may be wrinkled or tattered. He may be unable to find a pencil or a house-to-house record because his case is not properly organized. It is important to give careful attention to your equipment before sharing in field service.
2 What items should a well-equipped witnessing case contain? A Bible is essential. Include a supply of house-to-house records. Be sure that you have the publication that is being featured for the month. Current issues of the magazines, as well as tracts and brochures, are also needed. Carry a copy of the Reasoning book. Having the latest Our Kingdom Ministry will allow you to review suggested presentations before going to the door. When working in territory where you are likely to meet people who speak a foreign language, it would be good to have the booklet Good News for All Nations. Having a copy of one of our publications designed for young people will help you to be prepared to speak to teenagers.
3 Everything used should be neatly arranged in your case. The case itself does not have to be new, but it should be clean and in good condition. Your witnessing case is part of your equipment for use in declaring the good news. Keep it in good order.

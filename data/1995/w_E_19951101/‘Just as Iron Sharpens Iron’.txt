‘Just as Iron Sharpens Iron’
TOWARD the end of the third century C.E., an earnest young man named Anthony, described as a “Coptic Christian,” retired from the world and spent 20 years isolated in the desert. Why? He felt that this was the best way for him to serve God. He was Christendom’s first influential hermit, or eremite.
Today, Christendom has few hermits. But more and more individuals seek isolation in another way. They refuse to talk to others about religion, feeling that such talk leads to disagreements and fights. Their worship consists mainly of doing no harm to their neighbor.
True, doing no harm to one’s neighbor is a part of true religion, but more is needed. An ancient proverb states: “By iron, iron itself is sharpened. So one man sharpens the face of another.” (Proverbs 27:17) The fact is, the Bible encourages Christians to meet together, not to isolate themselves completely from the world or from other Christians. (John 17:14, 15) It says: “Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together.” (Hebrews 10:24, 25) Jehovah’s Witnesses follow that counsel. Several times a week, they gather together to ‘sharpen one another’s face,’ building up the faith of fellow believers. They find that honestly discussing the Bible does not lead to fights. Rather, it leads to harmony and peace. It is a vital part of true worship.

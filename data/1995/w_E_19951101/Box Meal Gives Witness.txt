Box Meal Gives Witness
IN THE days following the earthquake in Kobe, Japan, last January, people in the affected area had a hard time finding food. Still, Jehovah’s Witnesses did not lack sustenance, thanks to the kind assistance of their friends. For the first two or three days after the quake, nearby congregations provided rice balls. Soon, caring friends were providing box meals. To the box meals, many attached notes expressing concern for the affected ones. Those who received the meals said that every meal was “salted” as they could not hold back their tears when reading the notes.
Jehovah’s Witnesses shared their food with others who were in need. One Witness found himself eating his lunch while traveling by car with a non-Witness colleague working in the same company. So he shared one of the box meals he had received.
“Where did you buy this box lunch?” his colleague asked. The brother explained the relief work of the Witnesses. “I haven’t eaten vegetables for days. I’m going to save some and take it home for my family,” the man said appreciatively.
The third time this happened, the colleague handed 3,000 yen (about $35, U.S.) to the Witness and said: “I’m familiar with your activities, so please let me make a donation to your work. I appreciate your sharing your lunch with me. Really, your friends are all such nice people.”

Do Not Miss the “Joyful Praisers” District Convention
Three rewarding days of Bible instruction await you. Be present when the program begins with music at 9:40 Friday morning. Enjoy the opening talk, “Welcome, You Joyful Praisers of Jehovah!,” as well as the keynote address, “Set Apart as Joyful Praisers Worldwide.”
Friday afternoon’s program will focus on youths, their parents, and education. “Am I Prepared to Get Married?” is a talk many will want to hear. Parents should listen carefully to the discussion “Parents Who Find Pleasure in Their Children.” The afternoon program will conclude with the discourse “Education​—Use It to Praise Jehovah.” What is provided should help youths to get along successfully in school.
The Saturday morning symposium, “Answering the Call to Praise Jehovah,” should be encouraging to many. The morning session will conclude with the baptism talk. In the afternoon, there will be a frank discussion of how Satan from early times has used sexual desire to ensnare people. The day’s program will conclude with the presentation of information that should equip God’s people to carry out their ministry more effectively.
Sunday morning’s session will feature stimulating information focusing attention on the urgent need to flee to safety without delay before the “great tribulation.” (Matthew 24:21) The session will conclude with the important drama “Honoring Worthy Ones in Their Older Years.” In the afternoon, the public talk “Praise the King of Eternity!” will be another highlight of the convention.
Since 180 conventions are scheduled in the United States alone, there will be a convention not far from your home. Check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the time and place of the one nearest you.

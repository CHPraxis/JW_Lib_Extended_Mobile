<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IT IS early morning, and the air is cool and still. Every leaf and blade of grass shimmers with droplets, glittering in the first light of day. In a way, it seems as if the greenery has shed tears of joy in greeting the sunrise. Little wonder that dew has inspired poets​—and photographers.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, dew does more than refresh the human spirit. This atmospheric phenomenon, common all over the planet except in the polar regions, is a blanket of life-​sustaining moisture. Jehovah God has so designed the atmosphere that when it cools during the night under certain conditions, it reaches what is known as the dew point. This is the temperature at which the air can no longer hold on to its moisture and deposits it onto surfaces that are cooler than the surrounding air. Through their leaves, thirsty plants have been known to absorb as much as their own weight in dewdrop water, much of which they expel through their roots for storage in the soil.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In Bible lands, where there is a long dry season, dew may at times be virtually the only source of water for plants. Thus in the Bible, dew is often associated with the yield of crops​—and the lack of dew, with famine.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Dew can also have a more personal meaning. In his farewell song to God’s people, Moses wrote: “My instruction will drip as the rain, my saying will trickle as the dew, as gentle rains upon grass and as copious showers upon vegetation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:2-5:32:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>) Moses spoke words that were life-​giving like dew. Since he was the meekest of men, it is certain that he was habitually gentle and considerate in his speech as well. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:12:3-4:12:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Numbers 12:3</a>) Like dew or gentle rain, his words nourished without causing damage.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The next time you wonder at the gentle beauty of the morning dew​—nature’s own tears—​you may want to ponder the awesome wisdom of dew’s Creator.</p>

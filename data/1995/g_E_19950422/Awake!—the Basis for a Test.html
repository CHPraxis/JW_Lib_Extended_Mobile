<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHEN students in the South American country of Suriname opened their high school entrance examination booklet in July 1993, they discovered that regular <em>Awake! </em>magazine readers had an advantage. This was because nearly half of the questions in the 36-​page booklet, which had been prepared by the Ministry of Education’s Examination Bureau, were based on two articles from <em>Awake!</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Pages 1 through 9 featured the article “Shantytowns​—Hard Times in the Urban Jungle,” which appeared in <em>Awake! </em>of October 8, 1992. There were 21 questions that tested comprehension on that material. Pages 10 to 16 of the examination booklet contained 14 questions on the article “The Capybara​—Mistake or Marvel of Creation?,” which appeared in <em>Awake! </em>of September 22, 1992.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“By using these articles to examine the textual comprehension of students throughout the country,” remarked one headmaster in the western part of Suriname, “school authorities show that they view <em>Awake! </em>as a model of correct grammar and crisp writing.”</p>

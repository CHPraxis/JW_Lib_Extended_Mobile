Awake!​—the Basis for a Test
WHEN students in the South American country of Suriname opened their high school entrance examination booklet in July 1993, they discovered that regular Awake! magazine readers had an advantage. This was because nearly half of the questions in the 36-​page booklet, which had been prepared by the Ministry of Education’s Examination Bureau, were based on two articles from Awake!
Pages 1 through 9 featured the article “Shantytowns​—Hard Times in the Urban Jungle,” which appeared in Awake! of October 8, 1992. There were 21 questions that tested comprehension on that material. Pages 10 to 16 of the examination booklet contained 14 questions on the article “The Capybara​—Mistake or Marvel of Creation?,” which appeared in Awake! of September 22, 1992.
“By using these articles to examine the textual comprehension of students throughout the country,” remarked one headmaster in the western part of Suriname, “school authorities show that they view Awake! as a model of correct grammar and crisp writing.”
If you would like a copy of Awake! or would like to have someone call at your home to discuss this matter, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY, 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.

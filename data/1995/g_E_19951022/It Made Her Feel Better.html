<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">TARA PATEL writes a column entitled “On My Own” in <em>The Daily, </em>a newspaper published in Bombay, India. In January she wrote about the article “Is Your Life Boring? You Can Change It!,” which appeared in the January 22, 1995, <em>Awake! </em>“I’ve got a subscription to it,” she said of <em>Awake!, </em>“although I tend to dismiss it as one of the goody, goody magazines of the world.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, she added: “Getting more and more involved with the article, I muttered back, of course, my life is boring, terribly boring. Don’t even ask how boring! So what’s the solution?” She then went on to quote <em>Awake! </em>at length, concluding: “Keep learning. Have personal goals. Be creative. Do something with your hands. Have a purpose in life. Take God into consideration.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“All that. Goody, goody or not, come to think of it, it’s sound advice. Somehow this <em>Awake </em>mag[azine] makes me feel better. Subscribe to it if you wish.” Then Tara Patel provided the address in India for obtaining more information.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If you would like to receive a copy of <em>Awake! </em>as well as its companion magazine, <em>The Watchtower, </em>please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

It Made Her Feel Better
TARA PATEL writes a column entitled “On My Own” in The Daily, a newspaper published in Bombay, India. In January she wrote about the article “Is Your Life Boring? You Can Change It!,” which appeared in the January 22, 1995, Awake! “I’ve got a subscription to it,” she said of Awake!, “although I tend to dismiss it as one of the goody, goody magazines of the world.”
However, she added: “Getting more and more involved with the article, I muttered back, of course, my life is boring, terribly boring. Don’t even ask how boring! So what’s the solution?” She then went on to quote Awake! at length, concluding: “Keep learning. Have personal goals. Be creative. Do something with your hands. Have a purpose in life. Take God into consideration.
“All that. Goody, goody or not, come to think of it, it’s sound advice. Somehow this Awake mag[azine] makes me feel better. Subscribe to it if you wish.” Then Tara Patel provided the address in India for obtaining more information.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>ANSWERS:</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn"><strong>1. Earthquake: STAY IN THE CAR.</strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Although the car’s suspension system will cause it to shake violently, you are probably safest inside​—provided you are not near buildings, overpasses, or utility wires.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>2. Tornado: GET OUT OF THE CAR.</strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In a car is likely the most dangerous place to be in a tornado. But what if there are no safe shelters nearby? FEMA says: “Lie flat in a ditch or other ground depression with your arms over your head.”</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>3. Blizzard: STAY IN THE CAR.</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Unless you see a safe haven within a reasonable distance, it is best to await rescue. The engine may be turned on for brief periods to provide heat, but keep a window slightly open to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. Leave on an inside light as a signal for rescuers.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn"><strong>4. Flood: GET OUT OF THE CAR.</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">“If a car stalls in floodwater,” warns FEMA, “get out quickly and move to higher ground. The floodwaters may still be rising, and the car could be swept away at any moment.” Do not take chances. Water can be deeper than it appears, and levels can rise rapidly.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><strong>FEMA advises that you keep this information in the glove compartment of your car. And it recommends that in <em>all </em>situations, “the most important rule is: Don’t panic.”</strong></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">BY <em>AWAKE! </em>CORRESPONDENT IN GERMANY</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“THEY are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:16</a>) With these words Jesus described the absolute neutrality of his followers toward political affairs. Do professed Christians today measure up to this standard?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Consider the following press comments regarding Christendom’s involvement in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), which until its dissolution in 1990 had been governed by a Communist regime.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">• “Now that the Lutheran Church in the GDR has basked in glory for a short time as mother of the peaceful revolution, its public rating seems to be sinking rapidly. To many it appears to have been more a pillar of support for the regime and a playground for the <em>Stasi </em>(State Security Service).”​<em>—Die Zeit, </em>November 1991.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">• “Various provincial Lutheran Churches . . . have expressed bewilderment at involvement of church workers and parishioners with the <em>Stasi.”​—Evangelische Kommentare, </em>January 1991.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">• “[Lutheran] Church leaders hear complaints that priests were no longer caring for their people as they used to, as they are active in politics.”​<em>—Süddeutsche Zeitung, </em>February 1990.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">• “Weizsäcker [former president of the Federal Republic of Germany] said that the [Lutheran] Church had always played a helpful role in the political relationship of the two German States.”​<em>—Wetterauer Zeitung, </em>February 1992.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Political meddling was by no means limited to the Lutheran Church. “Virtually every [Protestant] church grouping was infiltrated by Stasi agents,” reported <em>The European. </em>Manfred Stolpe, whom <em>The European </em>describes as “the protestant church’s chief negotiator with the communist authorities,” said in his defense: “I would have shaken hands with the Devil if it had furthered our cause.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The <em>Guardian </em>of London reported on the close relationship between the clergy and the Mafia in Italy. It stated: “Church and Cosa Nostra have cohabited peacefully for so long that the church is frequently accused of complicity.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The <em>Toronto Star </em>carried an article on the collaboration of some Russian Orthodox priests with the former KGB. The report states: “The disclosures about church collaboration with the communist regime represent the most shattering blow. . . . Material from KGB archives . . . suggests that senior church officials not only betrayed their own principles but were willing to compromise religious leaders abroad.”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">While the churches of Christendom continue to meddle in politics, genuine Christianity adheres to Jesus’ injunction to be no part of the world.</p>

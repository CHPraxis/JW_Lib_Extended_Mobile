<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[32]" class="sb">“GOD IS LOVE.” All who come to know God and obey his commandments gain a deep appreciation for the depth of that love. “The love is in this respect, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent forth his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.” As we exercise faith in Jesus’ precious ransom sacrifice, we ‘remain in God’s love.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 4:8-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:16-62:4:16" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 16</a>) Thus we may enjoy a wealth of spiritual blessings now and in the system of things to come, everlasting life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:15" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 John 2:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:17-62:2:17" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 2. How has observing God’s commandments benefited his servants?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The Bible record abounds with examples of those who have observed God’s commandments and have been richly blessed as a result. These include pre-Christian witnesses, concerning some of whom the apostle Paul wrote: “In faith all these died, although they did not get the fulfillment of the promises, but they saw them afar off and welcomed them and publicly declared that they were strangers and temporary residents in the land.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:13-58:11:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:13</a>) Later, devoted Christian servants of God benefited from “the undeserved kindness and the truth [that] came to be through Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:17-43:1:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 1:17</a>) Throughout some 6,000 years of human history, Jehovah has rewarded faithful witnesses who have obeyed his commandments, which truly “are not burdensome.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:2-62:5:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 5:2, 3</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The Bible record states: “By faith Noah, after being given divine warning of things not yet beheld, showed godly fear and constructed an ark for the saving of his household; and through this faith he condemned the world, and he became an heir of the righteousness that is according to faith.” As “a preacher of righteousness,” Noah obeyed God implicitly, warning the violent pre-Flood world about the impending divine judgment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:7-58:11:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:5-61:2:5" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 2:5</a>) In building the ark, he carefully followed the divinely provided blueprint.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Noah and his family had to contend with the sinister influence of disobedient angels. These sons of God materialized and cohabited with women, producing a superhuman hybrid offspring that bullied mankind. “The earth came to be ruined in the sight of the true God and the earth became filled with violence.” Jehovah sent the Deluge to wipe out that wicked generation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:4-1:6:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 6:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:11-1:6:17" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 11-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:7:1-1:7:1" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 7:1</a>) Since Noah’s day demonic angels have not been permitted to materialize in human form. Nevertheless, ‘the whole world continues to lie in the <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>power of the wicked one,’ Satan the Devil.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Today, as in Noah’s day, Satan is trying to bring mankind and our planet to ruination. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:18" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 11:15-18</a>) Hence it is urgent that we heed the inspired command: “Put on the complete suit of armor from God that you may be able to stand firm against the crafty acts of the Devil.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:11-49:6:11" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:11</a>, footnote) In this, we are fortified by studying God’s Word and applying it in our lives. Further, we have Jehovah’s caring organization, with its anointed “faithful and discreet slave” and its loving elders, to shepherd us patiently in the way that we should go. We have a global preaching work to accomplish.

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu">6, 7. (a) What rewarding choice did Moses make? (b) What courageous pattern did Moses leave for us?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Consider another man of faith​—Moses. He could have enjoyed a self-sparing life amid the luxuries of Egypt. But he chose “to be ill-treated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin.” As Jehovah’s commissioned servant, “he looked intently toward the payment of the reward [and] continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:23-58:11:28" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:23-28</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:12:3-4:12:3" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Numbers 12:3</a>, we read: “The man Moses was by far the meekest of all the men who were upon the surface of the ground.” Conversely, Pharaoh of Egypt acted like the proudest of all men. When Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron to declare his judgment on Pharaoh, how did they respond? We are told: “Moses and Aaron went ahead doing as Jehovah had commanded them. They did just so.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:7:4-2:7:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Exodus 7:4-7</a>) What a courageous pattern for us who declare God’s judgments today!</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 8. How were the Israelites required to do “just so,” and how will the rejoicing that resulted be paralleled in the near future?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Did the Israelites lend Moses loyal support? After Jehovah had afflicted Egypt with nine of the ten plagues, he gave Israel detailed instructions on celebrating the Passover. “Then the people bowed low and prostrated themselves. Subsequently the sons of Israel went and did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron. They did just so.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:27-2:12:28" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Exodus 12:27, 28</a>) At midnight of that eventful day, Nisan 14, 1513 B.C.E., God’s angel proceeded to slay all of Egypt’s firstborn but passed over the Israelite homes. Why were the firstborn of Israel spared? Because they had found protection under the blood of the Passover lamb, splashed on their doorways. They had done just as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron. Yes, “they did just so.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:50-2:12:51" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Exodus 12:50, 51</a>) At the Red Sea, Jehovah performed a further miracle in saving his obedient people while destroying Pharaoh and his mighty military machine. How the Israelites exulted! Likewise today, many who have obeyed Jehovah’s commandments will rejoice to be eyewitnesses of his vindication at Armageddon.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:15:1-2:15:2" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Exodus 15:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:15:3-66:15:4" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Revelation 15:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 9. What modern-day privileges are foreshadowed by the Israelites’ doing “just so” in connection with the tabernacle?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>When Jehovah commanded Israel to <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>take up a contribution and build a tabernacle in the wilderness, the people generously gave their full support. Then, even to the minutest detail, Moses and his willing coworkers followed the architectural plans provided by Jehovah. “So the work for the tabernacle of the tent of meeting all came to its completion, in that the sons of Israel kept doing according to all that Jehovah had commanded Moses. They did just so.” Similarly, at the inauguration of the priesthood, “Moses proceeded to do according to all that Jehovah had commanded him. He did just so.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:39:32-2:39:32" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Exodus 39:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:16-2:40:16" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 40:16</a>) In modern times, we have the opportunity to give wholehearted support to the preaching work and to programs for Kingdom expansion. It is our privilege thus to unite in doing “just so.”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>Joshua​—Courageous and Very Strong</strong></p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">10, 11. (a) What equipped Joshua for success? (b) How may we be strengthened to cope with modern-day trials?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>When Moses commissioned Joshua to lead Israel into the land of promise, likely Jehovah’s inspired written Word was available only in the five books of Moses, one or two psalms, and the book of Job. Moses had instructed Joshua to congregate the people when they reached the Promised Land and to “read this law in front of all Israel in their hearing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:10-5:31:12" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 31:10-12</a>) Moreover, Jehovah himself commanded Joshua: “This book of the law should not depart from your mouth, and you must in an undertone read in it day and night, in order that you may take care to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way successful and then you will act wisely.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Joshua 1:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>The daily reading of Jehovah’s “book” equipped Joshua to handle the trials ahead, just as daily reading of Jehovah’s Word, the Bible, strengthens His modern-day Witnesses to cope with the trials of these critical “last days.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="24-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>) Surrounded as we are by a violent world, let us also take to heart God’s admonition to Joshua: “Be courageous and strong. Do not suffer shock or be terrified, for Jehovah your God is with you wherever you go.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:9-6:1:9" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Joshua 1:9</a>) After conquering Canaan, Israel’s tribes were richly rewarded when settling into their inheritance. “Just as Jehovah had commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:14:5-6:14:5" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Joshua 14:5</a>) A similar reward awaits all of us today who read God’s Word and apply it in our lives, obediently doing “just so.”</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>What of the kings in Israel? Jehovah had laid upon the king this requirement: “When he takes his seat on the throne of his kingdom, he must write in a book for himself a copy of this law from that which is in the charge of the priests, the Levites. And it must continue with him, and he must read in it all the days of his life, in order that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God so as to keep all the words of this law and these regulations by doing them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:17:18-5:17:19" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 17:18, 19</a>) Did Israel’s kings obey that command?

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>However, David​—the first faithful human king in Israel—​showed exceptional devotion to Jehovah.

Also, your own servant has been warned by them; in the keeping of them there is a large reward.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:11" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7-11</a>) If daily reading of Jehovah’s Word and meditating on it were rewarding 3,000 years ago, how much more this is so today!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 1:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:13:6-19:13:6" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 13:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:72-19:119:72" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> 119:72,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:97-19:119:97" data-bid="32-4" class="b"> 97,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:111-19:119:111" data-bid="32-5" class="b"> 111</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Still, it is not sufficient simply to gain knowledge. It is also essential for God’s servants to act upon that knowledge, to apply it according to the divine will​—yes, to do “just so.” This can be illustrated in the case of David’s son Solomon, whom Jehovah chose “to sit upon the throne of the kingship of Jehovah over Israel.” Solomon received the assignment to build the temple, using the architectural plans that David received “by inspiration.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:28:5-13:28:5" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 28:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:28:11-13:28:13" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 11-13</a>) How could Solomon accomplish this tremendous task?

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:7:2-14:7:3" data-bid="34-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 7:2, 3</a>) Later, though, Solomon failed. In what respect?

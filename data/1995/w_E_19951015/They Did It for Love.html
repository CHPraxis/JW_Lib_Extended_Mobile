<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A FAITHFUL, hospitable widow in Canada was raising four young daughters as true Christians. The elders in the congregation noticed that her home was in need of extensive repairs. She had neither the money nor the skill to do the work herself. So in accord with the principle set out at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:9-54:5:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Timothy 5:9, 10</a>, the elders discreetly arranged to have the work done for her. How?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Plans were made for the widow and her children to be away for five days. More than 80 in the congregation gave their wholehearted support, donating materials, funds, and time. Minutes after the family departed, eager workers swarmed over the house like bees. The entire exterior of the house was repaired. Walls were patched and painted. Floors were sanded and refinished. New floor tile and carpet were installed. All necessary electrical and lighting fixtures were upgraded. Even worn-out furniture was replaced. A complete renovation was accomplished in just five days!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The buzz of excitement and activity generated quite a stir in the neighborhood. An 80-year-old neighbor was so moved by the Witnesses’ efforts that he brought his paintbrush and insisted on helping. The employer of one of the volunteers contributed a ventilation hood for the kitchen stove. Another employer donated new kitchen cupboards. One man was so impressed that he wanted to learn more about Jehovah’s Witnesses. He eagerly accepted the publication <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Complete surprise was written on the faces of the widow and her daughters upon their return. There was an abundance of tears, laughter, and hugs​—an unforgettable moment of Christian love and emotion. Indeed, genuine love and concern for needy members of the congregation is a mark of true Christianity, for Paul wrote: “Really, then, as long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Galatians 6:10</a>.</p>

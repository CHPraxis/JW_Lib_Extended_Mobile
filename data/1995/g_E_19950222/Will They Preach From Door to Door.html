<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“POPE Sends Preachers Onto Streets of Rome.” That was the title of a news report by Greg Burke. He wrote: “Pope John Paul has urged Catholics in Italy to follow the example of sects like Jehovah’s Witnesses, who have been winning converts in the country, and start preaching door-​to-​door.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“‘It’s not time to be ashamed of the Gospel, it’s time to preach it from the rooftops,’ the Pope said on Monday to 350 itinerant preachers and religion teachers. . . .</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“‘I hope that your project to proclaim the Gospel in the streets . . . brings abundant fruits,’ he told them. ‘You have rediscovered a style of preaching that reaches out even to those who have strayed from the faith.’”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Reporter Burke noted: “Catholic Church attendance has fallen sharply in Italy over the last two decades, and the Pope’s enthusiasm for door-​to-​door preachers appears to be at least partly a response to the waning of its influence.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Such exhortation to “start preaching door-​to-​door” is not entirely new. A previous pope, Paul VI, said that the Catholic Church “exists in order to evangelize.” And the present pope, John Paul II, issued his encyclical <em>Redemptoris Missio </em>in 1991 to alert his church to the need to carry out the command of Jesus to preach publicly.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Roman Catholic writer Peter Hernon posed the question in the London <em>Catholic Herald: </em>“Whatever happened to evangelisation?” He was concerned about the much-​touted “decade of evangelisation” that is now several years old. When he asked a bishop about the lack of progress, the bishop responded: “You mustn’t be in a hurry. The Church has only been around for 2000 years.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">No wonder Hernon asked: “Where is the urgency conveyed by Jesus as He despatched His disciples to evangelise the surrounding villages? Or by St Paul: ‘Woe to me if I do not preach the Gospel! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:16-46:9:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Co 9:16</a>).’” Indeed, will Catholics imitate early Christians who preached publicly “and from house to house”?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:42-44:5:42" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 5:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:20-44:20:20" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 20:20</a>, <em>Douay Version.</em></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Hernon acknowledged that when it comes to door-​to-​door evangelism, he “can hear the sceptics muttering ‘theoretical, impractical.’ Not so,” Hernon responds. “To justify that claim I need to use a naughty word. I know it is naughty because the last time I used it in a Catholic article the whole section was edited out (though nothing else was altered). The word is Jehovah’s Witness. . . . Each Witness is also taught that, by his very calling, he is necessarily a missionary.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Though Hernon disagrees with the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses, he concedes that when a person considers their methods of preaching, “it is hard not to be reminded of the early Church as depicted in the acts of the Apostles.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses continue their zealous door-​to-​door ministry, thus fulfilling in these modern times the command of Jesus Christ: “You will be witnesses of me . . . to the most distant part of the earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>.</p>

Valuable Help for School Projects
“THE Watchtower and Awake! journals are definitely the most informative, the easiest to read and comprehend, the most timely, and the most encouraging journals I’ve ever read,” wrote a teenage reader. “The information for the majority of my school projects has come from these magazines. When I’m studying something in school, an article on that very subject is there to encourage me and help me understand the topic and its importance.
“For example,” she explained, “I needed a topic for a science project for the Science Fair we are required to enter. The project required three posters, a report, and a model. So I decided to develop the subject of the greenhouse effect, which was discussed in the September 8, 1989, Awake! I based my posters on illustrations that appeared in the articles and used the information therein for my report. My biology teacher gave me an A, and I received the first-​place award for the section on ecology and conservation!”

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ An adequate supply of forms for use during the 1996 service year is being sent to each congregation. These forms should not be wasted. They should be used only for their intended purpose.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Each congregation will receive three Literature Inventory forms (S(d)-18). The congregation secretary should meet with the literature servant early in August and set a date for taking inventory of the congregation’s stock of literature at the end of the month. An actual count must be made of all literature in stock, and the totals are to be entered on the Literature Inventory form. The total number of magazines on hand can be obtained from the magazine servant. <em>Please mail the original to the Society no later than September 6. </em>Keep a carbon copy for your files. The third copy may be used as a work sheet. The inventory should be supervised by the secretary, and the completed form should be checked by the presiding overseer. The secretary and the presiding overseer will sign the form.</p>

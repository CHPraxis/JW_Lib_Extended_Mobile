New Special Assembly Day Program
1 Why should we declare the good news without letup? What are the requirements for being a preacher of the good news? How can even shy or timid ones take the initiative in sharing the good news with others? These and other thought-provoking questions will be answered in the special assembly day program starting in September, with the theme “Qualified as Ministers of the Good News.”​—Compare 2 Corinthians 3:5.
2 As Jehovah’s people, we must be circumspect about our behavior. Encouraging experiences will be given by young people who will relate how they have resisted peer pressure. Parents will be provided with loving encouragement regarding the need to train their children as ministers of God. All of us will be helped to appreciate the necessity to preach and the blessings that accrue both to ourselves and to those who listen to us.​—1 Tim. 4:16.
3 Surely the baptism will be a highlight of the day. Prior to this event, a Bible-based talk will be directed specifically to newly dedicated persons. Of course, all present will want to pay careful attention as the subject of baptism is discussed and its meaning made clear. Any who desire to be baptized at the special assembly day should make this known to the presiding overseer well in advance so that he will have sufficient time to arrange for elders to review the designated questions with baptismal candidates.
4 Another highlight will be the principal talk delivered by a guest speaker. It is entitled “Qualified and Equipped as God’s Ministers.” Four main provisions that equip us as ministers will be discussed, and the talk will include faith-building experiences.
5 Plan now to be in attendance for the entire program. Be sure to invite interested persons and Bible students so that they too can benefit from this day of theocratic education. In this way we can make sure that we are “adequately qualified” as ministers of the good news.

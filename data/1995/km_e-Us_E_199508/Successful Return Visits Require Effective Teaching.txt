Successful Return Visits Require Effective Teaching
1 Return visits are an important and joyful part of our field ministry. Why should we be diligent to call back on interested ones? Jehovah’s name is made known and is honored by this disciple-making work, and God-fearing ones are helped to find the way to life. (2 Cor. 2:17–3:3) Recognizing that both the sanctification of Jehovah’s name and the lives of others are involved should move us to prepare well before going back.
2 A good teacher will help the student build on the foundation already laid. Just as a schoolteacher builds on the knowledge students gain from day to day, we should usually follow up our initial call with further comments on the same subject. This makes for continuity of thought and for progressive thinking.
3 When you return after placing the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?” you may find this effective:
▪ “On my previous visit, we were discussing ‘the last days’ mentioned in the Bible and what that means for us. You may wonder how we know that we are living in the last days. (2 Tim. 3:1) Jesus’ disciples were anxious to get the answer to that question. [Read Matthew 24:3.] In his reply, Jesus described conditions that we see about us today. These include distress and violence as never seen before.” Point out the feature of the sign discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4 on page 19. If the response is good, point out other features of the sign in paragraphs 5 to 8 on page 20. Offer to return and answer the questions raised on the front of the brochure.
4 To follow up interest in the brochure “What Is the Purpose of Life​—How Can You Find It?” you might say:
▪ “I have been anxious to resume our conversation about our purpose in living. I think we both agree that God intended for us to live on this earth in happy and peaceful conditions rather than in the turmoil we experience today. Do you think he will fulfill his promise?” Allow for response. Read Isaiah 55:11, and then discuss the thoughts in paragraphs 25 to 27 on page 30. Recommend a personal Bible study as the best way to find a worthwhile purpose in life.
5 To follow up previous interest shown in the brochure “Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!” you could display it again and say:
▪ “We talked about the beautiful world depicted on the cover of this brochure. I want to tell you why faith in Jesus Christ is so important to people who want to live there.” Turn to picture 41, and read Isaiah 9:6. Refer to picture 62, and read John 3:16, stressing the need for obedience. Explain that Jehovah’s Witnesses are helping people learn how to exercise faith by studying the Bible and trying to live by its counsel.
6 After each return visit, analyze it with a view to improving your effectiveness. Ask yourself: Did I have something definite in mind to say? Did I keep attention focused on the Bible? Did I build on the foundation laid on the initial call? Was my presentation designed to lead into a Bible study? Positive answers give assurance that you are striving to be a good teacher of God’s Word.

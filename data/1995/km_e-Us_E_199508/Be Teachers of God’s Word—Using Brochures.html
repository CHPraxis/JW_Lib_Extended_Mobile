<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Every dedicated servant of Jehovah has a responsibility to share in the work of teaching the Word of God to others. The seriousness of this responsibility becomes clear when we appreciate that it is the one with all authority in heaven and on the earth who has given us the commission to “make disciples of people of all the nations, . . . teaching them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:18-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18-20</a>) So, sharing in the preaching of the good news requires that we become teachers!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:2-55:2:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>During August we can use our teaching skills when offering brochures. We can pick out some interesting Scriptural thoughts in them and prepare a few comments that will help us get a conversation started.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>When offering the brochure “Does God Really Care About Us?” you could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ “We have called on many of your neighbors and found that they are concerned about the sharp increase in crime, terrorism, and violence. In your opinion, why has this become such a problem? [Allow for response.] It is of special interest to us that the Bible predicted this would happen. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-3</a>.] Note that this is to take place in ‘the last days.’ This implies that something is about to come to an end. What do you think it is?” Allow for response. Turn to page 22, point out the illustration, and discuss one or two scriptures quoted on that page. Make arrangements to return later to explain why we believe these blessings are near at hand.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>You might like to use this approach when offering the brochure “What Is the Purpose of Life​—How Can You Find It?”:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ “Many people experience difficulty in trying to find a real purpose in living. While a few enjoy some limited happiness, most live lives that are filled with disappointment and suffering. Do you think this is the way God intended for us to live? [Allow for response.] The Bible shows that God wants us to live in a world like this.” Point to the illustration on page 21, and then turn to pages 25 and 26, paragraphs 4-6, and explain what he has promised. Raise this question for discussion when you return: “How can we be sure that God will fulfill his promises?”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>You might offer the brochure “Enjoy Life on Earth Forever!” by displaying the full picture on the front and back covers and asking:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ “Would you like to live in a world full of happy people like this? [Allow for response.] The Bible tells us that God loves people and wants them to live forever in happiness on this earth.” Turn to picture number 49, and read one of the cited Scripture texts. Then, point to picture number 50, and explain what we must do if we want to live in this Paradise. Offer to return and discuss why faith in Jesus Christ is so important.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Jehovah is pleased when we make our ‘advancement manifest by paying attention to our teaching.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:15-54:4:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:15, 16</a>) Our brochures can be a real help to us in our efforts to assist those who yearn to hear “good news of something better.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:7-23:52:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 52:7</a>.</p>

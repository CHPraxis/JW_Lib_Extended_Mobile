NOTE: Congregations that have not yet requested the above-mentioned campaign items should do so on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S-14).
▪ An adequate supply of forms for use during the 1996 service year is being sent to each congregation. These forms should not be wasted. They should be used only for their intended purpose.
▪ Each congregation will receive three Literature Inventory forms (S(d)-18). The congregation secretary should meet with the literature servant early in August and set a date for taking inventory of the congregation’s stock of literature at the end of the month. An actual count must be made of all literature in stock, and the totals are to be entered on the Literature Inventory form. The total number of magazines on hand can be obtained from the magazine servant. Please mail the original to the Society no later than September 6. Keep a carbon copy for your files. The third copy may be used as a work sheet. The inventory should be supervised by the secretary, and the completed form should be checked by the presiding overseer. The secretary and the presiding overseer will sign the form.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting the 1996 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses with their September literature request. The calendars will be available in Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Ukrainian.
▪ From August 29, 1995, to September 1, 1995, the Society will be taking an inventory of all literature on hand in Brooklyn. Because of this inventory, no congregation literature requests will be processed for shipment or for pickup during those days.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb">IN ANCIENT times, Israel when faithful served on the world scene as a witness to Jehovah’s glory. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:8-23:41:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 41:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:10-23:43:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 43:10</a>) Many foreigners responded and came to worship Jehovah in association with His chosen people.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:43-2:12:48" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 12:43-48</a>) Some of the women married Israelites. Rahab of Jericho and Ruth the Moabitess became ancestresses of Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:5-40:1:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 1:5</a>) Such proselytes were part of the congregation of Israel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:23:7-5:23:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 23:7, 8</a>.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 3. What are the “new heavens” prophesied by Peter, and when were they established?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The heavenly governing arrangement of which the 144,000 anointed Christians will be a part was prophesied by the apostle Peter. He said: “There are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:13</a>) These “new heavens” were established in 1914, when Christ was enthroned as King in the heavenly Kingdom. But what of the “new earth”?</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 4. (a) What unexpected event occurred in 1919? (b) What was the ‘nation born at one time,’ and what was the ‘land brought forth with labor pains’?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>In 1919, Jehovah brought the anointed remnant out of captivity to Babylon the Great. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:4-66:18:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 18:4</a>) For the leaders of Christendom, this dramatic event was totally unexpected. Regarding it, the Bible says: “Who has heard of a thing like this? Who has seen things like these? Will a land be brought forth with labor pains in one day? Or will a nation be born at one time?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:66:8-23:66:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 66:8</a>) When the anointed congregation suddenly appeared before the nations as a liberated people, it was indeed a nation “born at one time.” What, though, was the “land”? In a sense, it was a spiritual equivalent of the land of ancient Israel. It was the realm of activity granted to the <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>newborn “nation,” a place where the Paradise prophecies of the book of Isaiah have a modern, spiritual fulfillment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:32:16-23:32:20" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isaiah 32:16-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:1-23:35:7" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 35:1-7</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:12-58:12:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:12-14</a>.) Wherever a Christian may be physically, he is in that “land.”</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 5. What nucleus came to exist in 1919? Explain.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>What had this to do with the “new earth” prophesied by Peter? Well, that new “nation,” born in 1919 in a restored “land,” was to develop into a worldwide organization made up of anointed and nonanointed praisers of Jehovah. This organization will survive Armageddon into God’s new world. In this way that nation could be viewed as the nucleus of the righteous human society, the new earth, that will exist after the destruction of Satan’s world.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> By the mid-1930’s, the anointed, as a group, had been gathered into the restored land. Since then, the emphasis has been on gathering the great crowd of other sheep, which today numbers almost five million. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:15-66:14:16" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Revelation 14:15, 16</a>) Is the “land” overpopulated? No, its boundaries can be extended as widely as necessary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:15-23:26:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isaiah 26:15</a>) Indeed, it is thrilling to see its population growing as the anointed remnant fills the “land” with “produce”​—healthful, invigorating spiritual food. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:27:6-23:27:6" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 27:6</a>) But what is the position of these other sheep in the restored “land” of God’s people?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>Foreigners Active in the “Land”</strong></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 6. How have foreigners been active in the “land” of God’s people?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Just as proselytes in the land of Israel submitted to the Mosaic Law, the great crowd today in the restored “land” obey Jehovah’s commandments. Educated by their anointed brothers, they abstain from false worship in all its forms and observe the sanctity of blood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:19-44:15:20" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 15:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:20" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Galatians 5:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> Colossians 3:5</a>) They love Jehovah with their whole heart, mind, soul, and strength and love their neighbor as themselves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:37" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 22:37;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:8-59:2:8" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> James 2:8</a>) In ancient Israel proselytes helped with the building of Solomon’s temple and supported restorations of true worship.

For example, they help to build up congregations and circuits, to say nothing of undertaking material construction projects, such as Kingdom Halls, Assembly Halls, and branch facilities.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 7. What happened in postexilic Jerusalem when there were not enough Levites to carry out temple services?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>In 537 B.C.E., when Israel returned from exile in Babylon, they set about organizing service on the temple site. However, the Levites who returned were not very numerous. Hence, the Nethinim​—circumcised alien residents who previously were assistants of the Levites—​were given increased privileges in temple service. They were not, however, equals of the anointed Aaronic priests.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:7:24-15:7:24" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ezra 7:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:8:15-15:8:20" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 8:15-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:3:22-16:3:26" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> Nehemiah 3:22-26</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 8, 9. How have the other sheep taken on an increasing share of the work of rendering sacred service during the last days?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Anointed Christians today have followed this pattern. As “the time of the end” has progressed, the remaining ones of the anointed have become fewer and fewer in the “land” of God’s people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:9-27:12:9" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Daniel 12:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Revelation 12:17</a>) In view of this, the great crowd now accomplish most of the work of rendering “sacred service.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:15-66:7:15" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Revelation 7:15</a>) Following the lead of their anointed brothers, they “offer to God a sacrifice of <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name.” They “do not forget the doing of good and the sharing of things with others,” knowing that “with such sacrifices God is well pleased.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:15-58:13:16" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:15, 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Moreover, with the great crowd increasing by the hundreds of thousands each year, there is an ever-growing need for oversight. At one time this was handled exclusively by anointed Christians. Now, oversight of most congregations, as well as circuits, districts, and branches, has of necessity been entrusted to the other sheep. In 1992 a few of these were given the privilege of attending meetings of committees of the Governing Body and serving as nonvoting helpers. Still, the other sheep remain loyal to their anointed fellow Christians and feel privileged to support them as Jehovah’s faithful and discreet slave.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:34-40:25:40" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 25:34-40</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>“Like a Sheik”</strong></p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">10, 11. Following the pattern of some Philistines, how have some former enemies of God’s people had a change of heart? With what result?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The way the faithful and discreet slave has used other sheep in positions of responsibility was prophesied at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:9:6-38:9:7" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Zechariah 9:6, 7</a>. There we read: “I shall certainly cut off the pride of the Philistine. And I will remove his bloodstained things from his mouth and his disgusting things from between his teeth, and he himself also will certainly be left remaining for our God; and he must become like a sheik in Judah, and Ekron like the Jebusite.”<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> The Philistines were sworn enemies of Jehovah’s people, as Satan’s world is today. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) Just as the Philistines were finally annihilated as a people, so this world, with its religious, political, and commercial elements, will soon experience Jehovah’s destructive rage.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:21-66:18:21" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Revelation 18:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:19-66:19:21" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 19:19-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>However, according to the words of Zechariah, some Philistines had a change of heart, and this foreshadowed that some worldlings today would not remain at enmity with Jehovah. They would cease religious idolatry with its abominable rites and disgusting sacrifices and be cleansed in Jehovah’s eyes. In our day such reformed “Philistines” are found in the great crowd.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">12. In modern times, how has “Ekron” become “like the Jebusite”?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>According to the prophecy, the major Philistine city of Ekron would become “like the Jebusite.” The Jebusites too were once enemies of Israel. Jerusalem was in their hands until David conquered it. Nevertheless, some of those surviving the wars with Israel evidently became proselytes. They served in the land of Israel as slaves and even had the privilege of working on the construction of the temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:4-10:5:9" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Samuel 5:4-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:8:1-14:8:18" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 8:1-18</a>) Today, “Ekronites” who turn to worshiping Jehovah also have privileges of service in the “land” under the oversight of the faithful and discreet slave.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">13. What were sheikhs in the ancient world?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Zechariah says that the Philistine would be like a sheikh in Judah. The Hebrew <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>word <em>ʼal·luphʹ, </em>when translated “sheikh,” means “leader of a thousand” (or, “chiliarch”). It was a very high position. The early nation of Edom apparently had only 13 sheikhs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:36:15-1:36:19" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Genesis 36:15-19</a>) The word “sheikh” is not often used when speaking of Israel, but the expression “head (or, chief) of a thousand” appears frequently. When Moses summoned representatives of the nation of Israel, he called on “the heads of the thousands of Israel.”<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> There were 12 of these, evidently subordinate only to Moses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:1:4-4:1:16" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Numbers 1:4-16</a>) Similarly, in the organization of the army, chiefs of thousands were second only to the general or the king.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:18:1-10:18:2" data-bid="32-1" class="b">2 Samuel 18:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:25:5-14:25:5" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 25:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">14. How today has the “Philistine” become like a sheikh?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Zechariah did not prophesy that the repentant Philistine would actually be a sheikh in Israel. That would not be proper, since he was not a natural-born Israelite. But he would be <em>like </em>a sheikh, occupying a position of authority comparable to a sheikh. And so it has proved to be. As the remnant of anointed Christians decrease in number and many of those who survive are limited by age, well-trained other sheep take up the slack, as it were. They do not want to supplant their anointed brothers. But the faithful and discreet slave gives them authority as needed in the “land” so that God’s organization can continue to move ahead in an organized way. Such a progressive process is seen in yet another prophecy.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:1-26:1:28" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Ezekiel 1:1-28</a>) When those purposes are finally accomplished, think with what joy Jehovah’s triumphant sanctification will be celebrated! The mighty anthem recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:13-66:5:13" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Revelation 5:13</a> will then be sung by all creation: “To the One sitting on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever”! Whether our place will be in heaven or on earth, do we not long to be there, joining our voices in that magnificent chorus of praise?</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature to be used during <strong>September: </strong>The <em>Live Forever </em>book will be used, and efforts should be made to start home Bible studies. <strong>October: </strong><em>Awake! </em>and <em>The Watchtower. </em>Make special effort to place copies of the magazines. Subscriptions may be offered on return visits when genuine interest is manifested. <strong>November: </strong>Offer the <em>New World Translation </em>with the book <em>The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? </em>NOTE: Congregations that have not yet requested the above-mentioned campaign items should do so on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S-14).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on September 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make an announcement to the congregation when this has been done.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Publishers planning to serve as auxiliary pioneers in October should turn in their application early. This will allow the elders to make necessary arrangements for literature and territory.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The elders are reminded to follow through on instructions given on <a class="xt" data-xtid="14" href="jwpub://p/E:1991286/5:213-22:257">pages 21-3 of the April 15, 1991, <em>Watchtower</em></a><em>, </em>regarding any disfellowshipped or disassociated persons who may be inclined toward becoming reinstated.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ A new <em>Watchtower Publications List </em>has been prepared, and four copies are being sent to each congregation. They should be distributed to the secretary and to the brothers caring for literature, magazines, and accounts.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ The Society receives many inquiries from publishers and others interested in financially advancing theocratic activities. In response to these inquiries, a magazine-size brochure entitled <em>Planned Giving to Benefit Kingdom Service Worldwide </em>has been prepared. The brochure contains information on gifts, wills, and trusts, as well as information regarding estate, financial, and tax planning. It is designed to help those desiring to benefit Kingdom service worldwide to select the best way to do so, given their family and personal circumstances. By reading the brochure and conferring with those working with the Society’s Planned Giving Desk, many have been able to assist the Society and at the same time maximize the tax benefits of doing so. The elders have a brochure available for inspection, or a personal copy may be obtained by writing or calling the Watch Tower Society, Planned Giving Desk, 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson, NY 12563-9204, telephone (914) 878-7000.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jehovah promises to teach us what we need to know. He assures us at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:8-19:32:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 32:8</a>: “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go. I will give advice with my eye upon you.” This assurance is of great benefit to us. Unselfishly, we want to show others how they can benefit themselves by heeding the wise counsel from the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 48:17</a>) During September we can do this by offering the <em>Live Forever </em>book. In making our presentations, there are various ways we can show the practical value of the Bible.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>In view of the prevalence of marriage problems today, you might choose to feature this thought from the “Live Forever” book:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “Most of the people I have spoken to are very concerned about the tremendous increase in marital unhappiness and divorce. How do you feel about this problem? [Allow for response.] Many have failed to realize the underlying causes. If they make a sincere effort, not only can couples save their marriage but they can find genuine happiness as well. The key to success lies in applying counsel found in the Bible.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:28-49:5:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:28, 29,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:33-49:5:33" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 33</a>. Turn to page 243, discuss paragraphs 16 and 17, and then offer the book.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>Children need quality time and training from their parents. In featuring the “Live Forever” book, you could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “All of us are concerned about the future well-being of our young people. In your opinion, what is the best way that parents can help their children find a secure future? [Allow for response.] Listen to this advice from a Bible proverb written about 3,000 years ago. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:6-20:22:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:6</a>.] While our children can benefit a great deal from instruction they receive in school, their most valuable training is provided at home by their parents. It requires time, attention, and love, but it is well worth the effort.” Turn to page 245, discuss paragraphs 20 and 21, and then explain how the book can be used as a basis for family study of the Bible.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>You may wish to offer the “Live Forever” book by showing how the earth will become a paradise:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “I’m sure you are concerned about what your life will be like in the future. In the Lord’s Prayer, Jesus taught us to pray for God’s will to be done on the earth as it is in heaven. What will the earth be like when that takes place? [Allow for response.] Here is an artist’s portrayal of a paradise world. [Point out the illustration on pages 12 and 13. Then read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:6-23:11:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>, included in paragraph 12.] Wouldn’t it be wonderful to live in such a world? This book will show you how you and your family can live in a paradise like this.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Preparing your presentation in advance is a key factor in determining your success at the door. Before you knock, make sure you have something specific to say about a Scriptural thought. Also, have in mind a brief comment about an interesting feature of the magazine or tract you plan to offer if the book is not accepted. Take advantage of every opportunity you have to sow the seeds of Kingdom truth during September. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:11:6-21:11:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eccl. 11:6</a>) You will be helping others to reap benefits that will last forever.</p>

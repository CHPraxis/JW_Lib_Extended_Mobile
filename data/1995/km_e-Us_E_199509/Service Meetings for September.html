Stress making special effort to distribute <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>during October. Since the magazines are published in a variety of languages, we should tell foreign-language-speaking persons that the magazines are available in their native language. (The local foreign-language congregation assigned to that territory should be informed.) In frequently worked territory, distributing our magazines can be the most effective means of cultivating interest, since they provide fresh information on a weekly basis. Where interest is found on return visits, offer a subscription. Have a family group demonstrate a practice session, as described in paragraph 14. Also, point out some practical suggestions for increasing placements.</p>

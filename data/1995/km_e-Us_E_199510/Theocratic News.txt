Cuba: Recently the Cuban government permitted a representative of the Society to visit Cuba as zone overseer. A meeting was held with the circuit and district overseers. The brothers are now able to assemble in groups of up to 150. They appreciate that they now enjoy increased freedom and that the Bethel Home can again be used as a center for Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses in Cuba.

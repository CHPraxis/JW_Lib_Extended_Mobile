<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>When making a return visit, you should endeavor to use a scripture that will add to the person’s knowledge of the Bible subject you discussed previously.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>One of the goals in making return visits on magazine placements is to establish a magazine route. A simple presentation like this might be effective:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “I hope you enjoyed the <em>Watchtower </em>article I left with you that explained why we should be in fear of God. Today I brought an article in the <em>Awake! </em>magazine that asks, ‘Why Is Life So Short?’ That’s a good question, isn’t it?” You could continue by saying: “Jesus’ well-known words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 3:16</a> give promise of everlasting life. Please accept this magazine and be encouraged by the solid hope offered in God’s Word.” Then explain that you will be back to bring the next issues and perhaps discuss further what God has promised for obedient mankind. Remember that each time you deliver the magazines, you can report a return visit.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>If you placed the article “A World Without War​—When?” you might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “What would life on this earth be like if there were no more wars? [Allow for response.] Let me show you what God has promised to do.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11</a>, and describe how things will be when God’s will is done here on earth. Remind the person of what Jesus taught his disciples to pray for as recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>. Help him to reason on the meaning of Jesus’ words. If there is genuine interest, you may offer a subscription to <em>The Watchtower </em>or <em>Awake! </em>and make arrangements to come back for further discussion.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>If you returned for further discussion on the cover series “Why Is Life So Short?” you might begin this way:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “The last time I called, we talked about human longevity. As you no doubt noted in the <em>Awake! </em>articles, scientists hold out little hope of helping us to live beyond 70 or 80 years. But what do you think about what the Bible promises? [Allow for answer.] The Bible shows that God has something much better in mind for man.” Then read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>, and explain how taking in knowledge can lead to everlasting life. At this point you may be able to offer a home Bible study or arrange for another Bible discussion.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>Starting a Bible study is an important goal in our ministry. Perhaps you have made several visits on a person who has accepted the magazines. Why not try this approach the next time you call?:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “People have so many different ideas about religion and its value in modern living. There are conflicting beliefs about why God has permitted wickedness or why we grow old and die. Some people would like to know how to pray and be heard by God.” Open one of our Bible study publications to a subject you feel will interest the householder, and briefly demonstrate how a study is conducted.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Jehovah is a God of purpose. Let us imitate him during October by making return visits with a purpose.</p>

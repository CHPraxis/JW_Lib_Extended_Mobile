Offer Magazines on Every Occasion
1 We have good reason to appreciate The Watchtower and Awake! What other magazines have such international appeal? This month the magazines will be featured in our preaching activity, and what powerful information the October issues contain! Usually, we place most of our magazines in the house-to-house work; however, we will want to be prepared also to offer them on every other appropriate occasion.
2 When offering the October 1 “Watchtower,” you might stimulate interest in the article “A World Without War​—When?” by saying:
▪ “Many people wonder why a world without war seems to be unattainable in spite of all the efforts of men. What do you think about these statements on page 5 of the October 1 Watchtower? [Read the first sentence in each of the first two paragraphs under the subheading “Religion​—A Great Hindrance,” and allow for response.] Of course, this doesn’t mean that there will always be wars. Notice God’s promise here at Isaiah 9:6, 7.” You may read this text from your Bible or as it is quoted in the Watchtower article. Explain briefly that The Watchtower advocates Jehovah’s Kingdom as the only hope for a peaceful world, and encourage the person to read the article.
3 When presenting the October 22 “Awake!” you might say:
▪ “What do you think about the question on the cover of this magazine: ‘Why Is Life So Short?’ [Allow for response.] This series of articles calls attention to what modern scientists and others have to say about aging, and then it focuses on what our Creator has promised regarding prospects for everlasting life. I would be pleased to leave you this copy if you care to read it.”
4 When you find people who are religiously inclined, why not feature an article from the October 15 “Watchtower”? This presentation may strike a responsive chord:
▪ “I’d like to get your opinion on this question: Is it possible to love God and fear him at the same time?” Allow for reply, and then read the caption text of the article “Why Fear the True God Now?” (Eccl. 12:13) Use one of the illustrations on page 199 of the Reasoning book, and offer the magazine if interest is shown.
5 When working from house to house, do not pass up small stores and shops. Those who regularly call on stores describe this activity as enjoyable and productive. You could try a simple presentation like this when offering the October 8 “Awake!”:
▪ “We know that businesspeople appreciate being kept up-to-date on issues that affect their community. I’m sure these articles will be of interest to you.” Then briefly share a point from the article “One-Parent Families​—How Successful Can They Be?”
6 If the person you approach is genuinely busy, you could display the magazines and say:
▪ “I know you weren’t expecting a visitor today, so I’ll be brief. I’d like to give you an opportunity to read something that is important.” Point out an article you have selected, and offer the magazines.
7 Keep a careful house-to-house record, and call back on all placements. If sincere interest is found on the return call, offer a subscription to one or both of the magazines. Let us be prepared and alert to offer our magazines on every appropriate occasion.

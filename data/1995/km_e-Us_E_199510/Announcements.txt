Announcements
▪ Literature to be used during October: Awake! and The Watchtower. Make special effort to place copies of the magazines. Subscriptions may be offered on return visits when genuine interest is manifested. November: Offer the New World Translation with the book The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? December: The new book, entitled Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life, will be offered, and a special effort will be made to follow up all placements, with a view to starting home Bible studies. January: Any 192-page book published prior to 1982 that the congregation may have in stock. Congregations that do not have a supply of such books may offer True Peace and Security​—How Can You Find It? NOTE: Congregations that have not yet requested the above-mentioned campaign items should do so on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S-14). The pre-1982 publications that may be used during January are not available in Brooklyn.
▪ The insert in this issue of Our Kingdom Ministry is the “Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 1996” and should be kept for reference throughout 1996.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting Examining the Scriptures Daily​—1996 with their October literature request. The booklets will be available in Arabic, Chinese, Chinese (Simplified), Croatian, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Iloko, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese. Until these booklets are available and shipments are made, they will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Examining the Scriptures booklets are special-request items.
▪ The November 8 issue of Awake! will include articles on Mormonism. This coverage is not an attack on the Mormon faith but rather a clear exposition of some Mormon beliefs in comparison with the Bible. These articles have been carefully researched and checked from Mormon sources. We believe this examination of Mormon history and doctrine will help sincere persons to see where the light of truth really lies. You may wish to order extra copies for your future contacts in the ministry. Congregations should notify the Society at once of any increased orders for this issue.

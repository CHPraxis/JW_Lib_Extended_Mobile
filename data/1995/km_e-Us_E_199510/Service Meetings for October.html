<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Have You Tried Referrals? A talk. Some publishers have been able to start new Bible studies in this way: After studying with an interested person for a while, they ask the person if he knows of anyone else among his friends, relatives, or acquaintances who might be interested in a Bible study. Often several names are given. Ask if you can use his name when calling on these individuals. When making the call, you might say: “So-and-so has enjoyed studying the Bible so much that he thought you too would like to benefit from our free Bible study program.” This can provide a nice list of return visits that may develop into productive Bible studies. Include one or two experiences from publishers who have found interested persons or started new studies in this manner.</p>

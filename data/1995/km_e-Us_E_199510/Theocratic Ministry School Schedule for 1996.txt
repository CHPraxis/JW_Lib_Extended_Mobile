Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 1996
INSTRUCTIONS
During 1996 the following will be the arrangements when conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.
TEXTBOOKS: The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures [bi12], Jehovah’s Witnesses​—Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom [jv], “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” (1990 Edition) [si], Reasoning From the Scriptures [rs], Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life [kl], and Insight on the Scriptures Vol. 1 [it-1] will be the basis for assignments.
The school should begin ON TIME with song, prayer, and remarks of welcome and then proceed as follows:
ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 15 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant, and it will be based on Jehovah’s Witnesses​—Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom or “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” When based on the Proclaimers book, this assignment should be delivered as a 15-minute instruction talk with no oral review; when based on the “All Scripture” book, it should be delivered as a 10- to 12-minute instruction talk with a 3- to 5-minute oral review following, using the printed questions in the publication. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the practical value of the information being discussed, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation. The theme shown should be used. Illustrations, photographs, and charts found in the Proclaimers book may be commented on by the speaker and used as teaching aids.
The brothers assigned this talk should be careful to keep within the time limit. Private counsel may be given if necessary or if requested by the speaker.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 6 minutes. This should be handled by an elder or a ministerial servant who will effectively apply the material to local needs. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. A 30- to 60-second overall review of the assigned chapters may be included. The principal objective, however, is to help the audience to appreciate why and how the information is of value to us. The students will then be dismissed to their various classrooms by the school overseer.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 2: 5 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material to be given by a brother. This will apply in the main school as well as in the auxiliary groups. The reading assignments are usually short enough to permit the student to present brief explanatory information in the opening and concluding remarks. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, and application of principles may be included. All the assigned verses should be read without a break. Of course, where the verses to be read are not consecutive, the student may cite the verse where the reading continues.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 3: 5 minutes. This will be assigned to a sister. The subject for this presentation will be based on Reasoning From the Scriptures or Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. The student assigned should be able to read. While presenting this information, the student may be either seated or standing. When the assignment is based on the Reasoning book, the sister presenting this part will need to adapt the theme and the material to be considered to a practical setting, preferably one that involves field service or informal witnessing. When the assignment is based on the Knowledge book, the setting may be a return visit or a home Bible study. The school overseer will be particularly interested in the way the student helps the householder to reason on and understand the material and in how the scriptures are applied. Paragraphs in the book need not be read. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but an additional assistant may be used. Not the setting but the effective use of the material should be given prime consideration.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 4: 5 minutes. This will be assigned to a brother or a sister. It will be based on a Bible character. For each assignment the name of a Bible character and a theme are set forth in the schedule. Information about the Bible character can be found in Insight on the Scriptures, Volume 1, under his name. The student should study Scriptural references in the material in order to get a clear picture of the Bible character​—the events of his life, as well as his personality, traits, and attitude. Thereafter, the student should develop the assigned theme of the talk and select appropriate scriptures to be used. Additional scriptures that highlight Bible principles that tie in with the theme may be included. The purpose of the talk is to show what can be learned from the example of the Bible character under consideration, whether good or bad. Acts of faithfulness, courage, humility, and unselfishness furnish good examples to be followed; unfaithful acts, as well as undesirable traits, stand as a strong warning to turn Christians away from an improper course. When assigned to a brother, this talk should be given with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind. When a sister is given this part, it should be presented as outlined for Assignment No. 3.
COUNSEL AND REMARKS: After each student presentation, the school overseer will give specific counsel, not necessarily following the program of progressive counsel outlined on the Speech Counsel slip. Rather, he should concentrate on those areas where the student needs to improve. If the student merits solely a “G” and there is no other speech quality marked “I” or “W,” then the counselor should circle the box, where the “G,” “I,” or “W” would normally appear, of the speech quality that the student should work on next. He will advise the student of this that evening as well as show this speech quality on the student’s next Theocratic Ministry School Assignment slip (S-89). Those on the program should sit toward the front of the hall. This will save time and enable the school overseer to give his counsel directly to each student. As time allows after the giving of necessary oral counsel, comments may be given by the counselor on informative and practical points not covered by the students. The school overseer should use no more than a total of two minutes for counsel and any other brief remarks after each student presentation. If the Bible highlights assignment left something to be desired, private counsel may be given.
PREPARING ASSIGNMENTS: Before preparing an assigned part, the student should read carefully the School Guidebook material dealing with the speech quality to be worked on. Students given Assignment No. 2 may choose a theme appropriate to the portion of the Bible that is to be read. Other assignments are to be developed in line with the theme shown on the printed schedule.
TIMING: No one should go overtime, nor should the counsel and remarks of the counselor. Assignments No. 2 through 4 should tactfully be stopped when the time is up. The one designated to give the stop signal should do so promptly. When brothers handling Assignment No. 1 and Bible highlights go overtime, they should be given private counsel. All should watch their timing carefully. Total program: 45 minutes, excluding song and prayer.
WRITTEN REVIEW: Periodically a written review will be given. In preparation, review the assigned material and complete the scheduled Bible reading. Only the Bible may be used during this 25-minute review. The balance of the time will be devoted to a discussion of the questions and answers. Each student will check his own paper. The school overseer will consider with the audience the answers to the review questions and concentrate on the more difficult ones, helping all to understand the answers clearly. If local circumstances make it necessary, the written review may be given a week later than what is shown on the schedule.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“WHEN a man does not know what harbor he is making for, no wind is the right wind.” These words, attributed to first-century Roman philosopher Lucius Annaeus Seneca, bear out a long-recognized truth: For life to have direction, goals are essential.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Often, however, life is an aimless drift. Many are content simply to avoid the rocks and whirlpools of everyday life. With no fixed bearing, they become like waves that are “carried forward by the wind one moment and driven back the next.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:6-59:1:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">James 1:6</a>, “Phillips”) For such people, “no wind is the right wind.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Bible provides examples of those who were goal oriented, thus serving as role models for Christians today. Moses “looked intently toward the payment of the reward.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:26-58:11:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:26</a>) Paul wrote: “I run straight toward the goal in order to win the prize.” He encouraged fellow believers to “have this same attitude.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:14-50:3:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Philippians 3:14, 15</a>, “Today’s English Version.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">With our eyes intently fixed on the Bible’s promises, may we imitate the faith of such goal-oriented men.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:7</a>.</p>

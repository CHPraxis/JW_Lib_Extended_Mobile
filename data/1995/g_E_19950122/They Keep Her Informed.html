<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A reader in Ohio, U.S.A., wrote: “I just want to let you know how much I appreciate the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. They are truly gems.” She explained how reading them keeps her informed.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I dropped out of high school 13 years ago,” she wrote. “Recently, I was required by the state to take a high school equivalency test, better known as the GED (General Educational Development) test. To prepare for this test, I had to take classes. Usually, if a person does well in these classes, in as little as six months, he can take the GED test. I, though, was prepared to take it within <em>four weeks, </em>and I received a very high score.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“The reason? Almost everything on the test​—science, social studies, and so forth—​had been covered in one way or another in past issues of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>Just by reading the magazines, my skills in reading, spelling, and punctuation were kept alive. In fact, I didn’t even study any of these subjects. The classes I attended only helped me to brush up on my math.”</p>

They Keep Her Informed
A reader in Ohio, U.S.A., wrote: “I just want to let you know how much I appreciate the Watchtower and Awake! magazines. They are truly gems.” She explained how reading them keeps her informed.
“I dropped out of high school 13 years ago,” she wrote. “Recently, I was required by the state to take a high school equivalency test, better known as the GED (General Educational Development) test. To prepare for this test, I had to take classes. Usually, if a person does well in these classes, in as little as six months, he can take the GED test. I, though, was prepared to take it within four weeks, and I received a very high score.
“The reason? Almost everything on the test​—science, social studies, and so forth—​had been covered in one way or another in past issues of The Watchtower and Awake! Just by reading the magazines, my skills in reading, spelling, and punctuation were kept alive. In fact, I didn’t even study any of these subjects. The classes I attended only helped me to brush up on my math.”

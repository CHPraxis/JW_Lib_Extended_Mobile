<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Two young students in Madras, India, shared the first prize for their model of a space station with a space vehicle and the launchpad. Where did the young boy and girl, seen in this photograph, get the idea for their project?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The youths explained in a letter to the publishers of <em>Awake!: </em>“We are taking this opportunity to thank you specially, since we obtained the prizes only because of the series on space exploration that appeared in the September 8, 1992, <em>Awake!”</em></p>

They Received First Prize
Two young students in Madras, India, shared the first prize for their model of a space station with a space vehicle and the launchpad. Where did the young boy and girl, seen in this photograph, get the idea for their project?
The youths explained in a letter to the publishers of Awake!: “We are taking this opportunity to thank you specially, since we obtained the prizes only because of the series on space exploration that appeared in the September 8, 1992, Awake!”

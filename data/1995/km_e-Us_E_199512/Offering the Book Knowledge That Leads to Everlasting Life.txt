Offering the Book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life
1 We were delighted when the new book, Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life, was released! It is designed to help people to come quickly to an accurate knowledge of the truth. In December we will have the first opportunity to offer this book in our territory. What can we say to stimulate interest?
2 Here is a presentation that might appeal to the person whose faith in God has become weak:
▪ “Many people grew up believing in God, but now they have found that their faith is not what it used to be. What do you think may be the reason for that? [Allow for response.] Our faith in God is strengthened by considering the marvels of the universe. [Read Psalm 19:1.] The One whose laws govern these heavenly bodies has also provided valuable direction for us. [Read Psalm 19:7-9.] These verses stress how important it is to learn all we can about God and his purposes. [Call attention to the illustration on pages 4 and 5, and read the caption.] If you would like to benefit from this special knowledge, I would be pleased to leave this book with you.”
3 Having some recent distressing news event in mind, you might say:
▪ “Likely you heard about [mention the event]. Have you ever wondered if God is really concerned about the injustice and suffering that we see about us or even experience ourselves? [Allow for response.] The Bible assures us that God loves us and that he will help us through times of distress.” Read portions of Psalm 72:12-17. Open the book to page 70, and point out that this book, Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life, answers a question that millions have asked, Why does God permit suffering? “You will find the Bible’s answer to that question very comforting. I would like to leave this book with you so that you can read about it yourself.”
4 If you meet a parent, you might focus on the family:
▪ “Most parents agree that there are many problems in trying to maintain a happy family life. What do you observe to be serious obstacles? [Allow for response.] Most of us do the best we can, but we usually appreciate assistance that will help us achieve better results. The Bible gives excellent advice. [Read portions of Colossians 3:12, 18-21.] The Bible has a lot more to say on this subject, as outlined in chapter 15 of this book, entitled ‘Building a Family That Honors God.’ It reviews counsel given in the Bible showing how to relieve marital stress and how to cope with the problems facing our children. I am sure you would enjoy reading it.”
5 If you prefer something brief, you might try this:
▪ “Have you ever wondered why we grow old and die? Chapter 6 in this book explains the cause of death and how God will remove it. The Bible tells us that God has promised everlasting life for those who love him. [Read John 17:3.] If you would like to read about this, you will find the book most enlightening.”
6 If we are well prepared, we may be able to use this book to ‘open up the Scriptures’ to others in a way that will bring them great joy!​—Luke 24:32.

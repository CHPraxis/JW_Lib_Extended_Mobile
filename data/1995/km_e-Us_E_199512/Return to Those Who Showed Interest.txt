Return to Those Who Showed Interest
1 When releasing the new book, Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life, the convention speaker explained that “honesthearted students should be able to learn enough through a study of it to take a stand for Jehovah and get baptized.” The book is designed to teach the truth quickly. It concisely provides specific information that can motivate students to make spiritual progress. It presents the truth in a positive way without dwelling on false doctrines. To have success in using this new instrument, we must make return visits on those who showed interest.
2 If you spoke to a person who lacked faith in God yet demonstrated some interest, you might begin by opening the book to the illustration on pages 4 and 5 and saying:
▪ “When I was here previously, we looked at this lovely illustration of beautiful surroundings. The caption asks, ‘What must you do to enjoy them?’ How would you answer that? [Allow for response.] The Bible clearly identifies one of the basic requirements. [Read John 17:3.] Knowledge is essential to our faith in God. An excellent way we can learn what we need to know is by systematically studying the Bible.” Turn to chapter 1 and point out some of the encouraging thoughts in paragraphs 1 to 5. Explain how a Bible study is conducted, and offer to return for more discussion.
3 If you return to continue your discussion on why God permits suffering, you might say:
▪ “The last time I was here, we talked about [whatever the event was]. The question came up as to why God permits so much suffering in the world. What conclusion did you come to? [Allow for response.] It is encouraging to know that God is not responsible for such distressful conditions.” Turn to pages 71-2 in the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life, and discuss some of the Scriptural thoughts covered in paragraphs 3 to 5. Offer to return again to explain why we can be sure that God’s permission of suffering will soon come to an end.
4 If you are returning to visit a parent who is concerned about family problems, you might say this:
▪ “I know that you, as a parent, want the best for your children. Since it is impossible to shield them from everything that is bad, you have to teach them how to cope with life’s problems. How do you think that can be done? [Allow for response.] One of the most important things a parent can provide is training.” Turn to pages 145-6 in the Knowledge book, and call attention to the Bible’s practical counsel, emphasizing its importance and how following it can be a blessing. Offer to return again to demonstrate how to use this book to learn more about acquiring a happy family life.
5 If you are making a call where you used a brief presentation, you could say:
▪ “It was never God’s purpose that we grow old and die. He intended that we live forever in a paradise earth.” Display the illustration on pages 188-9. Read paragraph 11 on page 184. Make arrangements for another return visit.
6 Surely this new book is another provision from Jehovah to ‘speed up’ the ingathering work in these last days. (Isa. 60:22) If we use it effectively, we can impart knowledge that may help someone toward gaining everlasting life.

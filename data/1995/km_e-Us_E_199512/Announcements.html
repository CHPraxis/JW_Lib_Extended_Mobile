<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature to be used during <strong>December: </strong><em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>A special effort will be made to follow up all placements, with a view to starting home Bible studies. Congregations that do not have this publication may use the <em>Live Forever </em>book. <strong>January: </strong><em>Making Your Family Life Happy, Worldwide Security Under the “Prince of Peace,” </em>or <em>True Peace and Security​—How Can You Find It? </em>Congregations that have on hand any 192-page books published prior to 1982 should offer such books first. <strong>February: </strong>Either <em>Making Your Family Life Happy </em>or <em>Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! </em><strong>March: </strong><em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. </em>NOTE: Congregations that have not yet requested the above-mentioned campaign items should do so on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S-14).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>for 1995 with their December literature request.

The bound volumes will be available in Chinese, Croatian, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish. Until the bound volumes are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Bound volumes are special-request items.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The Memorial for 1997 will be on Sunday, March 23, after sundown. This advance notice of the date for the 1997 Memorial celebration is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and they must find other facilities.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ Beginning on April 29, 1996, the book <em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life </em>will be considered at the Congregation Book Study.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ Work is almost finished on a new CD-ROM, which is <em>Watchtower Library​—1995 Edition. </em>This will contain a revised program and will add publications released during 1995, 1994, and 1979-1970.

Announcements
▪ Literature to be used during December: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. A special effort will be made to follow up all placements, with a view to starting home Bible studies. Congregations that do not have this publication may use the Live Forever book. January: Making Your Family Life Happy, Worldwide Security Under the “Prince of Peace,” or True Peace and Security​—How Can You Find It? Congregations that have on hand any 192-page books published prior to 1982 should offer such books first. February: Either Making Your Family Life Happy or Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! March: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. NOTE: Congregations that have not yet requested the above-mentioned campaign items should do so on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S-14).
▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of The Watchtower and Awake! for 1995 with their December literature request. (See the Watchtower Publications List, paragraphs 6-8, 10.) The bound volumes will be available in Chinese, Croatian, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish. Until the bound volumes are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Bound volumes are special-request items.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. Make announcement to the congregation when this has been done.
▪ The Memorial for 1997 will be on Sunday, March 23, after sundown. This advance notice of the date for the 1997 Memorial celebration is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and they must find other facilities.
▪ Beginning on April 29, 1996, the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life will be considered at the Congregation Book Study.
▪ Beginning with the August 1, 1995, issue of The Watchtower, a simultaneous, monthly edition is being produced in Punjabi.
▪ Albanian has been added to the languages in which Awake! is available. This is a quarterly edition and begins with the January-March 1996 issue. Distributor copies may be requested through the congregation. Please note that there is no subscription arrangement for this quarterly magazine.
▪ Work is almost finished on a new CD-ROM, which is Watchtower Library​—1995 Edition. This will contain a revised program and will add publications released during 1995, 1994, and 1979-1970. There will also be versions in German, Italian, and Spanish. Specific details have been provided in a letter from the Society to all congregations, dated November 25, 1995. Requests for this CD in one or more languages should be submitted by the congregation no later than January 15, 1996.

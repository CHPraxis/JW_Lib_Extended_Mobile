Question Box
▪ Should all baptized publishers fill out the health-care power of attorney (proxy) forms that the Society sent to all congregations last year?
“Time and unforeseen occurrence” can suddenly thrust us into situations that test our integrity to Jehovah. (Eccl. 9:11) Preparing for such challenges ahead of time will minimize Satan’s opportunity to get us to compromise. (Prov. 22:3; 1 Pet. 5:8) Unforeseen medical emergencies that challenge our resolve to “keep abstaining . . . from blood” are an example of such Satan-inspired attacks on our integrity.​—Acts 15:28, 29.
To help us in such medical situations, all congregations in the United States received a supply of health-care power of attorney (proxy) forms from the Society’s Legal Department in December 1994. Using pertinent state and federal law, these forms anticipate the type of medical emergency described above and refer to legal authority for judges and hospital lawyers who may question or challenge our refusal of blood. In addition, these forms set forth detailed medical information about minor blood fractions, alternative nonblood management, and end-of-life decisions.
Should all baptized publishers fill out a health-care power of attorney (proxy) form? As the December 1994 Our Kingdom Ministry announcement said, “publishers are not obliged to prepare these forms.” Thus, it is a personal decision each one of us must make. However, to make an informed decision about this provision from the Society, we should seriously consider whether we have done all we reasonably can to keep ourselves free from a God-dishonoring blood transfusion.​—Prov. 9:9.
As stated in the December 1994 Our Kingdom Ministry, publishers may obtain these power of attorney (proxy) forms and the explanatory question-and-answer folder from their congregation secretary.

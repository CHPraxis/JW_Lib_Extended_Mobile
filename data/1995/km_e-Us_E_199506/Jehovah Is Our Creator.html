<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Millions of people believe that God created life. Many others believe in evolution. Then there are those who are not sure what to believe. The book <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>is for all such people. This publication presents a thoroughly researched explanation of how life got here and what this means for our future. During June, we will be featuring this fine book.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Even prominent ones in the scientific community have acknowledged the book’s logic. One scientific researcher in the Netherlands wrote: “This book really does exceed all expectations. The logical buildup of the chapters and the illustrations are scientifically so up-to-date that you would have to be blind to raise any objections to them.” An attorney declared: “I have read it four times and continue to be impressed with the depth of study, scholarship, and documentation that went into its production.” So we can be confident that yet others will appreciate this book.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>You might choose to make a brief presentation like this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Open to page 6, and say: “Many people think that our beautiful earth and life upon it resulted from an accident. What do you consider to be a reasonable explanation as to how all of this came about? [Allow for response.] Mountains of evidence confirm the Bible’s account of a Creator who not only is very powerful but also loves us very much. He is the true God, and his name is Jehovah.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a>, and briefly explain how it is his purpose to transform the entire earth into a paradise.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>If you want to come to the point quickly, you might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ “Have you ever wondered about this question?” Point to the title of the book, turn to page 7, read the questions in paragraph 2, and explain that the book provides satisfying answers from the Bible.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>Or you might try this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ “Did you ever wonder how the earth came into existence? Many insist that it is the result of some colossal cosmic explosion. What do you think? [Allow for response.] The Bible teaches that God created the earth as our everlasting home. It is different from the other planets in our solar system. As far as we know, it is the only one in the universe that has all the complex provisions needed to sustain life.” Turn to paragraph 5 on page 130, and explain why the earth must be the work of a Master Designer.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong><em>Another approach might be something similar to this:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">▪ “Some people think that we evolved from ape-men. They claim that our ancestors looked like this. [Show the picture on page 89.] What do you think about that?” Allow for response. Point out what is stated in paragraph 20, and then read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:24-44:4:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 4:24</a>, which identifies Jehovah as our Creator and Life-Giver. “This book examines the entire theory of evolution in relation to what is stated in the Bible.” Refer to table of contents on page 5, and point out some titles, such as those for chapters 1, 7, 15, and 19.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>This book can be a blessing to sincere people who have been deceived by those without faith in Jehovah or his Word. The factual information the <em>Creation </em>book contains can help such ones to grow in appreciation for our Creator, who lovingly cares for us.</p>

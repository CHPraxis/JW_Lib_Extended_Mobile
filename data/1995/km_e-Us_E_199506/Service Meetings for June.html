<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">NOTE: <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Joyful Praisers” District Convention and then for a 30-minute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week. The day-by-day review of the district convention program should be assigned in advance to two or three qualified brothers who will be able to focus on outstanding points. This well-prepared review will help the congregation remember key points for personal application and for use in the field. Comments from the audience and experiences related should be brief and to the point.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Local announcements. Briefly discuss the importance of making return visits. The major part of our teaching work is done when we return to cultivate interest. Few people can make spiritual progress with the literature alone. When we fail to return, we miss our best opportunity to help them. Return visits produce Bible studies. Many publishers have got the best results by returning within a day or two rather than waiting a week.​—See <em>Our Ministry </em>book, pages 88-9.</p>

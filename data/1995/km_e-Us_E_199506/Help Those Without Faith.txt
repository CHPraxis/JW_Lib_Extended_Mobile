Help Those Without Faith
1 In this day and age, it has become popular to be viewed as educated and progressive in thinking. Human philosophies and fanciful theories are extolled, while spiritual values are ignored. Sincere people who are interested in simple facts and understandable truths will welcome the opportunity to examine the book Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? This book can help those who lack faith. (Rom. 1:19, 20) Be sure to make return visits on all those who express interest.
2 You might begin your discussion this way:
▪ “I’m sure you are aware that many educators support the belief that the human family got here by evolution. It teaches that everything exists by accident. How do you feel about that? [Allow for response.] This idea is still referred to as a theory. A theory is ‘a speculation’ or ‘an unproved assumption.’ For centuries men believed that the earth was flat; now we know that was a foolish assumption not based on fact. Could the same be true of the theory of evolution?” Read the introductory comments on page 4, and then discuss Isaiah 42:5.
3 Or you might take this approach when you return:
▪ “It is common to meet people who do not believe in God. Years ago, that was very rare. Why do you think so many have lost faith in God? [Allow for response.] Many attribute their loss of faith to the appalling increase in violence and distress in our world. They reason that if there is an almighty God, why doesn’t he put an end to all this suffering? Those who can’t find a satisfying answer to that question often become atheists. But there is overwhelming evidence to prove that God exists and that he will soon make the earth a place of happiness and peace.” Continue the discussion by using the Scriptural thoughts found in paragraph 19 on page 196.
4 With your Bible in hand, you might open the conversation by saying:
▪ “We are calling again to point out why a study of the Bible is practical for our times. Most people have a Bible, but few take time to read it. Some frankly tell us that they don’t have much confidence in the Bible anymore. How do you feel about that? [Allow for response.] One of the things that convinces us that the Bible is the inspired Word of God is the fulfillment of its prophecies.” Refer to Scripture texts in paragraph 6 on page 234.
5 This thought might get a favorable response:
▪ “We can see beauty and marvelous evidence of wisdom in the things that surround us on this earth. This lovely picture of a sunset is a fitting example.” Show the illustration on pages 12 and 13. Mention points from “Some Things to Think About,” and explain how this book provides satisfying answers to vital questions about our world.
6 We can be a blessing to others by using this book to help them find a solid basis for faith in their Creator.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>After a lengthy Bible discussion, a youth stated: “I was struck by the dynamic personality of Jesus Christ. Here is a leader I could believe in.” The same cannot be said of any national figure or of sports and entertainment heroes. True Christians do not view as models those who openly embrace worldly standards and unchristian life-styles.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:3-19:146:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 146:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Young people can be assured that when they come to exercise faith in Jesus Christ, they present themselves as God’s sheep and are known by Jesus. The Fine Shepherd cares for them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:14-43:10:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 10:14, 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:27-43:10:27" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 27</a>) Youths who follow Christ as their Model are blessed.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>One brother who currently serves at Brooklyn Bethel had this privilege of service as a goal from the time he was eight years old. He was encouraged to view Bethel service as a practical way to follow Christ’s example when he got older. His parents, as well as traveling overseers, kept this before him. To help him prepare, they encouraged him to apply himself diligently just like a member of the Bethel family, performing chores at home, helping to maintain the Kingdom Hall, and developing skills in the ministry. After enjoying Bethel service for years now, he is thankful that as he was growing up, he made the effort to imitate Christ’s example.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Jesus did not pursue a worldly career; he chose the ministry. A young sister wanted to pioneer when she graduated from school but held back because of not having suitable part-time employment. She kept thinking: ‘First I’ll find a job, then I’ll put in my pioneer application.’ An elder pointed out that the longer she waited, the better a full-time job would look, since she would not have anything holding her back from accepting it. She related: “I prayed to Jehovah for his spirit to guide me.” She immediately enrolled as an auxiliary pioneer and later became a regular pioneer. Shortly after that, she found ideal employment that accommodated her pioneer schedule.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Jesus boldly declared the Kingdom message to everyone. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:23-40:4:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 4:23</a>) Young Christians can also learn to be bold in preaching, not being intimidated by others. One 14-year-old Witness reported: “Everyone at school knows my position as a Christian. . . . They know it so well that if I meet a classmate while I’m engaging in the ministry, I do not feel embarrassed. Fellow students usually listen, and many times they accept literature.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Considering Christ’s example can help young people make wise decisions about their future. Instead of being preoccupied with worldly pursuits, they ‘remember their Grand Creator’ by showing zeal in Jehovah’s service. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:1-21:12:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:1</a>) Like Christ Jesus, they are cultivating “the love of the Father,” which brings blessings far more desirable than anything offered by the world. Instead of “passing away” with the old world, they can look forward to ‘remaining forever.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A TEENAGE boy jumped to his death from the eighth floor of an apartment building. He had read a book that described a death leap as being “free from pain or uneasiness or fear; rather, it feels good.” The author of this book, published in Japan, claimed that he was only offering “suicide as one of life’s choices.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">People who commit suicide are not the only ones who manifest disregard for life today. Reckless drivers also show very little respect for life. Some even drink and drive, many speeding down the road to death.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Others show how little they value their life by the emphasis they place on pleasure. Smokers refuse to rid themselves of cigarettes, although smoking can cause death and has been called slow-motion suicide. Instead of maintaining chastity in this sex-mad world, many pursue a promiscuous course that often leads to death.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Without even being aware of it, some rob themselves of years of life by overeating, overdrinking, insufficient exercise, and pleasure seeking. Japanese author Shinya Nishimaru warned: “Unrestrained eating habits upset physiological functions, and the pursuit of nothing but convenience and pleasure eats away people’s vitality.” Some share the view of those of ancient times who said: “Let there be eating and drinking, for tomorrow we shall die.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:22:13-23:22:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 22:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:32-46:15:32" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:32</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Yes, disregard for life is rampant today. Hence, it might well be asked, How precious is life to you? Should life be guarded at all costs? And is there anything more valuable than our present life?</p>

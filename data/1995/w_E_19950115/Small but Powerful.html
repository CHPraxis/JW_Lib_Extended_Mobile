<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ROBERT, a young man from Canada, wandered through Europe in search of his place in life. He saw many things that left him feeling despondent about the future.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">While sitting in a café in Seville, Spain, Robert was handed a tract published by Jehovah’s Witnesses. At first, Robert was skeptical. “Nevertheless, I did read it,” he said. “I cannot explain it, but I felt something snap into place. During my travels, I had seen many forms of human depression and downfall, and I was frustrated at my inability to change things. After reading the tract, I wondered, ‘Does this “new world” have a chance for existence?’ Then, I thought, ‘Yes, maybe it does.’”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">With renewed hope, Robert wrote to the office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Canada, requesting that someone visit him upon his return home and help him to understand the Bible.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Without doubt, the spoken word is powerful. However, never underestimate the power of the printed message. No matter how small, Bible-based publications have dynamic appeal. They touch the mind and heart, giving a sure hope for the future.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>

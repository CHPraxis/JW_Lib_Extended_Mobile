Small but Powerful
ROBERT, a young man from Canada, wandered through Europe in search of his place in life. He saw many things that left him feeling despondent about the future.
While sitting in a café in Seville, Spain, Robert was handed a tract published by Jehovah’s Witnesses. At first, Robert was skeptical. “Nevertheless, I did read it,” he said. “I cannot explain it, but I felt something snap into place. During my travels, I had seen many forms of human depression and downfall, and I was frustrated at my inability to change things. After reading the tract, I wondered, ‘Does this “new world” have a chance for existence?’ Then, I thought, ‘Yes, maybe it does.’”
With renewed hope, Robert wrote to the office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Canada, requesting that someone visit him upon his return home and help him to understand the Bible.
Without doubt, the spoken word is powerful. However, never underestimate the power of the printed message. No matter how small, Bible-based publications have dynamic appeal. They touch the mind and heart, giving a sure hope for the future.​—Hebrews 4:12.

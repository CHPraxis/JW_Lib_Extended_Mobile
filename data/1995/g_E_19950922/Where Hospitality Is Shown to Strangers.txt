Where Hospitality Is Shown to Strangers
In September 1994, a man from Michigan, U.S.A., wrote to the congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Lebanon, Tennessee. He explained:
“Back on Sunday, June 6, 1993, I attended your public talk and Watchtower Study. It was the first time I had ever entered a Kingdom Hall, and I was really impressed by all the smiling faces and the sincere love I was shown. I arrived a few minutes late, and when admitted, I seated myself alone. A young couple in the same row lent me a Bible and eventually a copy of the Watchtower magazine for the study.
“After the meetings most of you talked with me, shook hands, and made my stay a very pleasant experience. When I finally left your Kingdom Hall, I took three books with me​—the Bible, The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, and You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. That night I read most of the Live Forever book, and I learned a new name for my God, Jehovah. . . .
“I want all of you to know how much I appreciated your wonderful hospitality to a total stranger and especially want you to know that . . . I was baptized on July 9, 1994, at the tender age of 70.”
If you would like to receive warm hospitality from those who enjoy serving God, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5. They will put you in touch with a Kingdom Hall near your home.

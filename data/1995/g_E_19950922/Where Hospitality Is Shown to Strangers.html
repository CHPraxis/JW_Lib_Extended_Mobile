<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In September 1994, a man from Michigan, U.S.A., wrote to the congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Lebanon, Tennessee. He explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Back on Sunday, June 6, 1993, I attended your public talk and <em>Watchtower </em>Study. It was the first time I had ever entered a Kingdom Hall, and I was really impressed by all the smiling faces and the sincere love I was shown. I arrived a few minutes late, and when admitted, I seated myself alone. A young couple in the same row lent me a Bible and eventually a copy of the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine for the study.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“After the meetings most of you talked with me, shook hands, and made my stay a very pleasant experience. When I finally left your Kingdom Hall, I took three books with me​—the Bible, <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived, </em>and <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em>That night I read most of the <em>Live Forever </em>book, and I learned a new name for my God, Jehovah. . . .</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I want all of you to know how much I appreciated your wonderful hospitality to a total stranger and especially want you to know that . . . I was baptized on July 9, 1994, at the tender age of 70.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">If you would like to receive warm hospitality from those who enjoy serving God, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5. They will put you in touch with a Kingdom Hall near your home.</p>

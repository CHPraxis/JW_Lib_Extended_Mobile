<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">OVER three thousand years ago, Moses wrote: “The days of our years are seventy years; and if because of special mightiness they are eighty years, yet their insistence is on trouble and hurtful things.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:90:10-19:90:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 90:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Despite medical advances, man’s life span is still the same as it was in Moses’ day. Nevertheless, humans will not always be condemned to such a fleeting existence. In the Bible book of Isaiah, God said: “Like the days of a tree will the days of my people be; and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:22-23:65:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">One of the longest-living trees in Bible lands is the olive tree. The tree pictured here is one of many thousand-year-old olive trees that still thrive in Galilee. When will humans get to live so long? The same prophecy explains that it will be when God creates “new heavens and a new earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:17-23:65:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The book of Revelation also prophesies the establishment of “a new heaven and a new earth”​—a new heavenly government and a new human society when God “will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 21:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This divine promise will soon be fulfilled. Then, even the days of an olive tree will seem like a mere 24-hour day. And we will have ample time to enjoy to the full the work of our hands.</p>

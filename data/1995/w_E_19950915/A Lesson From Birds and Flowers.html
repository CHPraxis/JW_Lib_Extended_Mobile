<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHAT often concerns people today more than anything else? For the majority, it is having enough to provide for their family or being able to improve their standard of living.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Making ends meet was also a major concern when Jesus Christ was on the earth. But he warned that this legitimate concern could become an overriding anxiety shutting out spiritual things. To illustrate his point, Jesus told his disciples to look closely at the birds and the flowers.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Birds need to eat every day​—proportionately a lot more than we do because of their high metabolic rate. Moreover, they cannot sow seed, reap, or store food for the future. Yet, as Jesus observed, our “heavenly Father feeds them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:26-40:6:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:26</a>) Likewise, God clothes in the finest array the beautiful “lilies of the field.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:28-40:6:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:28-30</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jesus assures us that if we keep material needs in proper perspective and give spiritual things priority, God will make sure that we also have the necessary food and clothing. If Jehovah God cares for the birds and the flowers, he will surely care for those who love him and ‘keep on seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33</a>) Are you putting the interests of God’s Kingdom first in your life?</p>

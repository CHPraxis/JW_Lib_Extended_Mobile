<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Response to First Person Account  </strong>Thank you so much for the heartrending story of Larry Rubin, “No Longer a Rock or an Island.” (November 22, 1994) Many often fail to make allowance for those who have suffered in the past. My own son once told me that if I truly had faith, I would not be anxious! But not everyone can just leave the past behind. Please continue to feature human experiences of this sort. I pray it will soften some hearts.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">I struggle for words to express my thanks. So often we encounter ones who have been scarred by past abuses. Helping them to function within the congregation and to develop a relationship with Jehovah is a formidable challenge. The article showed that it is possible for such ones to learn to feel love and trust.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">I have been a Christian for 25 years now. I’ve served God faithfully with my brain, but my heart has felt like it was encased in solid concrete. I grew up in an alcoholic family and suffered beatings, sexual abuse, and other traumas. Jehovah has done so much for me, but I cannot feel love for him. Larry Rubin’s story gave me a flicker of hope that maybe, just maybe, I will one day be able to cry about my past and have feelings. Maybe I’ll also get what Larry Rubin now has​—love, trust, and acceptance.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Some previous life stories have been about people who seemed to be supermen​—fearless, without internal conflicts, without weakness. Larry Rubin’s story was told from a different angle. He was frank and exposed his intimate feelings. Life stories of this kind are real to us because they are about things that happen in our own lives.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Rh Factor  </strong>It is truly commendable how <em>Awake! </em>treats such controversial subjects. In the article “The Rh Factor and You” (December 8, 1994), the approach taken was not that of a religious fanatic. The subject was handled with scientific accuracy, using up-​to-​date medical terminology, yet in terms that were clear and understandable. It disproves the charge that Jehovah’s Witnesses are blind fanatics who place no value on human life.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">I am pregnant, and my doctor told me I needed a shot to prevent me from building antibodies against my baby’s blood. I knew nothing about the Rh factor and didn’t object. When I later learned that the shot is made from blood, I was scared that I might have violated God’s law on blood. Your article helped me by explaining that taking the shot is ultimately a conscience matter.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>Talking About Religion  </strong>Though I was raised as a Christian, I am very shy about participating fully in the public preaching work, especially around my schoolmates. The advice you gave in the article “Young People Ask . . . Why Talk About God?” (September 22, 1994) reminded me of the importance of that work. I will take to heart your encouragement to become adequately qualified as a teacher of God’s Word.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">I am 12 years of age, and I have really been ashamed to say that I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. I hoped that my schoolmates would not see me in field service. The article helped me to see that I am not the only one who has had to deal with this problem, and it helped me overcome these feelings of shame.</p>

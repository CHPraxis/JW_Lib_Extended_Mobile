<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE 20th century has been marked by great disasters, and most of them have been man-​made. Some, though, have not. Foretelling our days, Jesus Christ said: “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:7-40:24:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:7</a>) True, man is to blame for wars and food shortages, but he is not responsible for earthquakes. In a similar way, while some disastrous floods have been caused by man’s activity, he cannot be blamed for earthquakes. Neither are hurricanes or volcanic eruptions the fault of man.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Whatever their cause, natural disasters show the smallness of man, his impotence in the face of awesome natural forces. This earth, our home, usually feels so secure and solid. But when it shakes in an earthquake, gets inundated by flooding waters, or is swept by violent winds that bear down relentlessly as if with the force of an explosion, that feeling of security vanishes.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Natural disasters have caused immense damage and great loss of life during the 20th century. Could this have been avoided? Can anything be done to reduce the catastrophic effects? As individuals, what can we do to protect ourselves? Are we completely helpless when disaster strikes? Will mankind always be victimized in this way? The following articles will discuss these questions.</p>

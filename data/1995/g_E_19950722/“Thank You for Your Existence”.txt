“Thank You for Your Existence”
That is what a man from North Carolina, U.S.A., wrote to the headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York. He also said: “I am requesting the home Bible study you offer in Awake! But also I am requesting any and all information you may be able to provide on the subject of hell. . . .
“I was reared in a Baptist Church, but even as a small child, something about their teachings or doctrine just did not balance out within me.
“I have been reading your publications since 1965. I refer to the Bible when reading, and everything in your literature corresponds to the Bible. I’ve always wanted to know the real truth about God and Jesus, and I honestly can say that I am finding true answers through your material and the Bible.”
Perhaps you too would appreciate information regarding the Bible-​based teachings of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

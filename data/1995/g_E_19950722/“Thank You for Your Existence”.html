<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a man from North Carolina, U.S.A., wrote to the headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York. He also said: “I am requesting the home Bible study you offer in <em>Awake! </em>But also I am requesting any and all information you may be able to provide on the subject of hell. . . .</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I was reared in a Baptist Church, but even as a small child, something about their teachings or doctrine just did not balance out within me.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I have been reading your publications since 1965. I refer to the Bible when reading, and everything in your literature corresponds to the Bible. I’ve always wanted to know the real truth about God and Jesus, and I honestly can say that I am finding true answers through your material and the Bible.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Perhaps you too would appreciate information regarding the Bible-​based teachings of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

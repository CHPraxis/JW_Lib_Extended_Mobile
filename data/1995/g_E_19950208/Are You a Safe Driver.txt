Are You a Safe Driver?
YOUR attitude while behind the wheel of a car can strongly influence your driving ability. A study conducted by the British Automobile Association revealed that each year 22 percent of British males between 17 and 20 years of age are involved in at least one road accident.
The key factors in their unsafe driving habits? Besides alcohol, mood swings, and loud music, the deputy director-​general of the Automobile Association, Kenneth Faircloth, notes: “Too many are influenced by their peers to drive dangerously.” As a result, the Automobile Association recommends that training focus more on the attitudes of the driver and less on the mechanics of driving.
For example, ask yourself: ‘Do I try to impress the passengers in my car by nonchalantly taking risks? Does my mood determine my conduct behind the wheel? Do I view other drivers on the road as mere hindrances that must be outwitted?’ The answers to such questions reveal what kind of driver you are.
Whether male or female, young or old, develop a neighborly attitude while driving. “Treat other people exactly as you would like to be treated by them.” (Matthew 7:12, Phillips) Doing so will help you to drive safely.

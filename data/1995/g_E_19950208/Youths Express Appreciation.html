<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE young people pictured here are all Nigerian secondary-​school students. In a letter to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Nigeria, they wrote: “We would like to thank you for the consideration you have shown to us youths in publishing the book <em>Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“This publication has helped us to resist the pressures of the world and to refute unscriptural teachings. It covers a wide spectrum of the concerns of youths, and its counsel is always based on the Bible. The section that discusses peer pressure has especially helped us to understand the Bible’s wisdom in its counsel to walk with wise ones and to avoid association with stupid ones. The other students in our school are amazed at how we put up with one another in love and how we seek to earnestly observe the oneness of spirit in the uniting bond of peace.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Seeking at all times to maintain our conduct fine among the students in our school, we zealously proclaim the Kingdom hope to all the students who will listen to us, regardless of those who may try to influence us in a wrong way.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The letter was signed, “From young Witnesses of Jehovah, All Saints Secondary School, Aba, Abia State, Nigeria.”</p>

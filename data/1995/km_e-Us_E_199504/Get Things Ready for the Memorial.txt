Get Things Ready for the Memorial
Has everyone, including the speaker, been informed of the exact time and place of the celebration? Is the speaker aware that the program should not exceed 45 minutes?
Has someone been assigned to obtain the emblems? (See The Watchtower of February 15, 1990, pages 16-18.) Have arrangements been made for the table to be set with a clean tablecloth and a sufficient number of glasses and plates?
Have plans been made to clean the Kingdom Hall beforehand and afterward? Have the attendants and servers been assigned? Has a meeting been held with them to go over their duties? What procedure will be followed to ensure that all are served efficiently?
Have arrangements been made to help older and infirm brothers and sisters to attend? If there are any of the anointed who may be confined and unable to be present, have preparations been made for them to be served?

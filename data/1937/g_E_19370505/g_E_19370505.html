<p><span class="font7">Today there is no longer in existence a Protestant organization that is in fact a protest against the Catholic Hierarchy. Protestantism is dead, and its leading lights have become in fact a part of the mighty Catholic Hierarchy organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A writer in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Century</span><span class="font7"> reports a dealer in religious goods as saying recently:</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370505_files/g_E_19370505-2.png" alt="" style="width:230pt;height:259pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">An astonishing thing is taking place right here in my store. A few years ago I used to sell candles, incense and embroidered chasubles to Roman Catholic priests. Their people would drop in and buy a prayer book or a rosary. Protestants would pause briefly before my window, glance at it disapprovingly and then walk away. But, what a change today 1 That gentleman with the clerical collar and black rabat who just left the store is a Lutheran. He bought a whole earton of pure beeswax candles, a pound of Jerusalem incense, and there is a richly embroidered green cope in the glass case upstairs that always catches his eye. Episcopalians not only buy beautiful prayer books, but lately they are buying rosaries and even plaster images of the blessed virgin. A Methodist parson, also dressed in clericals, came in last week and bought a brass cross for his altar. Two of the most recent Methodist churches in this city have real altars with crosses on them. I sold a pair of a censer to a Lutheran. Nowadays when a man in clericals comes in, he may be a Roman Catholic priest, or an Episcopalian, or a Lutheran, or even a Methodist, or a Presbyterian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Trotting True to</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Form in Canada</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the Toronto </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star,</span><span class="font7"> Reverend R. E. Knowles, of the United Church (formerly a Presbyterian) ,isgrant-ed a column and a half to report an interview with the g entieman whom he addressed as “my lord”, that is, Bishop O’Hara, of Montana. That Roman Catholic gentleman, at Reverend Knowles’ request, informed him that communism is the menace of the hour, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Catholic church in Italy and France is as strong as it ever was, it was a disgrace that Al Smith could not be elected president because he was a Catholic, that Protestants are coming to admit that the Roman Catholic church is the true church, “and that the church, and not a book, is the final authority on spiritual truth”,<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark42">1</a></sup> that neither the Greek nor the Anglican clergy have valid “orders” and they cannot change the bread and wine actually into the body and blood of the Lord, and that the cures at Lourdes and elsewhere are really cures. One of the closing paragraphs of the interview follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Are the popes, as a rule, men of great mental force?” I asked. Yes. Always. Of great intellectual powar—through the years they are growing ever more and more equipped for their great office. Beyond all the lines of secular rulers in history, they stand preeminent. In culture, in wisdom, in devotion—and in outstanding knowledge of their times and the problems these times present.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">483</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Reverend W. A. Cameron, B.A., minister of the Yorkminster Baptist church of Toronto, in a sermon November 15, stated his three great reasons for admiring the Roman Catholic church are (1) that it inculcated the habit of going to church, (2) that the church stands open all day and every day in the week, and (3) it has great numbers of monks and nuns living in complete poverty, chastity and obedience to the will of the church. It is extremely interesting that not one of these reasons is a Scriptural reason or has any foundation in the Word of God.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>The United States Is in Line</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">For several years now a trinity composed of Catholic, Protestant and Jewish clergymen have been traveling up and down the United States to try to prove to the people that all is well. It is like an alligator, with a couple of undigested fish in its stomach, trying to calm the fishes’ fears by smiling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Charts M. Sheldon, the 80-year-old Congregational author of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">In His Steps,</span><span class="font7"> advocates a merger of all Protestant, Catholic and Jewish churches. Poor man! That ‘‘religion”, when ready to serve to the hungry sheep, would be more uncertain, would look as bad as and smell worse than the famous Heritage Hall hash of a bygone era. But the point is, Sheldon wants it. He craves union with the “Singing Harlot” Hierarchy, sharing the general “Protestant” hopes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Baptists and Catholics at Raleigh, N. C., have no trouble in getting along together. They are really one and the same, at heart. Thus, the Catholic parochial school meets in the Sunday-school room of the First Baptist church while its own building is in process of construction. The Protestant church not only no longer protests, but is proud of the fact that it is, in truth, no longer Protestant at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Frederick B. Fisher, pastor of the Central Methodist church, Detroit, Mich., senses the value of the trappings which constitute such a large part of the stock in trade of the Hierarchy. In his “church” he has a boy in a robe bearing a cross, another hooded boy bearing a Bible, then 200 youths in white vestments, then a youth bearing an American flag, and finally himself, at the tail end of the procession.<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark45">2</a></sup> He depends on this show to get the children to drag their parents out in all kinds of weather.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>The Primate Business</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">In the Church of England the clergy have a lot to say about primates, the same as in the Hierarchy. An archbishop is a primate. The dictionary is pretty good on this. One of the definitions is:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The order of mammals consisting of man and the apes, monkeys, marmosets and lemurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One primate is just “Primate of England”, while another is “Primate of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">All</span><span class="font7"> England”, and there is a “Primate of Ireland” and a “Primate of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">All</span><span class="font7"> Ireland”. In considering the above definition, and applying it, you might as well leave out the “man”, and divide the rest to suit the skirts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since Christmas the “girls” in the Canterbury cathedral have put away their white surplices, and the latest fashion notes say that now they are wearing white linen albs, girdles with tassels, stoles over their shoulders, maniples on their left arms, and chasubles over all. Also their vestments and copes will be of different colors at different seasons. By their clothes the girls make up for what they lack in knowledge of the Bible and in common ordinary horse sense. The situation is confused because the girls insist on wearing masculine pants and men’s shoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Right Reverend H. A. Wilson, bishop of Chelmsford, England, stated it would be a good thing if somebody would shoot some of the clergy and a few bishops. He seems to have the right idea as to their value to mankind.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Prayers for Prosperity</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">At hand some advertising literature of “Christ’s Church by-the-Sea”, Broad Channel, New York, Rt. Rev. Arthur W. Brooks, bishop. The literature says, “Prosperity is going to return to the people of the United States of America.” It is to be obtained by many repetitions of a prayer which is supplied in printed form and reads, in part,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. . . that our land may once more become a place where there is plenty of opportunity for sound industry ; that all may honestly earn their living and reap the benefits of their labors in whatever vocation and occupation they may engage, with gladness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who have read Judge Rutherford’s book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font7"> will smile quietly. They will not be surprised that the bishop knows not what are the true riches; they will not smile at that. But they will smile that the bishop seems to honestly think that Jehovah God will hear “for their much speaking” those •who already, according to His Word, have “more than heart could wish” and yet want more and ever more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">British vicars may now sell their castles and get down off their high horses and live like other people. A spokesman said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many vicarages have as-many as twenty bedrooms, acres of land, and require a big staff. Vicars’ wives are literally killing themselves in trying to keep these big places up, and the vicars and rectors themselves are doing the work of gardeners and handymen instead of doing the work of their parishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The disadvantages of having no useful occupation were illustrated in the Isle of Wight, where the Reverend George Garrett, of the Anglican church, chained four dogs to the rear of his motor cycle and speeded down the road with one of the dogs being dragged because he could not keep up with the race. When Garrett’s wife came up to remonstrate with him he hit her with the dog that had been dragged. Besides hitting his wife with the exhausted pet the “Reverend” used language that may not be printed. The “Reverend” was fined £10 and forbidden to hereafter keep any dogs. As he had nothing to take up his mind previously, and now has less than nothing, he is in a bad way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Reverend H. G. Proctor, curate of St. John’s Parish, Long Eaton, Derbyshire, England, graduate of Keble College, Oxford, and Cuddesdon Theological College, decided that he is not a Christian, and does not believe in Christianity, and will take up sheep farming. Now, if all the other dominies will only follow his example, the people will get a chance to know something of what the Word of God teaches and what it is really for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Wells’ Indictment of the Church of England</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">H. G. Wells, himself a member of the Church of England, is pretty well disgusted with the hypocrisy of the whole thing. He wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In our public life, in our social life, in our educational affairs and at universities, the Established Church is still capable of great mischief. And it does great mischief if only by warping our mental integrity and deadening down our intellectual quality. Manifestly also it is a reservoir of poisonous bad taste. Is it not time we put an end to this dingy incubus?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What Wells said was well said, and it is well to remember that while he had the Church of England specially in mind, the same goes for the Church of Rome, and then some.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. George B. Cutten, president of Colgate University, thinks that “the time is ripe for a religious Hitler”. In his heart he must have been wishing for Ambrose Ratti to dominate the earth.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Misgivings Here and There</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">At the second inauguration of President Roosevelt the invocation was offered by Reverend Phillips, chaplain of the Senate. That official presumed to approach Jehovah God without the mediation of anybody or anything, and merely said “Amen” to his own pronouncements. The benediction, made by Reverend Ryan, of the Catholic University, terminated courageously with the words, “Through Christ, our Lord. Amen.” Shame on the so-called “Protestant”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Methodists are beginning to see, and w’ill yet see more clearly, that Fascism is Catholic Action. The following is a statement of the Methodist Federation for Social Service:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The latest press statement from the Vatican on its anti-Red campaign does not mention atheism. It speaks of “foreign policy’’. On political issues the Vatican has taken its stand. It is with Franco, Hitler, Mussolini and Japan just as certainly as though it had signed the agreement or entered the understandings between those forces. That these agreements mean a joint offensive against democracy and particularly “people’s front democracy”, because it leads to “communism”, is triumphantly proclaimed in the Nazi press. . . . The Vatican is one of the international triumvirate lined up to destroy democratic government and restore autocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Remembering the cucumbers and garlic of happier days for salvation peddlers (Numbers 11:4,5), the Reverend Nance Kivell, minister of the City Temple Church of Christ, Sydney, made the sad-eyed confession:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If we could put hell into some church members and into some ministers and those who speak from the pulpit, we would get somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just to help out the Reverend Kivell’s argument, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> gently suggests where he would get, and where his hearers would get by such a course. The Lord explained it all in Matthew 15:11-14, which reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>The Agreement on Hell</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Catholicism and Protestantism have one point on which they are at agreement. The agreement between the two is that Jehovah God, the great Creator, lied when He told our first parents that if they ate of the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden, or even touched it, they would surely die; and that the Devil told Eve the truth when he told her to the exact contrary, “Ye shall not surely die.”—Genesis 3:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be sure, the Son of God, Christ Jesus the Savior of men, stood for the truth on the subject, and denounced Satan as a liar because of what he said to Mother Eve (John 8:44). But to one who has been “regularly ordained” by the Devil, or by one of his mouthpieces, it would look like a very little thing indeed to deny point-blank a statement made by Jesus Christ. Thus, Jesus said of the dead that they “are in the graves”. —John 5:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord could have gone into detail, had He seen fit to do so, and explained that “there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave whither thou goest” (Ecclesiastes 9:10) and that “the dead know not any thing” (Ecclesiastes 9:5) and that in the very day that a man dies “that very day his thoughts perish” (Psalm 146:4), with every scripture in the Bible in exact corroboration, but all this would mean nothing to a clergyman. He would still stand by the teachings of his “church”, and his father, the Devil. A nice illustration of the loyalty of the clergy to their father follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a sermon delivered just before he was ordained, Reverend Abram H. Bergen, Blumen-hof, Saskatchewan, Canada, was heard to say, “Mit Recht hat der Feind gesagt: Ihr werdet mit nichten des Todes sterben.” Translated into English this says, “Truthfully the Devil said, Ye shall not surely die.” This clerical testimony on behalf of the Devil, who ordained him (John 8:44), was doubtless much appreciated by the Old Boy.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>The Official “Low-Down” on Hell</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Maybe you have wondered what it is like in the ecclesiastical hell. This hell has no relation to the Bible hell—not the least. It is just as opposite to it in statement, in thought, in purpose, in effect, as it can possibly be. But, boys and girls, as a money-maker it has the Bible hell pushed off the boards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Protestants have a hunch that something is a little bit decayed about it, and so they don’t have much to say on the subject. All they insist upon is that Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are liars and that the Devil tells the truth. But the Roman Hierarchy is not so squeamish. They figure that if you are going to sell anything, the thing to do is to put it in the store window and then loudly declaim its virtues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So here is an official statement on “The Sight of Hell” (published by Duffy, in Dublin and London), supplied to Roman Catholic children by the Roman Catholic clergyman Reverend J. Furniss, C.S.S.R. Reverend Furniss was not talking through his hat. He was laying down the proposition, so he says, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Permissu Superiorum.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In other words, the bishop of his diocese guarantees that the following is an exact statement of facts about the Roman Catholic and Protestant hell. Read it thoughtfully, in the light of the 26 verses in Psalm, 136 which repeat the assertion that many times concerning Jehovah God, that “his mercy endureth for ever”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Little child, if you go to hell, there will be a devil at your side to strike you. He will go on striking you every minute forever and ever without stopping. The first will make your body as the body of Job, covered from head to foot with sores and ulcers. The second stroke will make your body twice as bad as the body of Job. The third stroke will make your body three times as bad as the body of Job. The fourth stroke will make your body four times as bad as the body of Job. How, then, will your body be after the devil has been striking it every moment for a hundred million of years without ever stopping? Perhaps at this moment, seven o'clock in the evening, a child is going to hell. Tomorrow evening at seven o’clock, go and knock at the gates of hell and ask what that child is doing. The devils will come back and say—‘the child is burning.’ Go in a week and ask what the child is doing. You will get the same answer—‘it is burning.’ Go in a year and ask. The same answer comes—‘it is burning.’ Go in a million years and ask the same question. The answer is just the same—‘it is burning.’ So, if you go forever, and ever, you will always get the same answer—‘it is burning.’ ”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>“God </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Was Very Good to This Child”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">The Reverend Mr. Furniss wanted to make a hit with the Roman Catholic children on this subject of hell, and so he went a little more into detail about the ‘goodness of God’, that is, his god, the Devil. You will be charmed when you get down to that part. To a clergyman it all looks so lovely, so reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you get the idea that any of them are ashamed of this line of salesmanship, and that that is the real reason why they don’t stand up like men and debate such issues with Judge Rutherford, over the radio, so that all may hear, then that shows that you haven’t got “faith”, that is, faith in the Devil and in his spokesmen, the clergy. And if you haven’t got such faith, here is what you get (maybe you are more than 16, but you get it anyway!):</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">‘See! on the middle of that red-hot floor stands a girl; she looks about sixteen years old. Her feet are bare. She has neither shoes nor stockings . . . Listen! she speaks. She says: I have been standing on this red-hot floor for years. Day and night my only standing-place has been this red-hot floor. . . . Look at my burnt and bleeding feet. Let me go off this burning floor for one moment, only for one single short moment. . . . The fourth dungeon is the boiling kettle. ... in the middle of it all there is a boy. . . . His eyes are burning like two burning coals. Two long flames come out of his ears. . . . Sometimes he opens his mouth and blazing fire rolls out. But listen: there is a sound like a kettle boiling. . . . The blood is boiling and bubbling in his head. The marrow is boiling in his bones. . . . The fifth dungeon is the red-hot oven. . . . The little child is in this red-hot oven. Hear how it screams to come out. See how it turns and twists itself about in the fire. It beats its head against the roof of the oven. It stamps its little feet on the floor. . . . God was very good to this child. Very likely God saw that it would get worse and worse, and would never, never repent, and so it would have to be punished much worse in hell. So God in his mercy called it out of the world in its early childhood.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Monitor,</span><span class="font7"> to which </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> is indebted for the above “gems”, gives two more along the same lines (from the pen of John N. Quinn). The first is from “Father” Hippolytus, who knows all about the worms, and the second is from “The Child's Pathway to Glory”. Oh, how happy the child will be in glory when she knows about the other children in hell! is the thought:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The fire which is unquenchable and without end awaits the unrighteous, and a certain fiery worm which dieth not, and which docs not waste the body, but continues bursting forth from the body with unending pain. No sleep will give them rest; no night will soothe them; no death will deliver them from punishment. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“There is nothing but misery in hell. You would nevermore have one moment’s ease; for there is nothing but pain there. Put together all you can think of that is miserable, and painful and terrible, and it is all nothing to what is prepared for those who go there; and that not for an hour, or a day, or a year, but for an eternity. . . . The frightful and cruel devil may torment them as much as he pleases—they are made strong to bear it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Texas preacher told his congregation that, because they had not paid anything to their orphans’ home for two years past, they all had about as much chance to get to heaven as a celluloid doll. One lady was very much grieved, because she was too poor to pay. What the preacher was covertly trying to put across was to picture what would happen to a celluloid doll if it landed in the ecclesiastical, money-raising, hair-raising hell which is the only alternative to heaven of which he has ever told his flock.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Two advertisements for stray goats attract attention, as published in local newspapers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lost—100 Protestant Episcopalians. Finder please return to St. Mark's Episcopal Church, Hood River, Palm Sunday, April 5th at the 11 o'clock service. [Hood River (Oreg.) .Vews.]</span></p>

If perchance as you read this notice you have seen, heard or housed any of these Baptists, please notify the pastor of the Fairhope Baptist Church, or return them to the church and receive your reward. You may know them by the wandering look on their faces. [Mobile (Ala.) Press]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At La Fayette, Ind., the theology of Reverend Robert Knight, pastor of the First Christian church, got the best of him. Maybe thinking deeply on the text, “So fight I, not as one that beateth the air,” he started practicing on his wife Leota, pummeling her on the chest, arms, face and back. He bruised her jaw and possibly injured her spine. No doubt he is a strong believer in the eternal torture deity, who is the Devil. At last accounts he was out on $500 bail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Arrested for kicking a cripple and knocking him down, the Reverend L. Craig Long, pastor of Calvin Presbyterian church, 647 Orange St., New Haven, Conn., denies that he knew the lad had infantile paralysis. He states in defense that all he did was to throw the boy over a hedge. He did not know that the hoy, twelve years of age, was the son of a New Haven policeman, or that he was wearing a sustaining belt at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Anyway, this was not as bad as what John Calvin, founder of the Presbyterian church, did. He sat by the window enjoying the scene while Servetus baked for five hours in front of a slow fire. Calvin believed in the doctrine of eternal torture and tried to show that he was like his father and its author, the Devil.—John 8: 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Religion” struck new levels when T. G. ‘Curley’ Evans, of Hot Springs, testified before an Arkansas house of representatives committee that he was a Hot Springs policeman in the daytime, a dice dealer in a gambling house at night, and a “Holiness” preacher on Sundays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Flint, Mich., a lad of nineteen years of age, convicted of breaking and entering and car theft, was sentenced to go to Sunday school regularly for three years, so he might have “benefit of clergy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible says not to use vain repetition in prayer, and that “God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few”; therefore it is of some interest to know there was recently a praying contest at Brisbane, Australia. The winner was Reverend T. A. Haslam, 85 years of age, who prayed continuously for three days and nights.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Souls Quoted at a Dollar Each</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Maybe you didn't know that the souls for which Jesus gave himself a ransom are quoted at a dollar apiece, but that is what Evangelist E. Howard Cadle, Cadle Tabernacle, Indianapolis, seems to think in the following letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Would you give one dollar to lead one soul to Christ? For each dollar we are spending at the Cadle Tabernacle, we are leading a soul to Him, either here in the Tabernacle, at the one-night revivals, or in the homes with our radio program. Last year we led more than ninety thousand souls to Christ. In addition, millions have been brought closer to the Lord, broken homes rebuilt, divorces and suicides diverted and thousands of little boys and girls have been kept from becoming orphans and thrown out into the cruel world without a dad or mother. The old Gospel has not lost its power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I am asking you frankly, where else could you spend one dollar that would lead one soul to Christ? Don’t you think our work deserves a gift from you ? The only money you will ever meet in heaven is the money you have spent to advance God’s kingdom. We are terribly in need of funds to carry on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I am enclosing a self-addressed envelope for your gift. Remember, one dollar means one soul for Christ; or ten dollars, ten souls for Christ. The night is soon coming when we cannot work. Won’t you hurry with your gift? Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ten dollars endows a chair in the Cadle Tabernacle with your loved one’s name engraved on a brass plate on the back of the chair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Chillicothe, Ohio, Cadle told his audience they had to come across with $155 before he would start his sermon. First he sold 10 copies of his book at $5 each, then 105 promised contributions of $1, and finally they passed the collection plates and he went ahead with his sermon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Great Commission Prayer League, 808 North La Salle St., Chicago, Ill., issues a nice piece of advertising matter calling for a nationwide spiritual renewal or revival of the American people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It names five days when all Americans should assemble for prayer for this blessing from God, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Watch Night, Good Friday, and Easter. Not a single one of these is mentioned in the Word of God. Thanksgiving Day is fixed by the president, not by the Bible; Christinas was not the day of Christ’s birth; Watch Night is the night that ushers in one of the years as ordered by Pope Gregory; Good Friday is purely an invention of the Roman Catholic cult; and the only place where ‘’Easter” occurs in the Bible it “Passover”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Does it not seem that if the promoters of this nation-wide revival hope to get anywhere with their pleas to God it might be a good idea to pick out just one item mentioned somewhere in the Scriptures and have it correct according to that standard? But perhaps they prefer to be 100-percent wrong on all counts, so that they can confess that they are indeed miserable sinners unworthy of divine notice. The scriptures cited are also misapplied in every case. They are Romans 13:1, 1 Timothy 2:1-4, Hosea 6:1-3, Psalm 90:16,17, Deuteronomy 28:1-6, 2 Chronicles 15: 2. None of these scriptures may be properly applied to a wholesale revival of the American people. They apply quite differently.</span></p>

If he had known that Mark 16:18 is really no part of God’s Word, and that its inclusion in the Scriptures is not a mark of piety, but of impiety, the Reverend T. Anderson would be alive today. A doctor was called just before he died, but could do nothing; the poison was all through his system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Alfred D. Weaver also tried it at Bartow, Fla., and died from the rattlesnake’s bite. The city council passed an ordinance forbidding any like shows at evangelist performances hereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. C. F. Aked, pastor of All Souls’ church, Los Angeles, Calif., is still in the headlines. His text on Sunday morning, February 14,1937, was taken from the saying of Abraham Lincoln, “If we call a dog’s tail a leg, then how many legs does a dog have?” After this inspiring spiritual</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">talk Dr. Aked recited Lincoln’s farewell at Springfield and his Gettysburg address and all who had come to hear him went home feeling that they had heard what they came to hear. Meantime, the population of the country’s insane asylums grows by leaps and bounds.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">At St. John, N.B., Reverend A. G. Philpotts, preacher at the Alliance Tabernacle, brought an axe into the pulpit and gave the congregation one week to come across with the long green or a week</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">later he would smash the pulpit to kindling wood. Probably if one could look into the inner recesses of Reverend Philpotts’ mind he would see that the “Reverend” knows the jig is up, and he will soon have to chop wood for a living anyway, and the time has come to begin practice for his life work. Nobody should be too hard on this rooster for trying to get the swing of the axe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A report of the Committee of Evangelism and Social Service of the United Church of Canada calls attention to a booklet published by the United Church Tenth Anniversary Celebration Committee. Among other things, the booklet declares that the church will have to grow in honesty during the next ten years, and then says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">She [the church] will continue to condemn what may remain of the capitalistic system, but she will do it in full recognition that she is involved in and is a party to that system, not only in her endowments and investments, but her congregational revenues and incomes, all tied up with and dependent upon the process of profit-making.</span></p>

It still thinks man a big success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There has been a great victory for something or other at Thomasville, Ga. A Sunday movie was to have been shown for the benefit of tornado sufferers. The ministerial association got wind of it and caused the arrest of the proprietor. 335 people paid to see the show. The ministers were sore because they thought if anybody should give up money on the first day of the week, they certainly should give it up to the ministers and not to tornado sufferers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">E. C. Finkbeiner, Pennsylvania, says that the Reverend A. P. Wenger was to have preached on “The Dardanelles of the Soul” and then wants to know just what part of the soul that is, and if everybody has one of those things, or if it is a sort of malignant growth found only on preachers. Now, was that nice of Finkbeiner?</span></p>

Other churches in the neighborhood are closed except when somebody can watch the poor boxes. In some Australian churches the collection plate is covered with a grid.</span></p>

How is it that the dames, Effie, Henrietta, Leona, Malinda, and Isabel, were mentioned ahead of their hubbies? Are women better pigchasers than men ?

<p><span class="font7">Charles J. McCollough, private secretary to Roger W. Babson, statistician, made an investigation and reported that 8 percent of those listed as belonging to churches are dead.

<p><span class="font7">Bloomington, Ill., has an unusual social feature. Once a week, Tuesday noon, at the Young Men’s Club, there is a contest to see who can tell the biggest lie. The Bloomington </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Pantograph</span><span class="font7"> claims that the biggest liar on February 2 was the Reverend Ralph G.

<p><span class="font7">Newspapers laugh at Voliva (Dowie’s successor), and can hardly well help it, because of the fact that Zion City, Ill., had its heaviest rain of the year three hours after Wilbur Glenn “prophesied” no more rain would fall for the rest of the year, which then had 3,460 hours yet to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Following the Catholic Eucharistic bread show, and the Republican convention, Cleveland felt it ought to do something to redeem itself; so it held a Bible marathon, the object of the game being to read the Bible through in 72 hours, with the inevitable result, on the face of it, that, read in that way, it would not result in a particle of benefit to anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Reverend Benny Benson, pastor of Reformed Presbyterian church, Greenpoint, N.Y., became peeved the other Sunday night because in a building built to comfortably seat 700 only 39 came out to hear what he had to say.

<p><span class="font7">Reverend Doctor Frederic S. Fleming, rector of Trinity Parish, New York, is peculiarly well qualified to speak for the Episcopal church. In the “Trinity Year Book” he explained that the Parish has $32,000,000 in incomeproducing assets; which may all be true, for at one time it was admitted to be the largest and the worst landlord in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He mentioned that the salaries of the clergy on the regular staff were $125,073, and an additional $38,379 went to associate pastors called “parish visitors and lay assistants”. All together, that makes about $163,452 worth of preaching. Assessing the value of this the</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The instrument of 20,000,000 stops—stop, we heard that one</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Reverend Fleming says, “The gospel of Christ for us has lost its sureness, its courage and its authority”; which is certainly true, and that despite the price. He says further:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is practically no preaching worth the name to be found. Frankly, a moratorium would be a godsend, heartily hailed on both sides by the pulpit and the pew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is an offset to this rather gloomy but undoubtedly correct appraisal. The sextons, assistants and engineers pulled down earnings amounting to $46,781, and the music, organists and choirs licked up another $77,959, making a total of $124,740, so that the total annual bill for uplift was only a paltry $288,192, and for this amount the people actually got something, and Reverend Fleming himself says so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He says that “the ringing of the chimes between 5 and 5:15 every afternoon except Saturday” is “a subtle message of sympathy and understanding, a touch of inspiration bringing new courage and hope to workers homeward bound”. Ah! That’s it. For only a little over a quarter of a million dollars a year the people can hear the old chimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Fleming hastily goes on to say, however, that a new set of chimes should be installed, and indicates that it would be a good idea for the public to cough up the price. Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Reverend Dr. William H. Foulkes, of Newark, in an address at Philadelphia, made the statement that “the Church today needs a baptism of fire”. He is right. The “church” he is thinking of will get the baptism of fire he is not thinking of, in Armageddon ; and when that baptism comes it will burn it up, root and branch, and be the best thing that ever happened to the glory of God and the good of mankind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">That is a happy headline in the London </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald,</span><span class="font7"> “World Churches Unite to Fight”; and the more the caption is considered, the more truthful and reasonable it all sounds. Just to start thinking: ‘The church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven’ (Hebrews 12: 23), and the “world churches” are opposites. The rest of the caption seems self-explanatory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The human family makes progress. A generation ago there was once in a while a dad that would whip a boy with a strap. But now see. At Texarkana the Reverend E. W. Morris, formerly with the Salvation Army in Texarkana and Shreveport, but of late conducting a mission in his home, was arrested for clubbing a boy with a piece of automobile spring. Rather than return to the “mission” the boy (variously estimated as ten to fourteen years of age) pleaded that he might be sent to prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such of the public as still have a sense of humor are getting a big kick out of seeing the bishops once more begin to churn for war, realizing that if it comes the bishop himself is liable to get hit with a bomb. The old job of cheering young men to go out and kill somebody loses much of its charm when an airplane directly overhead looses a 2,000-pound bomb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Kansas City </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font7"> contains the pictures of three graduates of the Ouachita Baptist college at Arkadelphia, Ark., who are taking a course in military training at Fort Leavenworth before they start their work of preaching “Blessed are the peacemakers”, “Love your enemies,” etc.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>After the Bonus Money</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">M. E. Dodd, pastor of a Baptist church at Shreveport, La., had a big advertisement in the Shreveport </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> in which he said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I was with the boys in the tents, in the ‘bull pen’, in the mess halls, on the march, on the ships, in the hospitals, in the dugouts and trenches, speaking, praying, talking, distributing papers, selling cigarettes, chocolates, et cetera. And because I was in the uniform of a welfare worker instead of a military man I cannot claim any part in the bonus. But on the basis of my service, I venture to make a suggestion to you about your part of the bonus. Do not forget that one-tenth of your income (bonus included) is sacred to God. There are many worthy causes challenging your charitableness and worthy of all support. Among them you would consider your own church first of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The advertisement occupied a space two columns wide and lOf inches high and was set with a black border around it. Not a bad idea, putting it in mourning; for if any of the soldier boys are so foolish as to part with their cash to any of these institutions calling themselves “churches” (the sole object of whose existence is to dishonor the name of Jehovah God), they will do well to mourn their folly.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Strange Words from Methodists</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Hitherto, when there was a chance for war, the Methodist church has always been strong for it, but in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Epworth Herald</span><span class="font7"> a writer, after dismissing the conscientious-objector course as unsatisfactory, proposed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Stay out of jail—why thus separate yourself from the masses? Why thus let yourself be put out of the game? Accept the draft, take the drill, go into the camps and onto the battlefields, or into the munitions factories and transportation work—but sabotage war preparations and war. Be agitators for sabotage. Down tools when the order is to make and load munitions. Spoil war material and machinery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let all fair-minded people take note of these words and observe that they are not the words of Jehovah’s witnesses, who never have given such counsel and do not now give it; yet Jehovah’s witnesses, and not the Methodists, are the objects of direct Hierarchal and therefore indirect governmental wrath in time of war and in time of peace. Like their Master, Jehovah’s witnesses are peacemakers, peace-lovers, and, if you choose, “pacifists,” but they are not and never will be saboteurs or traitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Seven hundred Methodist ministers in Britain are pledged not to participate in any future wars. Their spokesman, Reverend Leslie Keeble, went on record as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All war is contrary to the spirit, teaching and purpose of Jesus Christ, and our conscience forbids us ever to take part in it or its preparation. It is incredible to us that the appalling wickedness and mass murder of modern war should be contemplated as a possibility by any sane person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bishop F. J. McConnell, of the Methodist Episcopal church, telling of an Austrian conscientious objector (very likely one of Jehovah’s witnesses) who was shot dead because he would not fall in to go to the battle front of the World War, says, reflectively:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The manifest heroism of the conscientious objectors is the spearhead today in the fight against war, their bravery being of that extraordinary type that knows nothing of artificial excitement produced by the uproar of battle itself. I bow more profoundly to the conscientious objectors than to any other heroes of the last war. Oh, don’t cease to be gentle, gentle reader, at this! I mean the conscientious objectors who took and take the consequences. Not the writers, myself included, who have written, and continue to write, without any special risk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In southern California the Methodist Episcopal church quoted with approval a statement of the Presbyterians that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Christians owe an allegiance to the kingdom of God that is superior to loyalty to their own country, and that in any matter in which the laws of their country conflict with the commands of God, they must assert their duty and right ‘to obey God rather than men’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And then, on their own account, the Methodists said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“We hold to be utterly un-American the growing tendency to infringe upon the right of free speech and free assembly of minority groups in this state in violation of constitutional prerogatives, and call upon officials and individual organizations to refrain from the use of extra-legal methods in dealing with labor problems and groups.” “We also hold, in the words of the General Conference, ‘that our country is benefited by having as citizens those who unswervingly follow the dictates of their conscience. ’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Methodists also asserted that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘ ‘ The present industrial order is unchristian, unethical, and antisocial because it is largely based on the profit motive which is a direct appeal to selfishness. Selfishness is never morally right, never Christian, and eventually never benefits anybody.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Western New York Baptist Young People’s Association, discerning the readily apparent fact that there are many more</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">At Broken Hill, Australia, Reverend W. J. Wiley, Baptist clergyman, under his own name in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Barrier Daily Truth</span><span class="font7"> made the following startling confession:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I would like to speak to the war lords and warmongers. In 1914 we undertook the experiment on a large scale of waging ‘a war to end war’ and ‘to make the world safe for democracy’. . . . The World War created far more causes for new wars than it settled of old ones. . . . These slogans are slogans of death. You ask us to go on doing the same thing. Remember, we gave you everything you asked for and yet you failed. We gave the men—yes, and women and little children, too. ... We gave you money. . . . We gave you materials. . . . We gave you our right to freedom of speech. . . . Ministers were forced out of their pulpits or silenced when they undertook to teach ‘love your enemy’. You wrote our speeches for us. We spoke the words you wanted us to say. You dictated the editorials and inspired the propaganda. ... We gave you our schools. They were turned into training camps. . . . We gave you our churches. They were turned into recruiting stations. . . . We gave you our religion. We threw its sanctity about your damnable experiment. We blessed your ■war and your instruments of war. We prayed for the success of your armies. We invoked God to curse your enemies. We even gave the sacred name of our Redeemer as an example of the good of human sacrifice. . . . What have you given us in return? You have given us imperialism, nationalism, despotism, destruction and destitution. You have given us Hitler, Mussolini, and other strutting demigods. . . . Never again will we give up our allegiance to Jesus to serve war lords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Abbotsford, B. C., has an unusually bright dog. He realized that the two-legged folks were praying for peace and arming for war, and that some of the prayers were wrong anyway, so he sneaked into the dhurch, grabbed tw<sup>T</sup>o of the prayer books and headed for the door, probably intending to bury them where he had buried several others; but this time the constable caught him.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>The Political Swill-Barrel</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Reverend Hunt, in the Raleigh (W. Va.) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Register,</span><span class="font7"> showed the beginners in the preaching business the right methods to pursue if they want to get their feet into the WPA or any similar trough. Of President Roosevelt he said (sic as in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Register') :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He is our salvation to the voters of our nation. When we were in despair he reached his hand and lifted us from industrial slavery as Jesus Christ lifted the yoke of bondage when there was no hand of pity, the way was dark and the road was closed between God and man he prevailed to open the seven seals that man might have a right to the tree of life, so did President Roosevelt prevail to break the chains of industrial slavery between labor and capital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As man has the right to communicate with his heavenly Father through Jesus Christ so do we by the stroke of the pen of our great president give us the right to collect and bargain as employees. I feel that we should not go back to those dark days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As we have the right to free speech and to our own choice of our own organization as Christ said we may serve him under our own vine and fig tree as that stands good today so our organization stands. Let us not go back neither look back for he has said he hath taken hold of the plow handle and look back is not fit for the Kingdom of Heaven. I say that we must see the same in our government affairs as they cried at Pilate’s hall—“away with him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The millionaires and billionaires are crying today “away with him.” Were their cries at Pilate’s hall because of the bad deeds He had done? Or were they because He w’as a friend to the poor? They said that he was too kind, so in this nation do they cry because of his misdeeds. I say it is because of his reaching down his loving hand to the poor. What shall we do with him? Shall we say “away with him” or shall we say “he is my salvation”? It is up to you and me and to all voters of our nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Reverend Albert J. Mitchell, Negro, presiding elder of the African M.E. church, Baltimore, Md., showed wonderful interest in the clergy under his care just before election. He sent out 400 letters advising them to support the Landon-Knox ticket, and admits that many of the letters contained each a $5 check, to accompany the advice. The checks were signed by the chairman and the treasurer of the Republican State Central Committee. The gentlemen who contributed the money are now in mourning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sensing the objective of the Papal new deal for taking over the United States, lock, stock and barrel, and unwilling to be bribed, the Chicago Church Federation, representing twelve hundred Protestant churches, refused to participate in the WPA project to finance recreational and educational programs through the churches.

<h4><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>The Unbelief Department</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">At Newport News, Va., Reverend Robert Lee House was eager to undermine the faith of his congregation in the Bible. In a sermon on “Things I Do Not Believe” he mentioned, among others, that he did not believe in all the Bible, did not believe that inspiration or revelation is confined to the Bible, did not believe in the second coming of Christ, did not believe in the Millennium, did not believe in the coming of God’s kingdom, and did not believe in sanctification. At this distance it looks as if about the only thing he really believes in is the “Reverend” Robert Lee House.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Doing what lay in his power to help the young men of the Y.M.C.A. at Santa Ana, Calif., into infidelity, the Reverend Edwin 0. Colbeck, in an address entitled “The Bible, The Book Which Led the World Astray”, denied the verbal inspiration of the Scriptures and stated that he had on file over a hundred mistakes. He was very eager that the young men to whom he talked should not believe Jesus’ statement, “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” He desired that they should have great respect for the clergy, not the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Reverend Dr. Albert Joseph McCartney, pastor of the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant, Washington, D.C., is not more ashamed of the Savior than the Savior and His followers are of him. In his prayer to the newspapers, given at the Republican Convention at Cleveland, he did not mention Jesus in any manner, nor did any other of the clergy at that convention.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Sometimes the fleecers are themselves fleeced. A thief visited the trustees of the First Parish Unitarian church of Concord, Mass., to inspect the gold leaf on the steeple. He said it needed a little fixing at one place, and was told to go ahead and fix it. After some days he left, and it was found $500 worth of gold leaf was gone also, while in its place was some gold paint that is now already grayish green. The thief left the steeple, setting the clergy an example of moderation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A dispatch from London says there were no services at the Church of the Holy Ghost because an enraged bull refused to permit the worshipers to enter. It is not polite for candidates for the ministry to act like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A dispatch from Juneau, Wis., says that it took two weeks to remove all the skunks from the Lutheran church there, and then services were resumed. That might be all right in Juneau, but there are congregations elsewhere from which, if all the skunks were removed, they would have to sell the church.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">M. J. Televiak, pioneer, gets off down in San Antonio, Tex., far from the scene of his encounter, and then, seeking the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font7"> as a soft place to alight, writes thusly:</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370505_files/g_E_19370505-7.png" alt="" style="width:234pt;height:273pt;">
<p><span class="font6">Paying tribute to the Devil</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">While working in Rushford, Minn., I called on Mr. 0. A. 0. Moen. He denounced the Watch Tower, stating that we were selling books and that this work was a big racket, etc. Enclosed you will find an outline of a commercial organization of which Mr. Moen is secretary and treasurer. Perhaps </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> would be interested in this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Examining the four-page prospectus which Televiak thus so seductively introduces, it is found that the Christian Benevolent Society, of which Moen is the guiding star, aims to “assist those who have been bereft of loved ones’’ with an “approximate $1,000 protection” and “costs less than 3J cents per day”. It is “organized not for profit, but for benevolent purposes”. Oh, yeah ? And the board of directors consists of four persons: besides Moen, Reverend C. F. Geiger, president, Box 25, Chatfield, Minn., Reverend Hugo Bersell, vice president, Houston, Minn., and Reverend M. Vanderbeck, special representative, and evangelist, Rushford, Minn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Probably Televiak wants </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> to insinuate that neither Moen nor Geiger, nor Bersell, nor Vanderbeck, is on the level, and that in the long run it will be found that they have principally been the ones “assisted” because, at some stage or other in their lives, they “have been bereft of loved ones”, and that the whole outfit is merely one more oily scheme to separate “Lutheran, Methodist, Catholic, Presbyterian, Episcopal, Congregational, Brethren, Baptist, Nazarene, Mennonite, Christian and others” (mentioned in the prospectus) from some of their mammon of unrighteousness before the coming of the final showdown; but nothr ing doing. If Televiak wants anything of that kind done, let him leave San Antonio and hark right back up into Rushford, and argue it out with the directors.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>The Hierarchy a Habitation of Demons</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Revelation 18:2 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(American Revised</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Version)</span><span class="font7"> says of both Roman Catholic and Protestant organizations (unitedly opposed to the pure truth of God’s Word): “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and is become a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit.” It therefore becomes necessary to set forth a few facts, taken from the current news, which plainly show that all modern and ancient “churches” are into demonism up to their necks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The magazine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font7"> t </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sign</span><span class="font7"> unwittingly shows the close relation between the “Singing Harlot” church and demonism in an article by Mary Welcome entitled “The Soul in Ecstasy”. The article shows “St.” Alphonsus Liguori, one of the alleged great theologians, speaking of the soul as being torn from the body and carried away with violence a million miles in an instant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The article admits that this state of ecstasy is not incompatible with sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It tells of “St.” Thomas of Villanova as being suspended twelve hours in the air, and of Catherine Emmerich as being blown about like a soap bubble, during which time she swept down humanly inaccessible cobwebs and even decorated the cornices of the church. It tells of “St.” Joseph of Cupertino, who, if you will believe it, “raised a heavy cross that ten men had tried in vain to lift” and, still more, “three times when raised in ecstasy . . . dragged one of his companions into the air with him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With all respect for Miss Welcome, this is just too bad for the reputations of Mr. Liguori, Thomas of Villanova, Miss Emmerich and “St.” Joseph of Cupertino; for it is very apparent that these were all spirit mediums who conveyed to the minds of those about them ideas implanted in their own minds, ideas of happenings which by no stretch of the imagination ever happened at all, but were solely the “works” of demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Reverend G. Maurice Elliott, late Episcopal vicar of St. Peter’s, Cricklewood, England, is reported as saying, “I have seen the materialized forms of spirits, many of them friends who have passed over.” The “Reverend” is mistaken. What he saw was cooked up for him by the same evil angels so often cast out by the Lord Jesus throughout his ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The London </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Referee</span><span class="font7"> claims that the spirit medium that Queen Victoria consulted was Robert James Lee. It was Lee (who died in 1931) who saw in a trance the features of the London surgeon who was the famous “Jack the Ripper” of a half century ago. “The Ripper” went mad through vivisection of helpless creatures, and finally ran amuck among humans. He died in an asylum unknown to the asylum keepers except as “Murderer No. 124”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During her lifetime the people were not let into the secret that Queen Victoria frequently consulted the spirits. The statements now made agree with the claims of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy that she died a Roman Catholic; for the two are one and the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With not a word from the clergy to explain that each and every one of these manifestations is that of demons, devils, seeking to convey the false impression that the dead are alive, British papers abound in stories of impersonations of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Horatio Lord Nelson or others long dead, of dead brides appearing in their wedding garments, of the spirits of dead cats, of dead hands coming up through the floor, of beautiful women passing through cobwebs in. a belfry, etc., etc.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>Blasphemy and Demonism United</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">The clergy have spent years in trying to force upon the people the unscriptural and unreasonable view that when people die they are more alive than ever; and now when they are being caught in their lie, they know not what to do. Jehovah’s people are the only ones that have the truth on this subject. As to others, the prophet asks: “Lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord; and what wisdom is in them?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Los Angeles has a D.D. mill which is operated for a consideration by so-called “spiritualists”. The mill conferred upon a duck, under the name Reverend Drake Googoo, the power to perform weddings, conduct services and officiate at rites for the dead. Now the 207 varieties of preachers (none of whom have any better right to their high-sounding titles) are jealous and are preaching against the mill. Just to help them out, the information is gladly offered that the degree of D.D. is authorized in the Scriptures, where the clergy are referred to as d---- d----s. See</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Isaiah 56:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At hand a four-page leaflet advertising the demonized Harlem Negro as “Father Divine”, “Immanuel” and “God is with Us”; also “Jesus Christ”. It contains 31 paragraphs and repeats the statement “It is Wonderful!” twenty-six times. The conclusion is a seal the principal feature of which is the Great Pyramid. Whites as well as Negroes have fallen under the spells cast by the demons controlling this man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From Minneapolis comes the news that the followers of this Negro are hearing an “inner voice”. In other words, they are slipping into spiritism, demonism, and then insanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mrs. Peters, of Minneapolis, guest at one of “Father Divine’s” “heavens”, stated that when he came in she was thrown off her mental balance, was overcome by some sort of power, and joined with others in singing and dancing around the table. Unable to get closer to him she went outside and began to say “Peace, Father” even to the dogs. At length she realized she was being deceived, and headed back to Minneapolis, a wiser woman.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font7">HE Catholic Bible generally used is known as the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Douay Version.</span><span class="font7"> Nowhere in that Bible is purgatory even mentioned. No text makes mention of a soul in purgatory. From the year 595 to 604 (A.D.) Gregory, known as “Gregory the Great”, served in the office of pope of the Boman Catholic Hierarchy. He was the first man to “discover” “purgatory” and to advance the theory of the souls there being tormented with fire. Says the McClintock and Strong </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopaedia,</span><span class="font7"> Volume VIII, 1879 edition, under the title “Purgatory”: “But whatever the views of some Church fathers on the subject, as a doctrine it was unknown in the Christian Church for the first 600 years, and it does not appear to have been made an article of faith until the 10th century. . . . ‘Purgatory as a. burning-away of sins,’ said Doellinger at the Bonn Conference of Old Catholics in 1875, ‘was an idea unknown in the East as well as the West till Gregory the Great [pope 595-604] introduced it. . . . Gregory the Great added the idea of a tormenting fire.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The doctrine concerning “purgatory” finds authority only in the opinion and interpretation of men, that is, in the voice or opinion of men who lived centuries ago and who are called “fathers”. The eminent Catholic authority, James Cardinal Gibbons, in his book above cited, page 208, says concerning “purgatory”: “This interpretation is not mine. It is the unanimous voice of the Fathers of Christendom.” Then he gives the names of some of the early men in the Catholic church who advanced the theory. Are such authorities of any weight or support to the purgatorial theory? Is the fact that men centuries ago taught certain things concerning “purgatory” any proof of the existence of the same? Let Jesus answer concerning the tradition of such men. The clergy who were the Pharisees in Jesus’ day based their teachings upon tradition. They said to Jesus: “Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?” “But he [Jesus] answered and said unto them: Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition ? Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites! well did</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and hon-oureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” —Matthew 15:1-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus here shows that the teachings of men make void the Word of God. The apostle Paul expresses the same conclusion. Paul, when he practiced the Jewish religion, was guided by the tradition of the elders or fathers. When he became a true follower of Christ Jesus he cast away religion and the tradition of the fathers and followed only the commandments of God as taught by Jesus Christ. (Galatians 1:10-16) Then Paul specifically warned all Christians to avoid the teachings of men and to adhere solely to the teaching of Christ Jesus: “Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.”— Colossians 2:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The theory that numerous creatures are supposed to suffer in “purgatory” has frightened millions of sincere persons, causing them to bring forth large sums of hard-earned money and to contribute it toward the saying of masses, believing that by so doing they might render aid to those in “purgatory” and be in position themselves thereafter to receive benefits. Such sincere persons have thereby been greatly defrauded in their property and entirely misled concerning the way to life everlasting. Who is chargeable and responsible for that doctrine of “purgatory”, by which so many persons have been deceived and are still deceived? Are the members of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the priests wholly responsible therefor? No, it would not be fair to claim that they are entirely responsible. The father and promulgator of the “purgatory” lie is none other than the Devil himself. The Devil has overreached and induced men to believe and teach the doctrine of “purgatory”, and the Devil’s purpose in so doing is to turn the attention of man away from Jehovah God, with the ultimate expectation that he could lead all mankind into destruction. That wicked creature, designated in the Scriptures as the Old Serpent, Satan, and the Devil, is the arch deceiver and chief enemy of God and man. Both Satan and his ministers claim to be the enlighteners of the people and often pose as the representatives of Christ, and thereby deceive .and practice fraud upon credulous persons. Concerning this it is written in the Bible: “For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.”—2 Corinthians 11:13-15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">[The foregoing is one of a series of recorded talks by Judge Rutherford on important issues of this day. The phonograph records may be run on the ordinary type of machine and are being widely used for passing important information on to relatives, friends, and neighbors near and far. The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N.

<h3><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>Why Salter<a name="footnote3"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark88">3</a></sup> Lost His Job</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font7">DDLY enough, it just so happened that the editor of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> was present when Salter lost his job. Now is an opportune time to narrate the essential facts. This is done with no malice. It is done without either the knowledge or consent of Judge Rutherford,, and without his suggestion. It is done in the interests of Jehovah’s kingdom, of justice, peace and truth— earth’s only hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Salter lost his job, not because of attempted (but foiled) sequestration of funds of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, nor because of the purchase of a fur coat for his ladifren with .a portion of those funds. Either one of those reasons would have been ample. He was in a position of trust; he proved that he was not to be trusted. That is enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He lost his job because he was lazy and unfaithful and treacherous. That was the real reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nobody is big enough, in the Lord’s organization, or in any other organization, in these days, to lie down on his job and expect to get away with it. Only the other day the stockholders of the Bethlehem Steel Company, some of them, wanted to fire Charles M. Schwab (once accounted one of the greatest men in the United States) because, so they thought, he was no longer of use to the company of which he is the head. Salter would not work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the time he was fired, employees who were supposed to be working under Salter’s direction testified repeatedly that they did not know what his duties were; that he did not show up until around 10:00 in the morning; quit work promptly at noon; slept until 3:00 or sometimes 4:00 in the afternoon, and sometimes was not seen after the noon whistle blew, the rest of the day. Sometimes he spent the afternoons dictating personal letters to his ladifren stenographer. They were read at the hearing, many of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The letters were largely to faithful or supposedly faithful persons in the Lord’s organization, lauding himself, defending himself, justifying himself. Or they were to unfaithful persons, already out of the organization, commending them for their unfaithfulness and expressing his regret that, on account of his position, he could not speak as freely as he would like.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>The Letters Were a Scream</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">The letters were a scream. At the hearing, the ladifren stenographer was so seated in the room that, as she read the letters, there was no way in which Salter could give her the wink, or shake his head in disapproval, or steer the matter in any way. (She read her stenographic notes.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As she read aloud, when she came to a particularly bad place, where it was very apparent that the cat was being let out of the bag, she tried to omit a sentence or a paragraph. With kindness in speech and manner, Judge Rutherford called her attention to the omission, and asked her to reread. It only helped to emphasize</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">the fact that nobody can be unfaithful to God and cover it up. This happened repeatedly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was perfectly apparent to everybody present that Salter was unfit for his place. He was given the opportunity to resign, before the letters were read. Not knowing Judge Rutherford had transcriptions of all his ladifren's stenographic notes, he tried to bluff his way through. He failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After one of his letters had been read in which Salter had admitted that he does not believe the Lord is present, and that he counts those who have broken with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society as his real brethren in Christ, the writer of this memorandum suggested that it was unnecessary to go further, and that Judge Rutherford should husband his strength for the great tasks the Lord has entrusted to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But although, as this writer personally chanced to know, Judge Rutherford was under a great nervous strain in parting with this man who had been</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark92"></a>You Have Seen the Salter Letters</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">After his position was gone, Salter attended the Canadian convention where Judge Rutherford gave the address on “Work” which appears in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> for October 15, 1936. It was good to hear. That address, every word of it, was prepared in the forenoon of the day Salter was given his hearing. That is how busy men have to conserve their time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the discourse was delivered Salter came around saying, in effect, that he now saw his error; that he had been all wrong; that he was convinced it is the duty of Jehovah’s people to really </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">work</span><span class="font7"> in the interest of the “great multitude”, the “Jonadabs”, those ‘marked in their forehead s’, those ‘with Noah in the ark’, those ‘fleeing to the cities of refuge’, those seeking Jehovah, meekness and righteousness, Jesus’ “other sheep”, the “sheep” divided from the “goats”, those that</span></p>

It was a gift of friends. I did not know of the existence of the house until I read of it in The Golden *e«.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Not one cent of the funds of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society went into either of the Cadillac cars used by Judge Rutherford at San Diego and Brooklyn. They were gifts of friends.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As to the property at Staten Island, the location of WBBR, while this property was bought for the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society by its President, J.

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6">Salter knew all the above facts.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6">Why, then, object?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font7">counted a friend (Psalm 41:9; John 13:18), he preferred to proceed so that Salter could never say he had not had a fair hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the conclusion, and long before the conclusion, one with any manhood or honesty in his make-up would have thought Salter would have honestly admitted that he had been dishonest, deceitful, treacherous and lazy, and unworthy of employment in any enterprise where the sterling qualities of honesty, industry and truthfulness, to say nothing of courage, are absolutely essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But he bluffed it through to the end. When nothing more could be done, he was dismissed, and properly so. After Salter’s dismissal Judge Rutherford, still moved with kindness toward</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font7">‘hear and say “Come” ’, the ‘ten men taking hold on the Jew’, those ‘fleeing to the mountains’, the ‘many nations going up to Jehovah's mountain’, the “Ebed-melech” class, those that “go down to the sea in ships”, the lately delivered “prisoners”, the ‘virgins her companions that follow the Bride’, the “mixed multitude” of the Exodus, the “Nethinims”, the “Gibeonites”, the ‘strangers at the feast of tabernacles’, and, one of the best of all, “Joseph’s ten brethren.” But don’t imagine, for a minute, that Salter had any grasp at all of any or all of these great truths, which he could have had from the Lord through </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> had he been willing to be honest and industrious. He was merely trying to regain his hold on Judge Rutherford’s</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">esteem and confidence. At heart he despised all these instructions of the Lord, and now says so plainly in the letters which you have probably seen by the time this reaches you.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>None of Jehovah’s People Will Be Moved*</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">None of Jehovah’s people will be moved by anything that a man like Salter could say. They know that this work is Jehovah’s own work and nothing can overthrow it. If for no other reason, they are comforted, blessed, strengthened by the bread of life from God’s own Word, as it comes to them through the columns of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font7">When a man is constantly supplied with more food than he can eat, why try to tell him he is starving? God is fulfilling His promise to those who have ‘brought all their tithes into His storehouse’. The blessings are more than they can receive, i.e., retain and remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is nothing new that Jesus and His followers are accused of being winebibbers. Did that charge affect in any way Jesus’ standing with His heavenly Father? Not an iota. Why did Jesus use it? He was under great nervous strain. It provided a perfect nutrient, immediately assimilable. A chiropractor, once treating Judge Rutherford and the writer at the same time, said to the judge, as he saw his back suffering from ankylosis (six vertebrae fused together by pneumonia), “You are a miracle of God’s grace.” At the same time he said to the writer, “He is bearing a burden that would utterly crush you.” Read that paragraph twice, and make the most of it, all you hypocrites that wish to remain hypocrites to the end. You will get your wish, and your reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When it comes to work, there are plenty of people in Jehovah’s organization who are doing all they can do. Some of them, occasionally, turn all night, over and over, too tired to sleep. Judge Rutherford does that, too, for you, if you love God. If you don’t, it is all O.K. with him. He is just a “sheep”, trying to do his Master’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">*This was illustrated by S. M. Godfrey, of Pennsylvania, a faithful and intelligent company servant in the Keystone State, who, immediately on receipt of Salter’s infamous diatribe against the Society which had supported him for twenty years, wrote him as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sir:—I received one of the circular letters which you sent out, and these few lines are to express my contempt for one who would take the course that you have taken. I refer espe-</span><span class="font7">If you are a “goat”, just go right ahead and make all the goat noises and goat odors that you wish. Nobody will hinder you.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>Despicable Methods, Judas-like</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">In mailing out his letters Salter used despicable methods, the most Judas-like of anything this writer has ever seen. One method was to try to communicate with company servants by communications mailed from Brooklyn in envelopes bearing in the upper left corner what would lead the recipient to believe the letter was from “Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, N.Y.” The tan envelopes used were never purchased by the Society; the imprint in the corner is a forgery; the contents, ostensibly from the Society, were and are from the Devil, with Walter Salter as the tool used by him to endeavor to hoodwink some into leaving the Lord and His truth and coming over into some unnamed organization where their nickels and dimes would help feed a man that was too lazy to honestly feed himself.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>That Brings Up the Subject of Money</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Money is of the Devil. Everybody knows it, qnd everybody with any sense looks forward to its Divine destruction. While God’s people are in the Devil’s world it is necessary in the Lord’s work. It is useful in building and operating printing plants and office buildings, homes, gardens, shiploads of paper, world-wide radio hookups, and a thousand and one other things not necessary to be named. The Lord called it “the mammon of unrighteousness” and urged that it be used to God’s glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Salter, forgetting the funds which he tried to sequester from the Society, professes to be aggrieved because Judge Rutherford has quarters in San Diego where (on account of having had pneumonia at least twice) he does his work in winter. It is a permanent home, deeded to King David, in the interests of Jehovah’s kingdom, </span><span class="font6">cially to the letter sent by you or one of your associates enclosed in a Watch Tower envelope and purporting to be from the Society, in which the company servant is instructed (instructed by one who has manifested that he lias become a servant of Satan) to have this letter read and discussed at company meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your estimate of the intelligence of Jehovah’s witnesses is all wrong if you think they will be misled by your methods. You should join with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy: they would welcome you with open arms and you could' show them some new tricks. Jude 11-16, to my mind, seems to fit your present condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Meantime it is occupied by one of the hardest-working men in the world, Judge Rutherford. It isn’t a shanty; it is a real home; and nobody but a Judas would object to its erection or occupancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same can be said of the other places mentioned. Salter was even mean enough to mention the headquarters at Magdeburg, Germany, which Judge Rutherford built for the comfort of all the workers there before Hitler the Madman took over the country. There is no information in this office that Judge Rutherford ever reserved a room for himself at the Magdeburg home. But, suppose he did; whose business is it? At no time could he ever have been there more than a week or so in any one year. Was it not all right for him to have a place to sleep ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Or is it so that, having, like Abraham, given up all, and confessed that he is a stranger and pilgrim in the earth, now in Brooklyn, now in London, now in San Diego, now in Paris, now in Berne, now somewhere else, he should have no creature comforts, but give them all up so that some flatfoot that never knew what real work is could sleep from noon till four o’clock in the afternoon, digesting a dinner he did not earn?</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>That’s About All There Is to It</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Thaf s about all there is to it. Salter was fired because he is unfaithful and lazy. He tries to make a hit by referring to Judge Rutherford in capitals twelve times in one letter as “the president”. Well, he is that; isn’t he? And a real one, too. Just make a slip of any kind in your work, and see how long it is before you know that the one that should know about it does know about it. He directs the entire work, and should. He is the elected president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, as, for example (and with his nomination), C. J. Woodworth is president of the Golden Age Publishing Company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why be so small ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Oh, yes, one more little item. Just for a laugh. Salter pans </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font7"> He disapproves of it—now. He used to write inane items from Canada. Nobody found them very interesting. But they were all neatly typed. Somebody at the hearing said that was about all he did. He didn’t do the typing; somebody else did that. But he picked out the newspaper clippings that were to be copied. And it was brought out that he sometimes held them over for as long as five months so that he could have something to send in each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When this was brought to Judge Rutherford’s attention, he said, “Now wouldn’t that stop your grandmother’s clock?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Salter says </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> uses “bloodcurdling stuff and obscene language”, meaning, of course, the cartoon where is illustrated the statement of Jehovah God:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They give gifts to all whores; but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom. And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms : and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee; therefore thou art contrary.— Ezekiel 16: 33, 34.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>Access to Stenographic Report</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Salter’s above sneer at Jehovah God was intended to be the end of the foregoing article, but since then access was unexpectedly obtained to the full stenographic record of the hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The records show that Salter persisted in doing things his own way, instead of as instructed by the president of the Society. Thus: When the president instructed him to wait regarding certain building operations, he went ahead without delay. When he was asked to remove the partition he had caused to be constructed, to shut himself off from the rest of the office, he never removed it. When he was instructed not to submit transcription records to the Canadian Broadcasting Commission, he submitted them for censorship, resulting in dishonor to Jehovah’s great and holy name, and, incidentally, imposing a great additional expense and inconvenience upon the Society. It was an act of disloyalty to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the Brooklyn office, the one then directing the office work there, R. J. Martin, had his desk in the middle of the office, accessible from every direction. The desk of his successor is there to this day. On account of Salter’s tendency to perverseness, Martin had no confidence in him, ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Subsequent to his submission of the transcription records to Ottawa censorship, Salter, in a class meeting, falsely claimed that when Judge Rutherford filed with the Paris radio authorities a verbatim statement of his address, he was submitting to censorship. Such was wholly false. At no time has Judge Rutherford ever permitted any of his addresses to be censored by anybody. Filing a record is one thing; submitting records to be approved or disapproved or censored is quite another and a different thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And, in any event, since Salter was appointed to his position by Judge Rutherford, what kind of business was it for him to mention in the presence of others what he considered to be a mismove on the part of his superior? Such would not be permitted in any worldly organization.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>Who Wants a Disorganizer?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Nobody wants a disorganizer; everybody tries to get rid of disorganizers as soon as they develop malcontent in themselves or in others. It is hard enough work building up an organization, and keeping it up. It doesn’t take any brains or any heart to tear it down. Any fool can do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The central theme of Jehovah’s organization today is to do the will of God by proclaiming from door to door that Jehovah’s kingdom, now present, is the one and only hope of the world. The literature of the Kingdom flows from God’s Word, through the pen of Judge Rutherford, over the Watch Tower printing presses, and out by the millions of copies at the hands of faithful servants of the Most High God in every land and in every language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The books going out at the rate of 24,457,111 last year, and with a total up to last October of 229,675,028, Salter has advertised (as widely as he dared) that Jehovah’s people are “getting nowhere” with the work God has entrusted to them. Before being dismissed he did not engage in the service work to any extent, except when out with his ladifren at week ends. He seldom gave words of encouragement to those who did go out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The man who said that “to damn a thing with faint praise is to give it the damnedest kind of a damning” sized it up pretty well. Salter damned the service work with faint praise: ‘It was for others, if they wished, but it did not actually amount to anything. The real work was far ahead.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Enlargement of the Gall Bladder</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Can you imagine any man, appointed to a job by another man, and then evil enough, foolish enough, conceited enough, to say in the presence of others that he is confident that the man who appointed him will die, an object of God’s wrath </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font7">Armageddon, and he, the great, the wise, the prudent, the capable, will take his place and do what Rutherford tried to do and couldn’t? The man needs to be pruned. He should submit himself to the specialists and let them excavate his gall bladder and remove his inordinate selfesteem. He said to a fellow employee that his hands were tied. That is just what the Lord said, “Bind him hand and foot, . . . and cast him into outer darkness.”—Matthew 22:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When R. J. Martin, then directing Brooklyn office work, died, Salter said to a fellow employee, “I feel there is something in this for me. It is going to make a change for me.” “If a man thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.” (Galatians 6:3) W. F. Salter never will see the day at his best when he could show the good judgment of R. J. Martin at his worst.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Interspersed -with his extravagant egotism Salter had gleams of sanity. In a letter to Judge Rutherford, February 24, 1936, he said, truthfully, “I make no claim to being a student or speaker. I am a rotten reader.” Again, he said, “I have never aspired to any big position in the organization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yet this man, in an organization where men must be students, must be speakers, must be intelligent and eager readers, had the hardihood to state to others that the Lord would kill Judge Rutherford at Armageddon because he had usurped the Society, and that then a great work would be done. And who would do it ? Why, bless your innocence! “I will be about his present age at that time. I have a great work to do, but I am handicapped; my hands are tied.” If that is wisdom, may God deliver </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> from having any. And the mighty Salter thinks it doesn’t have any, at that.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>Personal Hatred of His Benefactor</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">-A mean person, a low person, hates his benefactor, for the same reason that Lucifer hated Jehovah God. Walter F. Salter is on record as saying that in 1918 Judge Rutherford was imprisoned because of his own fault. What a lie! He was imprisoned for being a Christian in wartime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He accused him, to the Toronto Bethel family, as being a severe autocrat. This disturbed the whole office force; and it is not true. He stated that he coveted flattery; that also is a lie. In a letter to one of the regional servants he said of his benefactor, “I have sensed for a long time that he is longing to get something on me, for some reason.” Imagine the disorganizing influences of such a letter. And in the meantime he wrote to Judge Rutherford never a word of these suspicions so eagerly peddled to others. Moreover, if he had the least common sense, he could have reasoned accurately that Judge Rutherford could discharge him at a moment’s notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He foolishly stated that Judge Rutherford had fixed himself so that no man could give him an order. Judge Rutherford never cast a vote for himself in his life, not one, nor did he ever ask anybody else to vote for him. In the fall of 1917 Jehovah’s people throughout the earth voted that he should be their president. As a matter of fact, Judge Rutherford rarely attends the annual meetings of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What peculiar animus against his benefactor must have urged Salter to seek to discredit Judge Rutherford because of the gift of automobiles mentioned in the letter of W. E. Van Amburgh reproduced in this issue! At no time were the Society’s funds ever used to purchase automobiles for J. F. Rutherford; his cars were always gifts from friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But here is the strange entry on the other side of the ledger, that the Society did purchase a car for Salter, and whereas Judge Rutherford uses his cars in the Lord’s work, Salter wore his out driving about the country doing things other than serving the Lord. In fifteen years, doing identical work in a much larger field, Robert J. Martin never owned a car nor wanted one.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>Disloyal to God’s Organization</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Salter was disloyal to God’s organization. He did not hesitate to refer to the Brooklyn office in contemptuous language. They (Brooklyn office men) were young fellows with no experience ; he could not afford to follow them. As he put it, “We have to work with the organization, but we don’t have to think with it.” That’s loyalty for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Percy Chapman was put in his place, Salter raised his hand in pledge that he would be absolutely loyal and obedient to the Society’s instructions under the new Canadian administration. You know now what was in his mind at the time. When dismissed he told Judge Rutherford, “I would have done the same thing myself,” and, “I did not resign for the pure reason that I believe it is the Lord’s organization and I would not resign therefrom.” Now he says he has known for a long time that it is not the Lord’s organization. Believe whichever story you like.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>No Confidence in The Watchtower</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Persons in the Toronto Bethel family discerned many months ago that it was apparent Salter did not accept many </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font7"> articles; at times he seemed bored, and showed enthusiasm only when something came up that called the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> presentations in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In private conversations and even from the public platform he advised against accepting what is in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> as from the Lord; they were merely “plausible explanations”; they merely represented Judge Rutherford’s thoughts on the matter. In one public discourse he dismissed these thoughts of Judge Rutherford as “thinks of men”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Once, in the office, holding </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font7">he pointed to an article and said heatedly, so that several heard him, “That is childish reasoning, childish reasoning.” Well, thank God, He still has some children, some that reason as He reasons. Judge Rutherford is one of those “little ones”. Jesus said, for just such: “I thank thee, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font7">Father, Lord of heaven and earth.”—Matthew 11:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a letter to one who denies the second presence of the Lord, Salter said that while he still, at that time, recognized the Watch Tower as the Lord’s organization, because he could not deny, then, that it was doing God’s work in the earth, yet he denounced the work as being done “in a very crude and erratic manner”. This from a man who truthfully admits that he is no student, no reader, no speaker, and that others admit is no thinker, no Christian and no real man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He showed an unwillingness to accept and apply the later truths regarding the Memorial, that it is primarily to the great name of Jehovah God. To two he stated that “the Memorial used to have so much more significance, but seems so empty now, since so many new thoughts have been brought out”. In other words, he took the cup of new wine handed to him by the Lord, and threw it back in his Savior’s face with contempt, because he hated the means by which it came to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Upsetting the Faith of Others</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It seems that when a man surrenders to the Devil he is not content with going himself, but wants to take others with him. Hence Salter tried to undermine the faith of others in Jehovah’s direction of His work in the earth. To a regional servant he said that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font7">committee should never have been discharged, but </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> should still be edited by a committee, and not by one man. Judge Rutherford Scripturally sets out that no man or men edit </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> but that the Lord Jehovah is the Teacher through it.—Isaiah 54:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On one occasion, at a certain lecture to the Toronto Bethel family Salter made the statement that, even in cases where it seemed that a person is not in line with the truth, it was none of the business of any member of the family to interfere or call a halt. Why, that is identically the way the Devil would talk and the way he always does talk. He wants to be let alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the office force said of that talk, “When he talks like that I feel so depressed. I feel like a ship without a rudder. It seems to undermine one’s faith; doesn’t it?” And the answer is that it does, and was so designed and intended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Salter made statements to many that the Watch Tower literature is not easy to understand, is often contradictory, and is over the heads of the people. None of these statements is true. What was his object in making them? His own good wife, not his ladifren, said that if she were to listen to him she would not be in the truth any time at all.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>Painful to Call a Man a Liar</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">It is painful to call any man a liar and a son of the Devil, but that is what Jesus did, and backed it up with the evidence. So here goes for Salter, and you just get out your notebook and see if you can chart what was going through his mind when he made the following statements. One lie follows another. He lied one way to one kind of people and another way to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">February 24, 1936, to Judge Rutherford: “I have misapplied </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer.</span><span class="font7"> I confess this to the Lord and to you, and am sorry, and have taken the matter to the Lord in prayer and asked his forgiveness. This has taught me more clearly than ever the great necessity of reading everything with greater care and diligence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">February 28,1936, to a man who does not believe the Lord is present: “I am fully persuaded that there must be a very great revision of much that we have been taught to believe was the truth in recent years. I am prone to believe that when Armageddon breaks it will so completely break up our present organization that it will make the experiences of 1917 and 1918 appear as nothing. After that our great and mighty work.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">March 4, 1936, to a regional servant in Europe : “We are up against a brick wall over here, and from the last </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Director [Informant]</span><span class="font7"> there are 90 less workers in the field than there were for the corresponding year previous.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">April 16, 1936, to a traveling representative in the United States: “I am firmly convinced that a mighty test is ahead for the church that will shake it from stem to stern. This I conclude from conditions as I see them in various companies of this land, and from reports I have concerning companies in the States, where I understand they are on the edge of a volcano.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">April 20,1936, to another traveling representative of the Society: “Everything in this office and throughout the entire country is in excellent condition.” (Ready to blow up one day and perfectly all O.K. four days later.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">May 11, 1936, to the president: “The results for the seven months this year are still well ahead of the corresponding period of last year. The number of publishers in the field shows also a decided increase, there being 2940 as compared with 2570 last year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Salter was not foursquare with Jehovah God. He was unfaithful to God and a traitor to God’s cause. He connived with the enemy to overthrow the Society and its work. It was Judge Rutherford’s duty to discharge him; he could do nothing less. “The time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God.” The judgment day is here; “the Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>A Personal Statement Regarding Salter<a name="footnote4"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark115">4</a></sup></span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">April 16, 1937</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have just received a copy of Salter’s latest tirade, which, for pure hypocrisy and deceit, has no equal. It is a series-of deliberate perversion and misapplication of facts which brands it, without a question of doubt, as of the Devil, and his sole intention is to poison the brethren and lead them astray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I have known this man for the past twenty or more years. We were “elders” together in the hectic days of 1917 and 1918.1 have seen the man in his native “heather” with all his bombastic arrogance and conceit manifested from one end of Canada to the other. I have seen him here at Brooklyn, suave, deceitful and an entirely different man from outward appearance. I do not believe the man was ever in the truth, but was and is one of the biggest hypocrites I know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the number of years that he has represented the Society I have never known him at any time to give a talk on </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> or any of the Society’s publications, but he has always endeavored to use some </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font7"> article or book to substantiate some rattle-brain scheme or theory of his own, an exact reproduction of the ministers who take a text of the Bible as a basis for their devilish theories. I am glad that the Lord has now torn the mask off and revealed the man for what he really is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the entire mass of junk that he is sending out there is but one accurate statement, and that is, that he was not capable of answering the party who is reported to have given him the material on our Lord’s return and the resurrection of the saints. The man was at no time capable of giving an answer for the hope that was within him because he has really never seen the Lord's organization nor properly discerned the body of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His covering letter sending out this trash to the brethren is devilish in the extreme. He encloses it in one of the regular Watch Tower envelopes with the return address of 117 Adams Street, which was calculated, of course, to deceive the brethren and lead them to believe that the material was forwarded from the Society's headquarters. By referring to himself as “Salter” and you as “Brother Rutherford” he intended to further his satanic scheme by creating the impression that this was submitted to the brethren for their consideration by the Society, and in order to further develop the deception he then created the impression that these were organization instructions which were not discretionary but entirely mandatory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All of this reveals the man in his true position as one governed by deceit, hypocrisy, and as a willing tool of the adversary. The implication of his own action is that he is doing this to further the interests of the Lord’s work. This would also imply, then, that the Lord was the author of this hypocritical and devilish procedure and would approve such a course of action. His god undoubtedly would, but Jehovah would not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Salter &quot;raises holy hands in horror” at the pictures and statements appearing in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> against the Hierarchy and the various other elements of the Devil’s organization, but at the same time he is willing to defame and degrade the name of Jehovah God by implying that the course that he is following is approved before the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Regarding this tirade against you personally: I have never at any time seen such a manipulation, misapplication and perversion of simple facts with such devilish intent. His reference to your homes or offices at Columbia Heights, Staten Island, California, and in other places, as palatial residences with luxurious furnishings, etc., is a deliberate falsehood, and he knows it to be so. He knows that the furnishings of all three places are practical, business-office furniture intended for the furtherance of the Lord's work. In fact, it has often occurred to me, when I had occasion to be in your office for any length of time in the Lord’s business, that it could be much more comfortable without taking away in the least from the efficiency of the Lord's work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, the fact that impresses me is that he deliberately lies and misrepresents conditions he knows of in order to interfere with the Lord's work. He knows that it is a physical impossibility to settle down and do the studying and research work necessary for the purpose of preparing the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and book material and other necessary Kingdom service at the office at 124 Columbia Heights, because of the innumerable interruptions of all sorts that occur there from the telephone, the various brethren call-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ing</span><span class="font7"> up about this, that and the other thing. He also knows of your physical condition making it impossible for you to live in the eastern part of the United States during the winter months and look after the direction of the Lord’s work and prepare the necessary material that should be prepared; that Staten Island affords an opportunity for you to get away and do this research work and prepare the material that is necessary to be prepared, and quiet, for proper thought and consideration to be given to it without the many interruptions; and that California enables you to work throughout the winter without the physical handicaps that you would have in the east. And, above all this, the manifest blessing of the Lord upon the tremendous amount of work that has been turned out under this arrangement is of itself sufficient answer to the foul charges made by this man. The Lord himself has blessed it and manifested His approval on the setup as it exists, and if Salter were not blinded to all honesty, justice and common decency, he would include these known facts in his letter, that the brethren might get a more accurate picture of the true situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His reference to your cars at Brooklyn and San Diego is similarly misleading. In the first place, he knows that these cars were not purchased by yourself or with the Society’s resources, but were a present to you. In the second place, he does not tell the friends that this car is used in Brooklyn in the service when you are away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His reference to the Society’s resources is devilish in itself, because it is such a deliberate misrepresentation of facts that he is familiar with. The man knows he is lying and creates a false impression when he presents it the way he does. He refers to the fact that there is a difference between the cost of production of the literature and the amount at which the companies receive the literature, but he does not say that well over fifty percent of the literature placed is placed by pioneers at less than cost of production. He does not say that a very large percentage of this literature is shipped to foreign countries at even less than cost of production. He does not remind the friends of the thousands upon thousands of dollars that are spent every year on broadcasts and for the recorded programs on the different stations throughout the world. Nor does he call attention to the thousands more that are given to pioneers in convention allowances and other provisions each year, nor the thousands that are sent throughout the earth to foreign lands to extend the Kingdom work in these places which are not selfsustaining. His letter implies that the difference in these amounts is something that you personally receive and use for your own pleasure, despite the fact that he knows that all monies received by the Society are received by the treasurer, banked by the treasurer, and that you could not, even if you wanted to, draw a- personal check upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If Salter were really halfway honest and wanted to give the brethren an accurate picture he would give them these facts; but that would not suit his purposes or the purposes of his father, and, as a willing tool, he confines his remarks to the limitations placed upon him to advance the interests of his Satanic majesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I am surely thankful to the Lord that during the past twelve years I have been enabled to be in a position to know the true facts regarding these situations, although even without that knowledge there would be no justification for accepting Salter’s vilification of yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lord’s blessing upon the Kingdom service throughout the earth during the past twentyodd years that you have served as president of the organization is the greatest proof, of course, of His favor and blessing, but this willful and deliberate misrepresentation of facts with such devilish ingenuity, which I know to be false, established beyond any shadow of doubt in my mind that the other things he brings up in his letter, which I do not happen to be familiar with, are just as false and misleading and instigated by the Devil for the purpose of opposing the Lord and the advancement of His organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Relative to his “crackpot” theories on our Lord’s return and the resurrection of the saints, and Armageddon: These are not worthy of receiving any consideration. Anyone who has read </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> during the past fifteen or more years will readily see that his play on words to set aside the mass of Scriptural evidence is worse than childish and is nothing but the babbling of one who, if he ever had any truth in him, has now turned into darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mass of evidence appearing in the parables of the “Pounds”, “Talents,” “Wise and Foolish Virgins,” “Sheep and Goats,” Lord’s Coming to His Temple, in “Birth of The Nation”, revealing the two organizations, and, in fact, all the Kingdom literature, up to and including the “Joseph” articles and “Song of the Harlot”, so definitely repudiates the position taken by Salter and his associates that anyone with the mind of the Lord will have no trouble in discerning the truth on this matter. But the colossal audacity of the man is manifest in expecting you to set aside the columns of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font7">which the Lord is using to bring forth such vital truth as contained in the “Joseph” articles, “Malachi,” “Song of the Harlot,” and devote its pages to the discussion of his theories on Armageddon and the Lord’s return. I and all the rest of the Lord’s people truly thank the Lord that you have the vision, courage and uncompromising devotion to the Lord that will not consider such a compromise under any circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I feel better that I have gotten this off my chest, and I want you to know that I am convinced that the Lord’s people throughout the earth appreciate your loyalty and devotion to Him and His cause and that such inconsistent vilification and misrepresentation as Salter and his associates distribute only more clearly manifest your true integrity and devotion to the Lord and His cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">May Jehovah continue to preserve and direct you in the vindication of His name and to the comfort and aid of His people in this great battle that we are privileged to be in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Your brother and fellow servant,</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>Disobedience Destroys the Rewards of Obedience</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font7"> ADAN </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Hebrew,</span><span class="font7"> Judge) is the name given by Josephus to that prophet of God whose strange experiences are recorded in the 13th chapter of 1 Kings and constitute one of the most remarkable stories of obedience and dis<sup>J </sup>obedience to be found in Holy Writ. The story of his obedience comes first, and is a thrilling account of the power of God backing up the word which He sent by Jadan to Jeroboam I, Israel’s wicked king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The story really begins in the last two verses of chapter 12, where occurs the statement that “Jeroboam ordained a feast in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">eighth</span><span class="font7"> month, on the fifteenth day of the month”, similar to that which Jehovah God by His servant Moses ordained in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">seventh</span><span class="font7"> month on the fifteenth day of the month. (Leviticus 23:34) This, the “sin of Samaria”, was the setting up of man’s word in the room and stead of the commandment of Almighty God as to the time and place of the “feast of tabernacles”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places which he had made. So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-el, the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of [Jehovah] unto Beth-el: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense. And he cried against the altar in the word of [Jehovah], and said, 0 altar, altar, thus saith [Jehovah]; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men’s bones shall be burnt upon thee. And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which [Jehovah] hath spoken ; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Beth-el, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him. The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of [Jehovah]. And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Entreat now the face of [Jehovah] thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought [Jehovah], and the king’s hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>Evidence of Acceptable Service</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Thus far Jadan had every evidence that his service was acceptable to Jehovah. At some apparent risk to his life he had come to reprove an idolatrous king at the time and place where the testimony would be the most difficult to give or to receive. Jeroboam was at the height of his power; he was at the altar which he had raised up as a place of offering and which he intended should be used by the ten tribes instead of the altar at Jerusalem; he was the king; it was the day of days with him, the spurious “feast of tabernacles”, the day of his own selection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jadan came and told him in the name of Jehovah God that the time would come when a descendant of the house of David (which house Jeroboam now despised and feared) would come to that very altar and upon it would sacrifice the priests themselves that had presumed to burn incense there. He even named the man, Josiah, that would do all this. The message was not his own message. It was the word of the true and living God. It was fulfilled 350 years later, in the tenth year of the reign of Josiah, and not until after it had been fulfilled did Josiah himself know that fact. The fulfillment is recorded in 2 Kings 23:15-18, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Moreover, the altar that was at Beth-el, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove. And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount, and sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of [Jehovah], which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words. Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Beth-el. And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>Jadan Proved His Authorization</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Jadan proved his authorization to speak in the name of Jehovah God. When Jeroboam tried to seize him, Jeroboam’s arm withered; and if</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">that kind of argument would not convince a man, it is hard to figure out one that would. Anyway, it made a sudden penitent out of Jeroboam. He wanted his arm back normal, so he could use it again; he wanted that worse than anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jeroboam had the mortification of seeing his altar rent, probably from top to bottom, and the ashes that were upon its concave top ran out to the ground, but he did have sense enough to know that this man of God was indeed God’s representative, and that the power which had withered his arm was God’s power. Knowing that his own prayers would not be heard, he begged that the man of God would pray for him, that he might be healed; and it was so done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is an interesting fact that though this “man of God” is mentioned sixteen times in the Scriptures (fourteen times in 1 Kings 13 and twice in 2 Kings 23), yet it is always by this peculiar title, and never by his own personal name. No doubt Jehovah God had some good reason for this, which reason will yet appear, why he is merely known in the Scriptures as the “man of God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The suggestion naturally arises to the mind that there was something about this “man of God” that is “profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works”. (2 Timothy 3:16,17) And it is so.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Jadan (if that was his name) has yet more to his credit in the story as it appears in the Scriptures in 1 Kings 13. lie refused to dine with a king, or even to enter his house, because he had been expressly instructed to that effect:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward. And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place: for so was it charged me by the word of [Jehovah], saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou earnest. So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Elisha acted similarly when Naaman, having been cleansed of his leprosy, w’anted to reward the prophet. Gehazi, Elisha's servant, viewed the matter differently, to the point of lying, and ran after the reward which Elisha would not have, saying that Elisha had sent him. When he returned Elisha asked him where he had been, and he lied again, saying he had not been anywhere. Elisha then said to Gehazi:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants ? The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although Jadan had been God’s messenger to Jeroboam, and had been the means by which his withered arm was restored, yet he was not to accept his hospitality, nor eat bread at his capital, nor drink water, nor even to go back by the same way he had come, but he was to go straight on his way. That is the way the true people of Jehovah God must do. Their work is to bear witness to Jehovah God, but not to fraternize with those who hate Him or who oppose His work or His people in the earth.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>Seduction by a False Prophet</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">Jadan was now about to be subjected to the test w’hich proved his undoing. He had successfully resisted the threats and the blandishments of the king Jeroboam, but he yielded to the wiles of the Devil in the person of one who falsely claimed to be, like himself, a prophet or spokesman of the Most High God. Manifestly, as the account shows, the tempter was “an old prophet”, inactive, resting on his past record of service, self-willed, not co-operating, and not acting in accordance with organization instructions, and was therefore a fit tool of the Devil. Being in Israel, he failed to reprove the king, and Jehovah sent a prophet from Judah to do what this “elder” should have done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the Icing, them they told also to their father. And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And he said unto liis sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass; and he rode thereon, and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that earnest from Judah? And he said, I am.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread. And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place: for it was said to me by the word of [Jehovah], Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou earnest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and am angel spake unto me by the word of [Jehovah], saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jadan Loses His Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the Devil’s lie to mother Eve cost her her life, so the lie of this false prophet cost Jadan his life. Instead of standing true and faithful by the Word of the Lord, the great Jehovah God, he permitted himself to be guided by the words of a liar, one of the false clergy of that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And does not the story which follows plainly show that one may be one of Jehovah’s people, and render faithful service under many and severe tests, and yet lose all because he takes the clergy or the elective elders at their estimate of themselves, and not at God’s estimate of them, and has fellowship with these works of darkness under the supposition that they are Christians, when, as a matter of fact, they are nothing of the sort?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water. And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of [Jehovah] came unto the prophet that brought him back [in the same unexpected manner that it came to Balaam when he was on his way to curse Israel] : and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith [Jehovah], Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of [Jehovah], and hast not kept the commandment which [Jehovah] thy God commanded thee, but earnest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of the which [Jehovah] did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy earcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back. And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him; and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>A Lion</span><span class="font9"> Was </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God’s Executioner</span></h4>
<p><span class="font7">And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carease: and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt. And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of [Jehovah] ; therefore [Jehovah] hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of [Jehovah], which he spake unto him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled him. And he went, and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass. And the prophet [showing considerable courage and perhaps feeling some contrition] took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And he laid his carcase in his own grave [showing that the end of a once faithful but thereafter disobedient servant is the same as that of the clergy of the Devil] ; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother 1 And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried: lay my bones beside his bones: for the saying which he cried by the word of [Jehovah] against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Prof. C. J. Cadoux, D.D., Mansfield College, Oxford, England, proves that the Roman Church itself officially approves the persecution of heretics. In one paragraph he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only was the Hierarchy virtually unanimous in approving of these severities, but the Pope, the official head of the Church, the Vicar of Christ, “the pastor and teacher of all Christians, ’ ’ repeatedly gave formal sanction to the use of them. It was even a General Council which in 1215 ordered Christian rulers to expel all heretics from their territories; it was Pope Gregory IX who in 1231 embodied in the Church’s code the imperial law condemning heretics to the stake; it was Pope Innocent IV who in 1252 ordered that torture was to be used; it was Pope Leo X who in 1520 solemnly condemned Luther’s statement that it was contrary to the wishes of the spirit that heretics should be burnt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">ONCE in a while someone writes in and says we ‘shouldn’t print such stuff’. They say we should not say the things we do about the Hierarchy, the hypocrites, thieves, international murderers, and other enemies of mankind. They say this is a good world, let’s make it better by soft, sweet speech. Anyone who has ever read the Bible knows that the Lord Jesus didn’t use any honeyed words on the hypocrites of His day, the scribes and Pharisees. They were crooks, and He knew it. Now, a magazine that has courage enough to tell the people the truth and expose this hypocritical organization, strip them clean of all their veneer and petticoat covering, has to be chided by some people who think we are too rough on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What is said in The GOLDEN AGE is not said to please people unless they want the truth. If what the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has done, and which has been exposed in the pages of The GOLDEN AGE, doesn’t make one's blood boil, it must be because that one has no love for righteousness. The GOLDEN AGE can't and won’t pussyfoot. It will not compromise. If the Hierarchy is right, why don’t they disprove the statements made? Why don’t they come out in the open and debate with Judge Rutherford. Two million, six hundred thousand persons requested such a debate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who are in favor of truth, liberty and justice are glad to see such “public enemies” exposed, so that honest people of good will may no longer support such an organization.

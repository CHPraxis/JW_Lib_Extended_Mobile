<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every namo and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH'S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall live on earth forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Blessed be the name of Jehovah from this time forth and for evermore.”—Ps. 113:2, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH is supreme. He is the Creator of heaven and earth, and the fullness thereof belongs to him. “Jehovah is high above all nations, and his glory-above the heavens. Who is like unto Jehovah our God, that hath his seat on high?’’ (Ps. 113:4,5, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.) </span><span class="font3">From the beginning his purpose is that all creation that lives shall praise his name and do so joyfully. That purpose is certain to be fulfilled. The faithful prophets of old wrote of that purpose. Jesus often emphasized the paramount importance of magnifying Jehovah’s name, and the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ frequently spoke of the supremacy of Jehovah’s name. But when so-called “followers of Christ Jesus’’ began to practice religion and called it “the Christian religion” they soon lost sight of the name of the Most High and of the supreme importance of magnifying his holy name. Religion has long been used selfishly for the temporal gain of man, and the name of Jehovah has been pushed aside and forgotten. During the time that Jesus, the great Messenger, was ‘preparing the way before the Lord’ many heard the truth then revealed, and most of them that accepted it did so by reason of a more or less selfish desire. What they first saw was that there is a chance to be saved and be taken to heaven to help the Lord rule the earth and to ‘ ‘ restore” the remainder of the human race. Many even assumed the position that God would forgive and save all men and give life to them whether they obeyed God or not. It must be remembered, however, that those persons were brought into the religious organizations and error was thoroughly instilled in the mind of each. Those who had lived in the organization of Babylon and who heard and accepted the truth came out of Babylon with their garments soiled, that is to say, they were still influenced much by the world and worldly desires and they followed worldly formalism and practices. There was ever before the mind of such the question: “What will the people think of me and the course I take?” And they tried to govern themselves accordingly, seeking the approval of men. To please men and to sing the praises of men, and to have others sing their own praise, was uppermost in the mind of many. When the great Messenger of Jehovah, Christ Jesus, came to the temple for judgment there were a large number of this selfish kind that stood before him awaiting judgment. Such were important in their own eyes, and hence felt qualified to have their own way and insisted on having their own way, and they continue to seek the praises of creatures and to give praise to man. At the same time there were others standing before the Lord Jesus for judgment and who had a different motive for their course of action. Their love was for Jehovah and the Lord Jesus Christ, and their desire was to serve and please the Lord. Although their garments were soiled by reason of what they had learned and practiced in the Babylonish institutions, their heart desire was to do the right thing. They had come out of Babylon with soiled garments that now must be taken away if the Lord found them in a perfect heart condition. The temple judgment made manifest the selfish and the unselfish ones, and only the latter withstood the test and were approved by the great Judge. These approved ones were made the “faithful and wise servant” class, but even they did not fully appreciate the importance of magnifying Jehovah’s name; but in due time at the temple the matter was made clear to them, and now, thanks be unto God, the faithful and true see that the name of Jehovah is the great issue and that his name shall be vindicated and that in due time every creature that breathes shall sing his praises. The Lord, by the temple judgment, therefore, makes clear the distinction between the selfish or “evil servant” class and the unselfish or “faithful and wise servant” class.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah by his prophet Malachi speaks of the paramount importance of his own great name, and he draws a sharp contrast between the unfaithful and the faithful priests. “For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts. But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the Lord is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible. ”-Mal. 1:11, 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> First Jehovah shows that his purpose is that all creatures who please him and live must praise his name, and the priestly class, being those selected as</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">a &quot;people for his name”, should be the first to praise his name, not only for a time, but at all times. &quot;From the rising of the sun even unto the going down” thereof means all the day long, that is, all the time, continuously. Therefore the name of Jehovah is great all the time, and all who ever receive life everlasting must come to see and acknowledge that fact and joyfully praise his holy name. All of the temple do now praise the name of Jehovah, as it is written: &quot;The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve, and dis-covereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.”—Ps. 29: 9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The decree of Jehovah is that his name &quot;shall be great” among the multitude without number, and those who are now coming into that company sing the praises of Jehovah’s name. Jehovah is now gathering the &quot;great multitude” from all nations, kindreds, peoples and tongues, and this he does in spite of those professing &quot;priests” who despise Jehovah’s name and his gracious work. Once these professed priests stood before the Lord at the temple judgment, but have now been cast away, and these attempt to interfere with the great multitude in learning of God’s gracious provision for them. In this they will not succeed, however.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> God declares that his name shall be great amongst the Gentiles. The great multitude are not spiritual Israelites, and hence they are Gentiles as this prophecy speaks of Gentiles. They hear of Jehovah's temple and his true worship there by the faithful remnant, and they voluntarily seek Jehovah and his King. &quot;Moreover, concerning a stranger [alien, foreigner] that is not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name’s sake: (for they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house: hear thou in heaven thy dwellingplace, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.”—1 Ki. 8:41-43.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>9</sup> This last-quoted text was a prayer of Solomon and was a prophecy directed of Jehovah and must have fulfillment, and the same is now having fulfillment. The great multitude coming out from all nations, kindreds and tongues is fulfilling this prophetic prayer, and these are coming, seeking the house of the Lord and praying toward his house. They are learning to praise Jehovah’s name. Concerning this same matter it is written by God’s prophet: &quot;And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising. Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side. Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged ; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces [riches (Leeser)] of the Gentiles shall come unto thee. . . . and I will glorify the house of my glory. ’ ’—Isa. 60: 3-5, 7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">’ The great multitude must be brought, and the Lord will bring them. While the faithful approved priestly class, the remnant, go forth and continuously offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness by continuously singing the praises of his name, the Lord is doing his work, &quot;his strange work,” and is gathering the great multitude. Those who come into the great multitude join with the priestly class in proclaiming the praises of Jehovah even now.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Mark that the prophecy says: &quot;In every place incense [sacrifice] shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering. ’ ’ The Hebrew for the word ‘ ‘ incense ’ ’ here used means &quot;a burning”, whether of animals or of perfume. Could it be lawful to offer incense to the name of Jehovah in every place by Gentiles, in view of the law of God, which required the priest to offer incense in the holy of the temple and on the golden censer? This question is made clear in the light of the Scriptures and what the Lord is now doing. It is written: &quot;The priests, the sons of Aaron, . . . are consecrated to burn incense.” (2 Chron. 26:18) The Hebrew for the phrase &quot;shall be offered”, as stated in the words of the prophecy (Mal. 1:11), means ‘to be brought near, or, to be made to approach, come near’. Therefore those among the Gentiles where Jehovah’s name is great do not act lawlessly and independently of Jehovah’s temple, but they do contribute or send their offerings to cause them to be brought to his temple to be burned upon his anointed altar by his anointed priesthood. During the past twenty years ‘this gospel of the kingdom has been preached’, and his servants continue to preach the same in all parts of the world for a witness to all nations, and within those nations the people of good will toward God come to the temple company with their pure offering, their unselfish devotion to God, and it is offered and the name of Jehovah is great amongst those of good will. (See Zechariah 8:20-23.) Therefore within the meaning of the prophecy the name of Jehovah is great among the great multitude, or people of good will, in every place where the offering of praise is made to Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The work of the Lord in which the remnant participate continues, and those of good will hear the truth and come to Zion to learn more of God’s purpose and to give praise to his name, while at the same time the so-called &quot;priests”, who have proved to be unfaithful, now oppose the work of bringing the truth by the witnesses of Jehovah, who magnify the name of Jehovah and point out to the people of good will their privilege of serving and praising him. The Lord God therefore tells these unfaithful &quot;priests” that they have enjoyed great privileges of serving him but have proved unfaithful, and now others of less privilege are seeking the way to his organization and are singing his praises. Says God through his prophet to these unfaithful priests: “But ye have profaned it [my name], in that ye say, The table of the Lord is polluted; and the fruit thereof [produced and placed upon the table by the Lord] ... is contemptible.’’ The facts now made known fully show the fulfillment of this part of the prophecy. At the beginning of the temple judgment there was a company of spirit-begotten Levites serving in the priest’s office, and who were moved by selfishness to so serve, and who magnified the name and teachings of a man, giving man credit and honor that properly belong to the Lord only. Doubtless at the beginning they were sincere in giving adulation to a man. Had they been unselfish and tried to know, they could easily have known that such a course of conduct is wrong. Opportunity was given them to know, but they rejected it. Because of their wrongful course of action they were not approved by the Lord at the temple, and now they continue to blindly follow the teachings of a man and laud and praise the name of a man, and bring a “blind’’ and “sick” and “lame’’ sacrifice unto tlie Lord, which is not acceptable unto him. Furthermore, they become embittered against the remnant w’ho do bear the message of the kingdom to the people of good will, and such opposing and embittered “priests’’ attempt to ‘turn the stranger away from his right’, by inducing those of good will to decline to associate with Jehovah’s witnesses. Because of the wrongful conduct of these unfaithful “priests’’ God says he is against them tor the reason that they turn the stranger away from his right.—Mal. 3: 5.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> To be sure, those unfaithful men called “priests”, and who at one time were of the priestly class, would be horrified, or at least appear to be, to say to one another or to others the words here uttered: “The table of the Lord is polluted ’ ’; but by their course of conduct they have said and continue to say louder than by uttered words that “the table of the Lord is polluted; and ... his meat is contemptible”. Such is exactly their attitude toward the publications of the Watch Tower. Is the Lord feeding his people upon food which he causes the Watch Tower to publish? If so, then those who oppose </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The W-atch-tozver</span><span class="font3"> and speak with words of scorn and contempt of what is therein contained speak against the Lord’s table. The Jonadabs who now engage in the proclamation of the kingdom message put to open shame those unfaithful “priests”, who were adversely judged at the temple and who now oppose the kingdom message. Jehovah’s name has become great amongst those now entering the “great multitude” company, and they sing the praises of the name of Jehovah and his King, declaring that salvation is of God and of the Lamb that sitteth upon the throne. At the same time these unfaithful “priests” attempt to turn the “strangers”, or the Jonadabs or great multitude, away from their right, which right is a knowledge of Jehovah and the privilege of serving him. Jehu pictured the true and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">faithful Priest, and he said to Jonadab: “Come . . . , and see my zeal for Jehovah.” The opposing ones above mentioned have no part with those pictured by Jehu. The Jonadabs today show more zeal for the name of Jehovah than those who have professed to be the followers of Christ Jesus and who were once of the priestly class. With these opposers the name of Jehovah is not great, and they make no effort to have a part in the vindication of his name, but, together with the religionists, heap ignominy upon his name. Furthermore, they say that the food that the Lord has put upon his table for his people is contemptible, and thus insult the Lord. The modern-day Pharisees, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, are hypocrites and are doomed to complete and everlasting destruction. Concerning the “evil servant” class, those once in line for the kingdom and who are now unfaithful and are opposing God’s kingdom, the Lord says: “And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”—Matt. 24:51. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Let the Jonadabs now take warning from tiie words of Jehovah and keep out of reach of those who oppose the kingdom work, and who at one time were “priests” but who are now the enemies of God. To those unfaithful ones, the “evil servant” class, Jehovah further says through his prophet Malachi: “Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the Lord of hosts: and ye brought [for sacrifice] that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand ? saith the Lord. ’ ’—Mal. 1:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> To those unfaithful ones the privilege of serving God by bringing the fruits of the kingdom before others, as the Lord has commanded, has become only a tiresome ceremony and formality, which offers them no opportunity to shine in the eyes of men. The carrying of the kingdom message from house to house in printed form, and presenting this to the people, is too humiliating for such self-important ones. They find no joy in it, and they have no desire nor do they make any effort to magnify Jehovah’s name by making known his kingdom message. They have never ‘entered into the joy of the Lord’ because they do not see that Jehovah’s name must be vindicated. Therefore they have said, and continue to say: “This carrying books about is merely a book-selling scheme. What a wearisome task that is!” They once had an opportunity of doing good, but they grew weary in well doing. (Gal. 6:9) They turned wholly to selfishness and were pushed away into darkness. Blindly they go about their own way of serving the Lord, and this they do by opposing the faithful servants of the Lord who carry his message to the people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Those of the “elective elder” stripe and their adherents have done service work by distributing the truth publications, but in doing it they “have snuffed at it, saith the Lord of hosts”. Snuffing scornfully at the witness work, speaking contemptuously of it, they have considered themselves justified in being careless of the witness work, and that carelessness has led them into willful opposition to God’s witness work. For this reason the Lord, by his angels, gathers them out of the temple and casts them into darkness. (Matt. 13: 41) Continuing the prophet says to them, the unfaithful ones: “And ye brought [for sacrifice] that which was torn [that which was taken by violence (B.F.) ; that is, stolen goods].’’ They have brought something that did not represent self-denial on their part, but something that would bring them into prominence and exalt them and that would bring no reproach upon them as men. They had no love for God, but desired to shine and be honored of men. In order to carry out their desires and course of conduct such men have lorded it over others and bossed them and deprived them of their real ministry. It appears at times that one appointed as a servant of a company becomes impressed with his own importance and begins to boss his brethren and to seek to draw away followers after hirr If, and thus to deprive the real ones of their opportunity of witnessing to the Lord.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> Furthermore the prophet says that these have brought as a sacrifice that which is “lame” and “sick”. Trying to please Satan’s organization and to receive plaudits therefrom, at the same time they still assume to be servants of God. Being spiritually sick and blind to God’s purpose, they continue in the attitude of claiming to be his servants, but they seek the approval of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ They have failed to obey God’s commandment directed to the priesthood: “And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean.” (Ezek. 44:23) It is the duty and obligation of those who serve God in truth and in sincerity to call attention to these things. For that reason the proper application of these scriptures must now be told. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> observes the opposers attempting to steal away the people of good will and to turn them out of the way; and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> must cry out and spare not, because such is the commandment of the Lord. (Isa. 58:1) There is no expectation now of doing any good to the “evil servant” class, but the publication of such warning is for the benefit of those who have turned their hearts to the Lord, that they may keep away from the evil ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’’Jehovah then puts the question squarely to the unfaithful priests: “Should I accept this of your hand?” The “evil servant” has thought to deceive, but the Lord cannot be deceived. Jehovah then answers his own question put to the “evil servant” class and says: “But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen. ’ ’—Mal. 1:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">” Those who were faithful to the Lord are not deceived. The onlooker may get the wrong impression, and hence the warning is for such. It is written: “God is not mocked”; and therefore the unfaithful “priest”, who attempts it, is cursed of Jehovah, as this prophecy states. The “deceiver” is a hypocrite, who puts stumbling blocks in the way of those who are faithfully endeavoring to serve God, and thus the deceiver shows contempt for Jehovah and for his name. The unfaithful defames Jehovah’s name and furnishes an argument for Satan that men will not maintain their integrity toward God when put under the test. (Job 1: 9-11) Such unfaithful “priests” are lawless, disloyal, covenant-breakers, and are cheats and frauds. Their course of action is a gross insult to Jehovah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Could any person who understands and loves Jehovah treat the Most High with such contempt? The Lord answers that in the negative and says for the good of all who will hear: “For I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.” Jehovah is “The King of Eternity”, the Supreme One, the Most High above all, and the One to whom every soul must be subject if he would live. Jehovah, particularly since 1914, is King, having then placed his anointed One, Christ Jesus, as his vicegerent upon the throne of Zion to rule. (Pss. 2:6; 97:1) When the faithful remnant of natural Israel returned from Babylon in 536 B.C., they had no king of the tribe of Judah reigning over them. Jehovah was the King of the faithful, even though the Persian ruler claimed the land of Palestine. When Jehovah’s faithful remnant were delivered from Babylon after 1918, they had no earthly king or ruler over them but Jehovah was, and is, the great King, and his royal palace is his temple, of which Christ Jesus is the Head, and he is ruling according to the will of the Most High. The “evil servant” class, the murmurers and complainers, do not fear God. They have not appreciated his statement, “My name is dreadful [terrible (R.P.)] among the heathen.” But many who claim to serve Jehovah do not fear and do not honor his name. “Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. 0 worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth. Say among the heathen, that the Lord reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.”—Ps. 96:8-10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> This command is to all who fear his name and who love and serve him, and none other will live. “Dreadful” is the name of Jehovah, particularly since the “seven vials” of the ‘seven last plagues of the wrath of God’ have been poured out, in the period of time from 1922 to 1928, as stated in Revelation sixteen. The warning notice has been given and served upon the rulers of this world, and even they are terrified by what they have heard, yet the “evil servant” manifests no fear of God. Those of the Jonadab company now learn of Jehovah, and they fear his holy name and prove it by their course of conduct. To the unfaithful ones, the “evil servant’’, Jehovah says: “Where is my fear? saith the Lord of hosts unto you, 0 priests, that despise my name.’’—Vs. 6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S CHARGE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> The sons of Levi through Aaron the high priest were the priests of natural Israel. Those priests foreshadowed the consecrated serving in the priestly office at the time the Lord appears at the temple for judgment. Other Levites performed other service before the Lord. In 1918 the Lord Jesus, the great Judge, appeared at the temple for judgment, and a command or charge is directed to those serving in the priest’s office in particular: “And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.” (Mal. 2:1) What, then, is the charge or command here given to the priests? There was need of cleaning up the sons of Levi, both priests and other servants, and the Lord Jesus began his judgment of cleansing and purifying the sons of Levi at his appearing at the temple, to the end that those who were able to “abide” that day and to come through the fiery operation might be assigned to the duty of offering unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Although the Lord appeared at the temple in 1918, his coming was not known and proclaimed until 1922, and the purifying judgment of the sons of Levi proves from the facts to have been accomplished first by 1932. The commandment or charge given to the antitypical priests needed to be heeded and applied unto the cleansing of the sanctuary and thereafter. The test upon the “sons of Levi” began with the beginning of judgment in 1918, whether they had knowledge of the Lord’s presence at the temple or not. The motive or heart condition of such there began to be tested. It was the time for those who had made a covenant to do the will of God to cease giving honor to men and to cease raising their own “lightning rods”, inviting others to give honor to them. The time had come for them to give all honor and glory to the name of Jehovah God. Hence the necessity for the charge and for the cleansing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> The presumption would follow that there would be a class of professed priests who were not giving heed io and obeying the charge. This presumption necessarily flows from the language of the commandment itself. Said the Lord to the priests: “If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the Lord of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings; yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart. ’ ’—Mal. 2: 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> This commandment showed that at least a part of the priests were moved by selfishness and that they would not successfully weather the day of testing. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> of January 1, 1923, began to give prominence to the necessity of magnifying and vindicating Jehovah’s name. At least from that time on there could be no excuse offered by those who had access to Jehovah’s table to disregard the name of Jehovah and to continue to laud the name of man. From that time on, at least, all serving in the priest’s office must give heed by setting their hearts upon Jehovah’s name as worthy of all their love, honor and glory. As the consecrated began to learn of the purpose of Jehovah to make glorious his name, and that he had taken out of the world a people for his name, who must give testimony concerning his name, all coming to the knowledge of these great truths must give glory unto the name of Jehovah God and cease bestowing adulation, honor, glory and praise upon men. In order to obey this commandment those servants in the priest's office must correct the abuses and practices of which they were guilty and into which error they had led others. Formalism, assumed sanctimoniousness, the attitude of ‘more holy than thou’, seeking the honor of men, and giving glory to men, and all things of that nature, must be put away. Only honesty, sincerity and full devotion to the Lord could be pleasing to him. The approved ones must bring an offering worthy of the name of Jehovah and which would take away the contempt for his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> In the Babylonish systems the name of Jehovah is defamed and the name of man exalted. Among those of the Lord’s organization on earth there was, particularly at the beginning of the temple judgment, a strong disposition to follow many things that they had learned in the religious organizations from which they had come out. Such formalism must now be put away, because the time had come for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, which must be accompanied by the delivery of true testimony throughout the earth to the honor of Jehovah’s name. No more should the teachings of any man be praised and followed. If'that man had taught the truth, follow and continue therein, but give the honor and glory and power to the Lord, to whom glory belongs. The Lord of hosts had given command, the day of battle is at hand, and the command of the Mighty One must be obeyed. Those who had been moved by an honest and sincere desire to do whatsoever is the will of God gladly obeyed the commandment to give honor to the name of Jehovah, and continue to obey. Others, who give no heed to the commandment, what shall the Lord do unto them ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> The hosts of Jehovah, led by Christ Jesus accompanied by all his holy angels, are now at the temple to execute the judgment of the Lord, and all are commanded to give heed and obedience to whatsoever they are directed by the Lord to do. The curse would be upon those who would fail or refuse to obey the commandment. “Saith the Lord of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you.” The particular ones addressed here are those once in line for the kingdom and who at the time of judgment are found to be unfaithful, and who subsequently are assigned to the “evil servant” class. The curse of the Lord is upon them at once when judgment takes place at the temple, and by their course of conduct they show that God’s curse is upon them. The prophetic truths revealed by the Lord at the temple are a blessing to the faithful servants, but these same truths become a curse to the unfaithful, and thus their ‘blessings have been cursed’ even now. This is true because the truth was placed before them which would result in their blessing, and by their refusal to give heed thereto the truth operates as a curse. Others, who are not of the “evil servant” class but who are guilty of shortcomings, carelessness and indifference to their duties, need to be warned that God will curse their blessings if they do not mend their course of conduct and render full devotion to the Lord and show real care and dependability on their part in looking after the kingdom interests committed to their hands. All who receive his approval must lay the warning to heart. Their “good intentions” furnish no excuse for failure to perform. The Lord requires faithfulness on the part of his servants, and that means that where the servant fails or refuses to faithfully perform his God-given commission, he shows that he is unworthy of the blessings of Jehovah. The commandments of the Lord are, to him, of the greatest importance, and the faithful will look well to the performance of the obligations laid upon him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> Jehovah’s dealings with natural Israel were prophetic. The complete fulfillment of his prophetic utterances is upon spiritual Israel, that is, those who are in a covenant with God to do his will. Further describing the curse that should come upon them Jehovah says: “Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts, and one shall take you away with it.” —Mal. 2:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>26</sup> This prophecy, according to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Version,</span><span class="font3"> reads: “I will rebuke your seed, and will spread dung upon your faces.” Such a curse God literally visited on natural Israel, as stated in the prophecy of Haggai 1:6-11 and 2:16,17. Jehovah declared his purpose to bring upon them the curse, and this he would do by withholding the rain to sprout the seed of their crops, so that their crops would not be brought to maturity for harvest. If the rains came and the crops grew, Jehovah would send hail or pests to devour their crops, and the result would be shortage of food. Now the Devil, who is a mimic god, brings more woes and distress upon the people in general by sending pests, such as storms to destroy the crops, and floods and pests to bring havoc upon the people, and then the Devil causes his clergymen to charge these calamities and disasters up to Jehovah. It should be kept in mind that Jehovah sent the curse upon his covenant people Israel, and such was a prophecy of what shall come upon the unfaithful spiritual Israelites. The calamities and woes that come upon the people of earth today emanate from the Devil. God’s great calamity upon all the world will be that which he will bring to pass at Armageddon. The prophecy of Malachi here uttered applies to the unfaithful priestly class of spiritual Israel, who suffer for want of spiritual nourishment and sustenance. Because of their selfishness those unfaithful ones cannot receive and feed upon the blessings of truth that the Lord provides as spiritual food for his own. Such truths, to the unfaithful, are nauseating. They take offense at the same and, having no sustaining spiritual food, they die spiritually. The warning is here given in order that those who will hear and give heed and turn their hearts wholly to Jehovah, and serve him, may be revived, come fully into God’s favor, and live. To God’s covenant people these words are addressed: “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a woik-man that necdeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.” (2 Tim. 2:15) One who studies to show himself to be approved of man is going contrary to the Lord’s admonition, because that which is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God. The positive commandment, therefore, is to study to show oneself approved “unto God”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> Now concerning that part of the prophecy, ‘ ‘ I will . . . spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts”; “and ye shall be taken away with it. ’ ’ The man appointed to drag the dead carcass outside of the camp was considered unclean and required to purify himself. (Lev. 16:27,28) In line with that provision of the law Jehovah states what his curse will be upon the unfaithful ones.. The judgment of God would bring upon them a disgraceful death and a dishonorable burial by spreading upon their faces the foul excrement of animals or the refuse of sacrifices, which must be burned without the camp. The one assigned to drag such refuse out of the temple must take it through the dung gate and dump it into the incinerator of Gehenna, thus fortelling the fate of the “evil servant” class. This part of the prophecy shows that the unfaithful priests are punished by complete annihilation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> The expressed purpose of Jehovah is that none of the priestly class shall have excuse for professed ignorance. Therefore God says to the unfaithful priesthood: “And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the Lord of hosts.” (Mal. 2:4) The faithful servants of the Lord “know”, because they have been given the truth and joyfully received the same. The unfaithful might have known, had they exercised ordinary diligence. The “covenant of the priesthood” was made plain in the publication of the book named </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font3"> and those who received the message therein, which the Lord provided, have rejoiced to put forth their best endeavors to fulfill their covenant. God’s purpose is that the covenant must continue to be performed by the faithful. They must show their devotion to him by the performance of their covenant continuously. The Levites, as a tribe, stood on Jehovah’s side on the occasion of the ‘golden calf’ incident at Mount Sinai. (Ex. 32:25-29) Prior to that time Aaron and his sons, who were Levites, were chosen and appointed to be priests. When Aaron and his sons ministered in the priest’s office, they must wear the holy, priestly garments. These statutory requirements Jehovah made for ever to observe, and they must be observed and obeyed by Aaron and his sons, and all who follow in the priestly office thereafter. (Ex. 27: 21; 28:1-43) Jehovah’s covenant with Levi, and which is inclusive of all thereafter of Levi, is shown in this provision of God’s law: Numbers 1:1,47-53. The Levites were charged with the duty of keeping the tabernacle. This constituted the covenant with all the tribe; and the Levites, having on a previous occasion, as above cited, openly declared themselves on the side of Jehovah, and having vowed to be his servants, were fully consecrated to the Lord. They were given to the high priest as his servants, according to Jehovah’s covenant with them. (Num. 3: 6-12; 8:1-26; 18: 6) The Lord Jesus, as Jehovah’s great Messenger and Judge, at the temple reveals to the antitypical priesthood these truths concerning the covenants, and now there is no excuse for them to fail or refuse to know and to obey the commandments of the Lord. In the prophecy Jehovah expressly mentions this covenant, saying: “My covenant was with him [Levi] of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name. ’ ’—Mal. 2: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> Jehovah, in addressing Aaron the high priest, at Numbers 18:1,19, expressly referred to this covenant. Phinehas, the son of Aaron the high priest, on an occasion showed his zeal for Jehovah and his covenant, and concerning this Jehovah said: “Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy. Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace: and he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.’’—Num. 25:11-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>80</sup> Just preceding his death Moses blessed the tribe of Levi and, speaking as the messenger of Jehovah, said: “And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.... And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one [the house of Levi], whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; . . . for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant. They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.” (Dcut. 33:1-10) True to his covenant Jehovah permitted the Levites to live and fill office down to the day of John the Baptist, who was a Levite.—Luke 1: 5-13, 57-80.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>81</sup> God keeps his covenants and changes not: “For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.” (Mal. 3:6) In this last prophecy “Jacob” includes the tribe of Levi. Said the Lord then concerning Phinehas: “I give unto him my covenant of peace.” That covenant denoted continuance in the priest’s office. (Num. 25:12,13) The father of John the Baptist was an active priest in the temple of Jerusalem. Peace implies safety, welfare and prosperity. No greater honor could be given to a Levite than to be the forerunner and announcer of Jehovah’s beloved Son and Servant, Christ Jesus, and that this honor was given to John the Baptist shows the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promise concerning that priesthood. (Matt. 11:11) Note, therefore, that the antitypical “sons of Levi”, meaning all those consecrated and wholly devoted to God, are promised the peace of God, glory, honor, immortality and life everlasting for them.—Rom. 2: 6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> The antitypical sons of Levi of this day, who are Jehovah’s witnesses, his remnant, sent forth to declare his name, like John the Baptist, now announce and advertise Jehovah’s anointed King, Christ Jesus, and his kingdom. The covenant with them is the covenant “of life and peace”, and these fear Jehovah and stand in awe of his name, and continue to obey his commandment by declaring his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>38</sup> Jehovah gave the tribe of Levi the service of his holy tabernacle as priests and Levites, and, says Jehovah by his prophet, this He did ‘<sup>1</sup> for the fear wherewith he feared me ’ ’. The Levites feared God, and this is shown by them at Mount Sinai, when they took their stand on the side of Jehovah and then acted as executioners of those who had turned to the Devil worship. (Ex. 32:25-28) Later Phinehas showed a like fear by zealously serving Jehovah as the executioner of the unfaithful. This foreshadows the antitypieal Levites acting fearlessly and boldly in declaring God’s judgments upon those who become unfaithful, and furthermore shows the obligation laid upon them to so declare God’s judgments. It is not their prerogative to do any actual slaying, but they must make known Jehovah’s judgments. (Isa. 58:1) Such is the reason why </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> should now publish these truths, that there might be no excuse for ignorance concerning the same, and hence no excuse for negligence by those who are serving as antitypical priests. Note now how the mimic god, Satan, and his ministers have perverted the truth of God’s Word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>34</sup> The Jesuits and others of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, attempting to justify their wrongful course of action, have counterfeited the provision of God’s law and greatly perverted the same, and have used it as an excuse and justification for their murder of so-called “heretics”. By “heretics” they mean all who do not bow to the Hierarchy. Thus the priests of the Devil, acting in the name of Christ, have brought great reproach upon the name of Jehovah. They assume that one who is not wholly and faithfully devoted to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is unfaithful to the Lord and they are justified in slaying him. Those devilish Jesuit priests of the “man of sin’’ crowd do not show any fear of God. Likewise the “evil servant’’ class do not show that they are “afraid before my name’’, saith the Lord. On the contrary, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy priests and their allies oppose Jehovah and his work done by his witnesses. The prophecy, therefore, shows the end of such opposers and persecutors with certain and complete destruction. If anyone professes to be the follower of Christ Jesus, and finds himself disposed to oppose the work of Jehovah and the Lord Jesus Christ and his servants in proclaiming the name of Jehovah and his kingdom, let him beware. This prophecy is notice to such. They that follow that course will find their fate pronounced by the Lord Jesus concerning the goats.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE TRUE WITNESSES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>85</sup> The prophecy then directs attention to Jehovah’s “faithful and true’’ witnesses. This prophecy applies primarily, of course, to Christ Jesus. Says the prophet: “The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.” —Mal. 2:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>86</sup> The Lord Jesus Christ is the great High Priest and Head of the antitypical priesthood. (Heb. 3:1) As Jehovah’s servant he spoke out boldly and plainly and published God’s law and denounced the counterfeit law of the religious organization that defamed Jehovah’s name. He openly showed that God’s law is supreme and far above the law of man-made governments or institutions, even as it had been commanded by Jehovah: “They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.”—Deut. 33:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>87</sup> The prophecy of Malachi here describes Christ Jesus as Jehovah’s great High Priest, the Greater than Moses or than Aaron. All true and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are necessarily included in this description; and that means also the faithful remnant now on the earth. “Iniquity,” that is, disloyalty or lawlessness and perversion, “was not found in his lips.” Christ Jesus upheld the law of Jehovah. His faithful apostles did likewise. The same must be true today with regard to the faithful remnant who, in the face of the cruel opposition by selfish “elective elders” and other opposers, such as the modern Pharisees, the strong-arm squad, magistrate courts and others, continue the service. The faithful witnesses of Jehovah must and will continue to boldly declare God’s purpose, regardless of such opposition. They have been commanded by the Lord, and by his grace they will obey his commandments. (Isa. 43:10-12; Ezek. 9:4; Matt. 24:14) These faithful ones may expect now to encounter much opposition; and, being a part of the priesthood, they will go courageously on making proclamation of the kingdom message, which God has commanded them to do. His law and his truth are in the mouth of such witnesses, and unrighteousness shall not be upon their lips.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>88</sup> Further speaking of Jesus Christ the great High Priest, the prophecy says: “He walked with me in peace and equity </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[(Hebrezvs)</span><span class="font3"> level; a plain; concord; justice].” Christ Jesus sought to establish peace, unity and order among God’s people. He denounced pride, and hypocrisy, and inequality. He taught honesty, uprightness and sincerity, and he “did turn many away from iniquity [that is, lawlessness and the crooked way] ”. When Christ Jesus appeared at the temple he turned the “faithful servant” class away from lawlessness, perverseness and crookedness, and those who were not thus turned away were disapproved. (Mal. 3:2, 3) Now the remnant, as the faithful antitypical sons of Levi whom the great Refiner at the temple has purified, turn others in the right way by proclaiming the plain truths of God’s Word in their presence and hearing, and thus they show those who will form the “great multitude” how they may escape the wrath of God and find refuge in bis organization and under his protection. (Joshua 20; Jas. 5:19, 20) “And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever. ’ ’ —Dan. 12: 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RELIGION AND CHRISTIANITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>88</sup> Jesus Christ, the great High Priest of Jehovah, made a clear distinction between religion and the law of God. He showed that religion is the product of the Devil, because it is contrary to God’s commandment and is practiced by professional hypocrites. “Tradition” is a precept which is taught by men and is contrary to God’s law, and therefore from the Devil. Everything brought forth to deceive and turn Hie people away from Jehovah proceeds from the Devil. The truth of God’s Word is often perverted to accomplish this wrongful purpose of the enemy. Jehovah describes the teachers of tradition as those who draw near to him with their mouths but their hearts are iar removed from him; whose wisdom and tradition shall perish. (Isa. 29:13,14) The Pharisees were of that class of teachers or clergymen who followed tradition and disregarded the commandments of God, and who were hypocrites. The religionists of this day are in the same class. They induce the people to believe that Christianity and religion are one and the same thing, whereas “Christianity” means to observe and practice the truths which Christ Jesus taught and which truths he received from Jehovah God; whereas “religion” means the observance and practice of that which is taught by men contrary to the Word of God and which emanates from the Devil. There is no such thing as “the Christian religion”. There is that which is called “the Christian religion”; but that is a misnomer. No Christian could be a religionist. The Pharisees propounded this question to Jesus: “Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?” The answer of Jesus given plainly and directly to that question is conclusive proof that religion emanates from the Devil and the hidden purpose thereof is to bring reproach upon the name of Jehovah God. “But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother; and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death. But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; and honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites! well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”—Matt. 15:3-9.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>40</sup> Those Pharisees did not honor God their Father by their covenant, nor their “mother”, God’s organization; but for their own selfish reason and purpose they taught exactly contrary to God’s commandment, and for this Jesus denounced them as hypocrites. The religionists of the present day do the same thing. The teachings of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy are based upon the teachings or traditions of men, and not upon the Word of God. The well-known writers of the Catholic doctrines cite the tradition of the “fathers” as authority for their doctrines and pervert the Scriptures in an effort to sustain the teachings of tradition. In a book written and published by the late James Cardinal Gibbons, bearing the title </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Faith of Our Fathers,</span><span class="font3"> he relies chiefly upon the tradition of the “fathers” to sustain doctrines therein taught, and which are held and taught by the Catholic Hierarchy. Concerning the doctrine of “purgatory”, the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy which nets the greatest amount of revenue to that organization of hypocritical priests, Cardinal Gibbons says: “This interpretation is not mine. It is the unanimous voice of the Fathers of Christendom. And who are they that have removed the time-honored landmarks of Christian faith by rejecting the doctrine of purgatory? They are discontented churchmen impatient of the religious yoke.” He further says: “The same motive which you have for rejecting the opinion of an ignorant politician and embracing that of eminent jurists, on a constitutional question, impels you to cast aside the novelties of religious innovators and to follow the unanimous sentiments of the Fathers in reference to the subject of purgatory. ... I would wish to place before you extended extracts from the writings of the early Fathers of the Church bearing upon this subject; but I must content myself with quoting a few of the most prominent lights of primitive Christianity. ’ ’ Then Cardinal Gibbons names and quotes from the following so-called “fathers” of Christianity, to wit, Tertullian, Eusebius, Cyril, Ephrem, Ambrose and others, and adds: “You see that praying for the dead . . . was ... an act of religion preached and inculcated by all the great Doctors and Fathers of the Church, who are the recognized expounders of the Christian religion.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Faith of Our Fathers, </span><span class="font3">page 208 and following.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>41</sup> All the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy are based on the same authority, that is, the teachings of the men in the early days of that organization and designated as “fathers in the church”, and their doctrines are wholly unsupported by the Bible. In this respect the Pharisees and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy teachers are exactly in the same position. They disregard the commandments of God and pervert the law and teachings of God and of Christ Jesus, in an effort to sustain the teachings of the early ‘ ‘ fathers ’ ’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>42</sup> It is interesting to note here that the apostle Paul was once a Pharisee, but by the grace of tne Lord he reformed and became a zealous preacher of the truth. As a Pharisee Paul followed and taught, as he stated, the Jewish “religion,” which was based upon the tradition of the fathers. After the Lord had made Paul an apostle, Paul wrote to the Galatians and said: ‘ ‘ For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it: and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.” —Gal. 1:13,14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>43</sup> Here the apostle makes the clear distinction between Christianity and the traditions of the fathers, which tradition was the basis for the Jewish religion. True Christianity is the Word of God, as taught by Christ Jesus; whereas religion is the tradition taught by men. That the religion of the Pharisees or “Jews’ religion” was a perversion of the truth, and hence from the Devil, is further shown by the apostle’s word, to wit: ' ‘ Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.”—Col. 2: 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy falsely claims that the apostle Peter was the first pope and that the popes following thereafter are his truly divine successors; which doctrine is also supported only by the tradition of the fathers. Peter himself takes an exactly contrary position and shows that the teachings of the fathers were vain and contrary to God’s Word: “Knowing</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">that ye were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers.” (1 Pet. 1:18,R.V.) The apostle Peter there definitely states that the tradition of the fathers was vain and contrary to God’s Word. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has followed the same vain traditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>45</sup> Concerning those who followed the tradition of their fathers and who taught and practiced the Jewish religion, which clearly emanates from the Devil, it is written: “Jesus said unto them, If God were ycur Father, ye would love me; for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.”—John 8: 42-44.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>46</sup> The ancient Pharisees and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy teachers, who are the modern Pharisees, are therefore clearly in the same class, and both are anti-God and anti-kingdom. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy falsely claims that that man-made Devil-originated institution constitutes God’s kingdom, and therefore the Hierarchy refuses to enter the kingdom of God under Christ and uses all manner of methods to keep others out; and concerning such the Lord Jesus says: ‘ ‘ But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.” (Matt. 23:13) The modern Pharisees, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, use every possible means of wrongdoing to proselyte or bring into their own organization, and under their control, all kinds of people; and concerning this Jesus says: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. . . . Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of hell ? ’ ’—Matt. 23:15, 31-33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>47</sup> Such thing as the “Christian religion” does not and never did exist. The name “Christian religion” is a perversion and a defamation of the name of Jesus and of Jehovah God. Its teachings and practices of formality are exactly contrary to the Word of God, and hence proceed from the Devil. Christianity is that which is taught by Christ Jesus in full obedience to the law and commandment of Almighty God. The ancient Pharisees persecuted Jesus unto death because he taught the truth of God’s Word. The modernday Pharisees, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies who practice religion, likewise persecute Jehovah’s witnesses, the true followers of Christ Jesus, and seek to bring about their death. Christ Jesus was in complete disrepute and disgrace with the ancient Pharisees. The true followers of Christ Jesus today, who are Jehovah’s witnesses, are in complete disrepute and disgrace in the eyes of all religionists and all of the Devil’s crowd. Thus the true and faithful servant class are privileged to suffer with Christ Jesus, even as he suffered, and all who are the witnesses of Jehovah suffer together, all being in disgrace and disrepute and hated by the religionists because they proclaim tho name and kingdom of Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>48</sup> In this connection, referring to the prophecy of Malachi 2:6, it is clearly seen that Christ Jesus and his true followers speak the truth. The law of truth is in the mouth of Christ Jesus and his faithful followers. Iniquity is not found in them; but the teachers of religion and all who oppose the kingdom message brand themselves as the enemies of God and of Christ. This specifically applies to the “evil servant” class, who had full opportunity to know better and to take the right course, but which class has wholly failed to profit by what the Lord gave them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DUTY OF THE PRIESTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>48</sup> Jehovah announced what is the duty of those who are in line for the kingdom and who are therefore of the priestly order. He directs his prophet to write: “For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law [of Jehovah] at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.” (Mal. 2:7) The remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses must keep their lips continually, and at all times they must be ready to speak when opportunity offers, and tell the truth of and concerning God and his kingdom. Jehovah instructed those who covenant to serve him, saying: “And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the Lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.” tLev. 10:11) This commandment applies more emphatically to the antitypical priesthood. They must speak boldly the truth of God’s Word and against the perversion thereof. This they accomplish by spreading the knowledge of the truth abroad in printed form; which they are doing now.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>50</sup> Further says the prophet: “And they [meaning all who are on Jehovah’s side] should seek the law [of God, and not the traditions of men] at his mouth.” The priestly class must obey God’s law and must make it known to others who will hear, because Jehovah sends them forth as his messengers to declare his Word and his name. As John the Baptist was the messenger of God sent forth to make announcement of God’s purpose to send Christ Jesus, so the remnant of God’s priestly class are now sent forth to declare Jehovah, his King and his kingdom. John the Baptist was killed because he declared God’s law to King Herod and to other practitioners of the Jewish religion. Herod was a proselyte to the Jewish religion and practiced that hypocritical formality. (Mark 6:14-29) Christ Jesus is the great Messenger of Jehovah, who prepared the way before the Lord and then straightway appeared at the temple. (Mal. 3:1) For this reason Jesus repeatedly spoke of himself as the Messenger of Jehovah and spoke of Jehovah as “Him that sent me”. Christ Jesus at the temple now sends forth the remnant, even as he declared concerning his disciples: “As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.” (John 17:18) “Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.” (John 20:21) The remnant are sent forth as the witnesses of Jehovah directly under the command of the Lord Jesus Christ. Christ Jesus has gathered his faithful followers into the temple, and in the secret place he informs them; and what they there receive they must go out and proclaim openly and boldly. (Matt. 10:27) In so doing, according to the commandments given them, the remnant come near to God, their Father, and to his organization, their “mother”, and of which organization Christ Jesus is Head and next to the Father; and all this is done by Christ Jesus and his faithful followers in the name of and for the sake of the name of Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>PROSPERITY UNDER GOD’S KINGDOM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">O</span><span class="font3">NE of the great benefits that will result to the people under the Lord’s government will be its administration for the general welfare of all. As an example: The radio belongs to God. He provided it for man and brought it to light at the proper time to announce his kingdom. Now the selfish interests would control the radio and use it entirely for selfish purposes. God will see to it in his due time that all the people shall hear the truth, and he will use the radio as one of the means of informing them. His lightnings will carry his truth and lead the people in the right way. (Job 38:35; Ps. 43:3) The Lord will judge the people with his truth, and therefore they must know the truth; and he will use his own good way which he has provided, to bring the truth to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Earth,” as used in the Scriptures, symbolically represents the visible organization of God’s kingdom on earth. “Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.” (Ps. 85:11) God made the earth for man. (Isa. 45:12,18) He put the electricity in the earth and around the earth for the benefit of the general welfare of the people. That power that is in the waves of the sea belongs to the Lord, for “the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof”. (Ps. 24:1) Use of the radio has been brought to light for the general welfare of the people. (Dan. 12:4) The power of the ocean waves will operate the great machines that have been invented, and others that will be invented, and will produce the electricity that will light all the homes, provide the heat for fuel for all the homes and the power to operate all the necessary machines in the homes and upon the farms. The people will pay a small and reasonable tax merely to cover the necessary cost of operation, but no one will be permitted to reap a selfish profit therefrom, because none will be permitted to oppress or hurt in all that holy kingdom. That will be one of the great benefits to the people.—Isa. 11: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If a small percent of the taxes now paid by the people of the United States were used to build great highways and improve the water-power, the country would soon be wonderfully developed and there would be no men hunting for work. Suppose a great highway should be built from ocean to ocean ■ power lines paralleling boulevards; in the center part provision made for railways or rapid transit; on either side wide boulevards for heavy motor trucks; outside of this, and adjoining on either side, wide boulevards for pleasure cars; and beside each of these, and on the outside, footpaths for those who desire to walk; along the entire system of the highway, and at intervals of every few miles, lodgings provided wherein the people could find rest and comfort and food at a minimum cost. Such an arrangement would be a great benefit to the people. The Lord will do that and much more. All the wealth and all the power in the hand of the righteous Ruler will be used for the general welfare. Then there will be no men and women seeking employment that they might earn their bread. No heavy burdens will be laid upon anyone. Not only will the government be operated for the general welfare, but the Lord will look down with righteousness upon the earth, and truth will spring forth from amongst the people. “Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase. Righteousness shall go before him, and shall set us in the way of his steps.’’—Ps. 85:11-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord’s government will carry on a great reconstruction work for the general welfare of the people. He will restore the waste lands and make the places that once were desolate blossom like the rose and bring forth in abundance. The people will feel secure in their property, in their lives, and in their liberties; and all will learn to do right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Solomon was king over the Jews his reign was marked by great prosperity, contentment, and joy among the people. Palestine is a small country, and at that time there were many people in that land. God had promised Israel to bless them abundantly if they would obey him, and under Solomon’s reign he was doing it. (1 Ki. 4:1, 20) The government of Solomon foreshadowed the righteous government of God’s righteous Son. Solomon’s rule therefore foreshadowed the reality, that under Messiah’s rule there would be great prosperity, contentment and joy among the people. The ruler or governor brings honor upon himself, and properly so, when he looks to the general welfare of all the people. This rule is stated by the Lord: “In the multitude of people is the king’s honour: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince.” (Prov. 14:28) In harmony with this, Jesus stated: “And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.” (John 12:32) With absolute certainty we may know that under his righteous government the peoples’ interests will be protected and the benefits of that government will extend to all mankind. The blessings which God promised to Israel if obedient will be multiplied to all the nations of the earth. —Deut. 15: 4-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It must be apparent to all sober-minded persons that in a country like the United States, where there is so great an abundance of material wealth, there must be something radically wrong when more than ten million persons cannot find work by which they can earn their bread. That unhappy condition is enhanced when it is considered that at the same time millions of dollars daily change hands by those who gamble on the products and labors of others. The United States is cited as an example because these things are actually going on and because without a doubt the United States is the most favored land and government on earth. Under the righteous government of Jehovah and his King all the people will have an opportunity to work and will be required to work. Gambling in stocks will not be permitted. Work is a blessing to man and brings much pleasure when he can enjoy the fruits of his work. Work becomes irksome and laborious when man toils under adverse conditions and then has his earnings unjustly taken away from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Under God’s government the people “shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble”. (Isa. 65:23) They will all enjoy the fruits of their work. Thorns and thistles have long encumbered the ground and made it difficult for man to obtain a good yield from the soil. The Lord will show man how to remove these hindrances, that his crops may be raised in abundance.—Isa. 55:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Famine has been one of the great enemies of man under Satan’s reign. There will be no famines when God’s government is in full sway in the earth. “Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us. ’ ’—Ps. 67: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is quite the rule obtaining in present evil governments that those who govern do not suffer from famine, but have plenty. The prophet describes these: “And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered. ’ ’—Mal. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Conditions will be entirely different when the righteous One has full sway and exercises it. Then the people will have plenty and will rejoice. “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked bcarcth rule, the people mourn.” (Prov. 29:2) With the production and distribution of food and raiment carried on in justice and righteousness the people will be contented and happy. “And in this [government] shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. ’ ’—Isa. 25: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The health of the people is of very great importance. If all the people eould have health, that would be a great benefit to them. The present governments take some steps to safeguard the health of the public, but in so doing the people are exploited. Many who claim to serve the sick connive at making even the well sick that they may be able to reap pecuniary gain therefrom. Foods are adulterated to such an extent that much sickness results therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Under the Lord’s righteous government the people will be taught what is proper to eat and how to eat it; they will be taught proper sanitary conditions, how to sleep and exercise, and no one will be permitted to deceive them. They will be told the truth; and knowing that they are receiving the truth, they will be encouraged and benefited and will progress rapidly. God will eure the sick that they may remain well. He says: “There shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away.’’ (Rev. 21:4) “And [then] the inhabitant shall not [any more] say, I am sick.’’—Isa. 33:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Strength of mind and body will be another lasting benefit which the people will receive and enjoy under God’s righteous government. There are many who are now literally blind and who are blind also to the truth. “Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened” and “the blind shall see out of obscurity”. (Isa. 35:5; 29: IS) God would have these precious truths told to the people now, that they may gather strength therefrom.—Isa. 35: 3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who are obedient to the law of God are assured that they will receive strength, because “the way of the Lord is strength to the upright”. (Prov. 10:29) The old, sick and decrepit man will grow strong if he will hear and obey the righteous Ruler. The great Interpreter of the truth and righteousness is God's Anointed One, Christ his King. He is the Messenger that will bring truth and peace to the people at Jehovah’s command. All men will be brought to an exact knowledge of the truth, and particularly that truth that Jehovah is God and that Jesus Christ gave his life that men might live. Then hearing and obeying the truth, man will benefit thereby and will be restored to the days of his youth. (Job 33: 25) By the mouth of all his holy prophets God declared that under the righteous reign of his Beloved the King he will fully bless with strength of human perfection all men who will obey him and his Christ, his Vindicator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CAN SEE THE GREAT MULTITUDE COMING</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">My heart is so filled with joy because of my experiences in the service today (Sunday) that I must tell you; for I know that your heart also will be made happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I invited a Spanish lady whom I met here, and who is reading, to get into the chariot and go with me today. There were only a few houses in the Spanish settlement that I had not called on; so I drove there. She said, &quot;No, no! Let us not work here. I lived in this neighborhood. They are all Catholics belonging to the Penitente branch. They hang some of their members on a cross from Good Friday until the following Sunday. If they die, they pass immediately into heaven. If they survive, they are reveienced as saints. They all hate me because I quit the church, and it won’t do any good to go to them.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I assured her that they must be given the witness, whether they hear or forbear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first witness resulted in leaving a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches;</span><span class="font2"> the next, a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> and three booklets; the next, three booklets; the next, a bound book; and so on. We made fourteen calls, placing ten books and thirteen booklets, with twelve obtainers, and took orders from the. other two. Very few are now attending services, and my companion was truly astounded!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This afternoon we called on Spanish people with whom I had previously placed literature, giving them lectures on the portable. We found some reading their books, and they were so glad for the lectures. The priest had warned them not to buy the Bibles and books, and told them they should give their money to the hospital fund! He charges two dollars apiece for baptizing their babies, and they realize they have been &quot;held up’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I, for one, can see the great multitude coming, washing their robes, and beginning to wave their palm branches before Earth’s New King. The Protestants, so called, are prejudiced and indifferent. The Catholic people as a class are more hungry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I surely am rejoicing in the marvelous light from the temple. The light concerning the Gibeonites thrills my soul; and words fail to express the joy of heart to behold them coming in their tattered and dust-covered garments, their wine bottles empty, their bread moldy and stale, but asking for the bread from heaven! We are happy because the Greater Joshua is making a covenant of peace with them, which the great Jehovah will respect and will preserve them alive in the day of his fierce anger. It is my prayer that we may never lack courage to meet them and to assist them in making their covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I thank you, Brother Rutherford, for your example of unwavering loyalty and devotion, and, as an instrument in the hands of our Teachers, for pointing us to the many promises that our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us and will smite the enemy <sup>1</sup> ‘ from Gibeon even to Gazer ’ ’. May he speed the day!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Joyfully yours,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall live on earth forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW PORTABLE PHONOGRAPH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society now manufactures and has to offer a light-weight phonograph of new design, which is 14 by 13 by 5 inches in size, and covered with brown cloth a.nd having rounded corneis. It weighs 9 pounds 13 ounces, which is 5} pounds lighter than the previous mode) manufactured by the Society. With the three phonograph dises which can be carried in it, it weighs 12 pounds 6 ounces. The volume of sound is just as strong as that of the previous model, and the tone is of the best quality. As shipped out from our factory, the phonogtaph is timed properly, at 78 r.p.m., and should be checked from time to time. This new model, including three discs, is offered on a contribution of $10.00; without the three discs, $8.00. Remittance should accompany orders. Also specify the particular discs wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ADVERTISING WATCH TOWER PROGRAMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Witnessing parties and all individuals engaging in the field service should mention the radio station in their vicinity which carries the Watch Tower programs. This magnifies to the people called upon the message which Jehovah’s witnesses introduce, and often results in interest in the printed message on the part of the radio listener. This is one of the chief purposes of sending out the message over the radio, to encourage the people to read the literature. In this behalf the Society supplies radio folders, and all workers should make </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">constant</span><span class="font3"> use of them in house-to-house calling, leaving one of them, if nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TRANSCRIPTION MACHINES AND SOUND CARS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society constructs and assembles portable transcription machines at our own factory at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N. Y. These machines are spring-wound, and operated from a 6-volt wet-cell battery. Every machine is furnished complete with the battery and a battery charger, so that it can be kept up to its full strength. This machine can be offered at $100, complete, to brethren in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The sound car equipment includes the above and, additionally, a power amplifier and a horn with mountings for the top of your car. The entire sound car equipment with microphone attachment can be had for $175. Write to the Society for details.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>&quot;SONG OF THE HARLOT”</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten: make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.”—Isa. 23:16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH, by his prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel, foretells the rising of a religious organization which claims to represent God on the earth but which, in fact, is at all times consorting with and acting for Satan to bring reproach upon the name of the Almighty God. Jehovah’s organization is revealed under the symbol of a good woman called Zion, which gives birth to those who are the devoted and faithful children of God. (Isa. 54:1-13) Satan, the wicked one, has an organization, which is symbolized by a wicked woman and named in the Scriptures ‘Babylon, the old whore’, and which organization gives birth to all creatures that are in opposition to Jehovah God. All things earthly of Satan’s organization properly take the name of his woman Babylon, which is their mother. The chief element of Satan’s organization is religion, which Satan employs to corrupt earthly creatures and to make them a part of his visible organization. In the Scriptures “organized religion” is designated as the “harlot” because of the use to which the organization is put.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> “Harlot” is properly defined as a female committing adultery or fornication indiscriminately. In the Hebrew the word is used as applying to things spiritual, that is to say, going after idols, the committing of idolatry, thereby departing from the true worship of Jehovah God and engaging in religion or the worship of various wicked deities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> That part of the prophecy here specifically considered relates to Tyre. Before discussing in detail the prophecy of the twenty-third chapter of Isaiah it is well to observe some other parts of prophecy which throw light on the subject matter under consideration. Some persons have lodged objection to the manner of treating prophecy in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> complaining that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoicer</span><span class="font4"> repeats. This may be answered fully by saying that Jehovah often repeats, or causes to be said, the same words many times, and without a doubt he has a purpose in so doing. In the prophecy of Ezekiel he uses 64 times one phrase: They shall “know that I am Jehovah”. It should be kept in mind that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is not published to appeal to the fancy of critics, nor to please men. It does not attempt to please creatures, because such is an abomination in the sight of God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> aims to present a study to enable real students of God’s Word to get a better insight into the prophecy under consideration. At certain intervals in such study it is necessary to repeat something that has been said, in order to emphasize the point. Students of God’s Word who are really devoted to him and love him will appreciate this. The critics never appreciate anything.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Satan the Devil is designated in prophecy as ‘ ‘ the king of Tyrus” or Tyre. (Ezek. 28:12) The visible ruler of the city bearing that name was merely, as the Scriptures state, “the prince of Tyre.” (Ezek. 28:2, A.If.V.) Satan rebelled against Jehovah and therefore departed from the true faith toward God that he, Satan, might traffic in humankind. To do that Satan employed religion. Satan began by telling doctrinal lies respecting Jehovah God, hence religious lies, and these constitute the main stock in trade of all religions, and which doctrinal lies are uttered by the word and authority of the Devil and not on the authority of the Word of Jehovah God. Satan introduced his lying doctrines to Eve when he said: “Ye shall not surely die; for God [as you, Eve, call him] doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened; and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.”— Gen. 3:4,5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Eve desired religion, and the Devil saw to it that her desire was fulfilled. She wanted Adam and herself to become mighty ones, ‘ ‘ as gods, ’ ’ and not be limited to knowing just Jehovah God’s word. She wanted her ‘eyes opened’ and to ‘know good and evil’. The mere worship of God by obedience to him was made to appear as extreme and too much in restraint of the liberty of Eve and Adam. As “gods” they would not be restrained, but would be independent and hence not subject to the “higher power”. Then they could do what seemed right in their own eyes, even to compromising between “good and evil”. That was the first introduction of religion to mankind. Thus Satan, “the king of Tyrus,” created and used religion as the means of gaining control of and commercializing the human race. Therefore God said to the Devil, “the king of Tyrus”: “By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, 0 covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee.” (Ezek. 28:16,17) The practice of religion had its beginning with Adam and Eve. Thereby they expressed the selfish desire to have that which their Creator had not given to them. The Devil’s purpose in introducing religion was to alienate the devotion of man from God; and this is conclusive proof that the Devil is the author and father of all religion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">’Adam’s son Abel was never religious, because he was fully obedient to and received the approval of God the Creator. At the beginning the children of Adam were not commercial. Then Cain began to practice religion, in this, that he adopted a form of worship, but without faith in God. He had no love for God, nor for the true worship of God. He brought unto God an offering, for which offering God had no respect. Cain was not ‘doing well’, and said Jehovah to him: “Sin lieth at the door.” (Gen. 4:3-7) Then followed the great crime of murder committed by Cain, and which was induced by religion. Since then religion and murder have gone hand in hand. There never has been a war but that the religionists attempted to bless the warring factions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ Politics and commerce or trade were quickly developed through religion, and this for selfish gain. Cain built a city and named it for his son Enoch, meaning “dedicated [to selfishness]”. Then the grandson of Cain became “an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron”, which were and are commercialized and used for military purposes. (Gen. 4: 8-22) Due to religious practices in defiance of Jehovah God the human race became frightfully degenerate. The flood came and destroyed all practitioners of religion. Noah and his household remained true to Jehovah God, and they were the only survivors of the great deluge. Noah was “a preacher of righteousness”, but never a religionist.—2 Pet. 2: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> In obedience to God’s commandment Noah and his sons, following the flood, began to “multiply and replenish the earth”. (Gen. 9:1) Soon after the flood religion again came prominently to the fore. Nimrod, the great-grandson of Noah, became the visible religious leader, and ‘he began to be a mighty hunter before the Lord’. That was the practice of religion, because it put Nimrod, a creature, “before” or superior to God, the Creator, and it was a religion to all of Nimrod’s admirers and supporters. The purpose was to turn creatures away from Jehovah. With Nimrod religion began to be practiced after the flood. After religion politics was quickly employed and the political rule by Nimrod the religionist began. “And the beginning of his kingdom [political rule] was Babel.” Then commerce quickly developed, which is evidenced by Nimrod and his sons’ building cities and bringing together many people, which again required traffic amongst them.—Gen. 10: 8-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>B</sup> The building of the city and tower of Babel was induced by religion, and this is clearly shown by the language of the builders. “And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.” (Gen. 11:4) Babel, Babil, and Babylon, all meaning the same thing (Gen. 10:10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin),</span><span class="font4"> from the beginning stood for religion, politics and commerce, because the very express purpose was to turn men away from God in defiance of his commandment. The name Nimrod means rebel or rebellious one that rules. He named the beginning of his political kingdom </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Babel, </span><span class="font4">which meant to him and his followers “the gate to god”; therefore a religion. In defiance of the religious aspect of this organization the Almighty God interfered and brought about the confusion of tongues or language, and therefore the Hebrew word for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Babel </span><span class="font4">means “confusion”. Religions have always brought confusion to the people. The word “Babylon” means the same as “Babel”. The deity or one worshiped by that people was “Bel” or “Baal”, which means the Devil, the covetous one. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy,</span><span class="font4"> pages 127, 128, and the scriptures there cited.) This is further proof that religion is the product of the Devil. Politics and commerce, added to religion, form the elements of Satan’s organization. Jehovah God, by his prophet Ezekiel, designates Babylon as “a city of merchants”, “a land of traffic” or commerce.—Ezek. 17: 4,12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> The fact that Jehovah named Satan the Devil “the king of Tyrus” and said to the Devil, “By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence,” is conclusive proof that the city of Tyre or Tyrus stands for or symbolizes the Devil’s organization, which is made up of religion (the chief element or binding tie), politics, and traffic or commerce. All these things, recorded in the Word of God, were written aforetime for the aid and comfort of those persons now on the earth who love and serve Jehovah God as he has commanded; and for this reason a careful study of the Scriptures, together with the physical facts well known to be true, will result in much benefit to those who diligently seek for knowledge and understanding. The publication of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is for the purpose of aiding in such true and faithful study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> Referring now to the foregoing Scriptural definition of “harlot”: What religious system exactly fits the prophecies recorded in God’s Word? There is but one answer, and that is, The Roman Catholic Church organization. It is a religious organization. It claims to be the mother of the “Christian religion”, so called. All other religious organizations that take the name “Christian religion” are the offspring of the Roman Catholic organization, and therefore all are a part of Babylon. No one will even attempt to dispute the fact of the relationship of all so-called “Christian religions ’ ’ to the Catholic church organization. The Roman Catholic organization is ruled by the Hierarchy, and that organization indulges and participates in the political affairs of all the nations of earth. The Roman Catholic church is also a great commercial organization. It contains all the elements of the religious organization which began with Nimrod and of which the Devil is the father. This must not be construed to mean that all the people who are dominated by the Roman Catholic organization, or who support the same, are the willing servants of the Devil. Great numbers of them have been misled and woefully deceived. The millions of people who hold to the Catholic church organization, aside from the clergy, are designated as “the Catholic population”. Great numbers of these people are sincere, and it appears to be the Lord’s will to now give them an opportunity to see the truth and take their stand on the side of God and righteousness. Those credulous people have been deceived, and it now seems to be due time to afford them the opportunity to learn the truth and give their devotion to Jehovah God and receive his blessings. Nothing herein must be construed as an expression of ill will toward individuals or persons. The purpose of this publication is to expose the Devil’s deceitful methods in order that honest and sincere persons may escape his clutches and find the way to life and happiness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> It will be seen that the prophecy concerning Tyre applies to the Roman Catholic religious system. Zidon, being a neighbor city, pictured other religions that consort with and operate with the Roman Catholic organization. The term ‘ ‘ Christendom ” is a word applying to those countries or nations wherein the so-called “Christian religion” is practiced. All religious systems called “Christian religion” properly take the name of the mother harlot; therefore the terms Babylon and Tyre apply to the lands known as “Christendom”. Zidon, having been built before Tyre, would well picture other religions practiced prior to the beginning of the Roman Catholic, and which co-operate with the Roman Catholic organization. With this introductory a detailed examination of the prophecy appearing at the 23d chapter of Isaiah proceeds, and those who really love Gpd will pursue this study with a keen interest and, it is to be hoped, with much profit. If repetitions appear at different places you will see that such repetitions arc necessary in order to drive home the point.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BURDEN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The prophecy of the 23d chapter of Isaiah is introduced with the words “The burden of Tyre”. That means something heavy to be borne by ancient Tyre and foreshadows a greater burden to be borne by modern Tyre. It will be seen that the prophecy applies in a miniature way to ancient Tyre and that it applies on a far greater scale to the Roman Catholic religious system and in that system its fulfillment in completion appears. God has his own way to conceal the meaning of a prophecy until his due time to reveal it to those who love him. It often appears that the prophecy is recorded in the inverse order, that is to say, that which applies to the fulfillment of the prophecy in completion appears in the record first, while that which applies first appears in the divine record last. At this point it seems well to examine some historical facts as they appear in the Bible and which relate to ancient Tyre and the cities associated with her.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> Zidon was a sister city of ancient Tyre. Men who built cities immediately following the flood named them for their sons, as it appears: “Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were sons born after the flood. . . . And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, . . . And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comcst to Gerar, unto Gaza : as thou gocst unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.”—Gen. 10:1-6, 8,15-19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> From the Scriptures it appears that Nimrod was a granduncle to the Zidonians and also to the Tyrians. Both cities practiced the religion which the Devil promulgated. It is written: “Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians” (1 Ki. 11:5) ; also, “the gods of Zidon.” (Judg. 10:6) Zidonians’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">religion</span><span class="font4"> dates practically from the same time of the building of Babel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Tyre was built by the descendants of Canaan, the cursed one. (Gen. 9:25) The Hebrew word for “Tyre” is “Tsore”, and means “rock”. The city was built on a rock island, like a point in the sea, a short distance from the mainland of Phoenicia. It became a worldimportant center of commerce or traffic upon the seas. Doubtless the Devil chose this place, a rock, on which to build Tyre, in mockery or as a mimic of Jehovah God’s organization to rule, which is built upon the rock, Christ Jesus, taken out from Jehovah’s universal organization, Jehovah himself being the Great Rock.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> The first mention of Tyre is at Joshua 19:29, wherein it is called “the strong city”. It was included in the territory assigned to the tribe of Asher of the people of Israel. (Josh. 19:24-31) Both Zidon and Tyre maintained religious temples wherein they practiced the Devil religion and where they invoked the demon gods to bless their commercial traffic. (Joel 3:4, 5) The Devil was the invisible “king of Tyrus”, and the spiritual father of the visible ruler of the ancient city, which city was ruled by the representative of the Devil. That representative is called “the prince of Tyrus”. (Ezek. 28:2,12) Note that the ‘ ‘ prince of Tyre ’ ’ said: “ I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas [hence, as a sea god].” Also note that Jehovah said to him: “Thou art a man, and not God.”—Ezek. 28: 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The Devil had said of himself: ‘ ‘ I will be like the Most High” (Isa. 14:13,14) ; and thus he declared himself to be equal to the Almighty God Jehovah. Satan the Devil is designated in the Scriptures ‘ ‘ the god of this world”, that is, the invisible, spiritual ruler. ‘‘The prince of Tyre,” therefore, prophetically pictures the visible representative of the Devil, who claims to be a god. Such a claim is made by the head of the Roman Catholic religious organization. The pope of Rome, or the Roman Catholic organization, is designated by the Hierarchy a god, as it is stated in history. A Roman Catholic authority, Ferraris’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ecclesiastical Dictionary,</span><span class="font4"> says: ‘‘The pope is of such dignity and highness that he is not simply a man, but, as it were, God, and the vicar of God. . . . Hence the pope is crowned with a triple crown, as king of heaven, of earth and of hell. . . . Whatsoever the pope does seems to proceed from the mouth of God. . . . The pope is, as it were, God on earth, the only prince of the faithful of Christ, . . . The pope can sometimes counteract the divine law.”—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font4"> Vol. 2, page 310.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> While this high-sounding claim is made by the Roman Catholic organization for the pope, mark that it does not say for what god he is the representative on earth. The fact is, he is the representative of ‘‘the god of this world”, whom the Scriptures show is the Devil. (2 Cor. 4:4) It is quite certain that the sincere ones of the ‘ ‘ Catholic population ’ ’ would not willingly class any creature as equal to Jehovah, the Almighty God. They have been deceived and misled.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2O</sup>‘The Devil has caused the people to be very superstitious or religious. Paul came in contact with the people of Athens who were practicing the Devil religion in ignorance of the fact that they were paying homage to the Devil. To them Paul said: ‘‘Men of Athens, in all things I perceive that ye are very religious.” (Acts 17:22-29, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> Another translator renders the text in this wise: ‘‘How . . . reverent of the demons ye are, I perceive.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font4"> ‘‘Men of Athens, I perceive that you are in every respect remarkably religious.” (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth)</span><span class="font4"> This is further corroborative proof that religion is of the Devil and is in exact and complete opposition to the commandment of Almighty God. ‘‘The man of sin” practices religion, acting contrary to the commandments of God. “That man of sin ... , the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped ; so that he, as God, sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. Even him whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish ; because they received not the love of the truth [the very opposite of religion is the truth], that they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie [religious teaching].” (2 Thess. 2:3,4,9-11) That company of persons forming or composing the “man of sin” rely on the teachings of men, or tradition, which make void the Word of God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> Ancient Tyre, as shown by the Scriptures, did in fact control the commerce of the sea. “The sea” symbolically stands for the people that bear up and give support to the Devil’s religious organization. Therefore Tyre pictures religion commercialized, that is to say, religious doctrines and ceremonies and superstitions used for commercial purposes for the enrichment of a few at the expense of the credulous people, who are kept in subjection and under control. Religion traffics in humankind, selling the gullible and credulous people to the professional politicians and militarists. The religious institution known as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy claims that the head of that organization is infallible and can spiritually do no wrong, and yet it uses and practices religion and religious ceremonies to commercially gain material wealth and to control the people. Its subjects, that is, the “Catholic population”, must worship the religious institution, and at the same time those people are forced to contribute or pay money for the up-keep of the institution. “Organized Christianity” or “organized religion”, so called, is generally understood to embrace the Roman Catholic Church, the Greek Orthodox Church, and the Protestant church; but the Roman Catholic organization claims to be the original church, the mother of the so-called “Christian religion”. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the ruling power of “Christian religion”, so called, is the modern ‘ ‘ prince of Tyrus ’ ’, the members of the Hierarchy even giving themselves the title “the princes of the church”. Modem Tyre, therefore, is organized religion, visibly ruling the people under its father the invisible ruler, “the king of Tyrus,” who is the Devil. Jesus gave this plain statement concerning the practitioners of religion founded upon tradition.—John 8:44.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> Today Protestantism is dead so far as the protest against the practitioners of Catholicism is concerned, and the Protestant clergy, together with the rabbis of the Jewish religious organization, follow the lead of the Roman Catholic organization and act in harmony therewith. All such practice religion, of which the Devil is the author. Ancient Tyre was an opponent of Jerusalem, God’s typical organization. Modern Tyre is the enemy and opponent of the true spiritual Israelites, God’s people on the earth.—Ezek. 26: 2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“SHIPS”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> Says Jehovah by his prophet: “Howl, ye ships of Tarshish.” (Isa. 23:1) Ships are vessels, implements or instruments, such as used by ancient Tyre to carry on their commerce and trade upon the seas, and to establish colonies in the lands round about, to be used for commercial purposes. Also its religion was thus carried and spread to other places in the earth. Tarshish appears to have been one of the colonies of ancient Tyre where traffic was carried on. Tarshish was built at the far end of the Mediterranean sea opposite from Tyre and in the land since known as Spain: ‘ ‘ Tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches: with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in thy fairs.” (Ezek. 27:12) Her ships or vessels would carry the merchandise in which she trafficked. As a greedy enemy of Jerusalem it appears that Tyre used the ships under its control to carry on a slave trade: “Yea, and what have ye to do with me, 0 Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon your own head: because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things: the children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border.”—Joel 3:4-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> Applying the prophecy to modern Tyre, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization, the ships of Tarshish well picture the underpriests and subordinate organizations working under the command of the ruling Hierarchy, which is designated “The Hierarchy of Jurisdiction”. The underpricsts or orders underneath the Hierarchy, such as missionaries, Jesuits and others, are sent to all parts of the earth by the ‘ ‘ Hierarchy of Jurisdiction” to perform the more direct work with the people, which is called “missionary work”, and to commercialize the people and carry on a commercial work or trade in gathering in money for the upkeep and support of the Hierarchy. The monks, Jesuits, missionaries, priests, and all like agents work under the command or direction of the ‘ ‘ Hierarchy of Jurisdiction”, and thus such are in symbol represented as “mariners” of the sea, and the “wise men” are the pilots directing the movement of these symbolic ships: ‘ ‘ The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners: thy wise men, 0 Tyrus, that were in thee, were thy pilots. ’ ’—Ezek. 27: 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> Such vessels or instruments of the Hierarchy are used to hoodwink the common people and to deal with them and to keep them in slavery to the ruling power of the organization. Such underlings do the work of manipulating the common people or so-called “Catholic population”, who pay the bills, and the “Hierarchy of Jurisdiction” reaps the commercial benefits. In his book entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Faith of Our Fathers,</span><span class="font4"> published at the beginning of the twentieth century, Cardinal Gibbons says: “The number of Catholics in the world is computed at three hundred millions.” (Page 10) The claim is now made that there are more than 20,000,000 of the “Catholic population” in the United States. Such constitute that which is symbolically designated “the sea”, who bear up and support the organization and the work of gathering the ‘ ‘ Catholic population” under the organization, and collecting the revenue from them is done chiefly by the underlings or underpriests, which vessels or “ships” ride upon the sea.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> A Catholic priest known as “Anthony, O.M.C.”, operating from Kentucky, sent out a letter to the credulous and superstitious believers in the false “purgatory” doctrine of the Catholic religion, which letter is dated Louisville, Kentucky, September 21, 1936. That letter calls upon the credulous ones in these words, to discharge ‘your duty towards your dear departed who, helpless in their purgatory prison, crave the relief only Masses and Prayers can bring them. . . . Your offering will help to complete the Purgatorial Purse’. Attached to that letter is a paper or blank to be filled out and signed by all receiving it, setting forth the amount of money contributed for the purgatorial purse, and on that paper appear these words: “It is suggested that you send or pledge an offering of 25c for each name listed.” The paper or slip contains space for more than twenty names. Many of the “Catholic population” will contribute a much larger sum than that suggested. But suppose each one contributes 25c; that, according to the number of Catholics in the United States, would mean five million dollars, and, according to Cardinal Gibbons’ estimate of the number in the world, would be more than fifty million American dollars annually. A very unique commercial scheme. It has been well said that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the richest in material wealth of any institution on earth. Religion, commercialized, is truly the Devil’s scheme, and God declares it so.—Ezek. 28:16-18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“HOWL”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> The word “howl”, as appears in the prophecy, clearly shows that a great calamity will come upon modern Tyre, that is, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization. A howl means a wail of great distress or despair. When is that howl to begin ? From the Scriptures it seems certain that the complete fulfillment of this prophecy is at the beginning of Armageddon, that is, the beginning of the “strange act” of the Almighty God. (Isa. 28:21) The reason for this conclusion is stated, as follows: It appears that Jehovah caused his prophecy to be here recorded in a manner to conceal the meaning thereof until his due time for the understanding to be given to his people. In the prophecy here under consideration the command to howl is recorded in the prophecy before mention is made of the “seventy years” and the singing of “the song of the harlot” set forth in verses fifteen and sixteen. That does not mean, however, that in the complete fulfillment of the prophecy the howling must precede the seventy years, nor that the howling must continue for a period of seventy years either before or after.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> As an example of how Jehovah causes prophecy to be recorded and revealed, attention is called to the drama of Ahab and Jezebel, both of whom were slain before the seventy sons of Ahab and also before the worshipers of Baal were slain; but not so in the complete fulfillment of that prophetic picture. The fulfillment shows the acts last recorded picture that which was first fulfilled. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> Book Three, pages 41-53.) The prophecy of the “seventy years” mentioned by Isaiah in 23:15 corresponds with a like prophecy of seventy years prophesied by Jeremiah. (Jeremiah 25) What is there described as coming to pass at the end of seventy years, is actually fulfilled in completion at the same time as that which is described as due to occur before the seventy years began. Attention is called to this here merely to show that the prophecy at verses 1-14 is not necessarily fulfilled before that part of the prophecy mentioned here in verses 15-17 in Isaiah 23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> Some time after the destruction of ancient Jerusalem in B.C. 606 Nebuchadnezzar laid siege to and seriously damaged ancient Tyre. There was then some howling. (Ezek. 29:18) “For thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.” (Ezek. 26:7) “Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the Lord, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations. ... To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day. . . . And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea.” (Jer. 25:9-35) This great distress mentioned by the prophets above quoted clearly applies to Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> In the year 1848 distress came upon the Roman Catholic organization, also in 1870, and continued more or less until 1918; but such as then occurred could in no way compare with what will come to pass at Armageddon. The snarling or howling that took place in those years could in no way compare with the howl that will go up when Jehovah lays waste modern Tyre. When Jehovah, by his prophet, says, “Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it [Tyre] is laid waste,” when that comes to pass, such will cause modern Tyre to really howl. That howl will come when the Greatcr-than-Nebuehadnezzar, Christ Jesus, the Executor of Jehovah’s purposes, the Mighty Warrior, goes into action at the beginning of Armageddon. It is true that there was an attempt by world powers in 1848 and 1870 to lay waste the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization, but that did not succeed. The permanent laying to waste will be such as to produce a mighty howl, and that will be at the beginning of Jehovah's “strange act”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> It is the command of Jehovah given to the ships of Tarshish to “howl, . . . for it [Tyre] is laid waste, so that [in Tyre] there is no house, no entering in”. According to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font4"> the text is rendered thus: “For it is laid too waste to be a haven to enter.” In other words, there is no haven to enter Tyre, because Tyre is destroyed. The howl is because incoming ships or vessels of Tarshish, laden with merchandise, could find no berth nor wharf nor warehouse in which to put the merchandise intended for Tyre. Such is due to the fact that Tyre and her once favorable position in commerce and intercourse with other countries are ruined and the markets thereof wrecked. This is further proof that ‘the prince of Tyrus is a man, and not a god’. (Ezek. 28:9) It will then clearly appear that the text often misquoted, to wit, ‘The gates of hell cannot prevail against it,’ has no application whatsoever to the Roman Catholic church organization, but that such Scripture text has been wrongfully applied by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to deceive the people and has resulted in deception and great injury to the people. No more will the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization carry on its work of ‘compassing sea and land to make proselytes for hell’ (Matt. 23:15), because the modern Tyre will be done. That of necessity will come about by reason of the “strange act” of Jehovah in completely destroying modern Tyre, which is the Roman Catholic organization, so that none can seek her or enter her thereafter.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> The land of Cyprus, or island sometimes called “Chittim”, was northeast of Tyre. It was originally colonized by the Phoenicians from Tyre and Zidon. Says the prophet of God: “No entering in: from the land of Chittim [Cyprus </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)].”</span><span class="font4"> Paul sailed from Zidon “under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary”. (Acts 27:4) It w<sup>r</sup>as a near-by colony, dependent upon Tyre. Says the prophet Isaiah: “It is revealed to them.” This would mean that the ships of Tarshish were bound for Tyre and laden with commerce and, while putting in at the port of Chittim or Cyprus, learned of the desolation of Tyre and that their ships were out of a job because Tyre is done for. The report of the fact shakes greatly the dependent colony. In this connection the prophet of God says: “Thus saith the Lord God to Tyrus, Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee ? Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.” (Ezek. 26:15,18) “All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their countenance. The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt be any more.”—Ezek. 27: 35, 36.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>M</sup> Applying this part of the prophecy to modern Tyre, the Roman Catholic organization, as it properly applies, it will be seen that all who have depended upon the Roman Catholic organization, all who have had dealings with the Hierarchy for selfish gain, either political or commercial or otherwise, will be greatly grieved and shaken. For many years that religious organization has boastfully said: ‘The gates of hell shall never prevail against us, ’ and now not only will those seeing it go down be shocked, but to them it will appear very strange that such a calamity could come to an organization that claimed to represent God. This indicates that at the very beginning of Armageddon the religious organizations as such will perish and others seeing it will wail. “And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and lament over thee, saying, What city is like Tyrus, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?” (Ezek. 27: 32) “The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing, and saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls! For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off, and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city! And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.”—Rev. 18:15-19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> Religion has been a means employed by the Devil to build his mighty organization on earth, which has deceived millions, and religion and religionists, according to the prophecies of God, will be the first of Satan’s organization to be destroyed at the beginning of Armageddon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DUMFOUNDED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> Jehovah, by his prophet, then addresses the supporters of Tyre, both ancient and modern, in these words: “Be still [silent </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(margin'),</span><span class="font4"> dumb (Rot/i.)], ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.” (Isa. 23:2) This silence or dumbness is because of Jehovah's “strange-act” then begun. Hany credulous and gullible persons, and particularly the politicians and commercial giants, now look to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the modern Tyre, to pull them through their difficulties; but when they see Jehovah strike down that organization, which has claimed to be invulnerable, they will be greatly astonished and dumfounded. Then in distress they will say, according to God’s prophet: “We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble!” (Jer. 8:14, 15) The words of Isaiah’s prophecy here considered, to wit, “ye inhabitants of the isle” (vs. 2), manifestly means in the final fulfillment those near the Hierarchy and who have been looking to the Hierarchy for help, protection and safety, even as Chittim or Cyprus was near to Tyre and depended upon Tyre. Those close or near-by and dependent upon the main organization, being of the same stripe, picture the Jewish and Protestant clergy and other allies of the Hierarchy who tag along behind the Hierarchy at the present time to do the bidding of the old “whore”. (Ezek. 27:8) They have helped to replenish the coffers of the Hierarchy, and hence Jehovah’s “strange act” is against not only Tyre but the Zidonians and other allies, as he declares in his prophecy: “And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea.”—Jer. 25:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> Today the so-ealled “Protestants” and the Yiddish clergy openly co-operate with and play into the hands of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy like foolish simpletons and thereby aid in replenishing the numbers of the Hierarchy and to carry on her commercial, religious traffic. Commercial religion is the stock in trade of all such merchants. The Hierarchy takes the lead, and the simpletons follow. The Hierarchy is now taking the lead in compulsory flag-saluting, and in building images or monuments, such as is now widely advertised to be built at Washington, D.C., and the clergy of the so-called “Protestant” and Yiddish organizations fall in line and do what they are told, and when the sackbut sounds they fall down and worship. Poor simpletons!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>37</sup> The Devil’s purpose, and therefore the purpose of his instruments in thus making merchandise of the people, is to keep them in subjection and to build up and support the Roman Catholic organization on earth. This part of the prophecy appears to have fulfillment during the period of time marked in the record at Isaiah 23:15,16; that is to say, the coming to pass of the physical facts which fit the words of the prophecy reveal the time of the fulfillment. This adds further force to the conclusion that prophecy cannot be understood until fulfilled or in course of fulfillment. But let it be understood and kept in mind that this prophecy will not be appreciated by merely casually reading it, nor what is here said about it be appreciated by casually reading. Careful study is required. The fulfillment docs not come chronologically in the order of recording of the prophecy, but it appears better here to proceed with the study in the order in which the prophecy is recorded in the Bible, rightly dividing it in harmony with the facts and the Scriptures, and thereby locate the time of the fulfillment. In brief, the fulfillment of the prophecy from verses 15 and 16 precedes the fulfillment of the preceding verses of the same chapter.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> The peoples of earth, likened to the sea that bears up the ships of commerce, have been used as merchandise and for gain by the religious systems brought into being by Satan, the god of this world. Says Jehovah by his prophet in connection herewith: ‘ ‘ And by great waters the seed of Sihor [the grain of Shihor </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)],</span><span class="font4"> the harvest of the river [harvest of the Nile </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)],</span><span class="font4"> is her revenue; and she is [was (E.U.)] a mart of nations.” (Isa. 23:3) The Lord said to Joshua: ‘‘Sihor ... is before Egypt.” (Josh. 13: 3) Egypt was a commercial world power. Tyre had dealings with Egypt, which symbolizes the Devil’s world power and which was brought into action and employed to reproach the name of Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>89</sup> It is written concerning ancient Egypt that its annual revenue amounted to approximately $20,000,000 or that which is equivalent to that sum. Egypt was a great market for the commerce of the nations. Compare these facts with the commercial traffic of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has, and for a long while has had, dealings with Big Business or mighty commerce of the world, members of the Hierarchy being large investors in the commercial traffic of the world. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has been and is a market for all the world, dealing in and manipulating the people, and particularly the “Catholic population”, and doing this for its own selfish gain. Politicians of all nations find the Hierarchy both politically and financially advantageous to them. Dictators, in particular, find a strong ally in the Hierarchy, and it will be generally found that these dictators are backed up and supported and put in power by the Hierarchy. Other religious organizations at the present, the Yiddish and Protestants, deal with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy because it appears to them to be to their selfish advantage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> Will the Yiddish and the Protestant clergy ultimately find it advantageous to link themselves to the Hierarchy and be dictated to by the Hierarchy of the Catholic organization? In answer to that question Jehovah says by his prophet: “Be thou ashamed, O Zidon [turn thou pale, O Zidon </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)]</span><span class="font4"> ; for the sea hath spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.”— Isa. 23:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>41</sup> Instead of being benefited those dupes and allies of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy will become pale of face and grow sick when they see the power of the Hierarchy yielding to Jehovah’s “strange work” now being carried on, and they will be greatly shaken with shame and humiliation when they observe the begin-.ning of Jehovah’s “strange act”. Recently the president of the United States has advised the “good neighbor” policy between all religious organizations, and their unity in action. That will prove to be very bad advice, as many will later discover. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy now takes the lead in an aggressive campaign against all who do not fall in line with its schemes, and in this campaign the other religionists trail along. Everyone today who will not support the religionists is denounced as “red” or “communist”, even Jehovah 's witnesses being classed by the religionists as such, although those religionists making these false charges well know that Jehovah’s witnesses have no part whatsoever with the political affairs of the world. The Hierarchy follow the course of their father the Devil.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>42</sup> Under the Devil’s wily and deceptive influence the people in general which are used to bear up and support the religious systems that engage in traffic have been deceived and blinded into following such course. The time is certain to come, however, when the following part of the prophecy will be fulfilled, to wit: ‘ ‘ The sea hath spoken, even the strength of the sea”; that is to say, the sincere people who love righteousness will break away from the religious prison house and speak against that wicked organization. Those who compose the “great multitude” (Rev. 7:9) as waters are first turned away from the support of the religionists and give their devotion to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. Then will follow in due time the masses who will renounce and turn away from and against the religionists. This prophecy shows that in God’s due time the relationship of the sincere people with the religionists will be broken off. “The sea” (that is, the people used and exploited by the Devil to mother, nourish and support the religious systems, who rule, are the rulers) will turn against the old “whore” and disclaim any relationship whatsover with her.—Rev. 17 :16-18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>48</sup> Nebuchadnezzar, after laying siege to ancient Tyre, invaded Egypt. (Ezek. 29:18-20) The fall of religionists, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization, will precede the destruction of the political and commercial elements of Satan’s visible organization, and such will bring great pain and astonishment to the latter; as it is written: “ As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.” (Isa. 23:5) The report here mentioned is concerning the beginning of Jehovah’s “strange act”. This text, according to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version,</span><span class="font4"> reads: “When the report cometh to Egypt, they shall be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.” The fall of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the religious organization, will bring great pain to the remaining portions of Satan’s visible organization because they will observe the ability of Jehovah’s Executioner to perform Jehovah’s “strange act”, and it will be evident to the remaining ones thai they have no power to protect themselves and that their turn for destruction is next. This conclusion is abundantly supported by other scriptures.—Rev. 18: 9-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>44</sup> Today Jehovah’s witnesses in every part of the earth are being persecuted by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies, and the Hierarchy religious organization is the chief visible instrument of the Devil which brings into action against Jehovah’s witnesses the political and commercial elements, and together they seek to make the burden great upon the back of those who love and serve Jehovah. And now in this hour of great stress the true people of Jehovah God greatly rejoice, because, true to the promise of the Almighty God, greater hope and strength is given to them by revealing to them an understanding of his prophecy. “The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.” (Ps. 29:11) .Those who now devote themselves entirely to Jehovah and his King, and who continue to maintain their integrity toward God, rejoice to be counted worthy of suffering some of the reproaches that came upon Christ Jesus. They are fully advised that Christ Jesus the King is upon his throne, and has gathered unto himself those of his royal house whom he leads and comforts. Now Jehovah through Christ Jesus is revealing to his people a knowledge and appreciation of his prophecies hidden in times of old, and by this knowledge the faithful have increased hope. In the following issues of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> by the Lord’s grace, the examination of this prophecy will continue; and we give thanks to our heavenly Father that we are permitted to have his favor in this day, and to thus receive his comfort.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>FEAR OR FAITH?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">B</span><span class="font4">EFORE the destruction of Jerusalem there were two prophets who prophesied at practically the same time, namely, Urijah and Jeremiah. Urijah received warning that unless he stopped his prophesying he would suffer. He got frightened and fled to Egypt, and the king Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt and fetched Urijah out, and brought him to Jerusalem and slew him. Jeremiah was arrested, and the clergy and other accusers insisted that he be put to death, and his accusers cited the case of Urijah. Jeremiah stood film and showed his faith in Jehovah and performed his duty faithfully, and Jehovah protected him. (Jer. 26:8-24) The following experiences reported from Germany are quite appropriate. Urijah well pictures a class of men who have undertaken to serve Jehovah, and who because of fear have ceased doing so. Jeremiah pictures the “faithful servant” class, who obey God and not man. The names of the parties in Germany are omitted, for an obvious reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">------, February 3, 1937. Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is my privilege in the name of all the German brethren to send you a report of the activity of the last few weeks and at the same time to express our great joy, which is amongst all of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the convention in Lucerne you had given us permission to distribute the there adopted Resolution in Germany. This was done on the 12th of December, very rapidly and throughout Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We had taken care to keep all preparations strictly secret. The Resolutions were prepared. The German Secret Police had received reports from their spies in Holland as to the distribution, but they received no information as to the exact date of the distribution. Even the brethren were not informed until th'e day before. Every one received his package with the Resolutions placed in envelopes as well as the territory he was to cover. On Saturday, the 12th of December, at 5 p.m., the work suddenly began, and by 7 p.m. everything was finished. In all districts of Germany, in all larger towns and cities, 3,540 courageous ■witnesses began simultaneously the large attack. It was a great victory and a sharp stab at the enemy, to the indescribable joy of the faithful workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One hour and a quarter after the start, that is, at 6: 15 p.m., the police radio stations broadcast the distribution of the tracts, and in another half hour the whole police force, SA and SS, was on its feet. But they were too late; the work was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The enemy was furiously mad, that they bad been taken by surprise, and their anger knew no limits. They were also greatly disturbed and are now in fear, for the following reason: They do not know how many such tracts were distributed, but find them in all parts of Germany. When questioned, most of the population denied having received anything. But the police do not believe them, because it is no longer a secret that most of the people are against the Hitler government and really are glad when something is done to help the people get the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In different places the police arrested those who had not taken part in the work, whereas the courageous ones were left in peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They are all very joyful, more so than at any former time since the dissolution of our organization. They are all waiting and asking when the next attack is to take place, and quite a number of those who through fear did not take part last time wish to join the others next time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is quite evident that Jehovah fought this battle and blessed our work in every detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Naturally, outside of these leaflets, books and booklets are being distributed, the Jonadabs visited, and in certain places the work with the gramophones is carried on. During the last quarter year (October I to December 31), 1936, the report of the activity is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">About 3,600 workers; 21,591 hours; 300 Bibles; 9,624 books; 19,304 booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are about 4,000 brethren under arrest. At the present time, trials are taking place all over, which, since the newspapers now give more detailed reports than before, are causing quite a stir amongst the population. I enclose in this letter several newspaper clippings and also a report of the most recent abuse of faithful brethren. In spite of the cruel persecutions by the brown and black tormentors, the brethren are undismayed. The joy of Jehovah is our strength, and the confidence in him, the desire to do our duty in the face of death, is ever increasing as the heat of the fire oven, which in Germany is truly heated ‘ ‘ sevenfold ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> which all brethren receive regularly, and especially the last articles about the prophecies of Malachi, is wonderful food at the right time, also for us, and we are very thankful to the Lord that he has thus strengthened and encouraged us. Many from the ranks of the enemy look on with astonishment and admit that there is something extraordinary about Jehovah’s witnesses, that they could not possibly be so courageous, ready to stake everything and to oppose such terrific enemies in their own strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Surely the Lord will soon give an ear to our ardent prayers and to the many cries for freedom from this prison house and soon giant us a more free hand also in Germany for his name and his work’s sake, also for the great multitude, that we may carry on his work on a larger scale, as in other countries, because, we are quite sure, there is much to do in connection with the great multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With many hearty greetings and blessings and with the assurance that all the faithful in Germany are endeavoring with their might to carry on Jehovah’s work, I communicate to you, Brother Rutherford, the expression of our appreciation that we are able to serve the Lord together with you and all the Loi d's people, to serve and to die for Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brother and cowitness,</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>TIME OF INSPECTION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font4">HE temple or sanctuary of God must be sot up and cleansed before the complete vindication of Jehovah’s name, and such work is a part of the preparation for the battle of the great day of God Almighty. For some time prior to the opening of the temple for judgment Christ Jesus was giving attention to the consecrated ones on the earth to ‘ prepare the way before Jehovah’ and to bring these consecrated ones to the time and place of judgment; and concerning that period of time Jehovah says: “And he shall prepare the way before me.” (Mal. 3:1) That work being completed, then Christ Jesus suddenly or straightway comes to the temple: “He shall come, saith the Lord of hosts.” From that time forward to the time of the battle of Armageddon is designated in the Scriptures “the day of his preparation”.—Nah. 2: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptures show that these two periods are separate and distinct, in this, to wit: the time of ‘preparing the way before Jehovah’ ends with the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple; whereas “the day of his preparation” begins at the time of the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple. The consecrated must be brought before the Lord for examination, and must be tried and judged, and the approved ones are brought into the temple and anointed. This is part of the work of “the day of his preparation”. This work was foreshadowed by the rebuilding of the typical temple at Jerusalem. The prophetic book of Zechariah deals with this preparatory work, the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and the conditions that will exist at the conclusion of that battle. All of this was written aforetime for the purpose of giving strength to the faithful remnant of God’s anointed people now on the earth. Jehovah has furnished cumulative evidence upon this point, and it behooves us to give careful consideration to all of such evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the term “Lord of hosts” or “Jehovah of hosts” appears in a Scripture text it relates particularly to Jehovah as the Commander of his military forces which he uses to express his wrath against the enemy. Note that the words of the prophet concerning the coming of Christ Jesus are: “Behold, he cometh, saith </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah of hosts.&quot;</span><span class="font4"> (Mal. 3:1, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> Concerning the rebuilding of the temple as prophesied by Zechariah the command is: “Thus saith </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah, of hosts:</span><span class="font4"> Return unto me, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will return unto you, saith </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah of hosts.&quot;</span><span class="font4"> (Zech. 1:3, A.R.V.) The great God of battle is preparing for the final war, and those in his organization eagerly seek for information concerning the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cyrus, the king of Persia, under the direction of Jehovah issued a decree for the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem. A remnant of Jews returned from captivity in Babylon and began the work of rebuilding, and then because of opposition these Jews for sixteen years did no work whatsoever in connection with the rebuilding of the temple. In the meantime Cyrus was succeeded by Darius, the Persian. It was in the second year of the reign of Darius that God sent his two prophets, Haggai and Zechariah, to stir up the Jews and put them to work on the temple. Zechariah began to prophesy two months later than Haggai, or, to wit, in the eighth month in the second year of the reign of Darius.—Zech. 1:1. See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> Book Three, page 109.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Zechariah was a son of Berechiah, who was the son of Iddo the prophet. Therefore Zechariah was the grandson of the prophet. The scripture shows also that Zechariah was a priest. (Neh, 12:1-4,12-16) The name Zechariah means “whom Jehovah remembers”, and Zechariah foreshadowed God’s servant class on the earth at the end of the world and whom God remembers and makes living stones in his temple, which temple is his building for the vindication of his great name. The name Berechiah means “whom Jehovah hath blessed”. Sometimes Zechariah was called the son of Iddo, because he was in fact a son of the second generation. (Ezra 5:1) “Iddo” means “timely; one born on a feast day; loving; opportune”. We know that Jehovah does everything at the opportune time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah was displeased with the service of these Israelites, and therefore he caused Zechariah to prophesy and say: “Return unto me, saith Jehovah of hosts. . . . Be ye not as your fathers.” (Zech. 1:2-5, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.) </span><span class="font4">Their fathers had permitted the temple, which had been built by Solomon, to be cluttered up with trash and defiled by idol worship, and now the returned captives from Babylon were showing the same disregard for God’s interests by permitting the building of the temple at Jerusalem to stop and lie in waste. (Hag. 1:4) The words of the prophet Zechariah serve as a warning to all who are begotten of the Lord’s spirit and who become negligent of the duties and obligations laid upon them by the Lord. (Zech. 1:6) Isaiah prophesied of a similar displeasure on the part of Jehovah with his consecrated people on the earth. (Isa. 6:1-9; 12:1) This is one of the reasons why the Lord Jehovah sent his message to cleanse his people, that is, to refine and cleanse the temple class; and this work would necessarily mean the cleaning out and putting on the side all the stubborn and rebellious ones. All must know that Jehovah is God and that his name shall be vindicated; and this work must begin at the house of God. (Mal. 3:1-3; Ezek. 20:1,37,38; 33:33) Such preparatory and cleansing work must be done before the final battle; hence it is a part of the work of the ‘day of preparation’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month in the second year of Darius, which month corresponds to our modern month of February, the prophet Zechariah had a vision. It was about the time for the ‘ ‘ latter rain” to fall. Three months previous to that time Haggai had been prophesying. After the twentyfourth day of the ninth month of the same year, it seems, Haggai ceased prophesying, or at least there is no record of his further prophesying; but from that time forward Zechariah exclusively filled the prophetic office concerning the work to be done on the temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning the vision the prophet said: “I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom [of the mountain]; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.” (Zech. 1: 8) It being in the nighttime, the vision relates to a time when ‘there is darkness upon the earth, and gross darkness covers the people’. (Isa. 60:2) The “man riding upon a red horse” was the angel of the Lord which materialized and to whom other angels make report of the result of their investigation. (Zech. 1:11) He was riding on a red horse, which is a symbol of sanguinary warfare. (Isa. 63:2) The ‘man on the red horse’ manifestly represents Christ Jesus, the Leader and Field Marshal of Jehovah’s war organization.—Ps. 45:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is the time of inspection! The man on the red horse “stood”, that is, he made his horse come to a standstill, and this corresponds to the period of time of “silence in heaven” (Rev. 8:1), it being the time when there was inactivity between the end of the Elijah work and the beginning of the Elisha work of the church. (Mal. 4: 5,6) (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font4"> Book I, page 99.) The rider on the red horse ‘stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom’. Another translation </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">{Rotherham,</span><span class="font4"> and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.,</span><span class="font4"> margin) renders.this text “in the shade” or “shady place”. Evidently the leader stood his horse at a point on the side of the Mount of Olives in the shadow of the trees, and from which point he makes an inspection of the city of Jerusalem. At that same time there were myrtle trees growing on the side of the Mount of Olives. (Noh. 8:15) It was the appropriate place for the rider to stand his horse, and the faet that mention is made that he stood his horse among the myrtle trees shows that it was at an appropriate time for Jehovah to return to his people, to restore to them his truth, and to gather them unto himself. “Myrtle” means or points to harvest, the time of restitution and joy. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> 1931, page 149; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation,</span><span class="font4"> page 19.) This would fix the time of the fulfillment of the prophecy, to wit, at the time the Lord was gathering his people unto himself preparatory to cleansing them at the temple judgment.—Ps. 50:5; Isa. 41:19; 55: 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The man on the red horse was inspecting the city of Jerusalem, which represented God’s covenant people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The city of Jerusalem must, at the time, have presented a sorry appearance, according to the description given of it by the prophet. (Neh. 2:11-15) The inspector general of Jehovah’s hosts must have been filled with indignation when he surveyed the desolation of Jerusalem. Likewise when Christ Jesus came in 1918 to inspect the professed people of God and set up the temple, he would look with indignation upon the desolation of the earthly part of God’s organization, the covenant people of the Most High. At this point the words of Isaiah seem quite appropriate and express the indignation of the Lord: “For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed [remnant people] is come.” (Isa. 63:4) This locates the time of the beginning of the fulfillment of Zechariah’s prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The inspector general of Jehovah’s hosts at the same time made an inspection of Satan’s earthly organization : ‘ ‘ He stood, and measured the earth. ’ ’ What he then saw would further increase his indignation and in due time would increase his zeal to act in the destruction of the wicked world. “He beheld, and drove asunder the nations.” (Hab. 3:6) It is the day of Jehovah’s preparation. (Nah. 2:3) Standing behind the man on the red horse were other riders on “red horses, speckled [bay </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(margin)</span><span class="font4"> ; pale (Leeser)], and white” horses. This shows that the inspector general was accompanied by his army officers in the army of Jehovah, and these make inspection and render their report to their chief. (Zech. 1:11) The conclusion is irresistible that these horsemen accompanying the Lord Jesus represented his holy angels that accompanied him at the time of judgment. (Matt. 25: 31) “Behold, the mountain was full of horses ... of fire.” (2 Ki. 6:17) These represent the war organization of Jehovah. “And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.”—Rev. 19:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Zechariah’s prophecy, chapter fourteen, shows the two opposing armies assembled for war. Jehovah’s army is under the immediate command of Christ Jesus, and the army of Satan is under the immediate command of Gog, Satan’s field marshal. Then Jehovah comes forth to direct the fight. He is pictured as standing upon the mountain, and at the touch of his feet the mountain separates, forming a great valley between the two mountains. From between these two mountains come forth the war chariots of the Almighty rushing into battle, and then follows a description of the most terrible war that will ever have been fought. That is the end of war. The battle of the great day of God Almighty results in the release of all who love righteousness and in the complete destruction of all who willfully work wickedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah now is commanding this testimony to be given in the earth. Christ Jesus is the great witness, and he has committed to the faithful remnant who are members of his organization the work of delivering this testimony on the earth. The purpose of the testimony is to afford the people an opportunity to take their stand on the side of Jehovah and live, and that the name of the Most High may be made known and entirely vindicated.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>LETTERS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THANKS TO JEHOVAH FOR GREAT AID</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">AU praise </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font3"> Jehovah, who in his due time i eveals his puipose to man! In the midst of the battle he issues his commands. His faithful witnesses are quick to hear and obey. So it is with the phonograph recently introduced into general uso with the house-to-house witnessing. “Use phonographs!’’ was certainly issued by the Conimander-in-Chief of Jehovah’s army, Chnst Jesus. Under this fresh stimulus the work has gone foiward by leaps and bounds, adding a new zest and impulse and resulting in a more thorough and more widespread publishing of the kingdom good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lately we have taken the phonograph with us on all our witnessing. So enthused aie we with this latest provision of Jehovah for his witnesses that we cannot help but wnte you concerning our joy and gratitude, and wonder how we eier got along without it before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With machine in hand and the promise to give a message of greatest importance to those within, entrance to more homes than ever is possible. More than that, the short Bible talks by Brother Rutherford break down prejudice of many years’ stand ing. People now hear the Word who had turned deaf ears to the radio talks, who had declined to read the testimony card, or who had set themselves in opposition to house-to-house publishers. We have found, too, that almost inevitably the placement of books and booklets follows the presentation of the phonograph lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our thanks to Jehovah for this great aid in the work and to you, Brother Rutherford, for transmitting to the field forces instructions legarding the great blessings that are bound to follow the use of the phonograph machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your fellow soldiers in the tight to the vindication of Jehovah’s name,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Benjamin F. Meyers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hattie Meyers, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Auxiliaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“THAT’S WHAT THE PEOPLE NEED”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Hope this statement will make your heart glad, and the hearts of those associated with you, in knowing how Jehovah is giving his increase to the work in New Jersey after the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the morning of February 9, while operating the sound car a patrol car approached me and the officer asked me if I was connected with the Jehovah's witnesses of Secaucus. I answered him “Yes&quot;. Then he looked into the sound car where Sister Nelson was sitting and I asked him if he wanted to see the appaiatus. He looked at the apparatus and saw how it operated and then started to go back to the patrol car, in which w'as seated another policeman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tiie policeman again propounded a question and asked me whether Judge Rutherford was a real judge of the bench. I answered him “Yes&quot; and told him that now Judge Rutherford was dedicated to the service of the Most High God and the lectures which we were playing were by Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then he asked me who the one was that was doing the talking at the convention at Newark, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font3"> answered him and told him it was Judge Rutherford in person. While this conversation was taking place the lecture “ Jehovah” was being played by the sound car,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tiicn the other policeman in the car propounded a question and said to me, ‘‘How do you people get alongf” I told him I would be only too glad to answer him, and said that I got along bv voluntary contributions. I then told him that the car in front of him was owned by Sister Nelson who was in the car and that the apparatus was a voluntary contribution by people that loved the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then the other policeman told me, ‘‘Yes, at the convention 1 saw cars from all parts of the country.” Then I answered him and told him that these lectures were for the benefit of the people of good will and that eveiything was done to the honor and praise of Jehovah’s name, and for further information he could tune in to station WBBR. Then the other policeman in the car answered, ‘‘That’s what the people need; that’s what we want: the truth. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then the policemen acted very courteous and withdrew by saluting Sister Nelson and myself in a kind way. We continued with our work of broadcasting and by Jehovah’s grace were having a wonderful time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Toward evening, just as we were about through with that section of the territory, a police car again circled around us and just as the police car drove around the corner another policeman on foot approached me and asked me if I wouldn’t mind moving out of that part of the territory. With that I asked him if he had received instructions from headquarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He answered, ‘ ‘ Yes; there is someone sick on this street who has made a complaint. ’ ’ Immediately I told him that I would be glad to accommodate him. The policeman was very courteous and very kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the present time the police of North Bergen, New Jersey, have been acting very kindly, giving us the right of way with lights and saluting us as we go through the streets, and it seems that Jehovah God through his King Jesus Christ is giving the increase according to his good pleasure to the police of North Bergen, in that they are appreciating the truth which is being brought to their attention by the beautiful instrument provided by Jehovah, the sound car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Further more you would be interested to know that while witnessing in the business district of Newark the businessmen of that city have shown a different attitude entirely towards the truth since the convention. I have been placing books with some of them, and some of them openly admitted that they enjoyed the convention very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There was a time that at the mention of Judge Rutherford’s name the people would not have anything to do with us, but since the convention their attitude has changed very much, and now the people are gladly accepting us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">May the rich blessings of Jehovah through his King Christ Jesus be upon you as you endeavor continually to magnify His name.</span></p>

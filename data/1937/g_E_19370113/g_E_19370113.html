<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Condolences for Monessen</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">M</span><span class="font10">ONESSEN (Pa.) is to be pitied. Any city that will permit itself to be browbeaten and intimidated by a person of the limited intelligence of Mayor James C. Gold should have its charter revoked and be placed in the hands of a guardian. The better element of that city hangs its head in shame and regret over the un-or semblance of a trial, he found them &quot;guilty” of some kind of offense and placed a fine of five dollars against each. Mayor Jimmy probably never read of Nero, the Roman tyrant, but is stepping right along in his footsteps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">May 31, 1936, Jehovah's witnesses again called upon the people of Monessen, leaving with</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">aspect and smells ye smell of battle, and with flashing eye and quivering nostril girds himself for ye terrible combat, whilst ye damsel Hierarchy wringeth her hands and ye dapple gray pales to a clabber white.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">American acts of the wooden spoon who bosses the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Once again </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> brings to the attention of its readers the shameful acts permitted by the city of Monessen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">May 24, 1936, Jehovah’s witnesses called on the people of Monessen with a petition for redress of grievances. It was a protest against the unlawful acts of the mayor and chief of police in locking up the Kingdom School and throwing the teacher into jail. Mayor Gold, being totally minus of information concerning the constitutional right of petition, had 146 arrested and jammed into prison cells. Without any trial, them copies of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> No. 435. A radio program was broadcast from the bluff outside of the city. No arrests were made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From July 20 to August 2, 1936, regular witness work was carried on in the city. Two carloads of witnesses per day were sent into town to present the Bible message and circulate a petition concerning the radio debate. The mayor and his police again got busy and arrested 41. Most of them were sentenced to thirty days in jail on a charge of “disorderly conduct”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The “disorderly conduct” ordinance under which they were charged defines disorderly conduct as drunkenness, fighting and brawling,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">using profane and obscene language on the street, indecent conduct; congregating on the streets and inciting mobs. Not one of Jehovah’s witnesses was guilty of disorderly conduct, but that made no difference to the Monessen dictator. “Your presence here constitutes disorderly conduct,” was his decree. And the decent people of Monessen sat quietly by and let this vacuumcelled cacique put it over without a squawk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thirty-one cases were appealed from Mayor</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Gold’s lawless decisions to the Quarter Sessions Court of Westmoreland County, presided over by Judge Charles D. Copeland, where they came up for trial on October 26. And then the dictator of Monessen found himself in a quandary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He was now before a court where the rules of law and rules of evidence would prevail. It would be necessary to prove that Jehovah’s witnesses were actually doing that which was disorderly. How could that be done without evidence thereof ? A real problem for the mayor and his right</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">was enough to sustain</span></p><img src="g_E_19370113_files/g_E_19370113-4.png" alt="" style="width:231pt;height:270pt;">

<p><span class="font10">hand henchman, City &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7">Mayor Gold “wing </span><span class="font10">a</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Attorney V. R. Smith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The defendants in these appeal cases were all arrested during a special campaign in Monessen from July 20 to August 31. In a desperate attempt to cover their tracks and make out a case against the defendants, the mayor and city attorney ignored the things done by the defendants and attempted to apply to them acts done at other times. On May 24 Jehovah’s witnesses had circulated a petition in Monessen protesting against the unlawful acts of the mayor in closing the Kingdom School. At that time 146 were unlawfully arrested and thrown into jail. On May 31 a distribution of an issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> was made in Monessen. A lecture by sound equipment was given from a bluff near the city. During the period from July 20 to August 31, when the defendants were arrested, only a few were in town at a time. There was no sound equipment used, and there was no distribution of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font10"> with cartoons to offend the susceptibilities of the mayor. A few witnesses at a time called on the people of the city with the Gospel message. There was nothing done on which a charge of disorderly conduct could be based. The mayor said, “Your presence in Monessen constitutes disorderly conduct.” That</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">a conviction in his so</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">had no “inflammatory</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">called “court”. But they knew it wouldn’t hold water in the Quarter Sessions Court of Westmoreland county.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They made quite an effort. They endeavored to show to the court that a big mob of Jehovah’s witnesses swooped down on the town; that they distributed “inflammatory literature” filled with scandalous cartoons; that they made a big noise with a bunch of sound cars; and that they annoyed all the people in town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was a nice theory, but it didn’t work. The defendants who were on trial were not part of a “mob”. Only a few were in town. They literature” with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They had no sound apparatus with them. The mayor and the city attorney tried to put one over on the court, but without success. They tried to deceive the judge, but weren’t equal to the task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Judge Copeland heard the whole story. He considered the testimony, found the defendants not guilty, and ordered, adjudged and decreed that they be discharged from custody. Pennsylvania has a peculiar statute which permits the court or jury to assess costs against the defendant, even though he has been found not guilty of the offense. The defendant can be vindicated, but must pay the court for the privilege. In these cases the court decided that the defendants, even though guilty of no wrongdoing, should pay the costs of the court of Quarter Sessions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And that, sweet Jezebel, gave great comfort and solace to Mayor Gold. It gave him an alibi. He went before the city council of Monessen and loudly proclaimed, “The city has not lost in any of the [Jehovah's witnesses] cases, but has won a great moral victory.” It was published through the newspapers that Gold still thought he had won a “great moral victory” in spite of the fact that thirty-one of his decisions were reversed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This proves that in addition to being a minus quantity as far as general intelligence is concerned, he is still troubled with </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">deceptio visits,</span><span class="font10"> that pecular malady which causes one to see things as they are not. That is why he sees a Communist revolution g r o w i n g among the little children in a Kingdom school; why he thinks the Bible and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font10"> are Communist textbooks; why he thinks ringing a doorbell is disorderly conduct; and why he thinks he secured a “great moral victory” at the time he was given a walloping good trouncing.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370113_files/g_E_19370113-5.png" alt="" style="width:232pt;height:289pt;">
<p><span class="font7">The very learned Doctor Gold, mayor of Monessen, makes a comment on history, aided and abetted by the equally learned Dr. Vincent B. Smith</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">Something ought to be done to aid this strabismal official, and if the witnesses of Jehovah who were unjustly compelled to spend many weary hours behind prison bars collect damages from the mayor and the city it may have a healing effect upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">City Attorney Vincent R. Smith added strong words of support to the mayor’s squint-eyed alibi, and dug up for broadcasting the old familiar “Communist” bugaboo. Smith opened the floodgates and vomited forth a bunch of falsehoods to the effect that Jehovah’s witnesses were Communists, were backed by Russian money, and had every aim against the American system of government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The vaporings of Mayor Gold do great wrong to the city of Monessen, but, nevertheless, he is funny. It’s his dumbness that makes him that way. He doesn’t know any better; so when he sees the “Communist” ghost rising over the Monessen Kingdom School and yells for help, everybody gets a good laugh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But Attorney Smith is different. He has some intelligence—not an overly big supply, but enough to know what is a Communist. When he makes public claim that Jehovah’s witnesses are</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Communistshis actions are contemptible. He knows better. He knows that they are not Communists, and that he is falsifying the matter just to stir up malice, anger and bitterness against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Boss Gold says it is so, and although Gold may be dumb enough to think that the Bible is a Communist textbook, his orders must be obeyed. Therefore this lawyer, who knows better, degrades his position as a counselor and joins in the chorus of hate against an inoffensive people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Residents of Monessen : We sympathize with you for being required to live in a community where the American spirit of freedom, tolerance, and justice has been so thoroughly demolished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The people of Monessen should have intelligence enough and civic righteousness enough to protest against being bamboozled by a pair of purblind officials. They should have gumption and courage enough to insist that children be permitted to have religious freedom in the city. They should have Christianity enough to call a halt on the persecution of people, especially little children, because these obey God’s law. They should have sufficient desire for cleanliness to climb out of the gutter of maggoty politics and putrescent city government. All these things they should have, and have in sufficient measure to take positive action.</span></p>

It is a monument to the faithfulness and courage of these youngsters.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Because he had the temerity to teach these children in a private school, a teacher was jailed and held two days without charge. The superheated patriots thrust the children away from the public schools, and then object because they are taught in private schools. Threats and intimidation have been used to close such schools. Bricks have been thrown through the windows.

<p><span class="font10">What can be back of all this diabolical and fiendish treatment but a conspiracy to break up families, and to railroad Christian children to public institutions where they can be beaten and choked and forced to violate the Lord’s prohibitions against bowing down to images?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the public schools of Monessen the pupils are taught the history of the battles for freedom of worship in this country. They are told of the flight of the Puritans to a land of freedom. They are informed of the settlement of their own state, Pennsylvania, as a refuge where there would be freedom for all. And while they are being inspired with the accounts of things gone by, in their midst is being waged a wicked and unprincipled campaign against children who believe and obey the commandments of Almighty God. Not one public school teacher of Monessen has made protest against such religious persecution. Why teach that which they are not willing to practice?</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">A</span><span class="font10">FTER the recent tornado at Gainesville, Ga., the relief workers were attracted to the wreckage of a house where a dog was pitifully whining, and reaching the spot where he stood they found him, a large-sized bulldog, straddling over the body of a two-year-old baby girl. His body was literally a mass of torn flesh, and only a dog with his strength could have so long stood up under the strain of the weight of a timber that was lying across the center of his back. The child was covered with the blood of the dog, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">but absolutely unharmed.</span><span class="font10"> The dog died ten minutes after the timber was removed from his back, and he had fallen exhausted by the side of the child. It is reported that the relief workers, after they had rescued the child, and found it uninjured, then turned to the prostrate body of the dog that had saved the child’s life, and finding him dead, they almost unconsciously took off their hats, in the hallowed atmosphere of one of those “Acts That Thrill.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At Memphis, Tenn., the Red Cross had an office open last month to receive contributions for the storm sufferers at Tupelo, Miss. The secretary looked up one morning from her desk to find an old darky, ragged and bent with age, standing respectfully before her desk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Is dis here where youse gives some money to help dem po folks down in Mississippi whar de tornado hit?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Why, yes, Uncle,” said the young woman. “Any of your people down there need help?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“No, Mam,” said the old man. “I jes wanted to give a little bit of money to help dem folks out what got hit so bad,” and so saying, he pulled out two worn and greasy ten-dollar bills and laid them on the desk. Tears came to the eyes of the young Red Cross worker. After she had composed herself she saw the old man was leaving, and calling to him she said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Wait a minute, Uncle. Let me give you a receipt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He stopped for a moment, turned and looked at her, slowly shook his head, and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘Tse already got my receipt, Miss. God gave it to me, and I don’t need yourn.” And on his way he went.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The girl put her head on the desk and her whole body shook with sobs, as she paid homage to one of those “Acts That Thrill.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The relief that the government is handing to us poor needy people lands in the hands of but a few. Their sewing and storage rooms where the government supplies are kept are full of dresses, sheets, pillow cases, shirts and cloth in the web, and mattresses stocked to ceiling, but when we poor folks want some they just shake their heads and say, “We can’t do a thing for you.” They look you up and down all over as if you were a fool for asking. We understood when this first started out that the government was to give this clothing free of charge. They put a price on it and we have to work it out. If the government doesn’t receive any pay for this clothing, where does it go? They will not give us the cloth and let us mothers make our own clothing. They ‘give that to women who are needing work’, but it isn’t always the woman that is needing work that gets it. They put women in there that have husbands with steady jobs. Oh, what an unfair world this is! ... If we had to depend on the relief to clothe us we would be naked. I take all the old clothing I can get, and make it over. This relief is nothing but a graft. Our officers, and their friends and associates, are the ones that are reaping the benefits. How glad I will be when the King, whose right it is, takes office! Then we shall have peace, prosperity and happiness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">COMMITTEE of ten in a poorhouse in Ohio writes of the savagery of the beast that runs the place. They were fed meat so rotten it made many ill. Though other workers on relief work but six hours a day, those at this poorhouse must work eight, and if they sit down or lie down on their beds between breakfast and supper they get three days in solitary confinement on bread and water. The butcher cut up a hog that smelled so he could barely finish the task. He pleaded that it be thrown away; the superintendent was adamant, and the hog was used for food. A poorhouse under a devilish superintendent is a bad place, far worse than a prison. None but a devil that believed in a flaming hell or a “purgatory” would ever wish to make a fortune by grafting off the poor; but many fortunes have been made in that way.</span></p>

Thus, a reporter for the Newark </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Ledger </span><span class="font10">found a home on Shunpike Road where five workers strung 6,000 Christmas tags in three days and received $1.45 for it.

That is why the five workers earned 3c an hour each. It will add much to the happiness of “Christmas” for those who make much of it to remember these facts.</span></p>

The manufacturing output possible with 10,000,000 workers in 1929 now requires but 7,000,000 workers.

St. Christopher is, so it is said, the patron “saint” of Roman Catholic travelers; but he slips up every time there is a Catholic wreck, and there are plenty of them. But maybe the wrecks occur because the automobile owners did not come across quick enough or often enough with the main consideration, the long green, without which there is no mass, and hence no “blessing”. Wonder what share St. Christopher has in the 30,000 automobile deaths a year, and why, if he is such a good “saint”, and not a narrow-minded, cockeyed bigot, he doesn’t stop the killings altogether, Catholic as well as Protestant.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">M</span><span class="font10">ANY persons desire to do what is right and pleasing to the Lord but are really guided by credulity or by the whim of another. One asks this question: If I go to some church building each Sunday and take part in the religious exercises and pay my part to keep up the expenses of the organization, is that worshiping Almighty God and Christ? The Scriptural answer is, No; for the reason as stated by Jesus, that such is vain worship and that those who please God must worship Him in spirit and in truth. (Mark 7:7; John 4:23) To properly worship God one must have faith, because, as is written in Hebrews 11:6, without faith it is impossible to please God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Faith cannot rest upon the opinion of any man. Faith means to have a knowledge and understanding of God’s Word and then to rely upon and follow the instruction contained in that Word. Faith must be based upon evidence that comes from a perfectly truthful source. The opinion of man is merely a guess. Faith is based upon that which is known to be true. How, then, can a man who desires to go in the right way have faith? The Scriptures answer, at Romans 10:17, that faith comes by receiving knowledge from the Word of God. Such is the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From the Bible one learns that all men are sinners and imperfect by reason of inheritance. (Romans 5:12) Actual experience corroborates this Scriptural statement, because we know that there is no perfect man among us. All sane persons want to live; and the Scriptures teach that life is a gift from God through Jesus Christ. (Romans 6: 23) You go to a church building and take part in formal exercises because you desire to receive some benefit. But you find that no benefit results, for the reason that what is there taught and practiced is the opinion or doctrines of men. Because of fear many go to the churches and listen to what is there said. God’s prophet says (Isaiah 29:13): “Their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men.” The right way is stated in the Scriptures (Psalm 119:104): ‘Through thy precepts, or instruction, we get understanding; therefore I hate the false way? In order to increase in faith one must increase in knowledge, and to that end he must study the Word of God and rely upon it. One says, ‘If I do what I think to be right, surely that will get me salvation.’ Not so, however; because what you may think may be far from what is right. The Scriptures instruct that we must trust in the Lord and follow His Word if we will be guided in the right way.—Proverbs 3:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Learning that you were born a sinner and out of harmony with God, that Christ Jesus is the way to God, and believing this, you agree to do God’s will. Then you read in the Word of God (John 3: 30): “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” To believe on the Lord Jesus is to accept the statements of the Scriptures as truth, and which state that Jesus came to earth to be a witness for the truth, and that everyone that is of the truth hears His voice. (John 18:37) To “hear His voice” man must obey, or do what the Lord commands; and the one who has faith does that very thing. The advice given to those who desire God’s approval is: “Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.” (Ephesians 5:6) Going through certain forms and ceremonies is vain and useless. The man who pleases God must study to show himself approved unto God.— 2 Timothy 2:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For the very purpose of aiding the people to gain knowledge and understanding, and thus to be established in faith, Jehovah’s witnesses go about publishing the-truth to the people. They go to the homes of the people and exhibit to them books in which are set down these Scripture texts which constitute the foundation for faith and show the way leading to life. To gain such knowledge and rely upon it is the only way to establish one’s faith. It is those who have faith in God and who are diligently trying to obey His Word that will receive the blessings of life everlasting. It is your privilege to avail yourself of these Bible helps that you may study God’s Word and walk in the right way and receive His approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The one who attempts to destroy man’s faith</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">in God is the Devil, because he is attempting to turn all men away from God. For this reason it is necessary to be sober of mind and watchful. At 1 Peter 5:8, 9 it is written: “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour; whom resist stedfast in the faith.” You resist the Devil by learning God's Word of instruction and confidently relying upon that instruction.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark159"></a>Immediate Action Imperative</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">FpO </span><span class="font10">Hon. Harold G. Hoffman,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Governor of State of New Jersey, Trenton, New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The undersigned, citizens of the State of New Jersey, for themselves, and in behalf of all people who desire to see the blessings of liberty and freedom retained in this state, do hereby present information of importance to you with the request that you take appropriate action in connection therewith. The liberties of people have been encroached upon to such extent that a large portion of New Jersey is today virtually a Fascist territory. Freedom of speech, freedom of conscience and freedom of worship are so generally disregarded that immediate action becomes imperative lest the state be completely enslaved by a subtle, implacable foreign power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Between October 16 and 18 of this year about eight thousand people who are Christians and Jehovah’s witnesses gathered in convention at Newark to worship Almighty God in the mode which His Word, the Bible, prescribes. Like conventions have been held in many states of this country and in many foreign countries, but never before have they received the shameful and inhuman treatment accorded them in northeastern New Jersey. One hundred fourteen of them, residents of many states, were arrested and crowded into the local prisons throughout this Fascist-minded area. Hoboken, Jersey City, Weehawken, Orange, Union City, North Arlington, Harrison, Lyndhurst, Middlesex, Montclair, Caldwell, Prospect Park and Ridgefield Park participated in the outrage. Some were held for a short while and released, but the majority were given farcical trials and received prison sentences ranging from five days to sixty days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We are informed that the matter has been brought to your attention by many indignant protests from various parts of the country. You have replied to such letters stating that Jehovah’s witnesses had been incarcerated “because of their refusal to comply with local ordinances in Hudson County”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is surprising that you would make such statement without proper investigation. Your answer certainly is not the truth, and woefully misrepresents Jehovah’s witnesses. They were not arrested for violating local ordinances. Many of them were thrown behind prison bars for merely driving on the streets, or walking on the sidewalks. One magistrate, who has the doubtful honor of convicting the most and giving the heaviest sentences, made the remark in open court, “We have told Jehovah’s witnesses to keep out of town.” This statement portrays clearly the gist of the situation. It was because Jehovah’s witnesses had the temerity to be in a number of Jersey towns such as Hoboken, Jersey City, Orange, Weehawken, Union City, etc., that they were pounced upon and locked up. It was a case of religious persecution similar in intent to that of the Dark Ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is an unholy conspiracy afoot between fanatical religionists and municipal officials of a number of cities of New Jersey to “suppress the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses”. It doesn’t look well to openly arrest a person for presenting Bible truths to the people, and therefore certain municipal ordinances are used as a smoke screen to camouflage the issue and cause you and others to believe that Jehovah’s witnesses were violating local laws. In the onslaught of October 16-18 Christian visitors from other states were charged with violations of the following ordinances and laws:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. Commercial peddler ordinances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">2. Handbill distribution ordinances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. Disorderly conduct laws.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">4. Vagrancy law.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Abundant testimony from witnesses and court records can be produced to show that Jehovah’s witnesses did not violate such laws. Conviction after conviction was entered with no evidence to support it. Other convictions were obtained through the perjured testimony of police officers. On Monday, October 19, immediately after the close of the convention, fifty-seven cases were tried in Jersey City, Hoboken, and Weehawken, before magistrates who openly expressed their animosity towards Jehovah’s witnesses. Not one escaped a finding of “guilty”. All were railroaded to jail by trials which were a disgrace to the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In your form letter to those who complained of these wrongful conditions you further state, “The proper procedure for these people, if they believe that their constitutional rights have been refused, is recourse to the courts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We respectfully submit and can present to you the proofs that it is of no avail to appeal to the courts for relief from this intolerable condition of affairs. Judges have stated their hatred and prejudice against Jehovah’s witnesses in words such as the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“No consideration will be shown these Jehovah witnesses in this court.” This was followed by:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘ ‘ They are </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">‘ a</span><span class="font8"> bad bunch ‘a nuisance, ’ ‘fanatics, ’ ‘snakes in the grass,’ ‘hoodlums,’ ” etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“We don’t care about the constitution in this town. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“If you want to preach the gospel preach it somewhere else. This city is 75- to 80-pereent Catholic.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Jehovah’s witnesses are the most bigoted and intolerant of all people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Why don’t you people stay away from here</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You know we don’t want you around.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I will stab you [Jehovah’s witnesses] in the back every time I get a chance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“We have told Jehovah’s witnesses to keep out of this town.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hostility, prejudice and unfairness is furthe shown in acts such as the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Making unusual and exorbitant bail restrictions, especially for Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Evasion on the part of officials, thus making impossible the arranging of bail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Suppressing of trial records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jailing of defendants because of their refusal to take the stand in behalf of the prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Needless postponement of trials, subjecting Jehovah’s witnesses to great inconvenience and much unnecessary expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Court appealing to political boss for advice as to amount of fine to be imposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Arresting Jehovah’s witnesses and taking them before a Catholic priest for advice as to disposition of the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How can you expect justice to be administered under such conditions? There is a sinister influence back of this persecution which controls courts and police and which should be forced out into the open. It has been going on for a number of years. Jehovah’s witnesses have been arrested on every kind of charge that evil-minded officials, directed by religious fanatics, could think of. Special legislation has been enacted specifically against them. These are not empty charges. Every statement herein, with additional facts, can be proved by court records and the testimony of competent witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fact is that a Roman Catholic Inquisition has been established in the state of New Jersey. Police officers and local officials are used as instruments of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, a foreign power, to wreak the vengeance of that organization upon law-abiding Christian people. No local court can or will deal adequately with the situation. This has been demonstrated many times, and we are ready to present proofs in support thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A thorough and complete investigation should be made. Open hearings should be held. Witnesses should be subpoenaed and every effort made to bring the subversive influences which are throttling the liberties of the people out into the open. In such manner their un-American activities can be checked and freedom of the people preserved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As citizens of the state of New Jersey we therefore demand that you make such investigation, and offer you our support and co-operation in the undertaking.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>Three Interesting Letters</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">New Jersey’s Helpless Governor—1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">State of New Jersey Executive Department </span><span class="font8">The Secretary to the Governor December 14, 1936</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Mr. Bossier ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have before me petition signed by yourself and other residents of Passaic and Hudson Counties with regard to the incarceration of members of Jehovah’s Witnesses in various New Jersey municipalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is a sharp line of division between the three branches of Government—Executive, Judicial and Legislative—and under the Law of the State of New Jersey, it is not within the power of the Governor to interfere with matters which have been passed upon by the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These people have been penalized for refusal to comply with existing ordinances in these municipalities, and if they believe that their Constitutional rights have been denied them, they have recourse to the higher courts through appeal. It is not within the power of the Governor or any other member of the Executive branch of Government to take any action in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sincerely,</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Secretary to the Governor</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">E JM :WLV</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. George W. Bossier,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">51 Hadley Avenue, Clifton, New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">New Jersey’s Helpless Governor—II</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Gov. Harold G. Hoffman, Trenton, New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This will acknowledge receipt of a letter signed by your secretary, Elizabeth J. McLaughlin, which assumes to speak for you in the matter of the petition of Jehovah’s witnesses recently submitted to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The letter indicates a willful attempt to misunderstand or misinterpret the situation. It states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“These people have been penalized for refusal to comply with existing ordinances in these municipalities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You have been informed otherwise. Has one been penalized for refusal to comply with existing ordinances whose only offense is that he drove through the town and received a sentence of ten days in jail therefor? Has one been penalized for refusal to comply with existing ordinances whose only offense has been to sit in an automobile in the town, and who receives a sentence of ten days in jail therefor?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have offered to prove to you that the arrests were made solely because officers have received orders to arrest Jehovah’s witnesses no matter what they were doing, and to suppress their activities. You will not listen to any proof or investigate, but continue to repeat the threadbare yarn that Jehovah’s witnesses are arrested for refusal to comply with existing ordinances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Permit us to cite another case which has happened within the past week, at Union City. Harry Whitaker was arrested while calling upon the people. He wasn’t selling anything; was not distributing any printed matter, nor soliciting for any purpose. He was not violating any law whatsoever. Yet he was arrested, held in jail for a day, and when brought to trial the prosecuting officers had not found on what charge they could hold him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He is still in custody, and we presume that you would also consider his case one of penalizing for refusal to comply with an existing ordinance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The letter from your secretary further states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It is not within the power of the Governor or any other member of the Executive branch of government to take any action in the matter.” We are not sure whether you, or your secretary, seriously expect us to believe that statement. It would be far better for you to frankly state that you do not want to do anything about the matter. The religious outfit which is instigating the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in New Jersey is powerful and no politician desires to rub up against it. It takes real courage to fight the Boman Catholic Hierarchy. It is unfortunate that New Jersey does not have a governor with manhood and courage sufficient to put up a real battle for civic liberty and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">May we remind you in all seriousness that those in positions of authority who wink at, encourage, condone, or participate in the persecution of consecrated persons because those persons are actively engaged in proclaiming the Word of God are thus fighting against God, and in due time must answer to Almighty God for such wrongful acts.—Ezekiel 3:18,19; Ezekiel 33:12-15; Matthew 25: 31-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Having brought these matters to your'attention our responsibility in this behalf ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Yours very truly, </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">George</span><span class="font8"> W. </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bossier </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Divisional Servant, New Jersey Division of Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">How About a Little Christian Liberty in New Jersey?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">December 16, 1936 Honorable Harold L. Ickes,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Secretary of the Interior, Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Honorable Secretary:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have just read with great satisfaction an account of your intercession in behalf of a minority religious sect at Taos Pueblo in New Mexico, which was persecuted severely because it held beliefs differing from those of the majority.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark161">1</a></sup> Your efforts to secure to the peoples of this nation the guarantees of the Constitution providing for freedom of conscience and of worship are indeed praiseworthy. My humble compliments will perhaps add nothing to your laurels, but I could not restrain expression in view of so noble a deed. These humble Indians can indeed be grateful for your efforts in their behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There appears to be spreading an epidemic of bigotry. The Indians are not the only ones affected. But the same organization which so wickedly persecuted them is operating in like manner throughout the nation. In New Jersey, hundreds of God-fearing men and women (some of them grandmothers and grandfathers) and little children, all of them wholesome, are thrown into filthy jails. They are charged with the violation of laws which have been framed by men under the influence of these same bigots; laws which would prohibit these persecuted Christians from preaching the gospel because the gospel which they preach does not agree with the majority religionists. All of this persecution is in flagrant defiance of the federal and state Constitutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Untold misery has been and is being suffered by many at the hands of these bigots. Men and women are thrown out of positions and deprived of an opportunity to earn a living. Children are put out of schools and deprived of free education, and when private schools are established for these children more persecution follows in an effort to deprive them of this or any other opportunity for learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The persecution of the Indians in which you evidenced so kindly an interest is, I believe, small in comparison with the mass persecutions herein referred to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Men holding public office seem to shrink from the thought of even raising a finger in defense of the persecuted. To be a little more blunt, let me state that this persecution is carried on at the instance of the Roman Catholic. Hierarchy, and the persecuted are a body of sincere Christians known as Jehovah’s witnesses. Their persecution is winked at by public officials and the “hands off” policy is inevitably followed. An investigation of this persecution would undoubtedly reveal too much and pull too many skeletons from political closets and, therefore, no public official deigns to risk it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Appended hereto you will find copy of a protest in this matter which was delivered to the Governor of New Jersey a few days ago. It is almost a foregone conclusion that he will do nothing about it. He has known of this condition for years without stirring himself with regard to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If you could tell me of some way that one might secure the benefits of the Constitutional provisions for freedom of conscience and of worship without molestation by bigots who think that no one has the right to a belief differing from theirs, then I certainly shall be as grateful to you as those Indians ought to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sincerely,</span></p>

Italian agents also bribed the petty chiefs and discontented troops to quit and go to their homes, and thousands thus disappeared from the firing lines.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The records show about 120 known cases of persons either directly killed or so tortured that they died. Such cruel and revolting methods employed during the so-called “examination” of prisoners are described as sticking needles under prisoners’ fingernails, placing live coals between armpits and body, prolonged beating on the soles of the feet, driving sharp instruments into the heels, and perpetrating outrages upon sexual organs. These methods are used in attempts to force confessions incriminating themselves and other men and women active in opposition movements. But the tortures are not confined to the period of preliminary examination. They continue after commitment to prison. Even those prisoners convicted of such trivial offenses as distributing opposition literature or belonging to opposition groups are systematically beaten and starved. Some are reliably reported as having been inoculated with disease germs, others have had iron bands clamped around their heads for months at a time. Conditions in the prisons are reported to be so inhuman that many prisoners must sleep on the bare floors of their unheated and wet cells.</span></p>

They believe in transmigration of souls, and that at one time all were Negroes and lived in a continent now beneath the Indian ocean. They believe in the immortality of the soul, and in “purgatory” and in universalism. They are astrologists, and teachers of “faith healing” done, admittedly, by demons whom they designate as “invisible helpers”. They think that when they are asleep they can go around and help these “invisible helpers” in their work of healing. They are great believers in this “vibration” stuff, and demand from each patient each week a letter written with pen and ink, so that they can keep tabs on his “vibrations”.

He immediately became the center of such interest by a mob of 500 that he was knocked down still clutching the headless snake. All real students of the Scriptures know that the snake passage (Mark 16:18) is missing from the Sinaitic and Vatican MSS., and that all the verses from Mark 16:9 to the end of the chapter are of doubtful authenticity, and should not be used as the sole proof for anything whatever. The snake dancers at Ramsey, while supposing that they are being guided by the Scriptures, are manifestly being misled by the demons, whose whole intent there, as everywhere, is to do all possible to dishonor the name of God, and get people to lose faith in Him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Bible Designed to Be Bead As Living</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■L Literature—The Old and New Testaments in the King James Version” is the title of a new edition of the Bible which claims to present the ‘•'deathless words of the King James Version of the Bible unaltered and with scrupulous fidelity, but editorially and typographically designed to be read as living literature”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The advertisements of this new edition contain extravagant claims with respect to it, but omit an important and significant fact regarding it, and that is, that all the Apocryphal books are included, though these are definitely no part of the King James Version as it has been circulated in immense quantities by numerous Bible societies. These Apocryphal books are rejected by all Protestants, nor were they a part of the Hebrew canon, nor are they ever quoted as Scripture by any of the writers of the gospels and epistles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With respect to these Apocryphal books the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Imperial Bible Dictionary</span><span class="font10"> says,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“They contain things utterly at variance with the proper character of a divine revelation—fables, falsehoods, and errors of doctrine. . . . Judith not only acts throughout a deceitful part, but even prays God to own and make use of her deceit. The two books of Maccabees contain various historical errors and contradictions . . . Then, there are the ridiculous fables of the fish in Tobit, of Jeremiah’s taking the ark and altar to Mount Pisgah, and hiding them in a cave; of Bel and the Dragon, and, indeed, the whole story of Judith seems little less than a fable.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why are these books included in an edition of the Bible which claims to be the “best seller of the ages” in modern form ? The Bible with the Apocrypha has not been a “best seller”, but the editions without that group of books have been. It should be well known to the editors and publishers that the Bible has been circulated in immense quantities by Bible societies that have consistently omitted the Apocryphal books. On the other hand, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which has insisted upon including the Apocrypha in its editions of the Bible, has made no effort to circulate the Scriptures, but has, on the contrary, consistently burned Bibles, both the Protestant and Catholic versions, wherever it had opportunity to “get away with it”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The advertisements of the modern edition that have come to attention make no mention whatever of the inclusion of these Apocryphal books, and the scheme bears the marks of Jes-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">uit influence. One noticeable characteristic of the Apocryphal books is that they exalt men and their supposed virtues rather than God; and that would appear to be the main objective of this surreptitious inclusion of these unscrip-tural books in this new “Bible”.</span></p>

Not having anything more serious to engage their attention the rabbis have been supervising the slaughter of the chickens of which the several million Hebrews of New York and vicinity consume great numbers. Chickens that have had benefit of clergy in their death throes are entitled to leg bands which cost the rabbis $1.30 a thousand, and are sold to the dealers at $10.00 a thousand, not quite eight times as much. But the poultry dealers were demanding cheaper leg bands for sanctified chickens, and brought the matter into court. The rabbis complained that even at a profit of 670 percent they were losing money on the deal, which statement comes under the head of “Important, if True”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">T</span><span class="font10">HE effort of Hitler and others to identify the Jews with Communism proved a complete fizzle. Investigation discloses that among the 81 Communist deputies of the Reichstag of 1933 not one was a Jew. There were 6,000,000 Communist votes cast in the election, but there are only 300,000 German Jews entitled to vote; so not more than 5 percent of the Communist party in Germany could be Jews even if every Jew were a Communist, which is not the case. Nor is it true that the Jews of Russia are largely Communists. The official statistics of the original Petrograd Communist party in 1918 shows that of the then total membership only 2.6 percent were Jews. Hitler’s party is kept in power and kept together only by the most shameless lies ever invented.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark225"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark226"></a>The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the Bible</span></h2>
<p><span class="font19">C</span><span class="font10">ATHOLIC organizations are circulating large numbers of leaflets and tracts in defense of the Catholic church and endeavoring to persuade non-Catholics that this church is, after all, the most wonderful organization in the world. Some of these tracts deal particularly with the Bible, one of them interestingly stating the Catholic position as follows: “The Bible an authority only in Catholic hands.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This is but another way of saying that the Bible is no authority at all, but that the “church”, and by this is meant particularly the Hierarchy, is the real authority, without which the Bible would be worthless. This is a significant statement, and one that should not be lightly dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Othei’ leaflets make assertions along the following lines: “Do you know that the Catholic Church is the greatest lover and friend that the Bible has ever possessed? Do you know that the Bible needs an interpreter who can explain its meaning and settle its difficulties so that all may know the word of God? That Christ gave His church the power to interpret' the Bible? That the Church can make no mistake when she interprets the Bible?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Further the question is asked, “Do you know that the Catholic Church existed over sixty years before the last line of the New Testament had been written? Do you know that Saints Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Peter, Paul, Jude and James, who wrote the New Testament under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, were Catholics ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Such claims, unsupported by Scripture or historical proof, are calculated to mislead those who are uninformed, and to subject them to the Hierarchy, which has consistently pushed the Bible into the background, or, worse, endeavored to use it for unholy purposes. But all these questions can be answered, together with the claim that the Roman church has the only pure Bible and that other Bibles are corrupted and incomplete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While the so-called “guides” of Protestantism have woefully failed in protesting against these presumptions of the Hierarchy, God has not left himself without witnesses who boldly and courageously defend the Word of God against His slanderers, and who do not compromise with the destroyers of the faithful followers of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The absurd claim that the early disciples were “Catholics” is as false as the rest of the presumptuous pretensions of the Roman Hierarchy and its tools. The term “Catholic” was not used until at least a hundred years after these faithful men of God had finished their course in death. And as for those things that “distinguish” Catholicism today, they would have lifted their hands in complete horror had they known that any organization practicing such abominations would ever dare to claim the name “Christian”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark227"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark228"></a>“Catholic” Practices</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Take note of the additions that were made to the “faith” in the course of time, each a further departure from the simplicity of the gospel.— 2 Corinthians 11: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Holy water” began to be used in A.D. 120. “Penance” began to make its appearance in A.D. 157. About A.D. 200 the church was divided into two groups, clergy and laity, a direct violation of the spirit of the truth. (Matthew 23: 8,9) Fifty years thereafter hell began to be pictured as a place of torture, and 75 years thereafter the doctrine of the “Trinity” was forced upon the people, even though until that time Father and Son had been generally understood to be two persons, as is shown in what is mistakenly called “The Apostles’ Creed”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">About this time also the adoration of dead “saints” and relics developed, and living saints began to be persecuted by their supposed brethren. Liturgical “worship” also was established at about this time. “Liturgy” is really the practicing of repetitious formal ceremony instead of the study of God’s Word. In A.D. 360 the worshiping of angels was approved. (See Coiossians 2:18.) Mass and Christmas made their appearance toward the end of the third century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 449 the Roman bishop, in the face of opposition from other bishops, took the title of primate as Pope Leo I. In 454 the expression “Mother of Christ” was changed to the unscrip-tural title “Mother of God”. In 529 the first monastic order, the Benedictine, was established. In 547 the lenten fast was instituted. In 593 “purgatory” was made a part of “Catholic” belief, and a few years later, in order to stop “controversy”, Latin was adopted as the tongue in which “church” “services” must be held. But the adoption of all these heathen customs was not accomplished without continual protests uttered by those who loved the Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then, in 680, crosses, emblems of sun worship, were first introduced as “symbols of the faith”. In 715 prayers to the “virgin” and the “saints” were approved. The worshiping or bowing to images was established (though amidst great opposition) in 726. The year 783 witnesses the practice of kissing the pope's foot. Pope John XVI established canonization of “saints” on a paying basis in 993. Baptism of church bells and observance of “All Souls’ Day” and “All Saints’ Day” was established in A.D. 1000. The “celibacy” of the clergy was insisted upon beginning with A.D. 1015. The “rosary” gained recognition in 1059. Confession was sanctioned by the council of Loretania A. D. 1116.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Indulgences made their appearance in A.D. 1140. Then, about 1204, because there was much opposition to this and other departures from the truth, the Inquisition was brought in to exterminate “heretics” by means of sword and stake. The “wine” was withheld from the people by definite rule in A.D. 1263. The papal tiara made its appearance in 1311. The dogma of the immaculate conception of Mary was established in 1854, and the infallibility of the pope was decided upon (again in the face of great opposition) in 1870!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark229"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark230"></a>Christ a Catholic!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">Yet, say the Catholic propagandists, the apostles were Catholics, and some go so far as to say that even Christ himself was a Catholic! Yet none know better than informed Catholics themselves that the “Roman Church” is continually changing, not merely in minor matters, but in significant respects. In one thing it remains unchanged ; and that is, its opposition to the pure and simple truths of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While these are often given lip worship, it is well known that the Roman Hierarchy is a double system with a double doctrine, one for public consumption, and another which is carefully hidden from the people, but which reveals itself only too obviously in the spirit of the system and the course of action which it invariably follows in dealing with those who dare to differ with it, as well as with its own unhappy victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The claim, therefore, that “the Catholic Church existed over sixty years before the last line of the Bible had been written” is shown to be unwarranted. The true church was in existence, a free and Scriptural association of believers, but no such system as is now seen in the Roman organization then existed, nor did it make its appearance until years after the apostles had fallen asleep in death. (Matthew 13: 25) It is a far cry from the simple and unaffected faith of the apostles and early disciples to the mummery and. mockery of the present Roman religious system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But is it true that “the Bible needs an interpreter who can explain its meaning and settle its difficulties so that all may know the word of God”? And is it true that Christ “gave His church the power to interpret the Bible”? The claim that the Bible is worthless without the “authority” of the Roman church is shown to be false in the light of the following plain Scriptural declarations: “The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.” (Psalm 19: 7) “The entrance of thy [God’s] words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.” (Psalm 119:130) Did not Jesus our Lord himself say that His doctrine was hidden from the worldly wise and prudent, but revealed to those who were but babes in understanding?—Matthew 11:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On the authority of these and numerous other scriptures it is evident that Christ’s sincere and humble disciples, great and small, may be His instruments to bear His truth to those who are not yet believers, and that “no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation”. (2 Peter 1: 20) It is also interesting that in olden times it was thought sufficient to read the Scriptural counsels themselves, distinctly, sensibly, and not liturgically and senselessly in a monotone.—Nehemiah 8:1-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The effort at “authoritative” interpretation has invariably resulted in such absurdities as are contained in the Talmud and as are found in numerous Roman Catholic pronunciamentos. It was not so in the early church, where simple and unassuming brethren preached the gospel, and, as far as the essentials were concerned, did so harmoniously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Bereans received Paul’s preaching with all readiness of mind, but they nevertheless proved his preaching by the Scriptures, and were commended for so doing. (Acts 17:11) Would anyone subjecting the teachings of the Roman Hierarchy to such a test be commended?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark231"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark232"></a>The Greatest Friend of the Bible?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10">The Roman Hierarchy claims that it is not the enemy of the Bible, but that it is in fact the greatest friend and lover of the Bible. What does the record say on this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Pope Innocent III issued a bull against the Waldenses, the first translators of the Bible into a vernacular tongue, and commanded that all their books should be burned, particularly the Bible which they had translated into the Ro-manza language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Papal council of Toulouse forbade the reading of the Bible in any vernacular tongue!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The council of Bologna (appropriate name) forbade the general reading of the Bible, and especially the Gospel of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The famous bull </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Unigenitus</span><span class="font10"> (1713) forbade the reading of the Bible; not merely particular Bibles, such as Protestant editions, but the Bible as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fourth rule of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Index Expurgatorius </span><span class="font10">forbids the reading of the Bible, under the pretext that more harm than good comes from so doing! How does this harmonize with the statement, in 2 Timothy 3:15, “From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By the bulls of Pius IV and Clement VIII, Catholics are forbidden to read the Bible without a special license, in writing, issued by the bishop or the “father inquisitors”. Catholics who read the Bible without license are told that they commit a “mortal sin”! Catholics in Protestant countries are really indebted to Protestants for the license granted them to read the Word of God. However, it is admitted that they make relatively little use of the opportunity, being little encouraged to do so by their priests. The fact that dispensation is given in some countries to read the Bible only proves that the general prohibition exists. In Catholic countries Catholics would not think of reading the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Popes Pius VI, Pius VII, Leo XII, Pius VIII, Gregory XVI and Pius IX all expressly forbade the reading of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What kind of love and friendship for the Bible is this which keeps it from its mission to “make . . . wise unto salvation”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Who Has a “Corrupt” Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Assuming that Protestants generally are ignorant of the facts, the Papal agent charges that Bibles used by Protestants are corrupt and incomplete and that the Roman Hierarchy has the only pure Bible. 'What are the facts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The non-Catholic editions of the Bible are called “incomplete” because they omit the Apocryphal books of Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, The Song of The Three Holy Children, The History of Susanna, History of the Destruction of Bel and the Dragon, The Prayer of Manasseh, Maccabees, and certain additions to the book of Esther. These books are all added, in the Roman Catholic Bible, to what is usually termed the “Old Testament”, that is, the Hebrew Scriptures, as distinguished from the “New Testament”, or Greek Scriptures. The latter is the same in all Bibles, Catholic or non-Catholic, so far as books are concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Hebrew Scriptures contained none of these Apocryphal books and do not contain them to this day. Early students among Christians, such as Melito, Origen and Jerome, did not include them as inspired and part of the Bible. They are not found in the oldest manuscripts. They are not included in Bibles used by Jews to this day. In view of these incontrovertible facts, the charge made by the Hierarchy that the non-Catholic versions of the Bible are incomplete is shown to be a boomerang and discloses the fact that the Hierarchy has added to the Scriptures.—Proverbs 30:5,6; Ecclesiastes 3:14; Revelation 22:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In this connection it should be noted that the Hierarchy itself did not definitely include the Apocryphal books as part of the Bible until the fourth session of the Council of Trent, in A.D. 1546. At that time the great Reformation had begun, and this move of the Council was an effort to include in the Scriptures something that might be used against the reformers. But it was not until the Vatican Council in 1870 that the Apocryphal books were declared to be of equal value with the canonical books of the Bible. In a way it might therefore be said that the Catholic Bible is at this writing but 67 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font10"> which for obvious reasons caters rather noticeably to Catholicism, states that in declaring all parts of the Apocrypha to be equally inspired with the Bible, “The Church has based both canonicity and inspiration on authority, and in truth with wisdom, for they could be based on nothing else.” This misstatement of fact is characteristic of Roman Catholicism and unworthy of an encyclopedia that is supposed to give not the partisan opinion of some religious cult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The books included in the Bible are there because they were recognized to be written by men of God, and not because any supposed authority pronounces them canonical. The collection of the books of the Greek portion of the Bible (N.T.) was the result of the fact that they were recognized by a general consensus of opinion among Christians to have been written by men who were used of God. Historical evidence proves them to have been so recognized and accepted, and that without any formal endorsement of those who claim to be the “solid rock of authority”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Voice of “Authority”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And what is the voice of this authority, with respect to the Bible ? In the first place it should be remembered that the Israelites were entrusted with the oracles of God, that is, the Word of God. Did these at any time recognize or accept the Apocryphal books as inspired? They did not! Nor did the early Christians accept them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The apostles did not quote from the Apocryphal books as they did from the genuine books of the Bible. Councils of the early church rejected them. The council of Laodicea excluded the Apocryphal books, and the Ecumenical council of Constantinople approved this decision. Melito, Cyrillus, Origen, Eusebius, Hilary, Gregory of Nazianzus, Athanasius and Hieronymus (Jerome) all rejected these un-scriptural books. These councils and men are mentioned here, not as authorities, but rather as proof of the attitude of the best-informed men in the early history of the church toward the Apocryphal books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Latin Vulgate Bible, declared by the Council of Trent to be the only authentic version, is the translation of Hieronymus (Jerome), to which were added translations of the Apocryphal books. Hieronymus doubtless aimed at accuracy, but his translation left much to be desired. It was progressively altered by copyists until Pope Sixtus V felt obliged to have his own edition of it made at the Vatican, inasmuch as all current editions were more or less corrupt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Council of Trent said, “We adopt the rule of Hieronymus.” But which of the several hundred different editions should be used was apparently not decided. Sixtus V said, “This new edition of the Vulgate which </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font10"> present, without any doubt or controversy, is to be reputed and taken to be the only edition, which being as well as possible reformed [revised], our will is, and we decree it, to be read throughout the Christian world.” This was all very well, but Pope Clement VIII issued a bull later on stating that in the Sixtus V edition he had found two thousand dangerous errors. A new edition was issued by Clement VIII.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Douai [Catholic] Bible, translated in part at Rheims before the time of Sixtus V, contained all the errors of the editors of the Vulgate condemned by that pope. But now the English Catholics have adjusted their Douay translation to the Oxonian (Protestant) version—with exceptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Fr. Ungarellie (friend of Pope Gregory XVI), a profound scholar, affirms that he found in the present Vulgate 750 capital errors. Cardinal Bellarmino, who undertook the correction of the Vulgate, said, “I did not correct diligently the Vulgate Bible; many things which it was necessary to correct, for just reasons, and purposely, I left uncorrected.” Clement VIII, in his preface to his own edition, wrote, “In this edition, as some things we expressly changed, so, many others, purposely, we left unchanged.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now, who has a corrupt Bible? When the revisers of the Common Version (Protestant) Bible produced the admirable Revised Version, and when later the still better American Revision of it appeared, no extravagant claims were made for it, but an honest effort was made to have.it correct. There is found therein an accuracy that is not even attempted or desired in the Catholic translations. The latter are admittedly left uncorrected on purpose! Which, then, is the corrupt Bible? No translation is likely to meet every demand, and certainly none is letter-perfect, but in the Common Version and Revised Versions there is available to millions of people the Word of God in a reasonably trustworthy and essentially uncorrupted form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A few examples of Hierarchy mistranslations may be given: In Genesis 3:15 “it shall bruise” is changed to “she shall bruise”, an attempt to glorify the virgin Mary rather than The Christ, the 'seed of the woman’. In John 14:26 Jesus said, “The holy [spirit] . . . shall . . . bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.” In the Catholic Bible it is mistranslated “whatsoever I shall have said to you”, and the Vulgate has it “the Paraclete shall suggest unto you all things whatsoever I </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">shall </span><span class="font10">say to you”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In both of these renderings there is an evident attempt to get away from the words of Christ himself to what men may claim to teach as representatives of Christ under a supposed inspiration. The text is employed to support the idea that the pope or leaders of the Catholic church are authorized to give instructions other than those that appear in the Scriptures as given by Jesus himself. John 21: 25 should be compared with John 20: 30, 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The word ‘■elders” (Latin: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">seniores)</span><span class="font10"> from the Greek </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">presbuteroi,</span><span class="font10"> meaning simply “mature ones”, is in the Hierarchy Bible generally translated </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">priests</span><span class="font10"> (.Latin: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">sacerdotes),</span><span class="font10"> although the Greek word which would properly be translated as </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">priests</span><span class="font10"> is an entirely different term, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">hiereus. </span><span class="font10">True, the English word “priest” is a contraction of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">presbuteros,</span><span class="font10"> but not a proper translation of it, as it conveys an idea contrary to that contained in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">presbuteros.</span><span class="font10"> In passages, such as Hebrews 11:2, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">presbuteroi</span><span class="font10"> is translated by another word, i.e., “ancients,” because “priests” would </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">obviously</span><span class="font10"> be wrong, and it </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">really</span><span class="font10"> is wrong wherever it is used to translate </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">presbuteroi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The appeal of the Catholic Hierarchy to “tradition” is an effort to make God’s Word of none effect. (Mark 7:13) Tradition is unstable as the sands. Early Christians recognized this fact. Tertullian said against Ermegenes: “The school of Ermegenes may demonstrate that the things it-teaches are written, for, if not written, then it must fear the anathema which is destined to all who add to or take away from the Scriptures.” Basilius said, “To reject what is in the Scriptures, or to receive what never was written (tradition), is an evident mark of unfaithfulness.”—Luke 4: 4, 8; Revelation 22:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">To Flimflam the People</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">T</span><span class="font10">O FLIMFLAM the people into, the belief that all is lovely between the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the rabbis, the Washington </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font10"> carries the more or less interesting information that in that city Marty Gallagher, Irish Catholic, was training at the Jewish Community Center for a prize fight with a Jew named Levinsky, while Levinsky himself was training at the gymnasium of the Roman Catholic church Our Lady of Victory. Propaganda of that sort is so silly that it kills itself in the making. Why try to pretend that Jews are Catholics and Catholics are Jews? What real good can come from it?</span></p>

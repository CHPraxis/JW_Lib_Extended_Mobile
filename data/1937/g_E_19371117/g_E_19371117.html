<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Mussolini as Ridiculous as Ever</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">♦ Mussolini is asininely ridiculous. When he visited Libya he had everything fixed up to crash the headlines in great shape. He had hardly landed before a bull rushed for him, and if General Balbo had not grabbed it by the horns the world would have been the gainer. He timed his visit so as to get a great flood of glory from the achievements of the Italian troops in Spain, under the general Bergonzoli, first to enter Addis Ababa at the head of a tank column. The Spanish women licked the Italian men to a frazzle. Mussolini, so it is alleged, demanded that Bergonzoli put many of his officers to death; so he committed suicide instead, and the Sawdust Caesar hastened back to the Imperial City, into which, in the “march on Rome”, he came by sleeping car, on invitation from the king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Norris Is Sore</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">♦ Dr. Foxley Norris, dean of Westminster Abbey, is sore because the Reverend C. G. Holland, vicar of Ewell, Surrey, wrote, in a “church” magazine, objecting to the turnstiles and tills used at the time of the coronation. Dr. Norris wants to know, if a guy in the religious business can’t get back his money for cleaning up every night after big crowds have been running over his show place all day, who can. Reverend Holland should shame himself for pinning the bug on Reverend Norris like that. And don’t ask how Holland gets his. It is enough for you to know that he gets it. Meantime the farms are shrieking for both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">The Hitler Circus</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">♦ When Hitler puts on one of his circus acts he has before him a row of buttons which he presses as part of the show. One button, by means of a searchlight, draws attention to the Nazi flag, another to the audience, another to himself, so that his body guard may know when to clap, stamp and “hcdl”. There is a button for photographers, and if they fail to get the exact scene required they do time in a concentration camp.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A Chat from Karachi, India </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By G. B. Garrard, Pioneer</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(Karachi is 500 miles northwest of Bo nib ay, at the head of the Arabian Sea.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">AKING advantage of the lull in battle</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">—there is yet an hour before we go out on service again—I ant getting down to it. Owing to the added zest we had been getting recently due to introducing the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font6"> [now </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation']</span><span class="font6"> I had had it in mind to write. Often when returning from battle we get such joy that we feel like letting off steam a bit, and a letter (if we are not too tired) is a good substitute for a chat in our circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Among the Jerry-Purana Wallas</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You mustn’t mind this typewriter. It docs some funny tricks sometimes, and, believe me, it has seen its day, and by rights should be ready for the jerry-purana walla, as the rag-and-bone merchant is called here. However, catch pioneers giving away such useful luxuries!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At present I am up here in Karachi (250,000 population), and have been with Pioneer Vanderbeek, working it for some two months, during which time we have managed to place about 2,000 pieces of literature. The Lord has surely been very bountiful in His blessings. In addition to this there have been 22 new subscribers for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.,</span><span class="font6"> which is a record for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">was here in 1933. When meeting many of those who took literature then, we ask if they have read them and whether they would like more, and some say they have only glanced through them, etc., but have been too busy— really an excuse for not having interested themselves. At first they are not interested in getting further literature. So out comes the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.,</span><span class="font6"> and after pointing out the underhand methods of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy’s engineering for world control through Fascism, and other things of general interest that may be appearing in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.,</span><span class="font6"> I suggest that' they subscribe for the journal; and this often arouses their interest, and they agree to subscribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Having quickened this interest, then I urge them to take the latest of Judge Rutherford’s works, together with his side of the proposed debate which the Roman Catholic Hierarchy funked accepting, and to determine for themselves as to what true Christianity involves and what the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allied religions really are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In most cases they take the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> and one or two booklets, including </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Protection.</span><span class="font6"> In one or two eases where I have returned already they have expressed their appreciation of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered.</span><span class="font6"> I am here referring particularly to business folks. In India, in order to see the European menfolk and many of the Indians in the big cities it is sometimes almost impossible to do so in their private residences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We do appreciate </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font6"> with its fearless exposing of the harlot’s activities. It’s a real treat to hear Van (my companion —he used to be a ship’s officer) give his deep nautical chuckles as he goes into tucks over the various tit-bits in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font6"> Yes, it is fine. It is hard for some of the Indians to understand, as many are so unfamiliar with events in America, etc., but there are many issues that I am sure they will appreciate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the great thing that we appreciate in the field here is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered,</span><span class="font6"> with its predecessor </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font6"> These two pieces are some of the finest weapons that we have for our warfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Where some cannot afford to contribute for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> they can at least take </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Is Uncovered</span><span class="font6"> doing a work, and a strange one at that? I guess some of these Catholic priests are cursing that booklet up hill and down dale. Opposition to their “church” they can meet by kidding their folks that it’s Communist, but exposure from the Word of the Almighty God is devastating and sweeping a way. their lies. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font6"> has let the light in on their racket, pueca.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pucca of Jerry-Purana Wallas</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This uncovering will surely begin to sap their revenue in course of time, and with the great multitude now growing stronger and taking their stand, they will feel the hand of Jehovah in His strange work. The fools who say -in their hearts, ‘There is no God who sees us,’ even as they sweep on to their zenith of power, when they will feel safe and secure from opposition, cannot stop His work of exposing their hiding place built on lies,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When they say “Peace and safety”, at the brink of Armageddon, and then get their premonition of'trouble even as a woman in the pangs of childbirth, may they remember the strange work Jehovah did during their ruthless ascent to power and realize that they are known as frauds, liars and hypocrites both by their lovers and by the Catholic population upon whose backs they have ridden; and may they remember the burden of the message which Jehovah commanded His servants to bear before them of His righteous judgment, that His first act (again strange to some) in Armageddon would be to destroy that city which they had built called “Babylon”, symbolic of their wicked organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are having a right royal time of it here. We have joined in the obedience to the command to ‘ ‘ rise up against [the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and ‘daughters’] in battle”, and are simply rejoicing in the thrills of battle, meeting many Roman Catholics who appreciate the truth and the books, even though they are getting sermons not to take them, and having notices put upon the “church” door. . The more they oppose, the more energy we will put into it ■ and if they think that we will tire of it, and reason that it’s best to let us get on with it, as they cannot contest the truth, then we get them both ways; for, whichever way they work to oppose, we get on with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">At the Stuttering Old Typewriter Again</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I’ve had pne or two cuts at finishing this letter since Starting. Guess you’ll have to take a day off to get through it; it’s a pity to lumber up your w.p.b. with it; however, it affords me a bit of pleasure in writing, so hope you don’t mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another month finished. Van and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font6"> had a very satisfactory month’s work. We managed to place 173 volumes, 1,149 booklets, and 35 vernacular booklets, and, in addition,, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font6"> subscriptions. We are finding many of the Catholics are quite tolerant and ready to listen but dread taking the books for fear of the priests; but after a few home truths as to why the priests don’t wish them to read, some of them pluck up courage. We let them see that “Protestants” who know their Bible are more responsible than those Catholics who don’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It’s the fear of being ostracized or excommunicated. In India—probably above most other places—religion spells social status, because it means that one belongs to a community. It’s not so bad in the big cities. The truth will soon set them free from such fears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One call last week brought me in contact with a Catholic. He had been at a friend’s house when a priest had been talking with them and had mentioned Judge Rutherford. Don’t know what was said, but can guess what the religious fraud said; anyway, this gentleman said he wanted to read the books to find out'all about it. I’ve got to sec him tomorrow, to find whether he will take any of the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[Later.</span><span class="font6"> At a sacrifice to himself he is taking </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">dll</span><span class="font6"> books and booklets by degrees. May the Lord open his eyes that he may take his stand.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Down in Goa the papers have carried notices that anyone having various books by Judge Rutherford would be excommunicated. What a bunch of mean and unmanly scallywags! Remember the blind man who was healed at the pool of Siloam, that when the man told the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■religious fellows where to get off they excommunicated him (John 9; 34, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">margin),</span><span class="font6"> and his parents before that had feared being put out of the synagogue by the “Jews”. Isn’t that the same cowardly action of the clergy in these days towards those who desire to have their eyes|ppen and to “sec”? “We’ll excommunicate you!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cheers of the Fighters</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Cheers! We have just received the “Uncovered”, etc., records and look forward to good results from use of these. Fine advent, the phonograph and records. While giving the lectures at a European’s house a week or two ’ back a friend of his turned up, and after hearing the lectures this friend took all the volumes, all the booklets, and subscribed for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font6"> Wasn’t that a cheering result?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What has got those folks who are a bit upset over the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font6"> cartoons? I think they are grand! What is the difference between reading a thing in characters which we call type and seeing a thing in sketch? They both do the same thing—convey an idea and knowledge to the mind, •</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is something like those who objected to the picture in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font6"> Book Two. John saw or was informed about a harlot being stripped, and said so in so many words. The illustration showed a woman being stripped, and further conveyed to the mind what the author had been writing in words. Moreover the picture conveyed the meaning in prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It reminds me of the type we sometimes meet, who in all seeming sincerity say that the Bible should not be read in certain parts because the authors state things which they consider too indecent to mention. Such is foolish reasoning. However, I guess the few who have written complaints about the cartoons are </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">very </span><span class="font6">few in number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Your giving publicity to the Salter affair </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[The G.A.</span><span class="font6"> No. 460] will surely do a good work; for it will put the faithful on guard more than ever (2 Timothy 3:9) and let all would-be traitors see that publicity follows any similar course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is very despicable, betraying a fiduciary</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NOVEMBER 17. 1937 </span><span class="font6">trust so willfully, and then turning round on Judge Rutherford like that; happily </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">Lord showed that such things must be expected, and we can continue knowing that His organization invisible has a cheek on all these things. Jesus said that ‘offenses must come, but woe be to those by whom they come’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From his letter in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tower</span><span class="font6"> Judge Rutherford shows that these things do not deter him one iota from following that course of loyalty and devotion in faithfulness to Jehovah. The Lord must love him for his faithfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have only just received our </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font6"> No. 460. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">fellow who gets it into his head that he is of great importance and therefore the Lord has a special w<sup>r</sup>ork for him more than likely has a big kink. Many mad folks believe they are somebody else or some special kind of creature. Lust for power like that shows a carnal mind, and it is just what those who are of the world seek; those who seek the wisdom, of this world desire it; and we are told that 'if any man among us seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise’, otherwise .this satanic temptation will draw one away and cause the lust to conceive and bring forth sin unto death. It is better to become </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">fool for Christ’s sake and bear His reproaches and thus gain the wisdom that comes from above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Best Antidote for a Swelled Bead</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If anyone has the idea that he is so important that the Lord has a special w'ork in store for him it would be well for him to ask for pioneer territory in New Jersey, or let him volunteer for the Irish Free State, or work some of the countries of Continental Europe, say a year or two dodging the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">concierges</span><span class="font6"> in Paris, etc., or smuggle himself in a tin trunk into Germany and do the important work of spreading the gospel of the Kingdom there, where our brethren carry on so bravely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Or, perhaps it won’t do any harm for him to volunteer for two or three years for a country like India, or any similar tropical country. Let him get at least two or three summers here, and give him ?ome big cities to work with a push bike, and let him get his hours in if pos-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">sible under a tropical sun; or put him in charge of a house-car, traveling over the plains, getting up at 6: 00 a.m. and often working under the blazing sun, and feeling pleased if he finds his daily work is finished by 8:30 or 9:00 p.m., keeping the bus in running order, away from signs of modern civilization sometimes; or give him the business houses to work, in the big cities, during the heat of the day, wearing a collar and tie, with all the underclothes soaked with sweat; or let him go to the Bombay office and observe the branch servant working every day, barring Sunday afternoon, from about 6:30 a.m. to 8; 00 p.m., with about two hours for meals, etc., carrying on single-handed generally, with office work, packing, transcription machine work, phonograph work, studies, and door-to-door witnessing, plus any “overtime” (in a stewing humidity all the year round, mostly).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let him have at least two or three summers here, and if this doesn’t knock the nonsense out of his head I don’t know what would. If after that he really had the Kingdom and organization instructions at heart he would end up with a sane outlook, realizing that he in himself amounts to nothing. He would then be one of the happiest men alive, because he had got on with the work he was told to do; and I bet that of his own volition he wouldn’t want to swap jobs with any man or covet the position occupied by another for anything, for the simple reason that he would be rejoicing at being faithful </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">where he was sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">He would realize in a humble way that although he had not perhaps beached the point of overcoming by resisting to the blood, he had at least overcome that far, and could give thanks for the victory in overcoming hitherto through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The alternative would be that he wouldn’t stick it. It is just what some dreamers who dream dreams of the time when the Lord will use them because of their great (self-imagined) importance cannot realize—that it is better to obey than to sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jesus Hid Not His Face—Isaiah 50: 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When we see the way in which Jesus and His apostles humbled themselves to obey God’s commandments and instructions, and the way in which His remnant, our fellow servants, likewise lay down their lives as living sacrifices, and read of the sterling example set by Judge Rutherford and others who are so very dear to us, it makes one sick to read of others so lazy, and when deliberate treachery comes into it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our covenant is to look to ourselves to see that we fulfill our commitments, and work out our own salvation with fear and trembling. When remembering David’s statement, “Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns . of the altar,” I realize how good the Lord is to bring us into His organization and give us the instructions which enable this to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are living sacrifices, and where we might perhaps go barging off at a tangent we find ourselves brought in line obeying instructions from the [Watch Tower] Society; this gives us great joy. We are duly presented as sacrifices inasmuch as we are carrying out the orders or obeying the commandments received from the Head, which we agreed to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Well, I hope you don’t mind all this rigmarole—but, as I said, it’s a good substitute for a chat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Demons Deceive Hindu Boy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Demons deceived a seven-year-old boy in India into thinking he is a reincarnation of a dead sheik. He went to a village he had never been in, called every one by the right name, recited the Koran, which he had never read, and unearthed coins which he claimed that he hid from his wife when he was the sheik Nuruddin. The account says that “he met and recognized his fifty-five-year-old ‘wife’, his ‘sons’ and ‘daughters’, and asked them questions of an intimate family nature”. In the dispatches there is no indication on the part of the public or the press of any understanding that this is all the work of devils, out to discredit the God of the Bible. The sheik Nuruddin is stone dead,.and well the devils know that to be the truth. The clergy know that, too, and if they would but tell the truth about it humanity would have some knowledge of facts with which to meet such phenomena.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Hindu Miscellany</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">From a Hindu Army Service Clerk . </span><span class="font6">♦ I have studied very carefully the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> by Judge Rutherford. I find that his works are straightforward, correct and proved </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font6">the Bible. His teachings are quite new to us, but so up to the mark as to demand that they be followed forthwith. Under the circumstances I would be very much obliged to know how I can become a member of this Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As regards myself, I am a retired head clerk of the India Army Service Corps, and a Roman Catholic for about 33 years. To my utter astonishment and bewilderment, I have now found the correct doctrine, and certainly now, and henceforth, all that is useless shall be quit forthwith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Silver and gold have I none, being one of the Lord’s poor, but what I have I place at the disposal of the Society. The solemn truth should be pointed out forcibly, and the wrongs done to the poor and uninformed should be corrected as soon as practicable by every one who knows of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Few here can read English, and the pamphlets in Urdu explain only certain subjects, but works like </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font6"> it is important should be translated into Urdu as soon as possible. If permission is granted to me to translate this work into Urdu I will certainly make efforts to do so, or along with any other person or persons. No charge will be made, and all clerical labor will be done by me. In ease the Society has already arranged this otherwise, then well and good, but, in any event, I am under orders and desire to be counted a coworker of the Society from now henceforth.—Walter Mahtab Khan.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ At a movie fire in Hyderabad, India, 60 women were caught in a balcony, with no way of escape.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">♦ A Hindu wateh repairer, a former Roman Catholic, now rejoices in the truth, because of the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font6"> From his far-off home in India B, J. Kutino wrote to the Bombay Watch Tower branch office:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">I, the undersigned, until now spent all my life (which is a gift from Jehovah the eternal) in ignorance, owing to the fact that my elders, as well as myself, were in the Devil’s organization. But how can I stay any more in it, after knowing of the truth as you have brought it to me? So, brethren, help me, now, to give the good news about God and His works to my fellow men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is now some days since I had the privilege of obtaining some of your publications from the hands of Brother Abhistekam, who gave me good advice as to how to find out God and walk in ways pleasing to Him. He also gave me information as to how you are helping many people who are really in need of help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brethren, I do not know how many of you are engaged in this work, but I know you are very few, as you are teaching what is right. I would like to co-operate with you, but I really do not know much about God’s holy Word; I was not free to look into the wonderful works of Jehovah, as I was kept in darkness by the leaders of my Boman Catholic church, and also by my elders. But now, after reading the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font5"> I know that I am no more to be a babe in their hands, and I will no longer hear their worthless words.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Hindu Miners Get 12c a Day</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Workers in Hindu coal mines now receive not more than 5 annas (12c) a day, which is half what they received six years ago. But they now spend for drink twice what they did then, and the Government has fixed it so they can get four to five times as much liquor for a given sum. Result: The coal miners now drink eight to ten times as much liquor as formerly and have absolutely nothing to live upon at any time in the week except two meals of rice a day, with a little dal (Hindu split peas). To get one bound book telling about God’s kingdom, earth’s only hope, necessitates that the Hindu give up his entire earnings for two whole days. Yet some of them do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Demonism Advertised in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily Eagle </span><span class="font6">♦ The Brooklyn </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Eagle,</span><span class="font6"> which, under a former management, showed great animosity against Jehovah’s people, recently published a five-column article advertising the claims of the demons that reincarnation is going on in various parts of the world. The dispatch, sent from Ceylon by the special correspondent of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Eagle,</span><span class="font6"> narrates the story of the demonized girl Kumari Shanti Devi, of Delhi, who claims to have previously died in childbirth. She “identified” her former ‘husband’ and wanted to return to him. The demons had told her all the outstanding circumstances of his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Eagle,</span><span class="font6"> nonplussed, also told of a bride in Budapest who, with her husband, visited the castle where, she claimed, she had been murdered in a previous “incarnation”. At length the room was found, locked tightly for years. She told where the key would be found. The room was opened and there lay the skeleton, and by its side a rusty dagger. When she saw it she fainted. These stories, retailed by the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Eagle,</span><span class="font6"> must be strange mental food for it and for its readers. No explanation is offered except reincarnation, which is opposed by every word of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Female Swastika in Litigation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ At Fort William, Bengal, two Hindus made a metal female swastika of eight different metals piled on top of one another, set it up in a room and began worshiping it. Later, land was dedicated to the idol by a deed and litigation arose. The High Court finally decided that the idol was to get only the property specified in the deed, but was to get the income from another part. Of course a priest does all the monkey business for the idol, like burning incense, making offerings and getting his hooks on the cash.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Jesuits Back in Portuguese India</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Pursuant to their course of conquering the entire world for the Roman Hierarchy, the Jesuits are returning in power to Goa, Portuguese India, from which, for the good of the country, they were expelled 200 years ago. A new seminary, to house 500, is being built.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>The Moneylenders of India</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ India’s moneylenders are down to even as low a level as those of New York .city or Brooklyn. A report in the Manchester </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font6"> after citing recent forcing down of wages, and Government attempts to boost its revenues from drink and opium, prefaces its description of streets or public sewers three feet wide and single-room tenements for five persons, with the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Indebtedness is another widespread evil, and wherever I went it was the same report: almost everyone in debt, 75 to 150 percent being the usual rate of interest, though in a recent case the incredibly high figure of 2,300 percent was mentioned. The Kabuli or the Marwari moneylender still flourishes in every center of industry, whatever legislation, may be introduced or intended to put down the evil. The workers cannot do without loans, and, strangely, perhaps, there is among them a fairly high code of honor in regard to loans; To supplement it the Kabuli, naturally endowed with a stronger physique than the men of the plains, is never without his big stick, the &quot;lathi”, which he does not hesitate to use when gentler methods prove ineffective.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>The Sorrows of India</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The Indian correspondent of the Manchester </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font6"> summing up a few of the many sorrows of the Hjndu people, says: .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In India there are in a year fifty to a hundred million eases of malaria alone; and hookworm, tuberculosis and venereal disease all count their victims by the million, not to mention other ailments. The worst forms of exploitation of labor go without any legislative cheek whatever. Children of five and six work for ten to twelve hours a day in beedy (the indigenous cigarette) factories, with no holidays, on two qr three shillings a month.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>500 Fire-Walkers in Ceylon</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Demonism is getting ever bolder. At Colombo, Ceylon, 500 persons, including a woman, walked across red-hot coals without showing any traces of burns. The demons understand methods of insulating flesh from hot surfaces. This knowledge is common to all the angels, good and bad. Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego were insulated against harm in the furnace heated seven times as hot as was usual. •—Daniel 3.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>* Marquette’s Inducement to Tourists</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The municipality of Marquette, Michigan; acting with wisdom to make the city attractive to tourists, serves electricity for the tourist camp, spring water, a fine community hall and tables, electricity for cooking, cold and hot water shower bath, and a fine park for campling, all for 25c per day; 50c for three days; $1 per week. With commercial light rates 5c per kilowatt-hour, and cooking rates only 1c per kw-h, the Marquette municipal plant last year made a profit of over $100,000,</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>How to Save Gasoline</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Rules for saving gasoline, put out by the, Pontiac Motor Company, are, to accelerate gently, keep the foot steady, hold the car in second gear no longer than necessary, try to coast to a gradual stop, keep tires inflated, avoid long idling of engine, test spark plugs frequently, keep car and crankcase well lubricated, keep radiator filled, watch the pointer of the seasonal control on the intake and manifold heater and have the motor tuned up every 5,000 miles.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Modern Roadbuilding</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ A mile of new road a day is made by the road-building machine of the Barber-Green Company of Rockford, Illinois. Of course, this is possible only in sandy, flat, dry regions. The desert sand is picked up and carried by elevators to a platform where fine stone, stone dust and liquid asphalt are added and mixed. The mixture is spread out mechanically and the machine moves slowly forward on a road twenty feet wide made by itself.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Alt-Canadian Route</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The Canadian Government has again announced the All-Canadian Route—Winnipeg to Vancouver—but explains that there is still a gap, known as the “Big Bend” highway between Golden, B.C., and Revel stoke, B.C. (90 miles), over which the automobiles are carried by rail.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>“Alcohol Drivers” in Illinois</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Eighty percent of the fatal automobile accidents in Illinois in 1936 were attributed to “alcohol drivers” and 6 percent to “alcohol pedestrians”. The figures which bring these items to light also show that though traffic deaths in the United States were at </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">new high of 37,800, fatal injuries in the home were 700 in excess of even that high figure. So the conclusion arises that, after all, home is the most dangerous place, and the most likely causes of injuries are falling down stairs, slipping in the bathtub, electric shocks, scaldings, poisonings, burns and cuts from kitchen utensils.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>The World’s Greatest Bridge</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The $77,000,000 bridge over San Francisco Bay is 8| miles over water and 3 miles over land, rising to a height of 216 feet. Twenty-four men were killed, and 1,157 injured, in the three years in which the bridge was in construction. It is expected to pay for itself in twenty years. The cables of the bridge, 28| inches thick, weigh a ton for every foot. Each is made up of 17,464 wires about as thick as </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">lead pencil. Four of the towers are as large as the Woolworth Building, A fifth contains enough concrete to build the Empire State Building.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>A Modern Marvel</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The Golden Gate bridge, 4,200 feet between piers, has the longest span and the tallest towers of any bridge ever built by man. Each of the 746-foot towers is the equivalent of a sixty-story building. Over 100,000 tons of steel were used in the construction of the bridge.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Disloyal French Troops in Morocco</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">♦ The Week,</span><span class="font6"> privately circulated London newspaper, usually extremely accurate, declares that in French Morocco are many French troops who openly declare their intention to follow in France Franco’s course in Spain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The French Fascist Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The French Fascist law that &quot;any writer who insults the heads of foreign governments or their foreign ministers is liable to fine and imprisonment&quot; was slipped into the government’s proposals by the then Premier Laval without his colleagues’ knowing anything whatever of it. This indicates a crooked, and probably Jesuit, origin of the &quot;emergency&quot; law or rule, and ends a free press in France. The world is going Fascist (Catholic-Action-wise) by leaps and bounds.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ Without a word of truth in the story the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Mail’s</span><span class="font6"> correspondent in Paris was ordered to fix up and send to London what was published there in Lord Rothermerc’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Dispatch</span><span class="font6"> with a triple banner line across the front page to the effect that Franco was in chaos, tourists were afraid for their lives, France had gone Bolshevik, etc. The correspondent, when reproved by the French Government for sending out such manifest and complete falsehoods, admitted that he had been ordered by Lord Roth ormer e to send the story.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The Maginot line of forts between France and Germany costs France £40,000,000 a year, but she feels that she can afford it, ever since she welehcd on her repayments to the United States of money loaned since the World War ended. The line contains 300 forts, extending to 80 feet beneath the ground, stored with food and wine sufficient to last ten years. On the surface are the nests for machine guns and heavy guns which can be fired by radio. On the next floor down are the living quarters, equipped with all comforts and conveniences, including movies and soft drink parlors. The fourth floor down contains the railroads which emerge on the surface 60 miles behind the lines. The store rooms arc on the third floor down. Elevator service is provided at all the-forts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">France Wants Larger Population</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ France wants a larger population, for the reason that the Lerman population is growing and the French population is shrinking. The French Government now bestows d o w e r i c s of $600 on good girls of the poorer classes, between the ages of 21 and 30, provided they marry within three years after the dow-ery is assigned. Reduced railway fares are given to large fam i 1 i es, Public e m-ployees are awarded increases in their pay with every increase in their families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">French Disgusted with Their Newspapers </span><span class="font6">♦ The French, disgusted with their newspapers, are trying to sco what can be done to make them less venal. Up'till now it has been easy for anybody w-ith money to purchase what should not be for sale at any price. Influential newspapers of Paris received subsidies from munition makers. In the midst of the World War Germany bought one of the four largest papers in the city. News is colored to suit the views of the proprietors—and that is common in llcarstdom, too.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Mass Hypnotism in the Lille Refinery</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ In the first attack of mass hypnotism in the Lille (France) sugar refinery, four hundred women were working in a large well-aired room when one woman fell unconscious. There was no gas emanation to cause the collapse. In a few moments 200 women were in convulsions; some fainted; some tore the clothing and scratched the faces of others. All the women affected were between the ages of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">16 </span><span class="font6">and 20.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Mass Faintings in France</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Mass faintings occurred at Lille, France, all among girls 16 to 20 years of age. In the first instance 200 girls fell to the floor while older workers in the same sugar refinery were unaffected. Ten days later 70 more girls swooned while a physician was endeavoring to explain to them how not to do so. The cause of the faintings is unknown. Quite probably it is mass hypnotism, another form of demonism.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>Protestant Burial Places in France</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ In the Protestant districts in central France, around Poitou and Saintonge, for many generations, the dead are buried on the farms where they were born, and where they lived and loved and worked and hoped. There are few tombstones. The burial lots are the size of a room, fifty yards from the house, with enclosing hedges and a cypress tree at each corner.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>The Labor Government in France</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The Labor government in France has given the workers a 40-hour week, collective labor contracts, paid vacations, ample damages for discharge, compulsory arbitration governmentally supervised, minimum wages, recognition of workers’ rights to organize, and the right to strike. Sit-down strikes have been declared illegal, but have taken place.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>More Workers on French Railways</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ French railways are now on a 40-hour-week basis, thus providing employment for 60,000 additional workers. Train and engine service employees must have a 40-hour rest period once every seven days, and every railway employee must have at least ten Sundays or legal holidays a year.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>Does Anybody Believe This?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ In the latter part of the year 1935, at Dinan, France, it is alleged that rain fell which actually tasted like wine. The explanation offered is that minute bits of fruit were eaught up by winds passing over the vineyards, underwent fermentation in the heated upper air, and fell as rain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Located Nearly 6 in 100 of Those Slain </span><span class="font6">♦ By trinkets found on their persons, or other means, 17,000 soldiers were identified out of the 300,000 buried in Douaumont cemetery, France, where the 400,000 killed at Verdun largely lie. Recently 100,000 exsoldiers of 16 nations met at these graves swearing to preserve the peace.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>Stoned to Death Because of His Hair</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ At Lyon, France, eight-year-old Paul Gignoux was stoned to death by fifteen small boys and girls, none of them over ten years of age, all because his mother had refused to cut his hair. Very evidently demons were at the bottom of this.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>French Stand by Their Government</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The French people stand by their Socialist government. Not since 1871 have they rushed to the defense of their country as in their subscriptions to the 10,500,000,000-frane loan. The oversubscription was so great that many banks had to turn part of the crowds away.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Sunday Work in Quarry</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ At a Catholic school at Souillac, Francei, on Sunday, October 20, sixteen pupils were being punished by forced work in a stone quarry; there was a slippage of rock and five of the little folks were killed, one of them being literally cut in two.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Rebel Bombardment of Durango</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Rebel bombardment of Durango, Spain, ■was arranged for the hour of the morning mass. The Basque population of that city was solidly for the regularly elected republican government. It is also solidly Roman Catholic, and hence went to morning mass. The special targets were the churches. The Rebels flew </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">12 </span><span class="font6">large bombers over Durango three times at intervals of fifteen minutes, bombing the churches and machine-gunning the worshipers. Sixty were slain and 150 injured ; 25 bodies were recovered from one church; 12 nuns were slain in one convent. The pope wants Franco to win, and no doubt secretly chuckled over what happened at Durango.</span></p>

Some of them gave np and lay down by the roadside to wait for death. Tlie children had bloodstained rags wrapped around their arms and legs. There were children without shoes. Their feet were swollen to twice their size. This terrible journey by foot took most of them five days, with barely any food, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">with cruisers shooting from the sea and Hebei warplanes bombing the</span><span class="font5"> road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Transcript</span><span class="font5"> says, &quot;Franco's </span><span class="font6">God is the God of the Catholics.” This truthful statement, made by this Hartford (Conn.) paper, contains grim humor of which the editor who made the statement knows not.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Setting the United States Government an example of courage and honesty, 98 American writers joined in a manifesto in which they said :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We cannot keep silent when war becomes a slaughter of the unarmed, the innocent and </span><span class="font4">the </span><span class="font5">helpless.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Courage of Madrid</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The courage of Madrid is the talk of the world. After the city was assailed by airplanes for one year, street cars were running as usual, motor traffic, was dense, market gardeners were busy as ever, the town was regularly cleaned, the water supply was abundant and excellent, the people were in excellent health and they did not wish to leave. The normal population of the city, 1,20(1,000, was increased by 300,000 refugees from territory overrun by the Hierarchy’s Moorish army under Franco.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">As everybody knows, Ambrose Hatti, present pope of Rome, went out of his way to bless the Moorish, Italian and German army of Franco the Butcher. Just* to have it in the record as to what it was he blessed, the following is a translation of a statement made by the Madrid College of Lawyers regarding the conduct of Franco’s troops:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In many of these villages women would form long queues outside the baker shops, and the Fascist airmen were pleased to drop bombs on these crowds of defenseless women. Many pregnant women were forced to drink a mixture of castor oil and petrol. One of these in Algeciras, whose husband they discovered had fled to Gibraltar, was made to drink a large quantity of the stuff and then allowed to join her husband. She died the next day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ Testimony adduced in New York showed 12 nurses in Bellevue hospital required to take care of 2,000 patients. In another municipal hospital 19 babies died out of 50 assigned to one nurse, simply because it was physically impossible for her to feed and otherwise care for that number of infants. Meantime, there are millions of honest and capable women who are out of work.

In 1935 the state fund wrote 28.6 percent of the total premiums in the state for industrial compensation, at a saving to the policyholders of about $3,000,000 and to the taxpayers of about $145,000.</span></p>

And in spite of all this the Roman Hierarchy is flooding newspapers, radio and every other means of publicity with the most awful prognostications of what will happen right away unless Communism is curbed. The whole thing is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">camouflage, a smoke screen, a blind.

One wonders just how it happened that men of this stripe managed to get themselves put in position of “Investigators”, It is like appointing a bank robber to become a bank inspector.

The river flows through 92 miles of tunnel through the solid rock, one of the tunnels being 13 miles in length. All in all, the Colorado Aqueduct passes through 340 miles until its waters are lost in the Pacific ocean at Santa Monica—unless they are first used to water the garden spot of creation, Santa Ana, Anaheim, Fullerton, Long Beach, Torrance, Compton, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Burbank, Glendale, Pasadena, San Marino and their environs.

The hand of the Devil is plainly to be seen in this whole matter. It started by a spiritist crook ordaining ministers and even bishops at from $10 to $40 each. As a matter of fact, the human ordination of every one of the 207 varieties of clergymen is worth nothing at all, and the state could not guarantee any of them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Q</span><span class="font6">UESTION : &quot;Who is the greatest public enemy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Answer: Satan the Devil is God’s opposer and man’s worst enemy, and his religious agents who operate the various religious systems are the worst enemies amongst men. They </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font6">the worst because they reproach the name of God and lead the people into error and darkness. While keeping the people in ignorance of the truth religionists operate the most destructive and devastating racket that has ever been practiced. For more than five thousand years religion has been the chief instrument used by the Devil to deceive the people. Today religion is apparently a refined way of carrying on a racket by which the people are robbed of their money, their peace of mind, and their hope for the future. Into the religious organizations are drawn many persons who are induced to believe that such religious organizations are necessary for the welfare of mankind, and thus many good, honest people are deceived by religion and are caused to act as the Devil’s agents, and consequently they are the enemies of themselves and enemies of their fellow men. By means of religion the Devil has caused the people to become very superstitious, and by means of polities he has caused the people to submit to the theories advanced by religionists and to be governed by selfish men, and by means of commerce he has caused the people to be robbed of their hard earnings by men who have bestowed no labor upon the great wealth that they use. For these reasons here assigned the religious leaders are the greatest public enemies to be found amongst the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Question: Is the real choice of the people today one of choosing Fascism as against Communism, or vice versa, or as against democracy, or as against what?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Answer; The emphatic answer to that question is No. Fascism, Communism, Nazism, and so-called “democracy” are all organized and operated by the same selfish and wicked ' element composed of religion, politics, and commerce, and all are against the real interests of the people. All of such organizations have been brought forth under the subtle supervision of the Devil. Now the time has come for the people to be informed of the truth, and they must choose between wicked rulers amongst men and Christ Jesus, the righteous Ruler. It is utterly impossible for any political organization, whether the same be Communism, Fascism, or Roman Catholicism, to bring any lasting relief to the people. This is necessarily true because all of such organizations have been brought forward by the Devil. The only hope for the human race is the kingdom of God under Christ Jesus, and ■fell those who are informed of the truth and who accept and obey it will receive the blessings of the Lord, including that of life everlasting. That which is of greatest importance to man is life. The brief period of existence that man now enjoys is filled with sorrow. Under the righteous reign of Christ Jesus the obedient ones will be brought up to a state of perfection and live for ever on earth. Concerning Jehovah the Father and Christ Jesus the Son and His kingdom it is written: “The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of' God abideth on hirm” (Jolin 3; 35,36) Thus it is seen that those who choose Christ Jesus as their Lord, Redeemer, and Master, and obey Him, have life; the others have not. God caused His prophet to write in His Word, the Bible, the following for the instruction of men who desire to choose the right way: “ Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread [for such things as prayers to be said by Catholic priests upon the pretext that such prayers will get your loved ones out of ‘purgatory’, or save you some time in 'purgatory ’] ? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David. Behold, I have given him [Christ Jesus] for a witness to the people, a leader' and commander to the people.” (Isaiah 55:1-4) Under the command of the Lord Jehovah God, His witnesses are now going through the earth to inform the people of the great change that is taking place, namely, that Satan’s organization has reached a climax and that the kingdom of God under Christ is here. To these men and women, who do not practice religion but who are true Christians following Christ Jesus, Jehovah God gives this command, to wit: “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.' ’—Isaiah 62; 10.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>Statement and Protest</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH’S witnesses in convention assembled at Columbus, Ohio, acknowledging their gratitude to Almighty God for the privilege of giving witness to His name, do declare as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nineteen centuries ago Jesus declared it His mission and purpose in coming into the world to give testimony to the truth. All Christians, footstep followers of Jesus, are commissioned and directed to give witness unto the truth from place to place and house to house. (Isaiah 61:1,2; Matthew 10:7,12; 24:14; 1 Corinthians 9:16) For any government,'local, state or national, to interfere with such proclamation of the truth either by application of existing laws, enactment of new legislation, or unlawful action of public officers under color of law, is to defy the supremacy of God’s law and impotently oppose the purposes of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On May 17, 1936, Jehovah’s witnesses in pursuance of the aforementioned commands to preach the gospel, visited the residents of the city of Lagrange, Ga., at their homes to give testimony to the Kingdom message of Almighty God. While so engaged and while violating no law they were arrested by police officers of the city and 176 of them were incarcerated in prison. This unlawful and malicious interference was conducted under the direction of city officials, particularly the mayor, chief of police and city attorney. Those three officers conspired and schemed together to carry forward their unlawful purpose and were instigated thereto by religious leaders both Catholic and Protestant, and as a result thereof they committed the following wicked, .illegal, malicious and barbarous acts against Jehovah’s witnesses:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. Unlawfully arrested and imprisoned 176 who had violated no law.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. Incarcerated men and women in the same room.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">3. Assaulted, beat and struck many of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">4. Instigated and directed a mob of lawless toughs and thugs to assault, beat up, kidnap and deny the right of assembly and petition to Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">5. By the use of legal trickery and techni-cahties caused 78 Christian people to be convicted of violating a local commercial ordinance; caused many of them to labor as common criminals on the chain gang; imposed cruel and unusual punishments upon them, such as long and arduous hours of labor, serving them with rotten and wormy food in filthy jail surroundings ; afflicted them with violent threats, abuse and torture.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">These acts were not done in the interest of law and order, but for the definite and specific purpose of preventing Jehovah’s witnesses from bringing to the people of Lagrange the message of God’s kingdom as set forth in His Word, the Bible. In so doing, the officials of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lagrange have acted as tools and agents of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in its program to eradicate Christianity and the true worship of Jehovah God from the face of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sueh malfeasance of office we vigorously protest against, and denounce this unlawful, vicious and wicked persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. The actions of Lagrange officials are contrary to the law of God, which is supreme and above all laws made by human creatures. They are violative of the fundamental law of the land as inscribed by Federal and State constitutions. They are opposed to the spirit of freedom and liberty which has abounded in the United States from its birth to this present time. The name of Lagrange has become a stench in the nostrils of decent people as a result of the malicious acts of the tyrants who manage its affairs. Any municipality that will permit and acquiesce in the malignant persecution of Christian people is a menace and a danger to the freedom of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses have covenanted with Jehovah God to obey His commands to preach the gospel of the Kingdom to all nations and peoples. Regardless of the unwarranted opposition of this unholy trinity of Lagrange dictators, they will continue to serve Jehovah God in Lagrange as in other portions of the earth. Their reliance and confidence is in Almighty God, who has declared that all who oppose Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are wicked and will in due time be destroyed.— Psalm 145:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, their public press, and their fanatical agents wrongfully . and maliciously accuse Jehovah’s witnesses of being allied with Communists and other subversive organizations, well knowing that such charge is wholly untrue. For more than half a century last past Jehovah’s witnesses have consistently given testimony concerning the name and the kingdom of Almighty God under Christ Jesus and never one word uttered or act done by'them has had any reference to political affairs or could be properly construed as having reference thereto. Their interest is not in the polities of this world, and certainly in no political party. Their sole and only interest is to inform the people of God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus, which is the only hope of the human race, as plainly declared in God’s Word, the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is the religious organizations headed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy that are devoted to politics and are now in a conspiracy to seize complete control of the United States and rule it by a dictator in like manner as Germany is now ruled. We warn the people who love liberty and righteousness against this vicious encroachment of the religio-political power operating from the Vatican, Rome.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">From -well-informed sources we learn that veritable consternation was occasioned among the representatives of the British dominions and some of the democratic small states of Europe by the almost ostentatious brotherliness displayed by Mr. Eden during the coronation festivities towards the representatives of Rome and Berlin. On one occasion he was seen to fold them both in a jolly embrace, which was not extended to the representatives of any other powers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Britain is in a fever of preparation for another world war, and as a consequence the iron and steel business is on the boom.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Mui Tsai Slaves in Shanghai</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Rather than kill their little girl babies, for whom they are unable to provide, it is the custom of the very poor, all over China, to sell the little ones as slaves to those who are able to have such luxuries. It is estimated that there were not less than 20,000 of these little girl slaves in the city of Shanghai alone. The abuse of these little girls is common, and great numbers of them are forced into prostitution, but if the slave owners are respectable people they are supposed, when the child reaches maturity, to see that she is honorably married, and to provide some dowry.</span></p>

Hereafter, when burglars are engaged in their work of opening bank vaults, and helping themselves to the contents, it will be in order for them to distribute tracts in the neighborhood that they are helping the people to get rid of their wicked bankers.

<p><span class="font6">♦ China’s trunk-line railroad from Canton in the south to Peiping in the north has been completed, and it is now possible to go all the way from Canton to Paris by rail. In addition to this great forward step in transportation, the last ten years have seen 50,000 miles of highways opened to motor traffic.

<p><span class="font6">♦ Progressive Norway is so far ahead of the United States that there is no comparison. She has had state workmen’s insurance for 43 years and owned all her own railways for 47 years. Over her state-owned telephone lines a 15-minute conversation for a distance of 430 miles costs 12 cents. The interest on farm mortgages is 3 percent in the state banks. State-owned electric plants light the country from end to end, including the highways. State-owned hospitals provide free care for the poor. The schools are the best in the world. Norway has had state, fire, theft, tornado and marine insurance for 40 years, and unemployment insurance for 12 years, and has virtually no crime. Evidently the Scandinavian countries believe in doing things without too much ballyhoo. America makes much noise about progress and leadership, but she is definitely in the red, and the main quality for which it is noted seems to be more hot air than substantial and carefully planned, lasting progress. Norway’s progress is real.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Yon never see comic strips of murders and crimes in Swedish newspapers, or hear radio plays on that subject in my country. No children are running around with toy pistols playing hold-up, and the American type of gangster and bawdy-house movies are not shown.

<p><span class="font6">♦ The silly rules of royalty appear in Sweden, where two sons of King Gustav wed girls of their own choice, one the daughter of a Berlin businessman, the other the daughter of a Swedish businessman, and lost their royal status. The one who married a German commoner regains his royal status by a new law, but the one who married a Swedish commoner does not. Thus, in royal Sweden a German girl is superior to a Swedish girl; and, incidentally, the Swedish royal family is French.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Dispatches from Belgrade state that whenever Jehovah’s witnesses are caught “their phonographs, records and pamphlets are confiscated and the owners imprisoned”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The police are too crooked for words. They beat up a procession of Greek priests and then gave out a statement that they had been putting down a Communist demonstration. The only truth in this statement is the blatant claim of the Roman Hierarchy that everything on earth that opposes it is “Communism”,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Within a few minutes after the concordat with Rome w’as passed by the lower house, the patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church died from blood poisoning. He had been active in opposing the concordat which puts the Roman Church, with 30 percent of the population, in a more favorable position than the Orthodox Church, which claims 50 percent. The rumor is current in Serbia that he was poisoned to get rid of him. This is supported by the fact that his two brothers became mysteriously and dreadfully ill at the same time and their lives were feared for. When it was learned that the patriarch would not survive the night, the three readings of the treaty required by law were rushed through jn ten minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The concordat obligates the government to see to it that the children of mixed marriages are brought up Roman Catholics, no matter what changes may take place in the religion of the parents. Lawbreakers among the clergy may be tried by the clergy themselves, Where Roman Catholics are in a majority in a school, all the children in that school are to be taught the Roman Catholic “faith”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All members of the government that voted for the concordat were excommunicated by the Orthodox Church, rendering all their subsequent acts constitutionally illegal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">R</span><span class="font6">ECENTLY it was my privilege to conduct a study meeting in the home of a newly interested couple. One of the features was so amusing and interesting that I am passing it on so you may have a good laugh, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The man of the house had recently fallen out with the Baptist “church”, which caused quite a disturbance amongst the “principals”. Having learned that study meetings were being held in the home of this “erring brother’ ’, one of the preachers delegated himself to call at his home, and it was meeting night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At 7:45 the “Dr.” arrived and, having introduced himself to the ones present by presenting his card, he immediately proceeded to take over the meeting as a matter of course. He opened up by asking each one individually as to denominational affiliations. He received from one the answer that he was a Baptist but was at present studying with the Watch Tower people, as he wanted the truth. Another stated that he had been with the Salvation Army but was positive that he had at last found the truth. Lastly I was asked and I responded that I did not believe in religion or denominations, but belonged to the true church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “Dr.” then cleared his throat rather noisily with a few ‘H’ms’ thrown in and proceeded with the statement that before continuing he would like to be assured that we accepted the whole Bible and that during the meeting we would stick closely to the question matter being entertained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the preliminaries I quietly opened my phonograph and slipped on a male quartet, and promptly at 8 p.m. I called the meeting to order, introducing the song, to be followed by thirty minutes study on “Rebellion”, then thirty minutes on “Riches”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the conclusion of the song, the “Reverend” said, “I see you have some beautiful ‘hymns’ recorded,” and before he had a chance to continue, a brother was called upon to ask the Lord’s blessing. Things were now moving smoothly and at a merry clip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Immediately began the .recorded lecture “Rebellion”, and then the “Dr.’s” temperature began to rise. For four and a half min-* utes he squirmed, shuffled, coughed, grunted, and constantly cleared his throat. Finally, when the lecture came to a close, he gave out a loud bellow, demanding to know what this was all about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">then distributed copies of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Luz da Verdade,</span><span class="font6"> containing a Portuguese translation of the lecture, to each one and called on one of the brethren to read the opening paragraph, I also assured the preacher that his question -would be answered as the meeting progressed. After the paragraph was read, questions </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font6">invited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One asked the question as to the reason why Jehovah permitted the Devil to continue after the rebellion. The ‘ ‘ Dr. ’ ’ broke in then, loudly saying that the question was blasphemy and that nobody has the right to question God. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">took it for granted that he was asking a question, so turned the same over to the meeting for answers. Several expressed that they </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font6">lieved it all right to ask such questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I then referred to Exodus 9:16, which was read, and closed the discussion with the statement that inasmuch as Jehovah deemed it necessary and profitable to record the reason for this permission, that fact invites grounds also for question by the creature. T,he one </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font6">had first asked the question stated that he was satisfied with the answers given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Up sprang the “Dr.”, demanding his </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">hat, </span><span class="font6">saying that he could not and would not meet with devils, loudly proclaiming that the meeting was nothing less than a union of witchcraft workers, and “that man [referring to me] is the chief devil and wizard”. Then pointing to the phonograph, he loudly denounced the same as the deadliest of cobras and a fetish box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the ladies spoke up, saying to the “Reverend”: “I have known you heretofore as a kind, pleasing and holy man, but you have manifested here the spirit much like Satan, himself. My eyes are at last opened.” Poor “Doctor”; that was just too much. He stomped out, and the meeting continued.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">Hitler chose guns instead of butter, and “as the rearmament program draws to a close, unemployment and undernourishment must be the lot of the German people. . . . He has mortgaged the future and depleted the resources inherited from the past. * . . Germany is paying the price—a steady decline in the people’s standard of living. . . . When Hitler came into power, Germany had less than 5,000 officials for “economic control”. Now there are over 50,-000.

<p><span class="font16">Germany’s economic ills have been accentuated by an extravagance unequaled in almost any other country. There is no check on Nazi party expenditures. The million Storm Troopers have cost $800,000,000 since the Nazis got power. The Gestapo secret police number 25,000, plus clerical employes, and nobody knows what they cost. The Labor Front, which replaced the old trade unions, has 55,000 officials—many times more than the unions ever had. All German workers give up 6 percent of their pay in “voluntary” contributions—$720,000,000 a year—and have no control over expenditure of this money. What the Nazis do with it is one of the greatest mysteries.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">The measure of Nazi depravity is pretty well illustrated by an article in the Stettiner </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">General-Anzeig er</span><span class="font17"> wherein the imprisonment of three of Jehovah’s witnesses for being faithful to their God was sandwiched in between T</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">two stories, one of a Jew for wearing pants that looked too much like those of the Hitler</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Youth spittoon-cleaners, and the other of the conviction of two men for the form of sex crimes that is all the Nazi rage. The object of the Nazi rag, of course, was to drag the name of decent and honest, upright, Christian people in the dust by putting them in bad company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Flag Worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Herr Baldur von Shirach, leader of the Hitler Youth movement, in a speech at Ham-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">burg, Germany, set the Nazi flag up as an object of worship, in the following pronun-ciamento:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Our youth have always seen in their flag something more than the symbol of a mass organization with millions of members. They have regarded it as an emblem of the divine, and the visible sign of the Providence which led us to power and victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dare Not Even Send Out Stamps</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In their desperation, the Hitler gang have ordered that no valuables of the value of more than 10s. may be sent out of Germany, under penalty of death. In carrying out this law, it has been decided that rare postage stamps are valuables, arrests have been made and deaths are possible for such a seemingly harmless thing as sending a handful of used postage stamps out of the madhouse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lands in Hands of Church</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The Nazi party headquarters issued statistics showing that 27 percent of all German lands are in the hands of churches and large landholders. About 2,470,000 acres are owned by the religious organizations, and the Nazis are now demanding that this acreage be surrendered to the state, for the benefit of the poor.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>Germany</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Lichtenburg Concentration Camp </span><span class="font6">♦ In the Lichtenburg concentration camp, •three recaptured prisoners were beaten to death. In the coldest weather those most offensive to the Nazi regime were confined to dark cells, deprived of wash water for four weeks, and compelled to lie on stone with only a filthy horseblanket to cover them. Further details arc from the Manchester </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prison camp he found worse than Liehten-burg. Flogging was not among the official punishments, but there were, he writes, all the more unofficial assaults. The prisoners were struck in the face, and they often showed wounds from, bayonet blows. It is characteristic that in one case the doctor took rather seriously a wound more than, eight inches long—till he knew the cause. His customary comment ori these wounds was: “You cannot have behaved as you should.” If the guard was dissatisfied with the condition of a dormitory, the prisoners had to stand in the open, in their shirts, for two hours—usually in rain. The result, during my time in the camp, says my friend, was 36 deaths from pneumonia. Sick men who collapsed at their work on tho moors were left lying in the rain till evening. The usual result was death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Punishment for insufficient work and for “malingering” was three to six months in the punishment company. Here the prisoners had to cart sand through the wet earth of the moor from dawn to dark without pause. They were more mishandled than any others, and to get some respite from these horrors prisoners would allow a full lorry to crush one of their feet or otherwise get themselves so seriously injured that, for a time at least, even the guards could not get work out of them. Two prisoners were shot. The cause of death was entered as “internal hajmorrhagc”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prisoners receive 25 pfennig (say about 3d.) daily as payment, and are allowed to spend 20 pfennig in the canteen. If we bought margarine Wo received an inferior quality but paid the highest price. The canteen officer is allowed to make money out of his job. The sum accumulated from the 5 pfennig retained by the authorities is supposed to be handed to the prisoners on leaving. Tho State is also required by law to pay the fare home of the prisoners. What actually happens is that the retained sums are used by the State towards the payment of the fares. State expenditure grows in another way, for the camps along the Dutch frontier have had their guards doubled. Saturday and Sunday were supposed to be used for keeping the camp in order, hut actually we worked on every Saturday and on some Sundays on the moor. For this extra work we received nothing, though the department responsible for the moor drainage paid for it. At times the guards got prisoners to steal for them. If they were caught they were punished, and were in addition beaten by the guard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In summer we rose at three o’clock, and dug on the moor (usually standing in water), with intervals of ten minutes for breakfast and thirty minutes for dinner, till six o’clock in the evening. If any man were considered lazy he had to do “exercise”—i.e., throw himself down and spring up again quickly till he was exhausted, and then go on with his work. (Cf. my report on Lichtenburg in your issue of April 28, 1936.) If a guard chose to be dissatisfied with a whole company its members were hunted round tho camp square till they collapsed. The guards would often amuse themselves in this fashion, as the bad and insufficient food weakened us. Those who could not do the work were punished by being made to stand at attention for two to six hours with face turned towards sun, rain, or snow. If such an “offender” fell down he was beaten. If, owing to exhaustion, a man repeatedly attracted the attention of the guard he was condemned for six months to the punishment company. The standpoint was: “The fewer of you that return to freedom the better. Most of you ought to bo shot as enemies of the State. That would be best.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The guards liked to show us oft to their relatives, and even motor loads of the “Strength Through Joy” organization were brought to admire the educational methods of the Third Reich. The people of the district hated the guards, however, who did not dare to go alone amongst them. To prevent the truth from becoming known, care is taken now to condemn no foreigner to punishment in these camps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The German Freedom Party</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The German Freedom Party distributed by mail thousands or hundreds of thousands of manifestoes inquiring why Hitler is spending billions of money in armaments, why help is being given to Franco, why so many foreign papers arc barred from Germany, why the people are punished for listening to foreign radio stations, why the Nazi leaders spend so much money on themselves, and why the Hitler government has such a poor standing abroad that for a year past it has tried without success to obtain loans in England, France, the United States, or Belgium. If the authors are found they will be put to death, along with the printers and publishers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">♦ Das Schwarze Karps</span><span class="font6"> (The Black Corps), the official organ of the Nazi “Schutzstaffeln” (Black Shirts), in issue of June 10, 1937, publishes the following quite eloquent statistics:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Is it not outrageous to speak of church persecutions, in face of these numbers ? . . . This progress of the Roman church has experienced no interruption since 1933, but, on the contrary, a tremendous increase. Whereas before 1933 every 2.76th day some new church position or congregation was established [in pre-Nazi Germany], the church can achieve such successes after 1933 every 1.26th day. That means, that in the days of the Center party [Catholic party of the German parliament] there was established every third day an ecclesiastical position of support, whereas now, under the national-socialistic regime which is allegedly “inimical to the church”, this is being done almost daily I</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark153"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>Streicher Wants Them Guillotined</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ It would bo hard to think of any creature for whom </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> lias less esteem than it has for Julius Streicher, Hitler’s Jew-baiter, but it could hardly fail to notice his demand that the Roman priests guilty of sex crimes should be guillotined. He told it to 200,000 persons, and it must have made somebody sweat, for the very same day word came out from Vatican City that there will be no diplomatic break with Germany, even though all the parochial schools of Bavaria have been changed into secular schools. Mr. Ratti has sense enough to know that he is in a hot spot, and that it is best not to get too fresh with a man that is insane and has 70,000,000 people behind him that will do anything he wishes, and dare do nothing else.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark155"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark156"></a>Reich Support of the Churches</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Despite the family fight between the Reich and the churches, the Reich in the past four years paid out $56,000,000 from the public treasury for the support of these various ecclesiastical organizations. The salary of the much-advertised Cardinal Faulhaber is $11,600 a year. Not bad pay, eh?</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark158"></a>German Jews Law-Abiding</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The Reich Statistical Bureau published the information that in the first quarter of 1936 there were 40,487 Germans convicted of murder, robbery, arson, criminal assault, receiving stolen goods, counterfeiting, abortion, felonious assault, blackmail, extortion, theft, embezzlement and perjury. Of the 40,487 convicted, 40,381 were the ‘pure Aryans’ about which one hears so much, and only 106 were Jews, or less than one-fifth of one percent of the total. How many of this number were fairly tried is unknown. The figures show an appalling amount of crime in Germany, and disclose that the hated Jews are the most lawabiding citizens in the land, excepting only Jehovah’s witnesses, who commit no crimes at al]. Of the foregoing convictions there were no Jews at all convicted of the crimes of robbery, arson, criminal assault or counterfeiting ; all the honors in these categories went to the ‘pure Aryans’.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>Penalty for Saying Too Much</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The business of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is entirely political and therefore entirely commercial. It is not the least tiny bit interested in God—hates Him in fact—and delights in persecuting those who love Him. Occasionally its bedfellows in politics act mean; they could not do otherwise, for they are mean. It is of no use to argue with a mean person, to try to show him what is right, or what he has promised, or anything else. The Hierarchy, therefore, has erred in having too much to say to and about Hitler. Now he is retaliating with the information that the revenues of the Catholic church in Bavaria are to be reduced to one-third what they were. In four years last past these revenues were 140,000,000 marks ($33,300,000)—a great burden on the taxpayers, and one for which they received nothing at all.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>What Thoughts of Cruelty Can Do</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ What thoughts of cruelty can do to a human face is shown in the new six-pfennig stamp of the “Deutsches Reich”. The hero is Herr Hitler; the stamp was issued to commemorate his 48th birthday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark163"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark164"></a>Lankwitz and Gatow</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ According to John Dickson, Chicago </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font6"> correspondent, early in November of 1936, in Lankwitz, near Berlin, 600 men left their barracks allegedly &quot;to participate in secret maneuvers to test new German anti-aircraft guns”, and Christmas packages, in order to reach them, had to be small and had to be mailed not later than December 4. From Gatow, also near Berlin, and one of the centers of military aviation, 500 men left for &quot;secret artillery practice’'. No German dares say that these men are in Spain, fighting the Spanish Republic, but everybody with any sense knows that is where they are.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark165"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark166"></a>Political Imprisonment in Germany</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The first year of Nazi rule in Germany witnessed prison sentences for political reasons running to 5,645 years; the next year (1934), to 9,619 years; the third year, to 12,092 years; and last year, to 17,249 years. At that rate, inside of a generation everybody in Germany would be in prison for life, including the Nazi partisans themselves, and if Hitler lived that long all he would have to do would be to strut up and down before a mirror calling out &quot;Heil Hitler” all day long until the happy day that his wind gave out.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark167"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark168"></a>Expects a Free Germany to Reappear</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Gerhart H. Seger, editor of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Neue Volks-zeitung,</span><span class="font6"> is of the opinion that Hitler will run to the end of his rope and that liberty will reappear. In a letter to the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font6">asserting that the land is now in a state of complete terrorization, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without being able to commit myself to any prophecy as far as time is concerned, I have no doubt that a free Germany will reappear. I know that a Germany where books are burned instead of read is hot the real Germany.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ It </span><span class="font6">is an interesting fact that when the three Russian airmen flew from Moscow to California, it was forbidden to mention the event in any German newspaper. The Nazi leaders did not dare permit the German people to know of the real capabilities of the Russian army.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>Germany’s Best Technicians in Spain</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ One of the Manchester </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian’s</span><span class="font6"> own correspondents lately in Spain reports that Germany’s best technicians are there aiding Franco, and not only giving him advice, but orders, as it is now well known that he cannot win without their aid. The account says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now no military move is made without the approval of Germany and Italy. The destruction of Madrid is the result of the advice of the Germans and Italians, who considered it to be a military necessity. Germany and Italy had arranged to recognize Franco’s government when Madrid had been conquered; but in face of the failure at Madrid and in their eagerness for direct political and military intervention in Spain’s internal affairs they precipitated the recognition.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ Throughout the Catholic churches of Germany a plea has been made to the Lutherans and other Protestants to stand firm against what they term &quot;Anti-Christ”, meaning by that the new Nazi faith springing up in Germany. The plea flatters the Lutherans as being Christians, saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">AU Christians must stand together and not be diverted from the struggle against the Anti-Christ.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ Of 800 German scholars, exiled from their native land because of disapproval of the Nazi regime, 774 have been able to find employment in other lands, 464 of them in good permanent positions. There are still some 800 dismissed scholars in Germany itself. For these and for their dependents the future seems very dark.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>In Whisper Land</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ In Whisper Land the entire nation is divided into blocks, with a block assistant for each three or four houses, sometimes only one house. Each family must answer 35 questions. .Among these are the organizations to which each member of the family belongs, with rank attained therein; the denominational organization to which the children belong and the medals and decorations they have received; the newspapers read; the type of radio used; and whether the family owns a Swastika flag. One whisper on the wrong side of the ledger lands the unfortunate one in a prison camp. This is Nazism (Catholic Action) in actual practice in Germany.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ Frank Knox, Chicago newspaper publisher, referring to the fact that in Germany in 1936 a skilled worker received but $45 a month, while the average was only $31.09, summed up thus the fulfillment of the high promises made by Hitler:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The status of the German worker, onee free, highly intelligent, well paid and a self-respecting member of society, is that of a miserably paid wage serf of the government.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Hypocrites and murderers never like to be shown up for what they are, and so when 42 of Jehovah’s witnesses were sent to prison from Berlin, for terms ranging from four to eighteen months, the judge on the bench, acting in his capacity as office boy for the Hitler crowd, went out of his way to say that these were not sentenced for their religious views, but for their attitude to the state.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">♦ The depths to which boot-licking can go was reached at Oxford, England, when Bishop Otto Melle declared that Adolf Hitler is a gift from God, intended to rescue Germany’s 67,000,000 from the depths of despair. Needless to add, Bishop Melle is a German Methodist bishop and doing all possible to make a s hit with Adolf.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark189"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>Life in German Labor Camps</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Life in German labor camps has some good features, though it is severe enough. Every youth must serve six months at some form of hard manual labor. In summer the, rising hour is 5:30. After physical training and a substantial breakfast there are seven hours of work, broken by a lunch period of 30 minutes. On return to camp (always by bicycle) there is dinner, compulsory rest for one hour, and after that hobbies, games and manual training in wood or metals until supper at 7:30. Songs and recreation last until bedtime, at 9:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Eyes of the Blind Shall See”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ On May 2 of this year, Pastor Alberti, of Chemnitz, Germany, once for a time interned in a Nazi concentration camp, prayed publicly from the pulpit for Jehovah’s witnesses. At that occasion he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Bible Students are our storm troops., They are true followers of Christ and suffer for His name’s sake. We will yet come into the same condition.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another leading clergyman, Jankowitz, of the Ricsengebirge, Germany, recently had the courage of conviction to declare publicly that the literature of Jehovah’s witnesses contains the truth and is therefore to be highly recommended to every Christian who believes in the Bible. (From the German </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">GA.</span><span class="font6"> of August 1, 1937.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ At Altona, Germany, a woman was sentenced to eight years in prison for listening in on her radio to the secret shortwave station Freedom.

<p><span class="font5">They are publishing a child’s primer today, designed to teach little tots how to think of Jcivs and how to treat them if ever they should meet one. If a Gentile child sees a Jewish child, he is to thumb his nose at him (the illustrations show how), push him off the street and otherwise maltreat him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ The Lord Jesus Christ warned, “Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.” (Matthew 6:1) But nothing that Jesus said would have any weight with the “Reverend Father” James R. Cox, Pittsburgh, Pa. At hand some of his advertising ■ matter, telling about how to take a gamble on the Kentucky Derby under the auspices of his “church”. The back page tells about his ‘ ' charities ’ ’ thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From. November 10, 1930, to June 1, 1936— Meals served 2,839,012; baskets of food given 760,341; medical cases cared for at clinic 2,369; barber shop, shaves 18,123, hair cuts 39,224; gallons of milk given 21,071; tons of coal given 2,210; infants layettes 9,289; among the many items given the men were 7,758 suits of clothes, 18,463 pairs of shoes, 28,674 shirts, 5,109 overcoats; dresses, coats, shoes, undergarments and sweaters were supplied the ladies.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>Five Sets of Police Officers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ “Jersey justice” is so complicated, and Jersey politics are also so complicated, that at the entrance to the Holland Tunnel there are five sets of police officers on duty at one and the same time. On account of the excessive duplication of police departments, the cost for police protection in New Jersey is the highest in the United States for cities of corresponding size groups, and in many instances is twice as high. In the five counties of Hudson, Essex, Union, Bergen and Passaic there are 140 separate police departments in an area the total dimensions of which are only 20 by 35 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">No Extra Charge for Air Mail in France </span><span class="font6">♦ Concluding, and wisely too, that in this day air mails are reasonable and necessary, and for the good of all the people, France has abandoned all extra charge for air-mail service, and will give all first-class mail air service where that will be possible and whereby earlier delivery will thus be possible.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark199"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>How to Land Your Children in Heaven</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Some parents do considerable worrying about whether or not their children will land in heaven, but it seems that all that is quite unnecessary. All that is necessary is to steal enough natural gas .to blow up your house, as was done by the school trustees at New London, Texas, and away they go and everything is lovely. The Old Town High School “Spectator” puts it thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A major disaster has occurred. In New London, Texas, last week the students were gathered together in one of the finest school buildings. School was about to be dismissed, and no doubt thoughts of pleasure were flashing through the minds of all. Crash! The gates of heaven rolled wide, the glory of God shone out, and without hesitation 455 boys, girls and teachers trooped happily through into the Land of the Great Adventure, into the New World filled with the radiance of God and His Angels.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>Comparing Lewis and Green</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Heywood Broun, columnist, tells of a reporter assigned to get answers from John L. Lewis and William Gteen to certain questions affecting labor policies. He got his interview with Lewis in 20 minutes, and it was all finished business. When he tried to contact Mr. Green he ran the gauntlet of three secretaries and was finally told to come for his interview at 1:10 p.m. a week from the next Wednesday. When he came on the dot he whs kept waiting 34 hours and then Mr. Green refused to answer any of his questions.

<p><span class="font6">♦ A man offers a list of 1,671 names of persons, many of whom, so he says, are Catholics, who have given not less than $100, and from that up to $25,000, to various charities. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> does not want the list, and, as a matter of fact, wouldn’t take it as a gift, let alone pay the $15 for it which it is supposed to bring. Others solicit money; this office, never.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ The claim is m$de and seems fairly substantiated that La Guardia is the best mayor New York has had in a generation. He balanced the budget, abolished useless political jobs, put home relief on a business basis, broke slot-machine and other crime rackets, cut 40 percent out of the city’s fire losses, had the big utilities reassessed honestly, reduced the accident rate, built 18 miles of new subways, built beautiful low-rent projects for 10,000 people, tore down 2,000 old tenements, built the great Triborough bridge, 235 playgrounds, 90 parks, 4 sewage plants, 2 incinerators, 54 public schools, and 11 health centers, built the largest piers, and is now building the largest airport in the world for the use of the transatlantic and transcontinental air lines.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ Hoboken has plenty of money to waste on locking up and feeding Jehovah’s witnesses, but not enough to feed the children of its hungry poor; hence the touching newspaper story (and true, too) of the little three-year-old child that died from chewin'*. the paijit——&quot; from his crib, chairs and walls. Th&quot;^ottfigster was all right while the family vfas getting $11.40 every two weeks to live on, but when the relief was cut off and he tried to find food in the paint he gradually contracted lead poisoning and died.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Monessen is in trouble; not again, but yet. Aiderman Lowers was held for court on charges of getting money from the county for jail commitments and releases when the defendants never had been arrested. Serves Monessen right, for standing for such a contaminator of the atmosphere as Mayor Gold.</span></p></li></ul>

The first step is for Britain and France to change their representatives at Addis Ababa to the status of consuls, and this has already been done.

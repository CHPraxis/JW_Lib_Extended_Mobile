<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establisliment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>JEHOVAH’S PROVISIONS</span></h1>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“For the ivages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 6:23, R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH at the very beginning knew that all humankind would reach the point of dire extremity and that they would seek life and that which sustains life, and he made abundant provision for those who would give heed to his Word. To the perfect man created in his own image God announced his law and made known that the transgression thereof would result in death. Satan led man into death and then flung a challenge into God’s face that no man could get everlasting life under the provision that God had made, because no man would obey or keep the law when put to the test. That challenge put in issue the word and the name of Jehovah. Necessarily all creation of heaven would know that the supremacy of Jehovah was defied by Satan, and therefore all would ask: Who will win? A part of the angelic creation pinned their faith to Satan and went with him in the way of defiance and wickedness. The others remained true and steadfast in faith and obedience to Jehovah God. Although God declared his purpose to destroy Satan and all his wicked rulers, and at the time entered judgment to that effect, he gave Satan a suspended sentence and permitted him to remain alive for a season and have full freedom of action, declaring that in due time He would exhibit his own supreme power and would cause his name to be proclaimed throughout all the universe and thereby fully vindicate his name. The Bible contains the record of God’s word or purpose and announces that what he has declared shall be accomplished. “I have purposed it, I will also do it.” “My word . . . shall not return unto me void.” (Isa. 46:11; 55:11) A few men have held steadfastly in faith to God and in obedience to his Word. The greater number have come under Satan’s rule and have followed in his way of wickedness. Now humankind have reached the point of dire distress, fear and perplexity. God’s provision is man’s only hope, and about this man should know. The testimony of his name must now be declared, to the end that all who are of good will and honest heart may know of his provision and that all may know that Jehovah is supreme, the almighty and eternal God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> For centuries God has caused to be proclaimed throughout the nations his unchangeable rule, to wit: ‘ ‘ For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Rom. 6:23, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> Comparatively few men have given heed to that rule. Most of them have followed the philosophy of men, which originated with Satan. All persons desire to live, but most of them have been made blind concerning the way of life by reason of Satan’s ministers ’ haranguing them and telling them that there is no death but that at the time of dissolution the soul of the one who is a member of “the church”, or of the “Catholic population”, and whose sins have not been expiated passes on to “purgatory”, where for a money consideration the term of suffering may be shortened, and that then the everlasting abode will be in the bliss of heaven.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> Jehovah God is the fountain of life. No creature can live save by the permission of God. Jehovah sent his beloved. Son to earth, made in the likeness of imperfect man, and permitted the Devil to put upon Christ Jesus all manner of tests, even causing him to be wrongfully and wickedly charged with the heinous crimes of sedition and treason, put through a mock trial, convicted upon perjured testimony, and sent to the ignominious death of hanging upon a tree. Through it Jesus remained true and steadfast to God his Father, always maintaining his integrity toward God. Jehovah raised Christ Jesus out of death and bestowed upon him the greatest of all gifts. Concerning the Lord Jesus it is written: “For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself.” (John 5:26, Zf.F.) Jehovah’s provision for the human race is that he has bestowed upon Christ Jesus eternal life and immortality with full power and authority to give life to those who obey God’s commandments. For this reason Jesus said: “I am the living bread which came down out of heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: yea and the bread which I will give is my flesh, for the life of the world.” (John 6:51, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> “Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” (John 14: 6) There is no other way to get life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">♦Jehovah has furnished an abundance of proof and recorded it in his Word that he knew the end from the beginning. Today the proof given, together with the understanding and appreciation thereof, is being made clear to those who love and serve Jehovah, and upon them is laid the obligation to make known those truths to others by proclaiming throughout the earth the name of Jehovah and making known his provisions for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PROPHETIC DRAMAS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ Long centuries ago Jehovah caused men to play their respective parts in dramas which prophetically foretold his purpose and the manner of carrying it into execution, and which dramas God directed himself. Now he is unfolding the meaning of those dramas to his faithful and obedient servants. These prophetic dramas throw light from different viewpoints upon Jehovah’s purpose and his manner of carrying out the same, and this light shining into the face of Christ Jesus and reflected into the temple company causes them great joy. Among those prophetic dramas long ago performed and recorded is that of Joseph and his brethren, the revelation of which causes a flood of light to shine into the mind and heart of everyone who knows and serves Jehovah; and likewise he illuminates those who come to know God and Christ Jesus as the truth is proclaimed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Every child who has received instruction in the Bible has been told of Joseph and his brethren, but none have understood the significance thereof, for the reason that no man can have an understanding and appreciation of such prophetic dramas until God’s due time to make them clear. God himself brings about the conditions that fulfill these prophetic pictures; and then, when all the players are upon the scene and the part that each one plays is observed, the prophecy is illuminated by the Lord so that those who love righteousness and meekness may understand. It seems well here to give a brief synopsis of the prophetic drama of Joseph and his brethren and then to examine the Scripture texts in detail. It is a beautiful picture, and thrills the heart of everyone who loves and serves Jehovah God. It discloses Jehovah's marvelous provision and loving-kindness toward creatures, and it is of the greatest importance to have a proper understanding and appreciation of the provisions God has made.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>T</sup> Jacob was the grandson of Abraham, and by the grace of God had inherited the birthright from his grandparent. The circumstances surrounding the birth and early experiences of Joseph enable one to get a better view of the prophetic drama as it unfolds; and hence we give some consideration to his parentage. The earthly father of Joseph was Jacob, and Jacob’s father was Isaac. When Isaac was 131 years old and </span><span class="font4">his son Jacob was a man of mature years, Isaac gave Jacob the birthright blessing. Esau, the twin brother of Jacob, persecuted Jacob because Isaac had bestowed the blessing upon him, and Jacob fled to Laban, in the land of Syria, and there took to wife Leah, a daughter of Laban, Later Laban also gave Jacob Rachel to wife. Because of the barrenness for a time of his wives Jacob, with their consent, had two concubines. He had children by all four women. For a long season Rachel was barren, and in that time Leah had given birth to six sons by Jacob. The barrenness of Rachel had greatly distressed her. But in due time God heard her prayer and took away her reproach: ‘‘And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach: and she called his name Joseph; and said, The Lord shall add to me another son. ’ ’—Gen. 30: 22-24.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Isaac was yet alive when his grandson Joseph was born, and lived for twenty-nine years thereafter. A few years after the birth of Joseph Jacob had another son by his beloved wife Rachel, and the birth of that son cost Rachel her life. As she was dying Rachel named her second son, calling him Ben-oni, which means ‘‘the son of my sorrow”. But Jacob his father begot his son and called his son Benjamin, meaning “the son of my right hand”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> Jacob had twelve sons by the four different women aforementioned. His sons by Leah were Reuben, the firstborn; and Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. (Gen. 35:23) Jacob’s sons by his concubine Zilpah were Gad and Asher. (Gen. 35:26) His sons by his concubine Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali: and his sons by his beloved wife Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin. (Gen. 35:24.25) Joseph and Benjamin were full brothers. The other ten sons of Jacob were only half brothers to Joseph and Benjamin. The relationship of the two full brothers was, of course, closer than that of the other ten. Jacob was about 91 years of age when Joseph was born, and IOS years old when Benjamin was born; therefore both Joseph and Benjamin were sons “of [Jacob’s] old age”. (Gen. 37: 3) When Jacob was journeying to the land of his nativity after years of his absence in Syria, God sent his angel and informed Jacob that thereafter he should be known by the name </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Israel:</span><span class="font4"> “And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and bast prevailed.”—Gen. 32:28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> When Joseph was a lad of seventeen years he was a shepherd boy feeding his father’s flocks. His half brothers were feeding the flocks of his father at Shcchem. Jacob, now called Israel, sent his son Joseph to Shechem to ascertain the condition of his brethren and the flocks and to bring back a report thereof to his father Jacob. Arriving at his destination, Joseph learned that his brethren had gone to Dothan. Joseph then went to seek his brethren at Dothan; and when they saw Joseph coming they immediately formed a conspiracy against Joseph that they might get rid of him. His half brothers hated Joseph because their father loved Joseph more than them and had manifested this love by his treatment of Joseph. Additionally, Joseph had dreamed two dreams and had told his brethren about the dreams, and that increased their envy and hatred against him. Carrying out their conspiracy, they seized Joseph and threw him into a well or pit. Jacob had provided Joseph with a beautiful coat of many colors. They took this coat and dipped jt in the blood of a goat, indicating that Joseph had been killed. Then they sold Joseph to merchantmen going to Egypt and returned to their father with the stained garment, representing to him that Joseph had been slain by wild beasts. Israel was convinced that his son Joseph was dead. Joseph was carried away to Egypt and sold as a slave to one of Pharaoh’s officers. (Gen. 37:1-28) Joseph then served as a slave for a time, and until God’s due time to use him in another way. He was exalted by Pharaoh to the highest place next to the king in Egypt and became the most important man of Egypt, saving that nation from starvation and death.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> The name “Joseph” has a two-fold meaning, which the record discloses. At the time of his birth his mother Rachel said: “God hath taken away my reproach”; and she called his name “Joseph”, which means “remover”, that is, remover of reproach. And then Rachel said: ‘ ‘ The Lord shall add to me another son”; meaning “increaser”. Thus she foretold that the one whom Joseph foreshadowed would be the Vindicator of his Father’s name, would remove or take away the reproach of His name, and would be an increaser, and would increase the number of those who would maintain their integrity toward God and magnify his name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAYERS AND PARTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Away back in the centuries past, in the lands of Canaan and Egypt Jehovah staged a great prophetic drama by which he foretold the manifestation of his loving-kindness toward mankind. In that drama each person played his respective part, not knowing the real meaning of his acts. Jehova'h God directed the drama, and every part of it has a deep significance. The players and the parts that each one played, and the pictorial significance thereof, can now be understood, because it is God’s due time to reveal the meaning thereof to those who love and serve him. The revelation of this and other prophetic dramas makes glad the heart of the man of God and enables him to rejoice in the knowledge of the fact that “whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope ’ ’.—Rom. 15: 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> In this time when darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the people, when there is great distress and perplexity amongst men, the revelation of this prophetic drama to Jehovah’s witnesses and the transmission of that knowledge by them to those who mourn will bring joy to those of Zion and peace and gladness to those who hear and who seek righteousness and meekness, giving them assurance that Jehovah has made ample provision for every time of need for those who love and serve him. A brief synopsis of the opening part of the drama is set out first. Now the principal players are named, with a brief statement of the meaning of the parts played by them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>14</sup> Jacob, later called Israel, in this prophetic drama pictures or represents Jehovah God. To him Jehovah said: “In thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed,” even as Jehovah had said to Jacob’s grandfather, Abraham.—Gen. 28:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>15</sup> Rachel, the wife of Jacob whom he specially loved and who for years was barren, in the drama pictured or represented Zion, God’s “woman”, that is to say, Jehovah’s organization, that gives birth to his beloved children.—Isa. 54:1-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>16</sup> Joseph, the beloved son and firstborn of Jacob by his wife Rachel, in the prophetic drama pictured or represented Christ Jesus, the beloved Son of God. Joseph, during the seven years of famine in Egypt and in the land round about, in a typical or miniature way was the “seed” of Jacob in whom all the families of the earth who obey him shall be preserved alive and blessed. (Gen. 41:55-57) Joseph therefore particularly typified or pictured Christ Jesus, the “seed of Abraham” according to the promise. (Gal. 3:8,16) The church of God, which is that company of persons taken out of the world for the name of Jehovah and made members of the body of Christ, is included in the part of the drama played by Joseph, and this is particularly so with reference to the remnant. These, of course, appear in a subordinate way to the Greater than Joseph in the fulfillment of the prophecy. These are made a part of the seed of promise because they are members of the body of Christ.—Gal. 3: 29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>17</sup> Benjamin, together with his full brother Joseph, in this prophetic drama played the part representing or picturing Jehovah’s royal family, of which Christ Jesus is the head son. At the birth of Joseph, and after Rachel had named him, she said: “The Lord shall add to me another son.” In that she spoke prophetic words concerning Benjamin’s birth, which would come later; therefore in the drama Joseph pictures not only Christ Jesus himself, but also the original remnant that survive the test at the coming judgment of the Lord at the temple, which began in 1918, resulting in bringing forth the “faithful and wise servant” class. That original remnant was also foreshadowed by Mordecai and Naomi. Benjamin more particularly played the part representing or foreshadowing that part of the remnant brought forth </span><span class="font4">after 1922, and which part of the remnant was also pictured by Esther and Ruth, and these too are made a part of the elect servant or royal house. Hence Joseph and Benjamin together pictured Jehovah’s royal house in the entirety. Their mother, Rachel, was especially loved by Jacob, and gave birth to these two sons; and in this she foreshadowed Zion, God’s universal organization in its capacity of bringing forth Jehovah’s royal family. As Jacob loved Rachel most, so Jehovah loves most his organization Zion, for she brings forth the royal family, and he loves his royal offspring most, which is the kingdom of heaven class.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Until the birth of Benjamin Joseph was his father’s only begotten son by Rachel his beloved wife and was always the favorite son of his father. Likewise Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s “only begotten Son” and favorite (John 3:16), “the firstborn of every creature” (Col. 1:15), “my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.” (Matt. 3:17) “I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.” (Ps. 89:27) According to Jehovah’s purpose Joseph was the logical one to be the typical seed of Israel, Isaac and Abraham, in whom all would be blessed who receive blessings. (Gen. 28:13,14) Christ Jesus is the only logical and qualified “Seed of Abraham”, in whom all the families of the earth who receive blessings must be blessed. That promised blessing began at Pentecost in A.D. 33 and continues unto the end of the thousand-year reign of Christ. The fact that Joseph and Benjamin were both sons of Jacob’s old age pictures the barrenness of God’s organization for four thousand years, from Eden till the baptism of Christ Jesus at the Jordan, when he was brought forth and acknowledged as the beloved Son of Jehovah, in whom he is well pleased. (Matt. 3:17) When Christ Jesus was begotten of the spirit at the Jordan, then Zion, that is, God’s organization, like Rachel could say: “God hath taken away my reproach.” There was born out of God’s universal organization Christ Jesus, his Father’s great Vindicator who would in time take away the reproach that had fallen upon the name of Jehovah and upon his organization also involved in his name. Thus Joseph pictured the greater One, Christ Jesus, who is ‘the remover of reproach’. The two sons, Joseph and Benjamin, foreshadowed the complete Christ, and the death of Rachel at the birth of the second son, Benjamin, seems clearly to picture that Jehovah’s organization completes her function in bringing forth the members of the royal family when she gives birth to the last members of the remnant, which last members were pictured by Ruth and Esther.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>18</sup> Joseph’s brethren, that is, the ten half brothers who in the first part of the prophetic drama envied and hated Joseph, appear to picture those persons in the religious organizations that have envied and ill-treated the true followers of Christ Jesus because they </span><span class="font4">observe that the true followers of Christ Jesus have had greater favor from God. In the latter part of the prophetic drama, when these half brothers became reconciled to Joseph and sought his favor, the part played by them pictures those who are not members of the body of Christ, and hence not spirit-begotten, but are of good will toward God and Christ Jesus; hence they picture the Jonadab class, the “great multitude” or “other sheep” that Christ Jesus brings into his Father’s fold. (John 10:16) These are the earthly children of God’s organization. Zion, which is God’s organization, in her capacity of bringing forth these earthly children was pictured or foreshadowed by the three other women of Jacob, that is, Leah and the two concubines, the mothers of the ten half brothers of Joseph and Benjamin. Those here specifically named are the principal players. The others, who were subordinate players in the drama, the part they played and whom they represented, will appear in the detailed examination of the text. The Biblical account of the drama should be first read. It appears in Genesis, chapters thirty-seven to fifty inclusive.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE DRAMA</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> The statements hereinbefore made concerning the players and the parts pictured by them must appear to be somewhat dogmatic, and for that reason the detailed examination of the text should be had in order that we may more fully appreciate God’s gracious provisions. When the text of God’s Word is set alongside the physical facts which are well known to be true, and when both are in full accord and full harmony, then we may be sure that we have an understanding of the fulfillment of the prophecy. Jehovah had directed the drama long ago and made the record thereof for the benefit of the remnant, and we should confidently expect that he would give a revelation to his remnant before Armageddon, that the hope of such faithful ones might be made strong in these perilous times. The Lord at his temple, which is hidden from and hence dark to the people outside thereof, illuminates his prophecies, and illuminates the mind of the temple company, and gives them instruction. Therefore Jesus says to the temple company: “What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.” —Matt. 10:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> It follows that when the remnant receive from the Lord the truths illuminating the prophecies, then and there the obligation is laid upon the remnant, or Jehovah’s witnesses, to go out and make known these facts and the Scriptures showing the fulfillment of the prophecy to those who are hungering and thirsting for righteousness. Such are the ones that mourn and desire to be comforted and to whom the remnant are sent as anointed servants of God to bring them comfort. Such are the people of good will, and the obligation is upon the remnant to make known God’s provisions for all those who diligently seek to know and to dd his will. The remnant will in obedience to the Lord’s commandment make known to the Jonadabs what they “hear in the ear”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> Consideration should now be given to the Scripture texts beginning with Genesis 37:1: “And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.” Jacob, like his grandfather Abraham, “looked for a city [the kingdom organization] which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.” (Heb. 11:10) Joseph dwelt in the land of Canaan with his father and was his father’s beloved son and, like his ancestors, would be looking for the kingdom of God’s building. His antitype, Christ Jesus, said to the Jews who were against him: “Ye are from beneath; I am from above; ye are of this world; I am not of t-his world.” “My kingdom is not of this world.” (John 8:23; 18:36) Concerning his disciples, who were like Benjamin to Joseph, Jesus said: “They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.” (John 17:14) Since Joseph and his brother Benjamin were, like their ancestors, looking for the kingdom, therefore all pictured by Joseph and Benjamin are “strangers and pilgrims” to the world under Satan, looking for that better day and a perfect government. —1 Pet. 2:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> Jehovah, in directing the drama, moved each one of the parties to perform according to His own will. Israel, who pictured Jehovah God, showed his love for his beloved son in this, that he “made him a coat of many colours”. (Gen. 37:3) In this manner his father publicly identified Joseph his son as his favorite. The clothing supplied by the father identified the child as holding a certain position or place in the affections of the father. It was the custom amongst the Jews to show their favor to their children by the apparel they wore. “With such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled.” (2 Sam. 13:18) Joseph’s coat of many colors identified and designated him as the typical “seed of Abraham” and as the future head of all the tribes issuing from Israel. That future exalted position of Joseph was confirmed by dreams that Jehovah caused him to have and to then relate to his brethren. Joseph’s first drcam was in substance this: That while he and his brethren were binding sheaves of corn in the field, Joseph’s sheaf stood upright and the sheaves of his brethren stood round about and made obeisance to Joseph’s siieaf. (Gen. 37: 6, 7) Then Joseph had another dream, which he told to his brethren, and said to them: “Behold, I have dreamed a drcam more; and, behold, the sun, and the moon, and the eleven stars, made obeisance to me.” (Gen. 37:9) The dream told to his brethren angered them because they understood that the promise indicated that Joseph would be exalted above them and even above their own father and mother, and that all should bow down to him. (Gen. 37: 6-10) The envy and hatred of those ten half brothers against Joseph increased. In this part of the drama Jehovah was foretelling the exaltation of Joseph above his brethren, and more particularly foretelling that Jehovah would exalt his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, above all and give him a name above every name and before him every knee shall bow. (Phil. 2:9-11) When Jesus was on earth Jehovah openly manifested his favor to his beloved Son and by that plainly testified that Jesus is the real promised Seed of Jehovah’s choice as the Ruler of the world. To Jesus, when on earth, the testimony of God’s kingdom was given, and he began his earthly work by preaching “The kingdom of heaven is at hand”. Jesus declared that he always spoke as he was instructed by his Father to speak, and thus he carried out his Father’s purpose. Jehovah backed up the declarations of his beloved Son by having the Son perform miracles, thus showing his supernatural power. Even the Jewish clergy, who claimed to be the “seed of Abraham”, and therefore the brethren of Christ Jesus, recognized Jesus as the heir, although they hated him. They saw that God’s favor was specially upon him, and that increased their hatred. Those religionists were like Joseph’s half brethren who hated Joseph. (Matt. 21:38; Jolin 8:39-43) Those Jewish religionists hated Jesus without a cause (John 15:25), even as the brethren of Joseph hated him without a cause. Likewise those of the “faithful servant” class are hated by the religionists because the faithful servants are true and faithful to the name of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. (Matt. 10:25) Those who hate the Lord’s remnant on earth the most are the ones who also claim to be the followers of the Lord Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> Joseph was a faithful shepherd boy, looking well to the interest of his father’s flock. (Gen. 37:2) In this he foreshadowed the good shepherd, Christ Jesus. (John 10:11) The half brothers of Joseph, the sons of Jacob, were evil shepherds, and Joseph reported their wrongful conduct or evil deeds to his father. The truthfulness of Joseph increased the hatred of the others against him. Likewise when Jesus told the truth, he was hated the more by the religionists of his time and since. Jacob sent his beloved son Joseph from his home at Hebron a distance of seventy-five miles away to Shechcm to learn the state of his half brothers and the condition of the flocks that they wore tending.—Gen. 37:12-14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> In fulfillment of this part of the prophecy Jehovah sent Christ Jesus, the Good Shepherd, to earth to investigate the Jewish clergy, who were duty-bound to feed the covenant people of God on earth by informing them of God’s Word. Those Jewish religionists had become false shepherds and looked after their own selfish interests and neglected their duty to Jehovah and his covenant people. When Jesus came to earth he was, like Joseph, a young man, and the clergy of the Jews were “the elders in Israel’’. Jesus found them to be wicked and neglecting his Father’s flocks, and he reported the matter to Jehovah his Father. Because of his faithfulness in so doing Jesus brought down upon his head the malicious hatred of the Jewish clergy, who also incited others to hatred and to persecute Jesus.—John 5:16-18; 8:13-44.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The two dreams which Joseph had were, of course, divinely arranged as a part of the prophetic drama, and they foretold the exaltation of Joseph above his brethren and others of his family relationship according to the flesh. Joseph did not manifest conceit because of these promises, nor did he deport himself in a proud and arrogant manner, but he spoke plainly to his brethren and told them; “and his brethren [aside from the infant Benjamin] envied him; but his father observed the saying [kept the saying in mind].”—Gen. 37: 5-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> The dreams not only foretold the exaltation of Joseph, but foretold the opening to Christ Jesus of the heavenly things, that is, the unseen things of God’s holy Word, which told of the coming exaltation of Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s King and Vindicator, above every other creature in the universe. (Matt. 3:16) The exaltation of Christ Jesus was further foretold by the vision of transfiguration in the mountain. (Matt. 17:1-5) Jesus had told his disciples of his future glory and power. (Matt. 16:27,28) When Jesus stood before his accusers he said: ‘ ‘ Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.” (Matt. 26:64) The Jewish clergy hated Jesus and sought to kill him because he said that Jehovah was his Father, and that his Father loved him. (John 8:17-47) Faithfully obedient to Jehovah’s commandments, Jesus did “bear witness unto the truth” concerning himself and the kingdom of God, as foretold in the prophecies of God’s Word. Even the political ruler Pilate knew that the chief priests had “delivered him for envy”. (Mark 15:10; Matt. 27:18) All this was in fulfillment of that part of the prophetic drama showing the feeling of Joseph’s half brethren to Joseph. Those half brethren of Joseph had led the flocks of their father from Shechem some fifteen miles northwest to the place called Dothan, which means “two wells”. Joseph had been sent by his father to find them, and so he followed on in search of his father’s flocks then in charge of those evil shepherds. (Gen. 37:14-17) Likewise Jesus, “the Good Shepherd,” was faithful in carrying out his Father’s commandment, willingly facing danger, and giving liis life for the sheep. He went in search of his Father’s flocks then in charge of the Jewish clergy, who claimed to be the “seed of Abraham”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> Those unfaithful shepherds or half brothers of Joseph “conspired against him to slay him”, with the possible exception of Reuben and Judah. Even those two were in the conspiracy, but they were not in favor of slaying the lad, but standing by and consenting to the others’ taking a wrongful action against Joseph made all of them parties to the conspiracy and the crime committed. They stripped Joseph, taking away his beautiful coat of many colors, and then cast him into an empty well or pit, their purpose being to kill him later. Having done this, then they had a feast together, congratulating themselves on their accomplishment in getting rid of Joseph. At the suggestion of Judah, instead of killing Joseph, they sold him ‘ ‘ for twenty pieces of silver” to a band of Midianites and Ishmaelites, merchants bound for Egypt. Their conclusion was that now they were rid of their brother who had tormented them with the truth and that they had also profited by receiving some filthy lucre from the merchantmen. In order that they might further carry out their conspiracy and deceive their father Israel, they killed a he-goat, instead of Joseph, and took the blood of that goat and smeared it over the beautiful garment, and then carried it in that condition to Jacob, representing to him that his beloved son, Joseph, had been slain by wild beasts.—Gen. 37:18-35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> Joseph, being less than twenty years of age, his selling price was twenty pieces of silver according to the law. (Lev. 27:5) During the twenty-two years following this selling, Joseph was to Jacob as though he were dead. His father had no knowledge that he had been sold into Egypt and was yet alive.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>80</sup> This part of the prophetic drama was fulfilled by what came upon Jesus. His Jewish brethren, according to the flesh, conspired to kill Jesus and repeatedly attempted to carry out that conspiracy, and finally did execute the conspiracy in bringing about the death of the Lord Jesus. (John 5:16-18; 11: 53; Matt. 27:1) Like Reuben toward Joseph, some amongst the Jews were not favorable to the killing of Jesus, and among them there was “a man named Joseph, a counsellor”, who had not consented to the murder of Jesus. (Luke 23:5-51) As it was suggested that Joseph be sold into Egypt, so Judas sold Jesus to the enemy clergy for thirty pieces of silver. Jesus being thirty-three years of age, and therefore at maturity, the price for him was thirty pieces of silver, which the commercial religionists paid for his lifeblood, and then delivered Jesus to the executioners of Satan’s world, which “spiritually is called . . . Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified”. (Rev. 11:8; Matt. 26:14-16; 27: 3-5) After stripping Jesus of his identity as God’s favorite Son, which they did by their malicious lies, the Jewish clergy then caused him to be murdered as a wicked sinner. As Joseph’s half brethren killed the he-goat and used its blood for deception, so the Jewish clergy brought about the death of the Lord Jesus Christ. Joseph’s brethren sought to effectually deceive their father, and for a time succeeded. Likewise the Jewish clergy sought to deceive. Even though Jesus was raised from the dead by the power of Jehovah and that fact was repeated amongst the people, the Jewish clergy vigorously denied that Jesus lived again, and schemed to induce all to believe him still dead. (Matt. 27:62-66; Luke 23:50-53; John 19:31-42) Joseph completely disappeared from the land of his nativity and was supposed by his father to be dead; and thus ended the first act of the great prophetic drama.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SECOND PART</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>81</sup> The scene is now transferred from the land of Canaan to the land of Egypt, where Joseph was a slave or bond servant. Joseph’s career in Egypt requires a transfer in application of the prophetic drama from Jesus personally to Christ Jesus and the members of his body, the church, over which Christ Jesus is Head and Lord. The prophecy particularly now applies to “the feet of him”, otherwise called “the remnant”, his true followers yet on earth. Long after the selling of Joseph into Egypt one of God’s faithful witnesses wrote and the record of his testimony is this: “And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him, and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.” (Acts 7:9,10) This is further proof that the drama was directed by Jehovah God, was and is a prophecy, and was recorded long ago for the benefit of the remnant now on earth, that they might be encouraged and have their hope increased. In corroboration of this Jehovah’s prophet wrote: “ He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant; whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron; until the time that his word came; the word of the Lord tried him. The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free. He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance; to bind his princes at his pleasure, and teach his senators wisdom.” (Ps. 105:17-22) Thus was foretold that the feet members of Christ Jesus would be bound and hurt with fetters, that they would be held in restraint and suffer until God’s due time to lift them up with their Lord and Head. The loving-kindness of Jehovah is manifested in this, that he caused these minor details to be recorded long ago and now makes them known for the benefit of his faithful ones on earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> Arriving in Egypt, Joseph was made a slave in the house of Potiphar, captain in Pharaoh’s guard, that is, the man who was the chief executioner of the king: “And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.” (Gen. 39:2) Joseph was a slave and a man of no reputation in Egypt at that time, yet he had God’s favor all the time. Likewise the faithful followers of Christ Jesus upon earth, particularly of the remnant, have been made of no reputation among men and have suffered many indignities because of their faithfulness. They likewise have an assurance that God is with them, and this makes their burdens easy to be borne. Potiphar saw that Joseph was a good man and dependable, and he made Joseph a trusted slave for his service. Likewise worldly men have seen that those devoted to Jehovah are more trustworthy than other men and more dependable when assigned to a specific duty. These faithful followers of Christ Jesus have learned that whatsoever they do, they do as unto the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> Applying now the well-known facts and the prophecy to the faithful followers of Christ Jesus on earth, mark how well the two harmonize. The application seems to be properly made during the period of time when Christ Jesus was ‘preparing the way before Jehovah’, and before he came to the temple. From about A.D. 1878 forward Jehovah’s faithful servants under Christ Jesus were engaged in a pre-kingdom service. They saw that the kingdom was near, and they went forth proclaiming the second coming of Christ and the kingdom of God under Christ Jesus, although the matter was not then so clearly understood by them. As Joseph was a slave in the house of Potiphar, so the faithful followers of Christ Jesus on earth were in subjection to men because of not discerning who constitute “the higher powers”. (Rom. 13:1) They have believed that the political rulers of earth constitute the powers ordained of God, and were hence the higher powers. They faithfully performed whatsoever was committed to them, and men of the world saw that these true Christians were more reliable and dependable than others. As Joseph was made a trusted servant because of his dependability and faithfulness, so during the period of time when Christ Jesus was preparing the way before Jehovah there was developed a class of men and women, the true followers of Christ Jesus, who honestly and faithfully performed whatsoever was committed into their hands and were noted as dependable. This class was on earth when Christ Jesus finished the work of preparing the way before Jehovah and at the time he appeared at the temple for judgment. It is to this class the words of Jesus are addressed: “Blessed is that servant [class], whom his lord, when he eometh [to the temple], shall find so doing.” (Matt. 24:45,46) At the time “the higher powers” was not particularly an issue and was not given very much consideration. But the time must come when the integrity of God’s people must be put to a test and when they must know who constitute “the higher powers” and devote themselves fully to the true higher powers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>84</sup> No doubt Joseph was a well-developed and handsome young man as well as entirely trustworthy. He was strong, upstanding and vigorous. He had found favor in the sight of his master Potiphar and for that reason had been given the freedom of his house. His integrity now was put to the test. Would he remain true and steadfast to God, or would he compromise himself? Potiphar’s wife was used to put Joseph to the test, even as Satan’s “woman”, his organization, is used to put the sons of God now on earth to a severe test, affording the opportunity to prove their integrity. Potiphar’s wife attempted to seduce the young man Joseph and cause him to have intercourse with her. He resisted her, and yet she persisted in her efforts to seduce him. When Potiphar’s wife had failed to involve the young man Joseph and he fled from her when his garment was torn from his back by her, then she falsely accused him of the crime of assault with intent to rape. That was a serious charge; and the circumstantial evidence being against Joseph then, though wholly false, Potiphar the master caused Joseph to be thrown into prison “where the king’s prisoners were bound”. (Gen. 39:6-20) In this test Joseph had strictly maintained his integrity.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> Fornication and adultery are typical of illicit spiritual relationship of the child of God with Satan’s “woman” or organization. (Jas. 4:4) Jehovah’s faithful servants under Christ Jesus have repeatedly repulsed the unclean and licentious advancement of Satan’s “woman”, that is, his organization. Although often enticed, they have kept themselves “unspotted from the world” by refusing to have anything in common with the organization that rules the world. They have refused to be seduced by Satan’s woman. They have persistently refused to join with the religious organizations and have anything in common with those organizations and to thereby commit spiritual fornication. They have shunned the corrupt political affairs of this world and have steadfastly held to their service of God and Christ Jesus.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“Potiphar’s wife was moved by revenge to make the false accusations against Joseph. For revenge, like the adulterous and wicked woman, the clergy have falsely accused God’s faithful children of violating their liberty and with the crime of assault upon the organization of the world. They delight to continue to accuse Jehovah’s witnesses as communists. This false accusation was particularly true in the time of the World War, and is still true. Although the “faithful servant” class adhere strictly to the truth, as commanded by Jehovah, and fight only for the truth and the vindication of Jehovah’s name, the clergy, like Potiphar’s wife, resort to lies and maliciously charge God’s people with crimes, causing them to be imprisoned and otherwise restrained. The clergy and allies, who are the “mighty men” of Babylon, have always refused to come into the open and fight, and that is particularly true now. Unable to meet the truth, as proclaimed by God’s people, the clergy resort to lies and strike in the dark. Potiphar’s wife knew that she had no just cause against Joseph and that she must fight him by taking undue advantage by reason of her standing with her husband, and for envy and with express malice, she struck Joseph in the back. Likewise the clergy know they have no defense and they strike Jehovah’s witnesses in the dark, always hiding behind someone else and relying upon their reputation and standing amongst the political and commercial elements of Satan’s organization. Concerning the clergy and their allies of the present day, and their method of fighting, Jehovah says: “The mighty men of Babylon [Satan’s organization] have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds; their might hath failed; they became as women.” (Jer. 51:30) The result is that Jehovah’s witnesses are cast into prison, charged with the offense of sedition, treason, obstructers of the governments, hostile and dangerous to the state or organization of the world. (Matt. 24:9; Mark 13:9) Particularly were, such false charges laid against God’s faithful people during the World War, and many of them were imprisoned because of their faithfulness to God and their maintaining their integrity toward him. At that time the “evil servant” class, having become a part of Satan’s “woman”, betrayed the faithful ones into the hands of the clergy, even as Judas betrayed Jesus into the hands of the Jewish religionists.—Matt. 24: 9-12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>37</sup> The crime with which Joseph was charged by the woman was a capital offense. It was a charge easily made and easily proved with circumstantial evidence, and against which Joseph had no defense except his own honest word. Pharaoh’s baker was beheaded for an offense of less enormity than that charged against Joseph. Joseph doubtless would have been likewise executed, but God was with him and placed his protecting hand over him, preventing his execution. Jehovah maneuvered matters so that Joseph was placed in a higher-class prison, that is, in the royal prison. No doubt Joseph for a time was treated like other prisoners, because it is prophetically written of him: ‘They hurt his feet, and he was laid in irons.’ (Psr 105:17,18) The Lord showed his favor toward him, and then Joseph was made a trusted slave in the prison: “And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the Lord was with him, and that which he did the Lord made it to prosper.” (Gen. 39:22,23) In this prison house Joseph was a type of Christ Jesus representatively through his feet members on earth, who were restrained and thrown into prison, and this was particularly true during the World War.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> Whatever punishment is inflicted upon the faithful feet members, the remnant, Christ Jesus counts that as inflicted upon himself. (Matt. 25: 36-40) During the World War Jehovah’s servants were subjected to many indignities, imprisoned and ill-treated, even as Joseph was ill-treated at first. Then Jehovah relieved them of much of their suffering and preserved their lives, although his faithful ones had been imprisoned with the purpose of killing them and hence, as written, they were “appointed to die’’. (Pss. 79:11; 102:20) Christ Jesus, the beloved Son, was at that time at the temple. The holy spirit as comforter and guide had been taken away because of the Lord’s personal presence at the temple, who now guides and comforts his own whom he has gathered unto himself. (2 Thess. 2:7; John 14:16-18) Therefore God was with the antitypical Joseph class at this time and showed them favor, and he continues to show them favor, even to this day. As there were committed to the hand of Joseph as a trusted slave or bond servant all the other prisoners, even so the Lord has committed to his “faithful and wise servant’’ class the privilege and duty of ministering to all other prisoners, that is to say, to those pictured by Ruth and Esther first, and who have since been made a part of the servant class, and also to the people of good will, or Jonadabs, who are now being loosed and brought into the liberty of God’s kingdom. Thus the Lord has made the work of the “faithful servant” class, whom Joseph at this point of the drama pictured, to prosper. He has committed into their hands all his goods. They pray for prosperity and receive prosperity, as God had promised. (Ps. 118:25) Joseph maintained his integrity toward God. The remnant, the members of the body of Christ, who continue faithful, will maintain their integrity towards Jehovah, and, doing so, they are certain to have a part in the vindication of his holy name. The great prophetic drama proceeds, showing that Jehovah had much more in store for Joseph to perform, and foretells that God, through Christ Jesus, has committed into the hands of his faithful servant class much work to be done to the honor of his name. He now reveals these truths to the “faithful servant” class, that they may be strong in hope, knowing that, continuing in faithful service, they will in due time participate in the vindication of Jehovah’s holy name.</span></p></li></ul>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font4">HE Lord God Almighty sitting upon his throne, over and above all the forces of his organization and coming out of the north and moving forward to the destruction of the unfaithful city of Jerusalem, was seen in vision by God’s prophet Ezekiel. Concerning this Ezekiel says: “And above the firmament that was over their [the cherubim’s] heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake. ’ ’—Ezek. 1: 26-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The duty of pronouncing God’s judgment and of the execution thereof is laid upon Christ Jesus, who is God’s Chief Executive Officer. That this vision refers to the time of the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple of Jehovah for judgment is further supported by what the prophet later saw and about which he wrote, to'wit: “Afterward he brought me to the gate [of the temple], even the gate that looketh toward the east; and, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east, and his voice was like a noise of many waters; and the earth shined with his glory. And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city [prophesy that the city should be destroyed </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(margin)];</span><span class="font4"> and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face. And the glory of the Lord came into the house, by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east. So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house.”—Ezek. 43:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time of this, his first vision, Ezekiel pictured and foreshadowed those in the covenant with God and in line for the kingdom and whom the Lord Jesus Christ found faithful upon coming to his temple and to whom he committed his kingdom interests on the earth, and to which class he refers as the “faithful and wise servant”. (Matt. 24:45,46) This “faithful servant” class had its vision made clear concerning the Elijah and Elisha works of the church in the autumn of 1919. This was five years after Jehovah had placed his anointed King upon his holy hill in Zion and the “man child”, the new government, had been born. That new government was a part of God’s universal organization, and it was then, through the functioning of that government, that Jehovah began his reign over the earth. This was particularly shown by Jehovah’s being seated upon his throne above all his organization, as described by Ezekiel. Therefore, five years after the beginning of the kingdom the “servant” class of the Lord on earth began to clearly sec that God had another work for the ‘ * faithful servant” to do before the end. The kingdom had begun, and the first great work would be the clearing out of Satan’s organization, and before the Lord would do that he would cause the members of the “faithful servant” class on earth to give notice by a world-wide campaign of testifying to the Lord’s purposes. It is thus seen that the physical facts exactly fit the prophecy and show that Ezekiel had his first vision five years after his captivity and that the “faithful and wise servant”, whom Ezekiel foreshadowed, had his vision of the kingdom-Elisha-work five years after the King was enthroned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For a number of years God’s people had waited for the vision to speak. Since about 1889, when Volume II of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures</span><span class="font4"> was issued and it was seen that there was a typical significance attached to Elijah and his work, the faithful had waited, expecting the year 1914 to mark the complete fulfillment of the prophecy. They had expected Armageddon to follow immediately after 1914 and the church to be glorified. Of course, it was not due time until after 1918 to have a clearer vision of the prophecy. Like the prophet Habakkuk, God’s covenant people had waited, and, while waiting, there were some curious speculations indulged in by them, which were’mere guesses, of course, and therefore not true, because it was not God’s time for them to understand. Habakkuk, referring to the “servant” class, wrote: “I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved. And the Lord answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie; though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.”—Ilab. 2:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was in 1919 that the “faithful servant” class began to see the significance of the Elisha work. The “servant” more fully saw in 1922 the meaning thereof. It was in that year that God’s covenant people came to a realization that they had been negligent in giving the testimony to the Lord’s name and that ‘the Lord was angry with them ’, but that the time had come to ‘turn away his anger’. (Isa. 12:1) In that year the faithful saw the Lord had come to his temple, and with joy and zeal peculiar to the house of the Lord they went forward to do the Elisha work in advertising the King and the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The vision was so marvelous and awesome to Ezekiel that he ‘fell down upon his face, and heard a voice of one speaking to him’. (Ezek. 1:28) When the Lord, through the columns of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> disclosed tho vision of the Lord’s coming to the temple, and its meaning, the faithful appreciative ones, designated as God’s “young men’’, like Ezekiel, fell down and worshiped in devotion to Jehovah. To these faithful ones the vision continued to increase in beauty and grandeur, and they have seen and now see that the great work of God’s anointed people on earth is to make a proclamation of the truth looking to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The “faithful servant” has since continued to hear the voice of the Lord and to joyfully respond thereto in going forward with the work committed into their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the young man Ezekiel was prostrated before the Lord he heard a voice of one saying to him: “Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.” (Ezek. 2:1) “And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me. And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.” (Ezek. 2:2,3) Then and there Ezekiel was given a commission to bear a message to the people of Israel. Since </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">anointing</span><span class="font4"> is symbolic of a commission granted and bestowed upon the anointed ones, this would represent the anointing of the faithful ones who were approved and taken into God’s organization. Those whom the Lord found faithful at the examination upon coming to the temple, as pictured by the parable of the talents, would here be pictured as receiving the anointing or commission.— Matt. 25:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the Lord came to his temple in 1918 he found two classes of servants: one that was moved by a selfish desire to be honored in the kingdom, and another unselfishly devoted to the Lord in doing his will. The first he later designates as the ‘<sup>1</sup> evil servant ’ ’, and the other as the “faithful and wise servant”. It is after the division and separation takes place that the “faithful and wise servant” is known and designated as “the remnant”. The “faithful and wise servant” is anointed and commissioned to care for the interests of the kingdom, and this is designated by the words of Jesus that ‘he would make him ruler over all his goods’. (Matt. 24:47) This prophecy would indicate that such anointing took place in 1919; and that the general outpouring of the holy spirit, according to the prophecy of Joel, occurred in 1922, when all in the earthly division of the organization of the Lord were commissioned to go forth with the message of truth. —Joel 2:28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ezekiel saw the Lord approaching to destroy Satan’s organization, and the “faithful servant” class saw in 1919 that the church, pictured by Elisha, must now do a vigorous slaying work in connection with the Lord’s destruction of “organized Christianity”. Shortly thereafter the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> magazine was issued, and issue No. 27 of that magazine laid bare the wicked deeds of “organized Christianity”. Several million copies of this number of the magazine were placed in the hands of the people. The “faithful servant ’ ’ class then got on its feet and went to work. The anointing was a commission to speak God’s vengeance against those who had reproached his name. In the commission given to Ezekiel “there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe”. Likewise God’s anointed and commissioned people were now commissioned to speak the vengeance of Jehovah against those who had reproached his name. (Ezek. 2:10) The anointed people of the Lord were therefore commissioned to publish these truths so that they could be heard and read and understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Time was required for the organizing of the work, and it seems certain that the “servant” class might have been more energetic than they were. Doubtless many were held back because of fear and something was required for such that they might have their eyes fully opened to the responsibility of the work they were commissioned to do. It is well known that some of the groups of God’s covenant people at that time hesitated to distribute No. 27 of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> magazine, manifestly because of fear. It exposed the duplicity of the clergy, and some feared to incur their displeasure. In the latter part of 1920 the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society began the distribution of the message contained in No. 27 of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font4"> Companies that failed or refused to distribute that message lost the privilege, and others were sent into their territory to make the distribution. By 1922 God’s people had come to a clearer understanding of their duties and the work took on a greater impetus, and those who were privileged to do it went at it zealously and fearlessly.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>PHONOGRAPH CAMPAIGN</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">B</span><span class="font4">ELOW are given reports received from members of the Bethel family engaged in the educational campaign with the portable phonograph:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Twenty-five hours of exclusively phonograph witness work, in December, yielded blessings beyond all comparison. In the preceding seventeen months there were 1.55 placements per hour in the 384 hours devoted to witnessing. By the phonogiaph method the placements, in the month just ended, were down to 1.14 per hour, but the blessings went up 100 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The phonograph method removes prejudice, awakens the sleeping, reawakens the dormant, creates new interest, convinces the people of the unselfishness of Jehovah’s people, creates an excellent impression in the neighborhood, causes tho people to read the books they already have, changes the witness work from racing to visiting, makes the territory last several times as long, and blesses the worker with beautiful and oft-repeated truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Four weeks, to the day, after a Polish farmer near Madisonville, Pa., refused to talk about the truth or to receive the witness into his home he and his wife and two grown sons listened to four records with great interest and appreciation and promised to read a free booklet. Their prejudice is gone, probably for over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the same neighborhood, a young farmer and his wife, members of a church the pastor of which is particularly vicious in his attacks on the truth (even to the extent of following witnesses down the street and openly warning against reading the literature), heard six records and obtained four bound books. He is only just now working, after many months ’ idleness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the same neighborhood, where a woman claimed she had most of the books, did not read them, did not intend to, and would give them away at the first opportunity, her husband heard six records and manifested intense interest and appreciation. Indications were he will now read the books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Kempton, Pa., a man and wife, Lutherans, resented anybody calling with spiritual food: they already had all they needed or wanted. Neither chair nor table was offered. Two records were played on the floor of the porch. One mentioned </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font3"> and when the book was then shown, the man, though out of work, obtained it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Friedensburg, Pa., a woman who had many of the books declined to hear the phonograph or to obtain more literature. At the roadside stand, alongside, her husband (and four of her children) heard six records, and the man obtained the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> combination, and went into the house from which the witness had just been excluded, to get the wherewithal to contribute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the same neighborhood a man sore on the world, and particularly on the Devil’s churches, after grudgingly hearing two lectures, said the biggest hypocrites are in the churches and, as for him, he listens every chance he gets to “the man from Brooklyn’’. He promised to read a booklet, even though his wife protested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Oceanside, N.Y., a woman had just joined the Lutheran church and did not wish to get “mixed up’’, but when she heard two lectures she concluded the Lord had sent the witness. She already had </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font3"> and obtained </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In same neighborhood where a most capable witness had just called and left nothing by the usual methods, along came the phonograph witness, by accident, thirty minutes later. The playing of seven records resulted in placement of a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches </span><span class="font3">combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Jericho, N.Y., a Sunday morning call in an antique shop resulted in a most enjoyable half hour, playing the phonograph before an open fire. Two bound books were placed. Playing the records placed the books here also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In same neighborhood an Irish Catholic gentleman, a watchman, demurred that he already had 250 phonograph records of his own and every night, all night, listened to the radio, as he had nothing else to do. He finally consented to hear one record, “Purgatory.” At its end he said, “Well, now, that would make you think; wouldn't it?” and obtained the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Flushing, N.Y., an Irish Catholic woman granted admission to the witness “from the Watch Tower, with choice male quartettes and lectures from the best radio programs in New York city”. She was puzzled and kept wanting, to know the objectives; but, by taking a hint from Esther </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Preservation, </span><span class="font3">pages 120-122), this information was withheld until the right time. When she had no more time to spare, she was shown four bound books, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches, Creation, Government, Preparation,</span><span class="font3"> with the information that these were the books mentioned in the lecture. She promptly obtained them, and, two minutes after the interview was closed, came out on the sidewalk to know if she might have another set on the same terms 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The stirring call of the year text, together with the instructions to make good use of the phonograph, should be a great stimulus and blessing to the Lord’s people and a great blessing in the witness work. At the same time it is becoming a terrible plague to the clergy and their allies. They are cowards who cannot stand being exposed. In a home where I was the other evening, a “reverend” came in and sat down. I turned to him, saying, “We are having a Bible study; will you wait?” Just then he had caught sight of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> books and quickly grasped the situation and jumped up as though someone had stuck a pin into him, saying, “No, no! Oh no!!” and out of the house he went. That was all I saw of him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It never dawned on me the help the phonograph can be, although, since the first time they were suggested by the Society, I have carried one almost every time I went to the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Two weeks ago I stepped into a home, but as soon as the lady realized who I was she went into a fit, shouting at me to ‘ ‘ get out! get out I ’ ’ Her two daughters ran to her asking “Mother—what’s wrong?” Her reply was “Bootherford! Rootherford! Our worst enemy!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thinking over this incident on my way home that evening, I could remember lots of cases where the people were bitter against “Rootherford and Jehovah’s witnesses” in geneial, but I don’t remember a single instance where people were rude or disrespectful after hearing the phonograph records. On the other hand, there is a ring of sincerity and authority that commands respect, setting the people thinking to their own good, and causes them to take literature where with ordinary witnessing methods they would simply say “no” and that would be the end of the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the past two months, above my regular work, I have put in fifty hours in witnessing and evening calls; and I must say the phonograph has taken me into more homes in that time than in a whole year previously and, as for giving testimony, I am sure it is even more effective than the radio, because of the personal contact and also having the literature right there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A few days ago, while witnessing, a man refused to listen and then said, “Don’t go to that house: the lady wouldn’t be bothered; and besides, she is blind.” I wasn’t taking instructions from him, and went to the door in question. The lady was not only blind, but sick in bed, too; a neighbor let me in. There was no radio in the home, and this poor soul had no way of hearing the message of truth and could not even read the Braille system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">She gladly heard the phonograph and expressed appreciation and her desire that I should come again, which I will do, considering it a privilege to bring a little comfort to such a one; and what better method than by phonograph?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As in this case, the phonograph adapts itself to almost every circumstance, and my report shows that more than 200 people have listened quietly to Brother Rutherford’s clear, masterly explanations of their favorite texts and, problems that have puzzled many for years—this number in the past two months. Words cannot express what was behind the nods, smiles, remarks and gestures that accompanied the playing of the records. One lady’s face, last Saturday, was a study in itself. Her face was hard, and she let me talk and talk till I had to ask her if she knew what I was saying, and I was surprised to hear her say, “Yes, perfectly.” She remained cold as ice, and shrugged her shoulders when I asked her to let me put on a record. I opened up the machine anyway, and started it going. When halfway through she came over and sat down by the machine. When it finished she picked up a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> and asked, “Does this book explain what the record has said?” “Why, certainly; and much more.” She took the book and agreed that I call back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jesus said, “My yoke is easy, and my burden is light,” he did not mean that we can serve by just relaxing and sitting at home. Making good use of the phonograph calls for a lot of hard work, and although we don’t always see the results of our labors right away, we do indeed get immediate results to our own good, because such work as this can only sharpen our own appreciation of the service and is therefore something that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font3"> need' as well as the people to whom we carry the message. I find it good -to keep the names of all who have had back calls, and call on them as new books and booklets come out, taking the phonograph along, too, of course. Bain spoils the phonograph, but some of the brethren are sewing up a little cover made out of some waterproof material—even an old raincoat. I have such a cover; and it lets one make back calls, as well as witness, in bad weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have also found that some who are attending meetings and taking part in the witnessing took many months to wake up to their privileges; so it would be a mistake to make one or two calls and then forget all about them. One gentleman, a Mr. S., heard the phonograph a few times but remained tangled up in his church activities. I lost track of him when he changed his address. About nine months later, I called on two people (a couple I had contacted months previously) to try to get them to come along to a meeting, and, to my surprise, Mr. S. had invited them to one of our study meetings in the neighborhood and they went there. I find that I handicap myself by moving around to different territories that are not convenient to each other, and intend to confine my activities as near one locality as possible, and as enough interest is worked up it is easier for a study to be started; and, after all, that is the aim we should have as we start witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For Catholics I find a happy combination with the * ‘ Purgatory” record is the use of the Douay Bible. The scriptures are about the same, and to anyone who can think at all, a few pointed texts from it shakes their dependence on the priests greatly. I show them the large embossed cross on the cover, then the endorsement by Cardinal Gibbons, then read from tha preface, which states that this is considered the most genuine and authentic Bible there is. The more prominent texts I use are Genesis 2: 7, Ecclesiastes 9: 5,10; 3: 19-22; Psalm 146: 4 (which is Psalm 145: 4 in the Douay), Revelation 12 (re war in heaven and woe to earth), Revelation 14 (re church, etc.), etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is evident that the past two years have been a preparation period for this grand instrument and only now are the Lord’s servants realizing the effectiveness of letting well-prepared records tell the message, instead of stammering lips, and I again express my gratitude to Jehovah for the privilege of using one of the new light portables, so easily carried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The most interesting run of phonograph back calls I have had was when a party of eight worked a few blocks, taking as many names as possible for the purpose of calling back. I followed up about twenty such names, practically all of which showed interest, took the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> and some other literature, and had at least three weekly back calls. A study was started with as many as eleven at one meeting; and I feel sure that if such a system were worked out and adopted, in city territory especially, the results would be gratifying and enthuse the workers to more evening work and help them to realize the advantages of the Lord’s new instrument, the portable phonograph.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Hitlerizing Ronkonkoma</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">R</span><span class="font9">ONKONKOMA (Long Island, New York).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">has been stirred to its very depths. Educational forces have become aroused. Hundred-percenters have mobilised their forces, and the flag-wavers have grimly set their faces, with mighty resolves to save and preserve the flag, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, the Magna Charts, the school system, the Union Jack, e </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">pluribus unum</span><span class="font9"> and the whole ding-busted country. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And why all this sudden militancy and warlike actions ? What great danger has so aroused and stirred these valiant preservers of the public weal? Believe it or not, it all comes from the actions of a little thirteen-year-old pupil of the eighth grade of the Lake , Ronkonkoma school. One morning in October Grace Sandstrom stood with her arms by her side while the flag-salute ceremonies were conducted. She had good reasons for so doing, for it is the law of Almighty God that no creature shall render obeisance to an image, symbol or emblem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Daniel R. Terry, principal of the school, saw her standing mute, and promptly informed her and the whole school that it was a criminal act against the country to refuse to salute and anyone not saluting the flag could be arrested and imprisoned. Daniel knew better than that. If he didn’t, he has no business teaching school. But in his zeal to save the state and jam love for the national emblem down the throat of the pupils he overlooked the necessity of adhering to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Perfervld Disciple of Hitler</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With fervor worthy of a better cause the principal endeavored to gag the conscience of his pupil. Threats and coercion were tried. She was sent home from school daily. Daily she appeared ready for classes, an,d each day she was thrust away from the school doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DECEMBER IS. 1937</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All to no avail. Grace Sandstrom had been taught that God’s law is supreme. She stuck to that principle regardless of the cruel tactics brought to bear. Reinforcements were then called in, in the person of Walter M. Ormsby, superintendent of schools. Ormsby labored with Gl&quot;ace. He threatened her and her parents with immediate arrest. That didn’t work. Something had to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The high official, the superintendent, could not face defeat by a child. So a compromise suggestion was made. If Grace would raise her hand with the others she could repeat Psalm 20:5 in place of the pledge of allegiance. Grace then went to the schoolroom. She held her hand to the ceiling, and repeated: “We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the Lord fulfil all thy petitions.” And Walter M. Ormsby thought he had saved the day, his face, and his country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It didn’t last. Grace was troubled in conscience. She could see that she had been decoyed into a compromise, and on the next school day she again stood with hands by her side while the others bowed before the flag. So once again the foundations of the Republic appeared to be rocking, and the whole educational system in peril. Therefore it was time to adopt drastic measures', and consequently Charles and Hilda Sandstrom, parents of Grace, were summoned to court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Did they charge them with teaching Grace not to salute the flag? No. They knew they couldn’t get by with that. These patriotic pedagogues who had been daily preventing the girl from attending the public school caused a complaint to be filed in court charging that the parents wrongfully, unlawfully, willfully, corruptly, falsely, maliciously and knowingly kept Grace Sandstrom from attending upon full-time instruction in the public school.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">While the case was pending in court it was deemed wise to send the girl to some other 1 school. The matter was presented to William *B. Hartley, principal of the North Babylon school. He gladly consented'to give her refuge. Mr. Terry was notified, and immediately wanted to know where she was going. He was not informed, and forthwith the search was on. Chief snooper, <sup>4</sup> Thomas W. Fish, truant officer, was put on the trail and evidently worked well, for within a few hours Mr. , Hartley was deluged with phone calls, and received an intimation from the Department of Education at Albany that it might be bad for the financial health of the school if they persisted in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">sheltering this conscientious objector. It worked. Regretfully he informed her that she would have to go elsewhere.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">Listen to Daniel R. Terry, principal of the Lake Ronkonkoma school, as he tells the. court, under oath, his conception of religious freedom:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Mr. Hays: You teach that the State has a right to make laws contrary to one’s re-1 i g i o u s convictions, even though we are guaranteed religions</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font20">Don’t</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">you teach that a law contrary to that is not a proper law ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Mr. Terry: No. I believe first in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Also, keeping in mind that the parents were on trial for keeping the child from attending school, note this admission from the principal:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Mr, Hays: Weren’t you the man that kept her from attending school ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Mr. Terry: No, I sent her home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Mr. Hays: Isn ’t that keeping her from attending school? Weren’t you the man that kept her from attending school?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Mr. Terry : Yes, I suppose so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Next we present to you the totalitarian sentiments of Sterling C. Girardet, president of the school board. Mr. Girardet is like Mr. Hitler. Hitler believes in religious freedom if it does not in any way infringe on the state, which is Hitler, Note the similarity of Girardet’s views. * - .</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">‘By their fruits shall ye know them.’ This patriotic ( ?) trio of Ronkonkoma, to wit, Ormsby, Terry and Girardet, have been shown up,. ;&amp;r&lt;n$k their acts and words, as sailing under false colors. They were left hanging On the end of the limb to the full view of all, not as lovers of flag and country, but as Fascist-minded -individuals who would junk the Constitution with its guarantees of liberty. They would chisel off religious freedom a la Hitler style, and hound, persecute and jail those who object to their authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Citizens of Ronkonkoma had better check up on the fruits of Hitler and Mussolini before they endorse the new educational system of this unholy trinity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">The Ronkonkoma gestapo having purged Grace Sandstrom from the public school and having also fastened a criminal conviction upon the parents, it appeared necessary to deodorize the matter through sanctity of clergy. So a self-designated <sup>4 4</sup> Reverend ’ David E. Sloatman, announced that he would speak at the local Methodist religious joint on the subject, “Would Jesus Salute the Flag?” Naturally his answer was “Yes”. It would take a brave man to say “No” with the</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">them, but they didn’t fit in with conclusions acceptable to his prominent church members; so why mention them ? He mentioned the early Christians but neglected to tell how they were thrown to the lions because they refused to salute the image of Caesar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">‘ The glory of our history is that the rights of minorities have been protected from continued tyranny by a ruthless majority. ’ ’ Nice words those, Mr. Sioatman.

<p><span class="font20">Mr. Sioatman further grandly stated, “We thank our American heritage for the liberty which we enjoy in preaching this sermon this morning. ” He was very much favored. The</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">Grace Sandstrom desired to preach loyalty to the great Creator by acts of obedience. She wasn’t granted that liberty.

<p><span class="font20">Mr. Sioatman’s statement and position bring to mind the case of the Reverend Pharisee of Jesus’ day who stood in the temple and grandiloquently prayed: “God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are, . . . or even as this publican. ’ ’ This Ronkon-&lt; koma dominie thus feels glad and grateful that he is not as other men are, particularly Jehovah’s witnesses, who obey God’s law and thus are deprived of the liberty topreach.

<p><span class="font20">a considerable stock in trade of Americans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">A religious sect calling itself Jehovah’s witnesses has appeared in news dispatches from various Eastern points recently because its members regard flag-saluting as idolatrous. The parents of 13-year-old* Grace Sandstrom of Centereach, L. I., have just received a suspended fine of $10 because they seem to have encouraged Grace in her refusal to “bow down before any one or anything but God,” and were thus technically guilty of “keeping the child away from school,” since the school authorities insisted on the flag salute. To Arthur Garfield Hays of the American Civil Liberties Union, who defended the accused, this appears to be a violation of religious liberties, and he lias appealed the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The issue is not whether Grace loves her country. She testified that she did. The issue is whether she should be compelled to show her love in a manner prescribed by the school authorities. For most of us the flag salute is a gesture into which we can read what symbolism we .Eke. For Grace it is a violation of conscience. But if the meaning of the flag were reduced to a single word, that word would probably be freedom. This is the “sweet land of liberty.” And it is a little hard to see any consistency in compelling a school child or any one else, by threats and fines, imprisonment or physical violence, to salute a symbol of liberty. No Communist was ever less a Communist for be-</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">Its doctors/ire like its officers of the law ; at ride the laws of the United States; they assume the right, and the power to deprive any United States veteran of his just rights and to throw him “out into the.cold” if he offends them, or if they discover that he is one of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">If a citizen of New Jersey has attained to the age of parenthood, and has become the parent of three children, and has never done one other thing to justify his existence in the world, he can ask for and receive relief to the amount of $55.00 per month for himself and wife and three children*and the state will pay it with a smile, if he belongs to the right “church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">But if a citizen of the state of New Jersey was in the front lines of six of the worst battles of the World War, and his nervous system is greatly impaired, and he is old before his time, and several boards of competent physicians have declared him totally and permanently disabled, and.he is one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and stands for his rights before a \ board of New Jersey physicians, which board is dominated by a Roman Catholic physician, the most he can get for himself and wife and three children is $18.90 per month, grudgingly paid; and he may not accept any relief from the state. In other words, he is fined $36.10 per month for having been sucha fool as to participate in the campaign of the New Jersey</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">, Let’s see. It was-Thomas MeCampbell (was it not?) who made the statement in the New Jersey legislature, “I consider it the rottenest, the most corrupt government, of any state* in the Union. ” Now to get down to the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Doctors Look otter Themselves</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The doctors of New Jersey take with great seriousness the adage that <sup>4 6</sup> self-preservation is the first law of nature”. Whoever else suffers, they are not inclined to add themselves to the list. The general tendency in this direction was indicated nicely when the Emergency Officers’ Retirement Act was passed, '</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">When it was passed it was intended to compensate officers who had actually been in jured in war service, and as records indicated that about 1,800 officers had actually been injured in battle, that was the number expected to be retired, so that the cost was estimated at approximately $4,000,000 per year. But when the attorney general ruled that injuries or disabilities which might be presumed to have resulted from service also entitled those so afflicted to the same retirement, it let down the bars, with the result that many medical officers^ rushed in to get nice incomes for themselves by qualifying for this retirement. Instead of a total* of 1,800 beneficiaries, there were, therefore, more than 1,800 physicians alone who were able to qualify. Of course, there was a slight increase in the number of others who were admitted, but it was the phenomenal influx of medical officers which seemed to attract the attention of the Congressmen. While there were twice as many officers of other branches retired, the number of medical officers retired was about 18 times the number they had anticipated.—American Bureau of Chiropractic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Atlanta Penitentiary is full of men that have done things almost as bad. They saw a chance to get something for themselves, no matter how they got it, took a chance, and got caught. Being a doctor does not necessarily add anything to a man’s honesty. Some think it makes it harder to be .honest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">The following are some of the high-minded physicians of the veterans ’ bureau drawing full salary and disability pay at the same time. Unlike the New Jersey Jehovah’s witness veteran, there is nothing of any consequence , the matter with these men; they never suffered as he suffered; they are not old before their time as he is old; they are not tied down to a grand total of $18.90 a month to support a wife and three children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Just see what these men get, and reflect that very probably some of them never saw any kind of service except a short time at camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Two of their <sup>(i</sup>brethren” (chaplains) are drawing life pensions of $125 a month, One of whom was called to the service on November 1, 1918, and the other on November 6, 1918. Now for explicit citations of doctors:</span></p>

<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Doctors Have Other Duties</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">It should not be thought that these doctors do not have other duties besides awarding themselves moneys intended for the benefit of the veterans. They do. Nothing is known of their private practice, but their practice on veterans is a matter of record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Medical Bulletin of the Veterans* Administration,</span><span class="font20"> July, 1934, Volume II, Number 1, for sale by Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D.C., at 15c, lists on pages 31-58 the treatment of 49 insane soldiers. They received 63 injections of neoarsphenamine, 539 of mercury, 1,308 of sulpharsphenamine, 4,840 of tryparsamide, and 5,417 of bismuth, making a total of 12,167. This is an average of 248 “shots” apiece, and all that takes time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Another thing that takes much time of the doctors is to so arrange their records that as few of the veterans as possible shall obtain what is their due. The more there is paid to the veterans the less there is for the physicians. Just a suggestion here: Much time would be saved the doctors if after the next war all the surviving veterans are lined up against a wall and machine-gunned to the last man. This would enable the doctors to take it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Harry Bochert, of New York city, liaison officer of the State Department of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, shows the progress that has been made in this direction. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">For the ordinary soldier to draw compensation he would have been required to have gone into the World War accompanied by a motion picture camera and two witnesses to watch him every hour of the day and night, a stenographer, a notary public, two doctors and a lawyer, also an X-ray machine.

<p><span class="font18">“What we call heart failure in acute disease is therefore a widespread complex about which we have very much to learn . . .

Basis for this New Jersey medical aetion is that he is one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Pension was then cut again to $14.40 per month for himself, $1 for each of his three boys, and $1.50 for his wife. A veteran can do a lot for a woman on $1.50, per month, awarded by a grateful government for killing himself in its service!</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">On one occasion when this man visited the and his family he was told ii| so many words that because he is insistent upon justice he would be “left out in the cold*’.

They made good their threat.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">To see the correspondence in this case for the last seven years is enough to make an honest man sick.

<p><span class="font20">The Veterans’ Administration decisions at Washington and Lyons, New Jersey, not only do not agree with each other, but when, at either place, the discrepancies are drawn to their attention the result is silence, in some cases running to two years. The plain intent is to despise the United States Government, and make it appear despicable in the sight of all men who know the promises it made to the soldier boys in 1917-1918.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">Q</span><span class="font20">UESTION: What shall I teach my children about Christmas? and how shall I relieve them from disappointment when they see other children with their gifts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Answer: Honest parents who love their children teach them the truth. A lie is repugnant to honest parents, and the children should be taught to hate a lie because God hates it. It is always proper to teach the children the truth. Falsehoods, even though apparently small when told to children, never result in good. One should never do wrong with the hope of good resulting. R</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Christmas is representatively a feast commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ. Celebrated in many countries, as it is, Christmas is a religious and a commercial practice based upon false statements and void of the truth. It is religious in this, that it is a formalism or ceremony founded upon the traditions of men and is dishonoring to Almighty God and the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a religious racket because it affords the opportunity to carry on a practice of wrongfully extracting money from the people. It is commercial in this, that it affords the opportunity to make and sell for a money profit a tremendous amount of worthless junk because there is wrongfully employed in connection therewith the name of Jesus Christ, the use of which name enables men to obtain money under false pretense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The Devil is the founder of all religions, which he has brought forward and caused men to practice in mockery of and for the purpose of defaming the name of God hnd Christ Jesus. Following the flood the Devil organized religion with Nimrod as tha visible and exalted leader and the one who was deified. Thereafter many forms of religion were introduced and practiced by the various nations. At Christmas time a so-called “Santa Claus’’ is supposed to manifest his power and the children are falsely taught that “Santa Claus” can ride through the air and descend through chimneys and bring to them gifts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The name ‘‘ Santa Claus ’ ’ is another means</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">of-expressing the same name as “Saint Nicholas”, or “Saint Nick” for short, and all of</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">which me&amp;ns “Old Nick”, that is, the Devil; and thus the Devil exalts himself and in mockery of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Christmas tree tradition is a symbol of the death and supposed resurrection of Nimrod, the Devil’s religious representative on earth. Nimrod married his own mother, Semiramis. The Devil’s associates, the demons, presented to this woman the hallucination that Nimrod was alive, and thereafter he was called the “Father of the Gods” and Nimrod was deified. This, of course, was due to the wrongful influence practiced upon the credulous people by the wicked angels or demons that operate with Satan, the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The purpose of the Devil in introducing the Christmas tree practice is to divert the attention of the people from Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and to turn them to objects or things contrary to the Bible. An evergreen tree is a symbol of a living creature. It has ever been Satan’s effort to destroy all creatures that acknowledge and serve Jehovah <sup>z</sup> God, and the practice of employing a Christmas tree is a part of his scheme to deceive the people. In America and other countries millions of evergreen trees are annually destroyed that they may be used in this religious and commercial ceremony. The evergreen tree that was named-the “Nimrod” tree is the same as the evergreen tree that is called the’ ‘ ‘ Christmas” tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Christmas is celebrated chiefly by men indulging in overeating and overdrinking, and by resorting to many senseless ceremonies and practices. Those religious practices being founded upon falsehood, and the children being taught such falsehoods by their parents, the children are really led into believing and practicing a lie. Such is generally due to the ignorance of the parents because they have never taken the time and trouble to ascertain the truth about Christmas. It is claimed that Christmas is properly celebrated on December 25 ‘because Jesus Christ was born that day’. That claim is entirely farise, because Jesus was bom in the early part of October. Jesus did not command anyone to celebrate His birth, but He did command that those who have consecrated themselves fully to dQ the will of God and follow in His footsteps should celebrate annually His death. It should be</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">♦ It is not so many years since H. L. Mencken made all America laugh with the way he went after the dominies. Now President Roosevelt comes in for it. Likening him to a snake oil vendor at a village carnival, Mencken said: “If he became convinced tomorrow that coming out for cannibalism would get him the votes he so sorely needs, he would begin fattening a missionary in the White House backyard come Wednesday?’ As to the Brain Trust, Mencken refers to them as a “ camorra of quarreling crackpots ’ ’ and a ‘' rabble of vapid young pedagogues, out-of-work Y.M.C.A. secretaries, third-rate journalists and soaring chicken-farmers”. Mencken fails to mention that Roosevelt, according to repeated claims of the Roman Hierarchy, got all these “good ideas” from the pope.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">They could only smile, for they knew Mr. Roosevelt was only joking. He could have done something to see to it that Jehovah’s people get their just rights, had he wished to do so, but he did not wish to offend the Roman Hierarchy,</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">♦ .Westbrook Pegler, the rascal, teases President Roosevelt for taking advantage of technicalities whereby he paid no federal or state income tax during the four years wherein he was governor of New York state, on a salary of $25,000 a year, and paid no state income tax during the years in which he has been president on $75,000 a year and $25,000 allowance for traveling; and yet he issued a message condemning tax evasion. Pegler says: “You ought to see the list of political patriots on the pay-books of New York City who draw $6,000 and $9,000 a year exempt from the big federal tax. ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>The Civil Service Joke</span></h3>
<p><span class="font20">♦ Roosevelt and Farley handled the civil service joke in the manner that has come to be the accepted American type. First they fired all the old and tried postmasters; then they appointed Democrats, and mostly Roman Catholics, in their place; then they announced that all postmasters in the country would be put on a civil service basis; and then they announced that the postmasters now in office (i.e., their Roman Catholic appointees) would be allowed to retain their offices indefinitely. That makes the joke 100-percent. The old men are out, the new men are in, and the new men are going to stay in; and that is American civil service.</span></p>

As all </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font20"> readers know, the word “religion” means ritual worship and formalism, and those who practice these debaucheries are not interfered with in America, in any manner whatsoever. Had Mr. Roosevelt said, ‘ * Today,, in America, there is still freedom to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of one’s own conscience,” he would have stated a great untruth, as the letter to the president by Judge J. F. Rutherford makes perfectly plain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">* + Once upon a time there was a kind-hearted intelligent man who had a very large family of chil- \ J dren. They all lived on a 4 large farm and produced an abundant supply of good things to eat. His sons and daughters worked the farm, and the father, the head of the house, managed the business and they all lived happily together. They built storehouses and stored the surplus food for future use. All went well till the father became selfish and put padlocks on the storehouses to keep his children out. Then the Devil seemed to take possession of the man and he said to his children, “You have produced too much food, so I am going to destroy what you have produced this year; for the storehouses are full/’ But he kept the padlocks on the storehouses, and gave his children the poorest of the food, barely enough to live on. He kept the best for himself, and to sell. He hoarded &gt;&nbsp;his money and became miserably rich and arrogant. Because of the ill-treatment by their father, and poor food and hard work, the children became discouraged. They had worked hard and produced plenty, but were compelled to live in poverty and want, while their cruel father lived in luxury and extravagance. This condition ended when the wicked father died and a new manager took possession of the farm. This is fiction.</span></p>

They kept back by fraud from the laborers and became exceedingly rich and arrogant. The Devil seemed to have gotten complete control of the rulers and they said to the people, “You have produced too much food; the storehouses are full; we must destroy some that you have produced ’<sup>9</sup>; and they began the work of destruction. But they kept the padlocks on the storehouses, and gave the people the poorest of the food, and not enough of that. They kept the best for themselves. Because of the ill-treatment by the rulers, and poor food and hard work, the people became discouraged. They had worked hard and produced plenty, but were compelled to live in poverty and want, while the cruel rulers lived in luxury and extravagance. This condition ended when the wicked ruler died and a new ruler took possession of the country. This may sound like fiction, but is true.</span></p>

<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Where the AAA Money Went</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">♦ One California firm that raises hogs on garbage got $150,000 for not raising hogs with the garbage which they were paid to remove. Nineteen hog raisers received more than $10,000 each for “not raising” hogs, and seven wheat growers received more than $10,000 each for not growing wheat. One Florida sugar grower received $1,067,665; one in Puerto Rico received $961,064, and one in Hawaii almost twice as much. Forty-six cotton growers each received over $10,000 for not growing cotton. The “not raising” and “not growing” business was one of the greatest discoveries of modern times. It was a big help in getting rid of taxpayers’ money and helping foreign growers of things “not raised”.</span></p>

It shows the farmer paying 148 taxes on his new overalls and everybody paying 154 taxes on soap.

No doubt Somervell, who shifted fifteen recreation teachers from the above job, would appreciate being made a second General Franco. Why is he a WPA administrator?

<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>Hookers, Stool-Pigeons and Finks</span></h2>
<p><span class="font25">T</span><span class="font20">HE United States Senate Committee on Education<sup>1</sup> and Labor received only $15,000 (later increased by an additional $35,000) , with which to investigate violations of free । speech and rights of labor in the United </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font20"> States, but early produced information worth many millions of dollars to those with any interest whatever in the preservation of American institutions. They added materially to the education of slang-using and slang-loving Americans when they dilated on the detective ' business with its hookers, stool-pigeons, ropers and finks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The hooker, or detective, makes it his life business to create and maintain trouble between business concerns and their employees; from this trouble he gets his revenue. In 1935 Robert A. Pinkerton, president of the Pinkerton detective agency, received $129,500 in dividends. His concern pays by the piece for stool-pigeons’ work squealing on their fellow employees. The stool-pigeons used to get $1 a day before regular wages were stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A good stool-pigeon, or betrayer of his fellow men, should be married, hard up and want a car; these requirements make him a better Judas. The stool-pigeon is encouraged to use his imagination. His reports are falsified. He is advised to join the union. Strikebreakers are of several sorts: the finks are privates in the ranks; ropers are informants or petty detectives; sluggers are the blackjack men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Most of them are ex-criminals, of course. All are well versed in starting violence and sowing discord between employers and employees. The employers buy the weapons which these men use against the real workers, but have learned not to buy the weapons in their own names. Lawyers fix all that for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">There is grand co-operation between the detectives and munition makers, and the police are often in on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Some of the employers of the Railway Audit and Inspection Company (engaged in the hooker, stool-pigeon and fink business) are such well-known and patriotic concerns as Borden Milk Company, Consolidated Gas Company of New York, Frigidaire Corporation, Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corporation, H. C. Frick Coal and Coke Company, Kelvinator Sales Corporation, National Dairy Products, Truscon Steel, Western Union, Westinghouse</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Electric and Manufacturing Company, Woodward Iron and Coal Co., and the Pennsylvania Railroad.

Co-operation has spread widely in the last ninety years, in 43 countries, but principally in Great Britain, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Russia, Switzerland and Japan.

<h2><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>Liberty in Southern Rhodesia</span></h2>
<p><span class="font20">rp HERE is still some liberty in Southern JL Rhodesia, in spite of the desperate effort made two years ago to bring the entire country under the domination of politicians controlled by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. In July, 1936, the Southern Rhodesia Sedition Act went into operation, under which Judge Rutherford’s books, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, The Final War, Jehovah, Supremacy, The Harp of God, Where Are the Dead f Riches, Beyond the Grave, Angels, Righteous Ruler, Deliverance, Government, Creation,</span><span class="font20"> and </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font20"> were banned. The case was taken to the High Court, which listened to arguments of counsel for two and a half days and then read all the books. Decision was rendered September 23, 19$7, that none of the publications &amp;&nbsp;seditious and that the Bulawayo magistrate who seized the books must release them and pay the costs of the action brought against him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Some will be interested in Mr. Justice Hudson’s summation of the theme of the books challenged. Although the learned judge failed to grasp and express the paramount issue constantly emphasized in all Watch Tower publications (that the Most High God is now doing His work in earth for the vindication of His own name, that all who will may now join in that work under the leadership of Jehovah’s chief officer, Christ Jesus, and that the relief and salvation of obedient human creatures is a wholly secondary matter), it is interesting, nevertheless, to notice that the judge’s summation went out, in columns of the Bulawayo </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle*</span><span class="font20"> to every part of Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia, and thus what was launched to stop Jehovah’s work, or cripple it, is made to really help it </span><span class="font18">. God, Jehovah, is the supreme ruler. Satan, then known as Lucifer, was originally part of God’s organization and the perfect man Was placed under him. Lucifer rebelled against God, who then changed his name and thereafter gave him the names Satan, Serpent, Dragon and Devil. Satan set up his own organization in challenge to God and through that organization he has for centuries' ruled the world. In thus ruling and controlling the world, Satan uses three elements, namely, commercial, political and religious. Of these the author singles out the last for his fiercest attacks. Organized Christianity or Christendom, as the religion of nations, is under the control of Satan, whose great instrument it is for deceiving the peo-pie, for seducing and misleading them, and keeping them superstitiously in subjection. All natidns, and all-their rulers and governments are included in Satan’s organization, the British Empire being specially mentioned in several of the works as being among the worst.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">To a world so burdened and oppressed relief will come. Jesus, the head of God’s organization, will again come to earth, and will destroy entirely Satan’s organization. It was not suggested that earthly beings would take a part in the work Of destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">There were, however, millions of people of good will in Christendom who wished to see righteousness in the earth. These were to be informed of God’s purpose, that they might take their stand on His side and thereby escape the great slaughter which would shortly follow. The information was to be given by persons styled Jehovah’s witnesses, by means principally of the distribution of publications such as those now being considered. After the testifying the “slaughter work” would begin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The second coming of Christ had already commenced. In 1914 God set Him on His Heavenly throne, thus enabling Him to drive out Satan from Heaven. In 1918 Christ entered God’s temple and offered himself as King and rightful Ruler of the earth. And so the great day Was at hand, when would take place the great slaughter resulting in the final elimination of Satan and all his works. After that, under the government of God, there would be an end of misrule and oppression and there would be peace in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Such was the theme, with variations, and purporting to rest on Biblical statements and prophecies, which ran throughout all the publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">It is stated that all present governments are hopeless and can hold out no hope for suffering humanity; that it is no use looking to them, as they are doomed to destruction. In every publication, however, people are advised and urged not to join any earthly organization and not to take part in any fighting or violence. They are told that if they dissociate themselves from earthly governments and accept the Word of God and preach it, they will be saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The books did undoubtedly call attention . to a fundamental defect in all governments, namely, that the individuals of which they consist were under the influence of Satan and so were inca' F &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font18" style="text-decoration:underline;">__</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">pable of wise and just administration. And they also pointed out the remedy—a belief in and adherence to God’s Word and the advent of His kingdom on earth. If then the books were written in good faith they could not, in spite of the effect they might have in exciting disaffection, be classed as seditious publications in terms of the Act.</span></p>

Its hospitals are crowded with the wounded and the dying, its churches filled with supplicants praying for peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Suddenly in the calm blue sky three German bombing planes appear. In perfect formation they slowly circle the city. There is no need to hurry. They are safe, for the Basques have nd planes to oppose them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">First come the explosive bombs, crashing into crowded streets, into the homes of rich and poor alike. Frantic with terror, those who have not been hit gather up the wounded and make for their cellars and basements, for any shelter at hand. This is what the bombers expected. Quickly they shift to incendiary bombs and again the planes circle the town, dropping their cargo of flaming death. In an hour the whole city is ablaze. With their churches, convents, hospitals, homes burning over their heads, unable to. escape, hundreds perish in horrible agony. Others, half mad with pain and terror, make for the open country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Like giant birds of prey the planes swoop low over the fleeing heads of the women and children. Like a scythe in a Wheatfield the machine guns mow down those who have so far managed to survive, Along the roads and into the fields the Fascists harry their victims. And finally in Guernica there is no sound but the dull crackle of the fires. The ‘Holy City’ of the Basques has been destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A thriving city of 70,000 souls reduced to ruins; every hospital and every church leveled to the ground; over three thousand civilians, most of them women and children, killed by bombs and machine-gun bullets, or burned to death. Such is the story of Guernica. Such is the record of the most brutally callous bombardment of a civilian population in all history.

<p><span class="font20">♦ John McGovern, Glasgow Catholic, orator, manifest remarkable courage:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The Jesuits have been driven out of every country in Europe because of their merciless conduct to the poor. I do not allege that the priests of Spain as individuals were rolling in wealth, but I do allege that as a churfeh it was rolling in wealth and plunder. The Spanish working class were cruelly robbed and plundered by the Hierarchy of Spain. If the Catholic population are prepared to burn churches j if they are prepared to burn monasteries, if they are prepared to bum convents and shoot priests, there is something radically wrong, because Catholics would npt commit acts of that kind unless they abhorred the Catholic system that is ruled, controlled and dominated by that priesthood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">I point out this to you—the conduct of this war in relation to the bombing of children in Guernica, the wiping out of every living thing, and the murder in the bull-ring of Badajoz, of 1,500 defenseless men and women who were machine-gunned until all that' remained was a bloody heap of rags; 600 were burned to death in the hospitals after one bombing raid; every single man, woman and child in one village was bombed by the instruments of Hitler, Mussolini and Goebbels. I say the conduct of this war has been brutal in the extreme and unchristian. I could not think of Jesus of Nazareth being on the side of Hitler, Mussolini, or Franco.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">♦ Dr. Norman Bethune, Montreal surgeon, back from seven months’ service in army hospitals of the Spanish Republic, asserts that there are “100,000 uniformed Italians officially in Spain, as of June 1, 1937, with half as many Germans. If these would all go back home the war would be over in a few months. He states there are not more than 10,000 international volunteers in the service of the Republic, and believes the Republic will win, anyway. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">♦ At Santa Agueda, Spain, insurgent aviators bombed the lunatic asylum. Eight bombs were dropped on the women’s pavilion, and six mental patients strolling in the garden were machine-gunned.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>Pope Not Interested in Basques</span></h3>
<p><span class="font20">♦ Nineteen Basque clergymen, of whom nine were eyewitnesses of the events narrated, wrote a joint letter, delivered personally to the pope, in which they told of churches and convents destroyed by Franco’s bombers, priests and nuns killed, noncombatant inhab-. itants of Guernica and other cities pitilessly machine-gunned by planes flying close to the ground, and other acts of devilishness that would move anybody with a heart to do what he could to put a stop to such vicious cruelty. The only comment this received from Vatican City was that protests emanating from the Spanish Republic would not receive a warm reception in Vatican quarters; which means that the pope is one of the most cold-blooded, hard-hearted old rascals that ever lived.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark111"></a>Virgin Mary Bombing (?)</span></h3>
<p><span class="font20">♦ Would you think the virgin Mary would take part in the bombing, and mutilation of women and children? Hardly. But one of Franco’s German planes killing and mutilating helpless women and children in Bilbao, Spain, also showered the city with piously worded appeals for surrender, and these appeals bore a large illustration of the virgin Mary surrounded with cherubs. For centuries the Roman Hierarchy has claimed that there is a financial working agreement between God and the Devil regarding “Purgatory”; now the agreement is extended to the virgin Mary and “Hell”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Among the 101 Documents</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">♦ .Among the 101 documents captured from Italian soldiers by troops of the Spanish Republic in the spring of 1937 was a copy of an order by Mussolini’s divisional commander General Mancini in which that ‘<sup>1</sup> worthy ’ ’ mentions in so many words that there were 50,000 fighting under the Fascist emblem in Spain. According to latest figures there are now about 180,000.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>Franco’s Desire to Murder Children</span></h3>
<p><span class="font20">♦ Franco’s desire to murder children was brought to the foge by his refusal to grant safe conduct to the little folks of Bilbao. If you ask what makes this beast act that way, the answer is that it is his <sup>i</sup> ‘ religion ’ Fascism in any form is the natural outcome of “religion” and capitalism—the bottom of the moral sewer.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>Hierarchy Is Still Covered</span></h3>
<p><span class="font20">♦ The newspapers merely record the fact that Juan March, financial backer of Franco the Butcher, has authorized him to spend another $1,500,000,000 in the Spanish war, but do not say where the money comes from. Why all the mystery? Where else could it come from but the Roman Hierarchy? Mussolini has no money. And who or what is it in Italy that Juan March goes to see immediately after he makes this promise of further huge funds for the overthrow of the Spanish Republic ? It is all plain enough; and if the newspapers wanted to do it they could easily enough establish Franco’s financial connection with the fabulous pile of ill-gotten gain centered at Vatican City.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>The Freemasons of Granada</span></h3>
<p><span class="font20">♦ One of the first acts of Franco and his officers, in every city they capture, is to obtain lists of the Freemasons. These are all then executed forthwith. At Granada the masters of the lodges were forced to dig their own graves, in the presence of their lodge brothers. The masters were then shot. Their brothers were forced to inter the bodies of the masters and then to dig their own graves, when they also were shot and buried. Similar deeds were performed at Saragossa, Huelva, Ferrol!, Vigo, Coruna, Oviedo, Valladolid and all cities occupied by the Rebel troops.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>Franco an Ardent Catholic</span></h3>
<p><span class="font20">♦ The “Very Reverend Father” Sylvester Sancho, O.P., in an address to the students of the Catholic University at Washington, said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">This war is to be considered as a religious war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">It is camouflage to say that it is economic, or.that it is aimed at the great landowners. General Franco is a gentleman and a good Catholic. He goes to mass every day and says his rosary with his wife and daughter every afternoon.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>O’Duffy’s Men Shot from the Rear</span></h3>
<p><span class="font20">♦ It comes out that one of the reasons why General O ’Duffy and his men returned from fighting with Franco Against the Spanish Republic is that on one occasion they were fired upon from the rear by Franco’s men, who mistook them for Republicans. This offended O’Duffy and his men and they retaliated, killing many of Franco’s men. The affair caused bad feeling; hence O ’Duffy quit.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>The Popular Vote in Spain</span></h3>
<p><span class="font20">♦ A favorite argument of those who try to justify Franco’s revolt against the Spanish - Republic is that the popular vote for the Right was greater than the popular vote for the Left. This is no argument at all. The same &gt;&nbsp;thing often happens in the United States, and must occasionally happen in any country that has a republican voting system. Thus, in 1876 Samuel J. Tilden, Democratic nominee for president of the United States, received the largest popular vote, though Rutherford B. Hayes received one more electoral vote and was made president. Tilden did not connive with a bunch of crooks to use the army to overthrow the republic. As a matter of fact, it is even contested that in the last Spanish election the Bight did have a majority popular . vote. The Foreign Policy Association declares that the Spanish Popular Front received 4,206,156 votes, the Center 681,047 and the Right 3,783,601. The Center and the Right are not identical, and if even one-fifth of them leaned to the Left, then the whole castle in air reared for Franco falls of its own weight. He is merely a traitor to his country; a re-pudiator of his solemn oath; a Judas.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>Italians Were Well Equipped</span></h3>
<p><span class="font20">♦ Dr. Norman Bethune, Canadian surgeon, and head of the Spanish-Canadian Institute for Blood Transfusion, back home after seven months’ service in Spain, said that more</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Spanish people offered themselves for blood transfusion purposes than could be used. The morale was very high. The food was also much better. The Italians helped, albeit unintentionally. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">After their rout at Guadalajara we ate spaghetti and drank Italian wine for weeks. And an entire loyalist brigade equipped itself with first-class Italian boots, machine guns and supply trucks! </span><span class="font20">Fifteen thousand fresh Italian troops landed in Spain the third week in June.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>A Million Men Fighting in Spain</span></h3>
<p><span class="font20">♦ Dr. Bethune, speaking in San Francisco, explained that there are now about a million men fighting in Spain. On the side of the Republic are 500,000 men, 85 percent of whom are Spaniards. On the Hierarchy’s side are 125,000 Italians, 100,000 Spaniards, 50,000 Moors, 50,000 Portuguese, 25,000 Germans, and 100,000 of other nationalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Fascist (Catholic Action) Acts of War </span><span class="font20">♦ Archibald MacLeish, editor of </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Fortune,</span><span class="font20"> in an address in New York, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">In 1914 the methodical and murderous shelling of the civil population of a Spanish sea-coast town by a German fleet would have been an act of war. In 1937 it is not an act of war. The Spaniards merely die, and the Germans sail away. In 1914 the massacre of the civil population of an undefended Basque village by German planes would have been an act of war. In 1937 it is not an act of war. The Basques merely lie kicking in the fields where the machine guns caught up with them, and the Germans fly away. The wars of 1937 are not fought by declarations and mobilizations. They are fought in the back streets like the assassinations of gunmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">Spanish Grandees Defeated Themselves </span><span class="font20">♦ When the Spanish grandees, who owned 51.5 percent of the Spanish peninsula, went Fascist, they threw away the fortunes that have been in their families for centuries. If' the Spanish Republic wins, as now seems not too probable, these grandees, having thrown in their lot with Franco the Butcher, and his Moors and other soldiers of the pope, stand not the remotest chance of ever getting back their lands. Not only are they legally lost to them, but they have already been divided among people that will never give them up.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>Manage to Get Planes to Franco</span></h3>
<p><span class="font20">♦ It is against the law for person^ in the United States to send munitions to the Spanish Republic, fighting for its life against the treachery of Franco and other army officials that tried to seize the country for the Hier-arcy, but apparently it is all right the other way round; for the report is that twelve of eighteen of Franco’s planes forced down in France were American-built. There seems every reason to believe that the heads of the American, French and British governments really want Franco to win.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">The Pope’s Ambassador to Franco</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">♦ The pope’s ambassador to the Spanish Rebel commander Francisco Franco is Isidoro Cardinal Goma y Tomas, bishop of Toledo. The bishop receives a salary of $600,000 for “looking after the spiritual interests” of the poorest, most nearly starved people under the sun. This is eight times the salary of the president of the United States, and gives some idea of what will happen in this country when the Hierarchy gains full control.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>Terror in the “Third Reich”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font25">J</span><span class="font20">EHOVAH’S witnesses in Germany recently distributed throughout the entire Reich an “Open Letter to the Bible-believing, Christ-loving People of Germany”,<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark132">1</a></sup> from which the following excerpts are quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In the official newspapers Jehovah’s witnesses are represented as criminals, enemies of the State, as Communists; and the leaders of the movement as Jews, although all the world outside of Germany, and millions of Bibleloving Germans are convinced that the witnesses of Jehovah are neither criminals, enemies of the State, nor Communists, nor Jews, but are merely plain, decent, God-believing Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The antagonism of the German <sup>4</sup>‘Partyjustice” toward Christianity and the Bible is clearly made manifest by an article in the periodical “The German Justice Official”, dated March 21, 1937, and under the caption ‘‘The Bible Student Undergoing Punishment”, written by Liesche, director of the penal institution, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The kind of atrocity fables the International Bible Students Association is intentionally seeking to spread concerning Germany and our “Fuehrer” is shown to us in a Resolution which was adopted by the Central European Congresses of Jehovah’s Witnesses at its meet in Luzerne, September 4-7, calling upon all people of good will to take notice that Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany, Austria and elsewhere are cruelly persecuted with incarceration in prisons, mistreated in fiendish ways, and some even put to death. The Hitler Government has inflicted every form of cruel punishment upon true Christians, and continues to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Upon delivery into the prisons the only concern of these witnesses of Jehovah is that they may have a Bible, so that they may follow up their antagonism to the State with planned and skillfully put together Bible passages, in an effort to influence other prisoners if possibly. Jt should be the concern of the punitive authorities to prevent such study of the Bible as leads to notes that may be used in a way dangerous to the State. It is therefore left to the discretion of the punitive authorities to determine how this may be prevented. The important thing, however, is that it be prevented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Paragraph 112, Clause 5, of Service and Penal Performance states: “To the Christian prisoners are to be supplied prayer and song books as introduced by the church authorities. Evangelical prisoners receive in addition a New Testament with the Psalms; Catholic prisoners, the Diocesan Catechism and a New Testament or the Bible history; Jewish prisoners, a prayer book.” But these provisions do not apply to the Earnest Bible Students as prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Since, according to Paragraph 112 S. T. P. 0., the object of an arrest for investigation is also for the purpose of preventing the prisoner from com-<sup><a href="#bookmark132">1</a></sup> mitting new punishable offenses, it would clearly be inconsistent with the purpose of custody to supply such prisoners upon trial with the very books [Bible and New Testament] from which they might continue to take for their inner allegiance to their<sup><a href="#bookmark132">1</a></sup> forbidden sect new food and encouragement to compensate for their antagonism against the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The competent judge may, therefore, upon a correspondingly substantiated request of a penal institution director, in all propriety order the entire Bible to be withheld from the Earnest Bible Students. . . . &lt;&nbsp;From this it may be seen that sufficient grounds are given for withholding the desired edifying books [Bible and New Testament] from the arrested Earnest Bible Students, if one would only endeavor to apply the paragraph in question properly, should these books be misused solely for the purpose of endangering the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">To the punitive authorities is given, in every case, the possibility of acting with the viewpoint that almost all of Jehovah’s witnesses must be considered as fanatics to their ideas who designate themselves as martyrs. There are few among them who are ever brought to reason by the serving of their sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Martyrs of the Christian Faith /</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The foregoing clearly shows that the objective of the battle is to rob the German people of the Bible and to suppress all who point to it as authority for the exercise of spiritual freedom and belief. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In Christian forbearance and for shame we have long refrained from calling public attention in Germany and foreign countries to these disgraceful actions. In our possession we have crushing proofs of the above-mentioned cruel mistreatment of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Among those inflicting this mistreatment, Criminal-Assistants Theiss of Dortmund and</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Tennhoff and Heimann of the Secret State Police at Gelsenkirchen and Bochum have especially distinguished themselves. One did not hesitate to ill-treat women with bull whips and rubber clubs. For sadistic cruelty in mistreatment of Christian women, as already mentioned, Criminal-Assistant Theiss and a man among the State Police in Hamm are' well known. We are in possession of particulars and of the names of about eighteen of Jehovah’s witnesses who were put to death by violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">For instance: In October, 1936, Peter Heinen, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, formerly a resident on Neuhuller street, Gelsenkirchen, was brutally slain by an official of the Secret State Police, in the city hall of Gelsenkirchen. This pitiful occurrence was reported to Reichskanzler Adolph Hitler, and copies of the report were also received by Reichsminister Rudolph Hess and the chief of the German</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">State-Police, Himmler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The cruel mistreatment and the kidnaping of Willie Ruhnau, formerly residing at 809 Adolph Hitler street, Zoppot, have been submitted as a petition to the League of Nations Council, and given publicity in the press of the entire world. The police of Danzig refuse to give any information as to the whereabouts of Ruhnau. He was doubtless spirited away by the Danzig police, and later slain.—Translated from the German </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font20"> of September 15, 1937.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">J</span><span class="font20">EHOVAH’S courageous witnesses in Germany continue to be an inspiration to God’s faithful people all over the world. The German </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font20"> of August 15, 1937., contains a touching resolution, adopted by 83 out of 86 present at a meeting in one of the most perilous corners of that dreadful land, wherein they pledged themselves to faithfully continue to witness that Jehovah alone is the true God, and Christ Jesus alone His worthy sovereign Ruler in the earth. They did this in spite of the fact that within six months prior thereto 50 of their brethren and companions had been cast into prison, from which number two had disappeared and several had been sentenced to long prison terms. They declared their unity with God’s people all over the earth, their confidence in His protection, and their determination to have a part in everything that the Lord defines as necessary and good to further expose Satan and his wicked organization. As the resolution was read to the little company several did not even wait to be asked individually if they affirmed, but joyfully expressed their willingness in advance ; and it is known that the ones in prison are in fullest accord. God bless all the faithful in Germany! ►</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font23" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>Brave Words by Martin Niemoeller</span></h2>
<p><span class="font25">I</span><span class="font20">T IS not springtime for the hopeful and ex-pectant Christian church—it is testing-time, and God is giving Satan a free hand, so that he may shake us up and so that it may be seen what manner of men we are!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Heroic Christianity” is still a human possibility and can be achieved even without faith; but in the hour of trial and sifting it, too, is blown away like chaff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The Lord Jesus Christ did not fall upon the field of battle, but was put to death upon the [tree]; he did not die as a martyr, but as a criminal; he was not admired, but despised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">We shudder at this way of the [tree], and we have a terror, which no courage and no remedy can help, of the curse of contempt and ridicule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The prospect of them puts an end to our dreams of martyrdom and heroism, and the only prudent course, when all is said and done, seems to be for us to deny Christ. ‘ ‘ One must do in Rome as the Romans do!” We are now faced with the unequivocal question: What about our faith? And we see—as in Peter’s&quot; case—that something more is needed for faith besides our resolution and our readiness to face suffering and sacrifice; we see that faith is nd unchangeable and inalienable possession, and on which we can rely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The stabilizing element in our faith does not lie within us; and what keeps us from falling in. the hour of temptation is not our own honesty and loyalty, but God’s loyalty, which upholds us.

<p><span class="font20">♦ Tyrants are always cowards; hence the fright with which the Hitler government is running down and imprisoning all persons known or suspected of being anti-Fascist. The Gestapo, secret police, work in groups of three. One arrests a workman. A few hours later two others go, to the homes of his friends, advising that they are couriers from Prague, have anti-Fascist material for the arrested man, and ask the second victim to take care of it. If he takes it in they arrest him. They also arrest him if he betrays any sympathy for the man already arrested.</span></p>

The women workers in the gas factory all have a bluish hue to their cheeks, arid blotched hands. Plants die in the neighborhood. A drop or two placed in the water caused thousands of carp to die, emitting a terrible odor. The gas is being used experimentally in the Dachau concentration camp.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">* IVJAMA, I burned my hands. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">IVA Bunny held out her tiny hands, frozen white and stiff. “The cold burned ’em all up dead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">£ “Here, Bunny,” called Jane, “Mama’s busy. I’ll make your hands better.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Jane brought cold water and dipped the little hands into it. Suddenly a puzzled look spread over Bunny’s face. “It’s sticky, now, Jane—all sticky like—like a fistle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“You mean, like a thistle?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Uh-huh. And it—it jags.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“That’s because the ‘burn’ is going away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A moment of silence, then, “Jane, I’m glad the robins went awtiy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Why, Bunny?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20"><sup>4 (</sup>So they won’t get their feets burned in the snow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Buddy stirred from the comer where he was busy repairing a ‘yankee’. “I like summer best. There’s things to see—fish, and toads, and turtles, and snakes, and just lots of things. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Sure; and birds,” added Bunny. For the next two or three minutes she gave her attention to the interesting process of having her hands rubbed briskly in a rough towel. All at once her eyes widened in surprised horror.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Jane! The forties! What do they do in winter ? ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Aw, she means turtles,” said .Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Well, anyway, what do they do? Do they go away like birds ? ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“No. They bury themselves in the mud.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“What mud?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“The mud at the bottom of streams or ponds. They keep very warm in the mud, and all winter long they sleep there. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“How about toads .and frogs?” asked Buddy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Frogs, also, hide in the mud. Toads bur-' row into the ground.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“What’s that mean?” asked Bunny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“It means they dig down into the ground deep enough that<sub>t</sub>the frost can’t reach them. There they are able to keep warm even in . very cold weather.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“I know about the squirrels,” offered Buddy. “They gather nuts and hide them away in holes in trees. Then they live there all winter. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Right. Field mice also store away food in</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">burrows for winter use. The bear stores away food, too, but he stores it inside himself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“How?” asked both children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“He eats and eats before cold weather ‘ comes. He eats so much that he gets very fat. Then he crawls into a cave or a hole in the ground and goes to sleep. He sleeps there until spring comes. He isn’t fat any more, then, but very thin and very hungry; so off he goes in search of food. The skunk passes the winter in the same way. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">v “Do rabbits do that?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“No, rabbits don’t store food. They go out and get their meals all winter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“What do snakes do?” Buddy wanted to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">*<sup>f</sup> They hide in holes in banks or under the roots of trees.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Do all the butterflies die?” asked Bunny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Oh, no. Some never get to be butterflies before winter comes. They live as eggs or in their chrysalises—those little houses the caterpillars make—until spring. Some butterflies hide in sheltered places while it’s cold. But strangest of all, some of them migrate—that is, go south—just like the birds.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“That’s funny,” Buddy murmured. “Do they go in bunches ? ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Oh, yes, great * bunches’; sometimes so large they make the sky seem dark. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Don’t they get tired?” Bunny worried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">‘ ‘ Sometimes. Then they rest. Often they fly down onto the water and float along for a while.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Oh! They swim! Who taught the butterflies to swim?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“They don’t exactly swim, Bunny* They just float along. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20"><sup>i</sup> ‘ Sure, ’ ’ Buddy said; <sup>1</sup> ‘ and nobody taught them. That’s just how God made them.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">♦ Cyril Brown, in the New York </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font20">makes the common-sense observation that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The great trouble with our country today is that it is being run by reformers. Every one of these ‘saviors of the people’ is making a mighty good living out of reforming. It all costs a lot of money; but, then, it is not the spenders who intend to foot the bill, so they do not worry. Meanwhile the labor agitators and our politicians are living on the fat of the land and industrial strife is their meal ticket.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">W</span><span class="font20">INTER is due. Yet nature seems to pause, to hesitate, like the swimmer who is about to plunge into the cool waters of the sea. It is that brief interlude, neither fall nor winter, which is accompanied by a vague inertia that creeps into the blood and makes one seek the cheerful environment of the home or fireside. Hence the fields are deserted by man as well as by the migratory birds and the beasts in their holes and the cattle in their stalls. Only the furtive rabbit slips quietly through the long grasses and looks about timidly, seemingly reluctant to confine itself completely to its winter quarters, the entrance to which it has hidden carefully beneath the tufts of grass on yonder cliffs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">On the bosom of the quiescent pond there is as yet no hint of ice, as it tremulously re<sup>j </sup>fleets' the barren trees. A few brown leaves on bush and tree rustle disconsolately in the fitful breeze, or drift drearily to the sear grass to rattle lifelessly along the rutted road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A hazy sun looks coldly down on the barren landscape or withdraws itself behind the gray cloud-curtains that cover the leaden skies.<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The- whole aspect of nature recalls those</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">ancient lines that so pathetically express both the sorrow and the hope of the poor;</span></p>
<p><span class="font18"><sup>w</sup>Winter wakeneth all my care, Now these leaves waxeth bare.

<p><span class="font20">There is little trace of the winter rain of a week ago or the transient snow of yesterday, which gave a chilly hint of what will follow as winter chores and winter sunset varied with winter sport, winter thaw and winter crystal succeed one another in rapid sequence and lead on to the uncertain, March snow, which gives way in turn to the resurgent sap in the reviving maple and the trumpeting of the antlered deer.

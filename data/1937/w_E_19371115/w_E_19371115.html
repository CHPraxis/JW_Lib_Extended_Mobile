<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PART «</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH hates the wicked. “As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.” (Rom. 9:13) This does not mean that God loved Esau some and loved Jacob more. “Jacob” stands for those who faithfully serve Jehovah; &quot;Esau” stands for those who practice the Devil religion for gain, and Jehovah hates that class, because all such are on the Devil’s side. The most reprehensible on earth are those who pretend to serve God, and who constantly bring reproach upon his name, and who inflict punishment upon God’s servants because they serve God faithfully. Being subjected to persecution because of faithfulness to God puts to the test his servants, which test, if properly met, will work to the good of the righteous. “Jehovah putteth the righteous to the test, but the lawless one and the lover of violence his soul doth hate.” (Ps. 11:5, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.;</span><span class="font4"> Rom. 8:28) The lawless and the lover of violence, who practice violence contrary to God’s law, arc the religionists in particular. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy takes the lead among the wicked and is therefore the worst among the wicked. That wicked institution arrogantly and blasphemously assumes to be the representative of God and Christ on earth, while, hiding behind its false cloak, it prosecutes its wicked schemes to gain power over the people. Jehovah has appointed the day to fully recompense that wicked crowd, and the time for the expression of his wrath against them appears to be very near. The faet that the Lord God now makes clear to his people what his purpose is concerning the wicked, and shows to them that the religionists are the chief ones of the wicked, is strong and persuasive proof that the time of the execution of Jehovah’s wrath against the wicked is near at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah gave Jeremiah a vision of what his purpose is toward the wricked, and he caused his prophet to act out a part in making clear that picture. “Then took I the cup at the Lord’s hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the Lord had sent me.” (Jer. 25:17) Jeremiah then performed this pictorial drama or that part of it foretelling what those whom Jeremiah represented should do in the future. Whal he did was not an easy task for Jeremiah to perform, but he did not refuse it because it was hard, Uis commission from Jehovah obligated Jeremiah to perform faithfully the duty laid upon him. It was a God-given job. Jeremiah was fully advised of the mental condition of the clergy of his day, and he knew that to carry out his commission would bring hard things upon him from the religionists. But it was a joyful service because he was rendering it according to the will of God. Jeremiah had learned that the joy of the Lord was his strength. That joy was an antidote for all the disagreeable and painful parts of the tasks that lay before him. And what did that foreshadow? It foretold exactly what the witnesses of the Lord today are commissioned to perform and must perform. Looking at the picture made long ago foretelling disagreeable conditions, and having in mind the cruel persecutions that have here been inflicted upon some of their number, particularly upon the faithful in Germany and New Jersey, the remnant now well know that the task before them is not an easy one, but the difficulties that lie in their pathway do not deter them in the least from proceeding to the performance of their commission. The true, faithful and zealous ones arc not now wasting their time, and the time of others, by writing letters and asking what they shall do. They have the commandments and orders from the Lord, they know their duty, and they arc going forward to perform it. It is well that they know this. Some of the Lord’s people are not now privileged to communicate by letter with others. They arc not permitted to receive the publications of the Society, and particularly </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Waichtoiver.</span><span class="font4"> But they have fed upon God’s Word and know what he has commanded the faithful to do, and they are doing it, even at the cost of their own lives. They are not writing long dissertations in to the office and saying: “I have run onto this interpretation, and I want it answered to my satisfaction.” Those who are indulging in this kind of practice, wasting their time and the time of others, will not keep abreast of the Lord’s army, and they will not stand the test and will not go through to the end. No one is justified now in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">wasting time to stop and discuss the question as to whether or not the Lord Jesus has come and is at the temple, and whether the apostles and other faithful saints have been resurrected or not. These questions have long been settled, and now the faithful see a duty to be performed and are eager to perform that duty in the strength of the Lord. Let this be an answer to letters of this kind that arc written asking for the space in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> to be used to answer their questions, which have heretofore been clearly answered. The army of the Lord is moving forward under the command of Christ Jesus. There is no time for quibbling. Our duty is to obey the Lord, and particularly so when his commandments are clear and specific. The purpose of unfolding the prophecies to his people now is to encourage and strengthen those who arc in the front ranks to go on and not lag behind.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">* The command to Jeremiah was to make “all the nations ... to drink” to whom the Lord sent him, and he did so. In a symbolic or figurative way he caused the people to drink. What he did was to make a picture foretelling what would come to pass in the last days, that is, in the day of Jehovah. The record docs not show that Jeremiah left Judah and Jerusalem and journeyed to all the nations named, nor docs the record show that he sent messengers to such nations to deliver the cup and to make them drink. The record at chapter 27 of Jeremiah’s prophecy shows that he did take advantage of the presence in Jerusalem of the ambassadors or representatives from Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Zidon and that he sent the “cup” with them, or that he made them the official representatives of their respective countries or governments to drink the cup. Also Jeremiah did send the Lord’s written statement or message with Prince Scraiah, whom Zcdckiah the king was sending to Babylon. Seraiah was directed by Jeremiah to read what he had written in a book, of all the calamities that should come upon Babylon, and after reading it he was to bind it to a stone and cast it into the Euphrates river, thus symbolically foretelling what should befall Babylon. (Jer. 51:59-64) The picture made by Jeremiah, however, was complete, showing how the message of Jehovah’s warning gets to all nations of the earth in one form or another. For this present day Jehovah provided the radio, which has carried the message of the kingdom to almost all the nations of the earth, thereby giving the people warning that Satan’s world is to be destroyed and Christ Jesus shall reign in righteousness. lie also provides sound equipment to otherwise transfer the spoken message to various parts of the earth. In addition thereto Jehovah’s witnesses have the printed message in as many as seventy-five different languages and dialects, and which are distributed in that many and more countries of the earth. In the United States alone are some peoples of almost every nation of the earth, and these have been brought into contact with Jehovah’s message in some form.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">In obedience to the Lord’s command his witnesses have carried the testimony to the nations, and they must continue to carry this message as commanded; and when this is done and completed, then, as Jesus declares, the greatest tribulation of all time shall fall upon the nations. (Matt. 24:14,21) The message of Jehovah at the present time has become so very bitter to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy that that wicked religious institution employs every possible effort to suppress God’s message of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CATHOLIC ACTION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">* In the outposts of the British Empire, which arc generally known as the colonics of Great Britain, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is causing laws to be enacted prohibiting the importation or sending of the printed message of God’s kingdom into those countries. This devilish religious institution has become so bold that it publishes in its own papers that it is using its power and influence to cause the enactment and enforcement of such laws. This of itself is a clear admission that the clergy of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization have received the warning, and they will never be able to plead ignorance of God’s purpose to destroy them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> In the United States, which has long been considered a place of freedom of speech, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has been able to put the clamps on radio stations, newspapers and other means of publication to prohibit the free and wide proclamation of the message of God’s kingdom. They do this on the pretext that the message of God’s kingdom “shocks their religious susceptibilities” and causes dissension amongst the people, and should be prohibited. At the same time the big moguls in the Roman Catholic organization, and their political tools which they put in office, unhesitatingly and without hindrance flagrantly denounce the highest court in America because that court does not yield to the seductive and political influence of the Hierarchy. This is a further admission that the Hierarchy have heard the warning and that it has stung them to the quick; and never shall they be permitted to plead ignorance that they did not know what God was sending upon them. Let the Hierarchy and its representatives, as they read what is here said, take further notice that God’s message shall be declared and that they now have no power to stop the oncoming of Jehovah’s Executioner, who shall inflict upon their wicked organization the judgments of Jehovah long ago written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses are not trying to convert the world, they arc not carrying on a propaganda, they are not engaged in a bigoted proclamation in order to cause dissension, as the clergy of the Hierarchy falsely claim. Jehovah’s witnesses are obeying God’s commandments to tell the truth; and let the people of good will, who are honest and sincere, take note of this fact and obey God’s Word and refuse to give further heed to the malicious and false accusations made by the Roman Catholic clergy and their </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">allies </span><span class="font4">against the representatives of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BEGIN WITH RELIGIONISTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>r</sup> The </span><span class="font4">prophetic part of the drama enacted by </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jere</span><span class="font4">miah at God’s command shows where the cup </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">must </span><span class="font4">first be delivered, when he says: “To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as it is this day.”— </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jer. 25:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, the kings </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">others thereof, claimed then to be God’s people. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">They </span><span class="font4">pictured and therefore foreshadowed the religionists, clergy and the others of “Christendom” today </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font4">claim to be the people of the Lord and to be ruling the world by divine right. The clergy, the priests, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">preachers and practitioners of the Jews’ religion </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font4">hire, professed to be God’s servants, and they claimed to be the seed of Abraham according to God’s promise. They were bound by the terms of the law covenant, which God had made with that nation through Hoses; and they were also bound by the covenant of obedience and faithfulness to the Lord (Dcut. 29:1-14); and they were also bound by the terms of the everlasting covenant concerning the sanctity of life. (Gen. 9:</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1-17) </span><span class="font4">But they had fallen away to the Devil religion and had broken all these covenants and were worthy of destruction. (Rom. 1:31,32) They were bloodguilty, and there was no way for them to escape. Whom did they foreshadow? The facts clearly show, and that beyond any question of doubt, that they foreshadowed the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies and rulers and nations of “Christendom”. No one will attempt to question the fact that the Roman Catholic </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Hier</span><span class="font4">archy claims to be the only true representative of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font4">and Christ on earth. That unholy religious crowd uses its influence over the political rulers of the nations and causes them to join the Hierarchy in reproaching God’s holy name. They arc all without excuse. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">They </span><span class="font4">have been warned. All those religionists and their supporters claim to be Christian, and they therefore are in an implied covenant to obey the commandments of Almighty God. They claim to be followers of Christ Jesus, and therefore must obey him whom Moses foreshadowed. (Acts 3:22,23) They are also bound </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font4">the terms of the everlasting covenant concerning the sanctity of life. They have broken these covenants </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font4">the shedding of human blood viciously and without regard to the rights and privileges of other creatures. They have wickedly and ruthlessly engaged in slaughtering animals, contrary to God’s covenants. They are covenant-breakers and guilty of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* How do the men of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy deport themselves? They claim to represent Jesus, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font4">they arc wholly unlike Jesus, who was meek and lowly of heart and adhered strictly to the commandments of Almighty God. They follow the traditions of men and make void the Word of God. Far from following the course that Jesus took, who made himself of no reputation, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and particularly the cardinals and bishops, now go about wrapped in lace curtains and wearing lace “pants” or aprons, and dazzling tinsels and peculiar hats, and pose as sanctimonious and holy ones while everybody who knows them knows they are the crookcdcst gang that have ever afflicted the earth, and that they are carrying on the worst racket that has ever been practiced upon any people. These chief men of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy are scornful men. They use high-sounding words in praise of themselves, and with scornful countenance and haughty mien they command the people to do their own selfish bidding, and this in utter disregard of the people’s rights. The Hierarchy assumes the power and authority to tell the people what they must and must not read, when and where they must go, and what they must do, and to what they must listen and to what they must not listen. They attempt to control and rule everything in the land of “Christendom”. They have gotten their hooks so completely into the political and judicial element of almost all nations that the Hierarchy is really the power behind the throne that rules the nations of “Christendom”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Jehovah now speaks to that wicked and unholy crowd of religionists through his prophet and says: “Wherefore hear the word of the Lord, ye scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem,” anti-typically “Christendom”. (Isa. 28:14) These words of Jehovah without doubt apply to the Hierarchy. They arc the ones that have said: ‘Our organization is invulnerable; even hell itself shall not prevail against us’; and therefore the Lord says to them: “Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell arc we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not eomc unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves; ... ye shall be trodden down.” (Isa. 28:15,18) It is this ruling crowd of “Christendom” to whom the Lord commands the cup shall be taken and that these shall be the first to drink of the cup of this fury.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> And what is the purpose of compelling them to drink of the cup? Jehovah answers: “To make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse.” It is upon this religious crowd of “Christendom” that Jehovah begins his “strange act”, and that could well appear strange to all supporters of the Hierarchy and all the dupes thereof and they will say: “It is strange that God would so afflict an organization that for centuries has been using God’s name.” That organization has been using the name of God blasphemously in practicing its religion for pecuniary gain. God knew the end from the beginning, and it pleased him to speak of the things that did not then exist as if they weie already in existence. (Rom. 4:17) Therefore Jehovah says, as stated in the prophecy, that he is bringing upon “Christendom” this curse, “as it is this day.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> The picture enacted by Jeremiah shows that it applies when Jehovah begins his “strange act” against “Christendom”. At the time that Jeremiah enacted this picture it was eighteen years before the fall of Jerusalem. Jeremiah saw by faith and believed what God would bring upon Jerusalem, and he was not ashamed to boldly announce Jehovah’s purpose. While the fall of Jerusalem was a minor fulfillment of the prophecy, the complete fulfillment thereof is upon “Christendom” in the day of Jehovah, which is at the present time. The message of God’s prophet exposed the religionists of the Jews to shame and hissing; and today the honest-hearted Catholics and non-Catholics, who believe on God and Christ Jesus, look with contempt and hissing upon the fraudulent Roman Catholic Hierarchy that practices its religion for personal gain. Jehovah God’s message, written in his Word and now being delivered, is like a hailstorm, and, says the Lord, “the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters (truth] shall overflow the hiding place.” (Isa. 28:17) The double-dealing, the extreme crookedness of the hypocritical Roman Catholic Hierarchy and of other religionists’ supporting institutions, arc now being uncovered in order that honest persons may view them in their true state. “Christendom,” that is, the hypocritical religionists that claim to be Christians, shall be the first ones, according to Jehovah’s decree, to ‘drink of the cup of this fury’.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO IS NEXT?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” The fact that Jehovah’s “strange act”, that is, the battle of the great day of God Almighty, will begin by the destruction of the religionists of “Christendom” does not mean that there will thereafter be a period of witness work for the purpose of gathering the “great multitude”. On the contrary, the Scriptures show that the witness work must be completed before the great tribulation begins. (Matt. 24:14, 21) When the old “whore” goes down, there will be some that will weep and wail, and the chief ones amongst that wailing crowd will be those who have commercialized the religion of the Roman Catholic system and her allies. And why will they wail </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font4"> Because they will understand that they are next in line for destruction ; and this is shown by the statement in the prophecy: “Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people.”—Jer. 25:19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> The great commercial traffickers (pictured here by the rulers of Egypt) and their cruel, selfish hirelings or servants (the Ethiopians), advocators and hired killers, including the police, the army, and the navy, and the conscienceless politicians, all forming a part of the world organization, all must drink the “cup” and drain it to the dregs. They are the rulers in the world which are symbolized by Egypt. “Organized religion” not only is and has been friendly with the political and military elements of the world, but has depended upon such to help carry on the religious schemes and perform their ceremonies by which the people have been hoodwinked. The religionists, and particularly the priests or other clergymen, have ‘gone down to Egypt for help’, as the prophet Isaiah (30:2) puts it, and have turned their backs upon Jehovah God and his King, just as Jehoiakim and Zedekiah, the kings of Jerusalem, did in their time. The reliance of the religionists or religious practitioners upon Egypt, the world, is like leaning upon a bruised reed: “La, thou tnistest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.”—Isa. 36: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> In the prophecy of Jeremiah, in chapter 25, and particularly in chapters 46-51 inclusive, Egypt is dealt with after Jerusalem. The same is true as set forth in other prophecies, to wit (Ezck. 32:1-32): “There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncireumeised, and with them that go down to the pit. There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircum-ciscd with them that be slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit. Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord God.” (Isa. 19:1-22; Zech. 14:18,19) These prophecies all support the conclusion that when the religious systems, the old “whore”, fall, then the punishment will proceed to the Godless element, that is, the commercial and political elements, their allies and supporters.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup>“Egypt,” antitypically, includes the commercial elements; but there are others which must drink of the “cup”, and which arc specifically named aside from Egypt: “And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod.” (Jcr. 25:20) “The mingled people,” as they are called in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Authorized Version, Rotherham</span><span class="font4"> (margin) renders in this wise: “And all the Bedawin,” or, “mixed multitude.” That means mongrels of no specific nationality or race. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> Book Two, page 134.) “Uz,” named in this part of the prophecy, is dealt with. The land of Uz was where Job resided, and was in the east. (Job 1:1-3) Since the day of Job it is no longer a “land of Consultation” with Jehovah, but has been Godless. It represents that Godless people of the earth that have adopted the policy of dealing with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy by sending ambassadors to the Papal court; such as mentioned in Jeremiah 27:3. Its people are wholly devoted to the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hence it is written in the record: “0 daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself [vile] naked.” (Lamentations 4:21) Such are profe.ssed “Christian” religionists who are entirely and openly against G'od.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> The prophet next mentions the kings of the land of the Philistines, specifically naming the principal cities of the Philistines. The Philistines in the drama in which Samson played a part, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">also in that of David’s time, picture the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Seeing the setting of the picture by Jeremiah’s proph</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ecy, </span><span class="font4">the Philistines here appear </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">represent the commercial religionists and necessarily include the Hierarchy, which is commercial and political and works with the religious practitioners </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses and resisting the work of God’s servants in the realm of the earth controlled by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> The Scriptures show that Jehovah hated Esau (Mal. 1:3); and yet Esau was, according to the flesh, a descendant of Abraham. Jehovah hated Esau because he went entirely over on the Devil’s side. Edomites were the descendants of Esau. And so the prophecy declares that that people must drink of the cup of this fury: “Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon.” (Jcr. 25:21) Moab and Ammon were in the same class. The nations here mentioned appear to refer to others in the conspiracy against the Lord and his faithful servants, and who arc </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">moved </span><span class="font4">by the Devil to do his bidding in reproaching the name of God and violently opposing his kingdom. (Ps. 83:2-12) They have no faith in things pertaining to God, but they connive with those who practice the so-called “Christian religion” for selfish or commercial purposes, and together they seek to do injury </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses and are haters and persecutors of all who try to do good to their fellow man and, above all, of those who are diligent in proclaiming the name of Jehovah. In other prophecies the Edomites picture the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the religious practitioners; the Moabites picture particularly the commercial element; and ‘the people of Ammon’ refers to the political religionists, whether within or outside of the nations called “Christendom”, who do not acknowledge Jehovah or even pretend to worship and serve him. They picture a people who practice some form of Devil religion and who are received by and consort with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy as her allies. They are a people that are self-centered, self-contained, relying upon their own strength. (Jer. 48:1-46; 49:1-22; Amos 1:11-15; 2:1-3; Isa. 15:1-9) The people here referred to represent those who take a delight in hissing God’s people and hindering them in their work and mocking and persecuting them.—See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication, </span><span class="font4">Book Two, pages 27-36.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1 4</sup>It is clearly made manifest that Jehovah’s purpose is to cause every nation to feel his strong arm, and therefore he names the nations specifically: “And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea.” (Jer. 25: 22) In certain prophecies Tyre pictures the Hierarchy ; but there are many persons connected with the Catholic organization who have no faith in what the Catholics teach, but who hold on to the Catholic organization for the commercial gain derived by such association. By their mouths they may claim to be Catholics, but they really have no sincere devotion to the organization aside from what pecuniary benefit they derive by association with it. The peoples of Tyre and Zidon well picture such a class, because the ancient people of Tyre and Zidon selfishly operated for pecuniary gain. In brief, the nations described in this part of the prophecy include those who acknowledge the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and its religion solely for gain in a pecuniary way. In support of this conclusion, note that a Catholic of authority says:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“Though Catholic laymen as such have no jurisdiction in the Church, they are today the chief agents in the work and development of the Church. They are ready and willing to help the great cause. Priests and bishops mingle with them, guiding and advising them, and taking the lead openly when important issues are at stake. But the heavy work, the spade work, is done by the laity, men and women, to whom ‘the Catholic Cause’ appeals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“There was a time—it is now past—when only pious Catholics took part in the work of the Church. But today many Catholics who cannot qualify as pious are busy about Catholic Action. Catholicism, in America at least, has ceased to be a matter of religious observance. Catholicism now is something that partakes of clannishness, and that is constituted in large part by social and political and ‘club’ affiliations. Among the hundreds of Catholic leaders who arc outstanding in their loyalty to the cause arc to be found quite a few who have little if any regard for Catholic doctrines or observances. Catholic Action would be a far less serious factor in this country [U.S.A.] were its only agents pious and devout Catholics. The starting point of the wave of Catholic Action in this country may be traced back to the inauguration of the National Catholic Welfare Conference in 1921. On that occasion Archbishop Hanna declared: ‘We have co-ordinated and united the Catholic powci of this country. It now knows where and when to act and is encouraged by the consciousness of its unity. We feel ourselves powerful because our reunion has become visible.’ From that day Catholic strength has grown apace, and Catholic organizations have multiplied.</span></p>

(Isa. 21:14,15; Job 6:19) Tema, or that nation, therefore pictured a class of persons or nations who cater to the commcr-cialists and for hire do the bidding of the commercial strong men. “Buz,” mentioned in this part of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">prophecy, means “contempt”. The descendants of Buz, with the exception of Elihu (Job 32: 2, 6), joined the bad company of Satan’s commcrcialists. They despised anything and everything pertaining to God and his Word, and therefore pictured a siindar class of modern times, who are haters of anything and all things that arc good and pertain to God, and who resort to anything at the instance of the commcrcialists.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">** The Arabs were a class of peddlers. They traded with Tyre, but were not a part of Tyre. In the prophecy they are included with those who must drink the “cup” which Jeremiah carried. “And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert.” (Jer. 25:24) In Jehoshaphat’s time the Arabians brought to him rams and billy-goats. (2 Chron. 17:11) They lived in tents and were therefore tent-men. (Jer. 3:2; Isa. 13:20) They had no love for God or his temple, but, on the contrary, consorted with the Philistines and other opposers of God, and opposed the rebuilding of the temple and the walls at Jerusalem. (2 Chron. 21:16; Neh. 4:7,8; 2:19; 6:1,2) Some of the people “out of [that] nation” heard the gospel preached at Jerusalem, and heard it in their own language, as shown by the testimony of Acts 2:5-11. The Arabians, therefore, well picture those who are opposers of God’s organization and his people on earth, particularly Jehovah’s witnesses at the present time, and arc of that class of people who accuse Jehovah’s witnesses of being rebellious against the worldly powers, and who find it profitable to their own selfish desires to serve Big Business and the chief moguls of the Itoman Catholic organization for what profit or commercial gain they get out of it. They delight to have part in the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. They belong to the roughneck class. Among such people there are the leaders, who are known and are designated by the prophecy as “kings of the mingled people”, that is, the chief ones of the ‘mongrels’, who arc willing to hire out to do any kind of dirty work just so theie is something in it for them. They arc ready and willing tools to act for the Hierarchy. They picture an unsettled clement that have no distinct classification but arc out solely for selfish gain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> Continuing, then the prophet says: “And all the kings of Zitnri.” (Verse 25) The word “Ziniri” means “musical”, “my song.” It appears that such well fit the present-day “commercialized musical profession”. The paid choirs of the church organizations fit this description exactly. With their mouths they make music to the praise of Jehovah, but they have no heart devotion to the Lord whatsoever. They make song for commercial gain. For one to make music to the praise of Jehovah God is a blessed privilege, but those who indulge in song for professional and commercial purposes, calling out the name of God and Christ Jesus, and who hate God and his kingdom, are certainly a Godless crowd. They arc reprehensible because they use the language pertaining to Jehovah and the Savior, Christ Jesus, and yet openly reproach the name of God and Christ. These professional choirs indulge in music for commercial purposes, but their own hearts are not stirred in the least toward God thereby. They arc professionals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> Compare this with the untrained voices of ten thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses assembled in convention, who sing songs of praise to Jehovah, and which songs thrill the hearts of the ones who are devoted to him because they sing with the spirit of loving devotion to God and praise to his name. How different the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">paid </span><span class="font4">church choirs whose songs, to those who are devoted to God, are like a sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal! The apostle Paul had in mind such when he said: &quot;Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling eymbal.” (1 Cor. 13:1) It has </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">become a rule </span><span class="font4">of the so-called &quot;Christian” religionists </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">employ hired choirs or professional musicians at a large, money salary to sing in the great cathedrals and church buildings, and when the pope has a celebration, sueh as the inauguration of so-called &quot;holy year”, the professional singers celebrated in the world are brought forward to make music. In fact, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their commercial allies are </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in a </span><span class="font4">scheme to control the common people for pecuniary gain, and to carry out their schemes they employ music-makers to sing songs for them. This same crowd now controls the radio and furnishes music to suit the people who desire to yield to commercial solicitations. Likewise professional music conductors play anthems, which were written for the praise of Jehovah, but which musicians have no interest whatsoever in God and his kingdom. They play military inarches and furnish like music that stirs men’s emotions and makes them easy victims of the commercial and political crowd. They play sacred music at the instance of the leaders of the religious organizations in order to stir the people, and sway their emotions, and cause them to yield to the importunities of th: clergy and give up their money. Whenever the clergy want to take up a big collection they put on a paid song-fest first, and then &quot;get the one-armed man to pass the hat”. Music, which should be employed to the praise of the Creator, is improperly and wrongfully employed to swing the people into the Devil’s trap and rob them of their hard-earned money. This crowd, however, is amongst those who arc employed to turn the people away from God, and they, the Lord says, must drink of the cup of this fury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ Up to this point in the prophecy consideration is given to the ruling elements in the countries south of Babylon, and then Jeremiah turned his attention to the kings of the north or northeast of Babylon and passed the cup to them. &quot;And all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes.” (Jcr. 25:25) Elam was one of the early nations and was in an alliance with the nation or king of the plains of Shinar and joined with that Devil nation in wars of conquest. (Gen. 14:1,2,5, 9) In the days of Abraham Elam was a prominent nation of imperialistic ambitions and took the lead of a combination of kings in war. They were a devilish people. Abraham engaged them in battle and defeated them when he recovered Lot. (Gen. 14:1-16) God foretold the destruction of Elam, by the mouth of at least two of his prophets. (Jcr. 49: 34-38;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ezek. 32: 24, 25) The Elamites appear to well picture the rulers of imperialistic designs that form leagues, such as the League of Nations, to accomplish their purpose, and that are in a league against God and his kingdom. Those who support imperialism would be included within those described as &quot;Elam” in the prophecy. The following texts support this point:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast [of imperialism] and his image [the League of Nations, which is against God’s kingdom], and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with lire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.” (Rev. 14:9,10) “And the first [angel] went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.”—Rev. 16:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>f0</sup> Those mentioned in the prophecy above as &quot;the kings of the Medes” apparently were the descendants of Madai, the brother of Magog the son of Japbeth. This is the first mention of the descendants of Japhcth in connection with the cup of this fury. Up to this point in the prophecy the descendants of Ham and Shein are shown to have received the cup, and now the third great division of the human race gets its turn to drink of the cup at God’s hands. (Gen. 10: 2) Those Medes mentioned were, of course, before the time of Darius the Mede a.'.d Cyrus the Persian, as mentioned in the prophecy of Daniel. Those carly-day Medes acted with the politicians of Assyria in scattering the Israelites, the covenant people of God, among their cities and there holding them captive. (2 Ki. 17:6; 18:11) Such Medes (who were before Darins and Cyrus) appear to picture those organized elements who work with religionists in striving to prevent the activities of God’s covenant people, the remnant, and who endeavor to hold such witnesses in restraint and prevent them from worshiping Almighty God as he has commanded. The present-day crowd, whom those Medes pictured, claim to be God’s people, but are unfaithful to Jehovah and are hypocrites. In the various political and judicial offices there arc many men who claim to be Christian, but have no faith in God and in Christ, but who work with the high-up religionists who do claim to be Christians, and cooperate with such in inflicting punishment upon Jehovah’s witnesses because it appears to be to the advantage of such political and judicial tools of the Hierarchy. Such are the magistrates and other judicial officers, flagrant examples of which operate in New Jersey, Quebec, and other like places, who are without conscience and void of all honesty. They work together with the police or others of the military crowd </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">compel obedience to their unrighteous judicial decisions rendered against God’s true people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> The Devil is the god of this wicked world and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">rules </span><span class="font4">and claims the right </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">rule all the kingdoms of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">earth, and which the Lord will destroy; and there</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">fore </span><span class="font4">all such must drink </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the “cup”.

(Matt. 4: 8, 9; Luke 4: 6) Jesus rebuffed that wicked one, because in the heart of the Loid Jesus has always been the law of God written and the will of his Father he always does. Christ Jesus could not and would not take possession of the world until Jehovah’s due time. (Ps. 110:1) Now at the present time Christ Jesus has been placed upon the throne of full authority, and he must and will destroy all rule in all the nations under Satan, because they are against God and his kingdom. “Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”—Ps. 2: 8, 9.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> For many years Japan has practiced her own peculiar Devil religion. In more recent times she has yielded to the influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, for gain, of course, and now actively engages with the Vatican in a conspiracy to destroy the work of the Lord and his witnesses. Japan is included in the kingdoms of the north as mentioned in the prophecy, and she must be one that drinks the cup of this fury. Japan resents the message of Jehovah and confiscates the literature containing such message; but the Scriptures show that neither that nation nor any other shall escape, because Armageddon will not omit any nation or government on earth, be the same large or small, far or near. Japan is not included in what are commonly called “Christian nations”, but she has received the witness to the truth of and concerning God’s kingdom and of God’s purpose to destroy 1hc kingdoms of this world. There has been a wide distribution of the kingdom message in Japan, and in addition thereto Japanese official ambassadors in America, and other countries, have had that witness. Regardless of the persecution there continue to be a few faithful witnesses of the Lord in the land of Japan.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> With all his boasted power, the Devil himself cannot avoid ‘drinking the cup of this fury’. This is made certain by the words of the prophet: “And the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.” (Jer. 25: 2G) Clearly that means that the Devil himself shall be the last to go into oblivion, after seeing all of his organization destroyed. The king of “Babylon”, who is therefore the chief in the universal organization of wickedness, is Satan himself. “Sheshach” is a symbolic name for Babylon. The meaning of the name “Sheshach” is an enigma to all religionists. The clergy have never been able to understand it, and they scoff at the existence of “Sheshach”. Until recently God’s covenant people did not have an understanding of the name and its meaning. But in this day of Jehovah, after the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple, God has revealed to his people the meaning of that name. Jehovah has made known to his people that Satan’s organization is symbolized in The Revelation as a “wonder in heaven” or great “sign”. Jehovah God’s organization is revealed under the symbol of “a great wonder [or, sign] in heaven”, like unto “a woman clothed with the sun”. (Rev. 12:1-4) Satan’s organization is now understood, and is therefore no more an enigma to God’s people, but is known, by the grace of God, as that wicked organization, both invisible and visible, that for centuries has opposed Jehovah and defamed his holy name. The “king of Sheshaeh ” therefore pictures the Devil, who is the king </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">or head of the great </span><span class="font4">wicked organization in opposition to Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“But “Sheshaeh” shall fall in the great day of God Almighty. &quot;When Satan’s organization begins to tumble, the religionists of “Christendom” being the first, from that time on those who have looked upon </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">.the </span><span class="font4">world as perpetual, unbreakable and immovable will be greatly surprised and astonished. They will be greatly astonished when they see the Roman Catholic Hierarchy go down, and to them it will be a very “strange act”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“At chapter fifty-one of the prophecy, Jeremiah takes his stand as though he were at the point following </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">destruction of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">Devil and his organization. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font4">now records the historical fact as though it had already </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">come to </span><span class="font4">pass, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font4">says: * ‘ How is Sheshaeh taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations! And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">nations shall not flow together any more unto him; yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.”—Jcr. 51:41,44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Quite fittingly therefore the prophecy against Sheshaeh is the last part of the prophecy of Jeremiah </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">against </span><span class="font4">all </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the worldly organization. The last chapter of the prophecy of Jeremiah is purely prophecy recorded as fulfilled, and therefore is history written in advance. This shows that the last part of the battle </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Armageddon </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font4">be the destruction of Satan’s angelic host under Gog, the commander of the invisible as well as the visible army of the Devil. Then follows the seizing of Satan and casting of him into the bottomless pit. It will be a great punishment to the Devil to stand by and sec all his power taken away from him by the Ix&gt;rd Jesus Christ, whom he has for centuries persecuted. Then in complete disgrace Satan himself will be taken away by the Lord Jesus Christ and completely shorn of all power and cast into the bottomless pit. (Rev. 20:2,3) Thus the Lord, by his prophet, shows the beginning and the ending of the battle of the great day of God Almighty, which ends in complete victory </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font4">the hands of the King of kings, Christ Jesus, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">the honor and vindication of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GATHERING STORM</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” Undergoing great suffering because of their faithfulness to Almighty God, Jehovah’s witnesses of the remnant, and their brethren of the Jonadabs, view with keenest interest the march of the present-day events. The elements gathering for the great storm, which soon shall break, are moving forward to the mighty climax. They see the freedom of the people being taken away from them and the people themselves put in great fear and forced to obey the ruthless dictators of the nations of the earth. The British Empire, which has long stood for the freedom of speech and right of worship, is now seen moving to a point of crushing all freedom. The outlying colonies are now observed as putting forth their agents and enacting laws to shut out the message of God as delivered by his faithful witnesses, and those who are acquainted with the prophecies now see these prophecies being fulfilled as the cords arc being tightened around England herself, which ere long will be ruled for a time by the hand of some despot. In the land of America, which for the greater part of her existence has boasted of her freedom of speech and freedom of worship, is now seen vigorously active a movement to take away the liberties of the people and to destroy freedom of speech and freedom of worship of Almighty God. The officials or ruling elements, although sworn to uphold and to defend the fundamental laws of the nation, arc now seen as pushing with all available power to have all branches of the government, including the highest judicial body, controlled by a dictator, which dictator will act under the direction of the old “whore” until that wicked system is destroyed at the beginning of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses, now in the light of revealed prophecy, see the reason of the present-day events and know what will be the result. Some of the more noble-minded politicians now begin to sec the great dangers arising to the liberties of the people, and they cry out: “We must act quickly.” The difficulty, however, is that they have waited too long. The warning was given some years ago by those who are devoted to Jehovah. America was told of the oncoming of the condition now existing and what shall be the result. But the ruling powers gave no heed thereto. Then in due time millions of American people signed a petition to the lawmakers of the land calling their attention to the rapid encroachment upon the rights of the people by the ultrareligionists, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and called attention to the fact that such is against God and his kingdom. That petition to the lawmaking body was ignored, and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy was permitted unhindered to move forward with a ruthless hand. The cry of alarm that now comes up from a few of the politicians appears to be entirely too late. It is too late. The American nation or government is moving rapidly to the point of dictatorial rule. Then that nation will be compelled to ‘drink of the cup of God’s fury’. By the grace of Jehovah the remnant now are permitted to sec these things in advance in order that they may receive comfort and hope and know that their faithfulness to God and his kingdom will be fully rewarded in due time. Let all those who arc on the side of God now be diligent to inform themselves of the unfolding of prophecy and also diligent </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">bearing testimony to those who have the hearing </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ear </span><span class="font4">and who, hearing, may flee and find safety in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s </span><span class="font4">organization. The day of deliverance for those </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">who are </span><span class="font4">devoted to God is near, and although the persecution continues to increase, there is every reason </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for those who love </span><span class="font4">the Lord to greatly rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>81</sup> Jeremiah having performed that part of the drama showing that each and every nation must drink </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the cup of this fury, and having presented it to all, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">then </span><span class="font4">Jeremiah is directed by the Lord what he is to say: “Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the Lord </span><span class="font4">of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">because of </span><span class="font4">the sword which I will send among you.” —Jer. 25:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; Jehovah does not take action against his enemies until he first gives the warning of his purpose and states the reason for so doing. Here he tells Jeremiah to notify the people that it is the Lord’s command, the command of Jehovah of hosts, that the peoples and nations shall drink and be drunken and spue and fall, never to rise again. God now commands that the rulers and their supporters be told that fatal drunkenness is their lot, and soon they will find themselves in that drunken condition, from which they will not revive. God has caused to be written in his Word, and brought to the attention of religionists and others, that the great and mighty organization of the world, which they think is invulnerable and immovable, shall fall and that the Lord will see to it that all the world shall drink of the wine of his fierceness: “And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell; and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.” (Rev. 16:19) The wicked religionists have time and again, although having heard the warning, continued to assault the faithful people of God, and now<sup>r</sup> “Christendom” shall receive pay in kind. “For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the nations drink continually; yea, they shall drink, and swallow down, and shall be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font4">though they had not been.”—Obad. 16, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Il.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“ As the </span><span class="font4">religionists and their supporters have heard God’s message during the past few years, not only </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">have they </span><span class="font4">gone mad by reason thereof but they would </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">rather die </span><span class="font4">than to continue to hear it, and hence they continue to cry out, when the message is spoken, that “it shocks their religious susceptibilities, and should </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font4">forbidden and stopped”. Being unable to stop the message they would really like to die and get away from it. “And in those days shall men . . . desire to die, and death shall flee from them.” (Rev. 9:6) </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Roman </span><span class="font4">Catholic Hierarchy is now driven to madness by reason of the plainness of the message of truth delivered, and, knowing their inability to defend their fraudulent and false teachings, they refuse to come into the open and attempt to defend their traditions; </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and concerning </span><span class="font4">this it is written: ‘And it shall be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">vexation when he shall make them understand the doctrines.<sup>r</sup>—Isa. 28:19, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">** The organized forward movement of this plain message of truth began in 1922, and has progressed since, by the grace of God. Jehovah will have this message of warning delivered; as he states: ‘Because of the sword, which I will send upon you,’ meaning the sword of execution, which shall fall upon Satan’s organization. The sword of execution, wielded by the Mightier-than-Nebuchadnezzar, to wit, by Christ Jesus, will fall with greatest heaviness upon “Christendom”, and from such there is no escape. This fact is now known by those who are faithful to Jehovah, and gives them comfort and hope, because they know their deliverance is sure and that the vindication of Jehovah’s name is absolutely certain.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>45</sup> Jehovah's witnesses are not to go to the people and deliver any man’s message; and this is plainly shown by what God directed Jeremiah to say, to wit : “And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Ye shall certainly drink.” -—Jer. 2o: 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>48</sup> His witnesses of this time must go in the name of Jehovah God, in the name of the Lord of hosts, who now makes war upon the wicked. The people will refuse to hear, except a few; but the faithful witnesses will continue to say: “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Ye shall certainly drink.” Jehovah’s witnesses will not stop to argue with opposers. That is not their business. Their work is to bring the message of the Lord to the attention of the people, that they may have an opportunity to give heed thereto. Much and prolonged talk at the door with those of the homes is not obeying God’s commandments. His message must be delivered as the Lord’s message and as he has commanded it, and those who refuse to hear cannot be forced to hear, but, having an opportunity to hear, must bear the responsibility. The message must therefore be carried to them by those who arc serving God. They have no excuse for disobeying his commandments, the disobedience to which would result in the destruction of the ones who are in a covenant to obey his will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>47</sup> It is not the purpose of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> to boast of what has been done and is being done in fulfillment of this prophecy, but some of the well-known facts may here be mentioned in order that the faithful may sec that in the past few years, under the guidance of the Lord, they have been working exactly in harmony with God’s will in giving the message of warning to the nations and to the people. Some of the “wiseacres”, who think they are in the truth and wiser than others, will, figuratively speaking, continue to sit on the fence and whittle, and say, in substance: “I think we had better go easy now, because the great work that we will do is still in the future and after the end of the first part of Armageddon.” Also some who arc fearful will say: “Let’s talk about love and say nothing about the trouble.” The faithful will not be deceived by any such sophistry. God has revealed the meaning of these prophecies to his people in order that they may see their duty, obligation and privilege. Idleness and indifference now will result in disaster. Full and joyful obedience the Lord requires. This is the day when God has commanded his people to “rise up against her in battle” and to have a part in his work, which work appears to the religionists as strange. The faithful now recognize that God has afforded them an opportunity to have a part in his work for the comfort and encouragement of such as have covenanted to do his will. Therefore he furnishes them meat in due season by revealing the meaning of his prophecies Written long ago. God has promised to direct the path of those who acknowledge him. He often causes such devoted ones to perform duties that they do not understand until afterwards. It therefore seems fitting that we here call attention to some of the things that the Lord has permitted his people to do.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">&quot; Since 1922 Jehovah’s witnesses have been presenting the cup or message of Jehovah to nation after nation, and that message has been rejected and refused by the kings or rulers. In 1931 the message set out in the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the JIopc of the World,</span><span class="font4"> was seined upon the rulers in many lands, and thereafter the same message was taken jnorc particularly to the common people. While there is no specific or direct effort to serve the rulers further with the message of the kingdom, it is still brought to the attention of such time and again by reason of its being carried to the people, and the rulers must take notice thereof. The mighty religionists are very much opposed to the people’s hearing the message, and they, together with their political and judicial allies, formulate, enact and enforce laws to prevent the jieople from hearing. A small number of the common people hear, understand and appreciate this message as from the Lord, and they give heed thereto; but the far greater number of the people think that this work in which Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged is a 'very strange work’, and so they dismiss it by the mere saying, “We are not interested. ” Since 1931 Jehovah’s witnesses have, in obedience to God’s commandment, made a wide distribution of God’s message to the people. There has been a wide distribution of such Biblical explanations as contained in the books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication, Preparation, Preservation, Jehovah, Riches, Choosing</span><span class="font4"> (“Separating the Nations”), </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered, Protection,</span><span class="font4"> and many others. In addition thereto the radio has been employed to proclaim the message throughout the earth, and also thousands of sound machines have been and are being used to proclaim God’s Word within the presence and hearing of the people. The faithful and true witnesses rejoice in this and, regardless of opposition, push on. They will obey God rather than men.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>49</sup> Since 1934 the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their “man Friday”, one Hitler, have been personally served with the message, and they cannot claim ignorance. In 1936 a Resolution, publicly adopted at a convention in Lucerne, Switzerland, was widely distributed throughout that land and in Germany and in other parts of the world, although the work of distributing that Resolution was fraught with peril, and many who did distribute it were put in peril of their lives and are now languishing in filthy prisons in Germany. The rulers and the people of such lands have been warned, and it is their fault now if they do not find the way of escape. The day of reckoning and recompense is now at hand.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">“Since the Roman Catholic Hierarchy stands at the very head of the wicked class and is the more reprehensible because of using the name of Jehovah and Christ Jesus for the purpose of carrying on a cruel persecution upon Jehovah’s witnesses, and which brings great injury and suffering upon the people, her claim of lasting stability and immovability sounds very foolish. In the light of revealed prophecy can there now be any doubt as to where Armageddon begins? Do the Scriptures make this matter clear? or is it still a question of open speculation? Those who love Jehovah and his kingdom arc not left at all in doubt, as will now appear from what follows.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>BESIEGED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">J</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">EHOVAH’S </span><span class="font4">servants on </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">earth </span><span class="font4">speak his message. If the rebellious ones, meaning the professed Christians of “Christendom”, and the “evil serv</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ant” </span><span class="font4">class, had their way they would stop the work </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">God’s “faithful servant” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">completely silence </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">all who </span><span class="font4">speak the truth of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">concerning the Devil’s organization. But as God said to Ezekiel, so now he says to the “faithful servant” whom Ezekiel foreshadowed: “But thou, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">O son </span><span class="font4">of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">shall bind thee with </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">them, </span><span class="font4">and thou shalt not </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">go out </span><span class="font4">among them: and I will make thy tongue cleave </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">the roof of thy mouth, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font4">thou shalt be dumb, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">shalt not be to them a reprover; for they arc a rebellious house. But when </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">speak with thee, 1 will </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">open </span><span class="font4">thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God, He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.”— Ezek. 3:25-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “servant” is not to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tell </span><span class="font4">his own message. Jeho</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">vah </span><span class="font4">has made his “faithful servant” the “watchman”, and only as the Lord God directs the “servant” to speak he does speak, having always a “Thus saith the lx&gt;rd” for every part of the message that is delivered. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The work </span><span class="font4">of the servant </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font4">not to make converts to get them to join an organization, but to give a witness </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">the truth. The hearers must either accept or reject </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">message, and take the responsibility. “He that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">hath </span><span class="font4">an car, let him hear </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">what </span><span class="font4">the spirit saith.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">(Rev. </span><span class="font4">3:22) Jehovah brings his servant into action and uses </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">him </span><span class="font4">for his purposes while he moves forward to the vindication of his name. The opposition by the rebellious house of “Christendom” or by the “evil servant” will in no wise prevent the truth from being told as God purposes it shall be told.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah continues to instruct Ezekiel what he shall do. In chapter four of the prophecy it is written that God took Ezekiel and made him a sign-man to the professed people of God, first to Israel after the flesh, and thereafter to “Christendom”. “Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it the city, even Jerusalem: and lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about.” (Ezek. 4:1,2) Ezekiel is here instructed to lay a siege against Jerusalem. In this he performs a mimic siege against the city. This performance was in the presence of those in the city and was a sign to them and a warning. It was a prophecy against “Christendom”. Originally Jerusalem was the capital city of ‘both houses of Israel’, and Jehovah let the iniquity of both houses be visited upon that city. To Ezekiel Jehovah said: “Moreover, take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city; and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.”—Ezek. 4:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ezekiel was commanded first to lie on his left side for three hundred and ninety days, thus picturing the iniquity of the house of Israel; and then at the end of that period he was to lie on the right side forty days, picturing the iniquity laid against Judah. “Moreover lie thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it; according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity. For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days; so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. And again, when thou hast accomplished these, thou shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah; forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it unto thee.” (Ezek. 4:4-6, R.V.) This did not mean that Jerusalem was besieged that length of time when the actual siege came to take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(2 Ki. 25:1-8) This represents the long-suffering </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">God toward the two houses of Israel. The number of days that Ezekiel lay on his left side and then on his right side represented the number of literal years </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font4">God forbore with the two houses of Israel, suffering them to perform their iniquitous work. Both the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">390-</span><span class="font4">year and the 40-year period must have terminated </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font4">the same time, to wit, in the year GOG B.C., when </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">long-suffering of God ceased and the city of Jerusalem was broken up, marking the beginning of ‘the gentile times’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The 390-year period just mentioned applies to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">ten tribes of Israel, and the 40-ycar period applies to the house of Judah and Benjamin. In the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">year 999 B.C. the </span><span class="font4">ten tribes revolted against Judah. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">This </span><span class="font4">was 393 years before the destruction of Jerusalem. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font4">had foretold through his prophet that he </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">would rend the </span><span class="font4">ten tribes away from Solomon’s son </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Reho-</span><span class="font4">boam and give them to Jeroboam, and, if the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">latter </span><span class="font4">would remain faithful to God, through the ten </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tribes </span><span class="font4">the Lord would build him a sure house. (1 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ki. </span><span class="font4">11:29-40) But Jeroboam did not remain faithful to God, but, on the contrary, instituted a base and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">false </span><span class="font4">worship and set up two golden calves, one at </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel and </span><span class="font4">the other at Dan, and caused the people to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">wor</span><span class="font4">ship there instead of going up to Jerusalem. (1 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ki. 12: </span><span class="font4">26-33) God sent his prophet up to warn Jeroboam; but Jeroboam refused to heed the warning and to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">turn </span><span class="font4">aside from his false worship, and continued his iniquity. The iniquity of the ten tribes would therefore begin to count from that time, which was 996 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">B.C., </span><span class="font4">or three years after the revolt of 999 B.C. It follows, then, that 390 years from that date would end 606 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">B.C. </span><span class="font4">Israel’s iniquity dates from the beginning of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">religious</span><span class="font4"> revolt and the substitution of the false worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the Israelites in general foreshadowed “Christendom”, the application of the above is this: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Chris</span><span class="font4">tianity,” so called, was organized shortly after </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">demise of the apostles; and the Roman Catholics, acting through their clergy and the principal of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font4">flocks, monopolized the field, that is to say, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">entire </span><span class="font4">world, from the religious viewpoint, until the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">year 1531 (A.D.), </span><span class="font4">when the rulers of England and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ger</span><span class="font4">many broke away from the pope and the League </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Schmalkald was formed for the protection of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">Protestant religion. This date is definitely fixed </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">as a </span><span class="font4">historical fact. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> 1920, page 174.) It was therefore in A.D. 1531 that Jehovah began </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">bear with the iniquity of “organized Christianity”, as represented by the Roman wing of “Christianity” so called. God’s bearing with this iniquity begins to count at that time, and counting 390 years from </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">then </span><span class="font4">brings the period of time down to the year 1921.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now as to the house of Judah: Jehovah begins </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">count her iniquity, with which he had to bear, from the year 646 B.C., that being the thirteenth year </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the reign of Josiah. The proof is this: The ten tribes went into captivity to Assyria in 740 B.C. Judah should have drawn a warning from this and should have been faithful to God, button the contrary, Judah departed from the worship of Jehovah. When God gave warning to Jeroboam concerning the false worship established, he caused his prophet then to foretell the coming of Josiah the king of Judah. (1 Ki. 13:1,2) Manasseh and Amon, who preceded Josiah, had desecrated the temple of Jehovah God and established the devil worship amongst Judah. After Josiah came to the throne he did right in the sight of the Lord. (2 Ki. 23:26, 27) It was in the thirteenth year of the reign of this king Josiah that God raised up Jeremiah and caused him to prophesy to Judah, and Judah refused to hearken to the words of the Lord spoken by the prophet. “The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah of the priests that were in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin: to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.” (Jcr. 1:1,2) Therefore it was from that year, to wit, 646 B.C., that Jehovah began to count the forty years’ iniquity of Judah which terminated in 606 B.C. Jeremiah began to prophesy forty years before the fall of Jerusalem, and his first prophecy was one of warning to Jerusalem of the impending destruction of the city, to which warning the people declined to give heed. This corresponds exactly with the forty days (symbolic of forty years) that Ezekiel lay on his right side to bear the iniquity of the house of Judah.— Jer. 1:14-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There must of necessity be a proper application of this mimic siege on Jerusalem to that which Jerusalem represented, to wit, “organized Christianity,” or “Christendom”. As hereinbefore stated, it was in A.D. 1531 when God began to recognize her iniquity and to bear with the iniquity of the Roman branch of “organized Christianity”. That day is marked by the fact that it was then that the two main pillars of the Protestant wing of “organized Christianity” were set up. Germany, Britain and the United States, and the colonies belonging thereto, are the chief countries of Protestantism, or “organized Christianity” according to the Protestants. It has been chiefly in these countries where God has caused the truth to be proclaimed concerning his kingdom. A comparatively small amount of the witness work of “present truth” has been carried on in Italy, Spain and suchlike Cath</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">olic </span><span class="font4">countries. The beginning of this public witness work in these Protestant countries w’ould specifically mark the beginning of God’s forbearing with Protestantism. Mark now that it was in 1881 that this public witness work began and is especially indicated by </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">publication and wide distribution of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Food for Thinking Christians,</span><span class="font4"> which set forth the doctrine of the second coming of Christ, and the kingdom of the Lord, and the fundamental truths that had long been obscured by the unfaithfulness of “organized Christianity”. That work, begun in 1881, was exactly 350 years after Jehovah began to bear with the iniquities of the Catholic wing of ‘‘organized Christianity”, and 40 years thereafter exactly corresponds with the 390 days that Ezekiel lay on his left side in the mimic siege. At the end of the 390 days of the mimic siege Ezekiel lay on his right side for a period of 40 days, symbolic of 40 years, as stated by the scripture. This foreshadows that God would bear with the iniquity of Protestantism for a period of forty years from the beginning of that period, to wit, the year 1881, as above stated. Forty years added to 1881 marks the year 1921, at which time the forty-year period of forbearance of Jehovah with Protestantism would end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now be it noted that both the 390-ycar period, applying to Catholicism, and the 40-ycar period, applying to Protestantism, end exactly at the same time, showing that the application is correct and is to all ‘‘organized Christianity”. It was in that year, 1921, that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> by the Lord’s grace, was permitted to identify and did identify and publish the truth concerning ‘‘the beast”, ‘‘the image of the beast,” and ‘‘the abomination that maketh desolate”. (Revelation 13) (Sec </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> 1921, page 11.) In that same year, 1921, the nations of “Christendom”, by their duly constituted representatives, held a national assembly at Washington, D.C., known as the International Arms Conference. The announced purpose of that Conference was to establish lasting peace on the earth. The clergy of “organized Christianity” ably supported this movement. God’s covenant people, Jehovah’s witnesses, then known as “Bible Students”, presented to that International Arms Conference a resolution that had been duly passed by the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses, which, among other things, stated: ‘That no nation can be truly Christian which fails to obey the teachings of Jesus and the apostles; that the ruling powers of “Christendom” are made up of the commercial and political leaders supported by the clergy of both Catholic and Protestant eburch organizations who, contrary to the Word of God, had allied themselves with such leaders and become a part of the world organization; that the kingdom of heaven is at hand and that it is the divine and only remedy for lasting peace on earth.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The resolution memorializing this international conference called upon these nations to recognize and adopt God’s remedy, and then added: ‘If the divine Scriptural remedy be ignored, God’s wrath will be visited upon their governments and the system of “Christendom”.’ (See copy of Resolution, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> magazine, December 7; 1921, page 138.) At the time of the presentation of this resolution it was not known that the matter was in any wise foreshadowed by the prophecy of Ezekiel or any other prophecy. In the light of “present truth-” wc must conclude that the angel of the Lord directed God’s covenant people to thus serve notice upon “organized Christianity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the close of the year 1921 the 390 years and the 40 years of Jehovah’s forbearing with the two houses of “organized Christianity” had expired. The year 1922 was manifestly God’s due time to begin to make known his judgments against the nations of “Christendom” and to pronounce his judgment by and through his anointed people. It was in that same year, to wit, 1922, that the commandment came from the temple of God to his angels to begin the pouring out of the bowls of the wrath of God on the earth, and God’s covenant people in convention assembled at Cedar Point participated in that work. (See Revelation, chapter 1G; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font4"> Book Two, page 19 and pages following.) When at least two of God's holy prophets prophesy against “organized Christianity” and the events coming to pass fit both prophecies, then it must be that such events constitute the fulfillment thereof, and this should be a great encouragement to everyoue who loves Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">For the fiscal year ending September 1936</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A</span><span class="font4">LL PERSONS who love and serve Jehovah God have a keen interest in the work of advertising his King and his kingdom. This report is made for the purpose of informing such persons concerning the progress of the witness or advertising work done throughout the year during the fiscal year ending September 30, 1936. This witness work has been done in obedience to the command of Jehovah. No one who is engaged in this work expects to receive any money consideration for the service rendered. The only kind of service that is acceptable and pleasing to God is that which is prompted by unselfishness to the end that those who serve may maintain their integrity toward God and magnify the name of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font4"> is the exclusive name of the Almighty God. He is the Creator of heaven and earth, the Giver of every good and perfect gift, and the source of life. He is the Most High, the one above all, and concerning him it is written in the Bible: “Whose name alone is JEHOVAH.” Many persons are entirely ignorant of the name Jehovah. The ignorance of the masses is due largely to the fact that the professed teachers of the Bible have failed to teach them. The Almighty God has revealed himself through his Word under the titles or names </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God,</span><span class="font4"> which means Creator; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Almighty God,</span><span class="font4"> meaning the One whose power is without limitation; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Most High,</span><span class="font4"> meaning him who is above all creation; and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font4"> which means his purpose toward his creatures. To those who have fully devoted</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">themselves to Jehovah the relationship is that of father and children. Since this report has to do with the purpose of Jehovah toward His creatures now on earth, it seems appropriate to speak of him chiefly by his name Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In his Word it is written: “God is love”; meaning that the expression of his purpose toward his creatures is always prompted by unselfishness. There is nothing that his creatures can do that will bring any profit to Jehovah. Their obedience to his commandments brings the greatest profit to them, however, because it calls forth toward them his approval. Long centuries ago Jehovah expressed his purpose to establish a righteous world government and to destroy all the wicked and all unrighteous practices, to the end that his obedient creatures might live for ever in peace and righteousness to the praise and honor of the great Creator. Before cleansing the earth by the destruction of wickedness it is his expressed purpose that a testimony must be given throughout the earth to inform those who will hear that he is the only true and almighty God, that Christ Jesus, his beloved Son, is the Redeemer of mankind, the world’s rightful ruler, and that all hope of the human race is centered in Christ Jesus, and that the blessings of humankind will be administered to the obedient ones by and through the kingdom of God under Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah grants to those who love him the great privilege of bearing testimony of and concerning these truths, which testimony or witness work must be done before Jehovah through Christ Jesus destroys the unrighteous. The fearless and faithful performance of their duty in this respect means the maintenance of their integrity toward Jehovah. To serve Jehovah, therefore, is the greatest privilege any creature could possibly have. Appreciating this fact, those who are known as Jehovah’s witnesses, and also those known as the “great multitude”, delight to serve Jehovah and his King by proclaiming his Word, his name, and his loving-kindness to others. This report deals with their activities during the fiscal year.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark2"></a>RELIGION AND CHRISTIANITY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">To aid those persons of good will toward God to have a better understanding and appreciation of Jehovah God and his purpose toward his creatures, attention is here called specifically to religion and Christianity. It is generally understood amongst the people that religion and Christianity are one and the same; but such is a very erroneous conclusion. Recognized worldly lexicographers define these terms as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Religion : The “conformity in faith and life to the precepts inculcated in the Bible, respecting the conduct of life and duty toward God and man; the Christian faith and practice”.—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Webster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Christianity : ‘ ‘ The religion of Christians; the system of doctrines and precepts taught by Jesus Christ; practical conformity of one’s inward and outward life to the spirit of the Christian religion.”—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Webster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those definitions are entirely wrong and in full conflict with the Word of God. Without a doubt in Webster’s day the terms </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">religion</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Christianity </span><span class="font4">were used interchangeably, and it may be said that he was excusable for so defining those terms. Religion and Christianity, as defined in the Bible, are diametrically opposed one to the other. There is not in existence, nor ever was in existence, such thing as “the Christian religion”. The Bible, which is the Word of God, is the supreme authority in this matter, and our definitions should conform strictly to the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The correct definitions of these two terms, as shown by the Bible, are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Religion is any form of worship practiced or indulged in by creatures in recognition of some higher power, and which formalism and practice finds support or authority in tradition. Such authority consists of the teachings of men handed down by tradition from one generation to another. The transmission of </span><span class="font4">any knowledge, doctrine, custom, practice or form of worship from fathers to descendants, is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tradition. </span><span class="font4">Religion, as shown by the Scriptures, finds no support in the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Christianity : According to the Bible, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Christianity </span><span class="font4">means full obedience to the commandments of God, even as Christ Jesus obeyed and taught those commandments to others. A person is a Christian only when he has fully devoted himself to God by consecration, and then is diligent to obey God’s commandments, as set forth in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the earth today there are divers and numerous religions practiced by human creatures. There is just one Christianity, and that is not at all religion, nor does it have any similarity to religion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>ORIGIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It seems quite proper here to call attention to the origin of religion, and that information should be enlightening, and particularly pleasing to all who wish to know the right way and follow in the way of righteousness. Every sincere and honest person desires the truth, and the truth concerning Jehovah and his purpose and his relationship to his creatures is found only in the Bible. Concerning it the Lord Jesus, when on earth, said: “Thy word is truth.’’—John 17:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The order of Jehovah God’s creation as set forth in the Bible is this: First the Logos, who thereafter and now is known as Jesus, and Christ Jesus. (John 1:1, 2) “Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature.” (Col. 1:15) The Logos was at all times thereafter the active agent of Jehovah in the creation of everything thereafter created. God created heavenly creatures known as seraphim, cherubim and angels. One mighty angel of great light and power created by the Lord God was first named Lucifer. In his due time God created the earth and he created the creature man to live on the earth. (Isa. 45:12,18) It is recorded in the prophecy of Job: “Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? . . . When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?” (Job 38: 4, 7) It reasonably follows that, when the great Creator informed his creatures of heaven concerning his purpose to create the earth and to create and place on the earth an intelligent creature to the praise of the Most High, then the heavenly sons sang songs of praise to the Almighty God and all the angels of heaven shouted in praise of his holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then in due time God created man and made him in his own image and likeness. He placed man in a beautiful part of the earth, which he had finished, which he called Eden, and there God’s mighty angel creature, Lucifer, was installed as man’s overlord. Lucifer had noted the praise that all creatures gave Jehovah God, and he coveted that praise for himself. (Jer. 51:13) He had an insatiable desire for that which belonged exclusively to Jehovah God. He set about to gratify that unholy desire, and concerning the same it is written: “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be like the Most High.” (Isa. 14:13,14) Jehovah, being fully aware of Lucifer’s unholy desire to exalt himself, said this: “How art thou fallen from heaven, 0 Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! ... Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.” ■—Isaiah 14:12,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Adam and the woman Eve were in Eden, having been placed there by the great Creator with specific instructions as to their course of action, and had received at the mouth of Jehovah God his law, which informed them that in the day that they committed a willfully wrongful act that would mean their death. Lucifer, knowing this fact, set about to accomplish his wrongful purpose by turning Eve and Adam against the great Creator. Lucifer deceived Eve and caused her to violate the law of Almighty God, and Adam, by reason of his selfish desire to have Eve, joined her in the transgression, and thus both were turned away from God. (1 Tim. 2:14) For their violation of God’s law they were sentenced to death. (Gen. 2:17; 3:15-19) Before being put to death their children were born, and the result of the death sentence upon Adam and Eve was that all the human race inherited sin and death. “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned. ’ ’ —Rom. 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lucifer was also sentenced to death, but the execution of his death sentence was deferred for the reasons as hereinafter set forth. (Ezek. 28:19) Jehovah God now changed the name of Lucifer, calling him by four separate and distinct names, which names portrayed the wickedness of that creature. From then till now he is known as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Satan,</span><span class="font4"> which means adversary, or the one who opposes Jehovah God; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Devil,</span><span class="font4"> meaning slanderer; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Serpent,</span><span class="font4"> meaning deceiver; and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dragon,</span><span class="font4"> meaning devourer. That creature, as his names indicate, is the very embodiment of wickedness and is known in the Scriptures, as well as by experience of other creatures, as the chief wicked one of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Devil, having succeeded in turning Adam and Eve away from God, proceeded upon the theory that he could turn all creatures away from Jehovah God; therefore he challenged God to put on earth any man who would maintain his integrity toward God when put to the test. The Devil declared that he could induce all men to ‘curse God to his face’. (Job 2:5) That challenge raised the question of supremacy, that is to say, Is God, whose name is Jehovah and who is all-powerful, is he supreme, and is his Word true? or can Satan the Devil thwart the purposes of Jehovah? To be sure, God could have executed the Devil immediately; but had he done so, that question of supremacy would have been left unsettled in the mind of other creatures. It pleased Jehovah God to accept the challenge of the wicked one and give the Devil full opportunity to make proof of his boastful challenge. Jehovah knew full well that in due time Satan would fail and that all creatures would have an opportunity to determine each one for himself which is the right way and who is right, and that therefore each creature would have to do with his own eternal destiny. Therefore Jehovah God said to the Devil: “For this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.”—Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is a plain declaration by Jehovah that he was giving Satan a suspended sentence and that he would permit Satan to exercise all the power at his command in his effort to thwart Jehovah God and his purpose and that then Jehovah would show Satan the supremacy of the Almighty God by the exercise of His own power, and that he would have his own great name proclaimed throughout the earth. It is essentially important to keep in mind at all times the issue raised by Satan’s challenge, and God’s purpose as expressed in connection therewith. By doing so the reason for tho existence of so many religions in the earth will be understood. Also the reason will be very apparent that religion and following in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, called “Christianity”, are exactly opposed one to the other.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>RELIGION ORGANIZED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The first man and woman, being expelled from Eden, exercised their God-given functions to bring children into the earth. After a period of time there were in the earth many human creatures, and among these was a man whose name was Nimrod. Satan now began his operations to organize mankind in open defiance </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> the Almighty God. Nimrod was selected as the visible or earthly leader, and he stood before the other people as one even greater than Jehovah God himself. It is written in the Scriptures concerning Nimrod: “He began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord; wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before [impudently greater than] the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, ... in the land of Shinar.” (Gen. 10: 8-10) He became a slayer of animals in violation of God’s law, and his prowess and audacity and boastfulness made him an object of worship by others of mankind. Nimrod was an agent of the Devil, and Nimrod became the chief one the Devil first used after the flood to organize religion in the earth. By inducing a man to worship and praise a creature the Devil knew it would effectually turn away the people from the Creator. The Devil then induced the people to believe that they should build a tower by which they could enter heaven and, as it is written, “they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.” (Gen. 11:4) That was the beginning of religion. That tower and city of Babel was built in defiance of Jehovah God and for the purpose of carrying out the wicked challenge of Satan. The names Babel, or Bab-il, and Babylon mean “The gate of God”; therefore in derision and in ridicule of God. Babylon was built as a defiance to God, and the people were led to believe that through Babylon was the way to their salvation. Nimrod was the head of Babylon, and his name means “rebellious”, or ‘him that rules as a rebel’. Babylon symbolically stands for Satan’s organization. Babylon was therefore a religious organization directing the people to worship creatures in defiance of the Creator and was Satan’s adopted method of carrying out his wicked challenge. Religion was the binding tie that held the people together. The peo-pie ignored God, the Creator, and gave their allegiance and praise to a creature. (Rom. 1:20,25) The proof is conclusive, therefore, that Satan the Devil originated religion in defiance of Jehovah God for the purpose of deceiving the people and turning them away from God. Thereafter other nations were organized, the peoples of which likewise adopted a devil religion and indulged in the forms and practices of worship based upon the teachings of men, which had been induced by Satan and handed down from one generation to another, and thus the religions that followed thereafter were based upon or found authority in tradition. All religious worship was and ever has been contrary to the commandments of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the day of Abel till now there have at all times been a few men on the earth who have remained loyal and faithful to Jehovah. Among such men was one known as Abram, afterwards called Abraham, and whom God used to make prophetic pictures foreshadowing his purposes. Jehovah made promise to Abraham, and bound it with his oath, that in due time he would have on earth a righteous rule and that such righteous government would rest upon the shoulder of God’s beloved One, whom Abraham’s beloved son Isaac foreshadowed, and that such government would bring boundless blessings to all peoples of earth who would obey God and maintain their integrity toward him. The issue was clearly made now, and two pathways were laid before the creatures of earth, one marked out by Satan, which leads into unrighteousness and into destruction; the other marked out by Jehovah, as recorded in his Word, which leads to endless life and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God caused the descendants of Abraham to sojourn for a term of years in the land of Egypt that those chosen people there might perform certain acts and make prophetic pictures foretelling how Jehovah would develop and bring to pass his purpose to bless the obedient ones of mankind. There in Egypt God’s chosen people were severely persecuted and ill-treated by those who practiced the Devil religion. Jehovah God heard their cries, made a covenant with them, and caused Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, and then when they reached Mount Sinai Jehovah God confirmed his covenant and inaugurated it toward his chosen people. At that time Jehovah said to them: “I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.”—Ex. 20:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The chief purpose of that covenant was to safeguard the Israelites from religion, which the Devil was using to turn men away from God. That such was the chief purpose is clearly shown by the testimony of the apostle Paul, who was once a practitioner of religion, but who became a Christian and wrote under inspiration and authority given him by the Almighty God through Christ Jesus. Concerning that covenant which God made with the Israelites he wrote: &quot;What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; and it was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator. So that the law is become our tutor to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.”—Gal. 3:19,24, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle there explains that the seed of promise is Christ Jesus and that the purpose of the law covenant was to hold the Israelites away from the Devil’s religious influence until the coming of Christ Jesus, the seed of promise. The history of the people of Israel, as set forth in the Bible, from Exodus to Malachi’s prophecy, discloses the fact that the Israelite people were constantly influenced by the Devil and induced to embrace and practice the religion which was used and practiced by the nations round about them. One of the striking instances recorded in the Bible which proves this point is this: “Baal-peor” was a religion practiced by the heathen nation of Moab. Of course, it was a devil religion and the Devil induced the Israelites to embrace it; concerning which it is written: “And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel. And the Lord said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the Lord against the sun, that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel. And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal-peor.” (Num. 25:3-5) “Your eyes have seen what the Lord did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the Lord thy God hath destroyed them from among you. But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day.”—Deut. 4: 3, 4; Ps. 106: 28; Hos. 9:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has ever been the practice of Satan to employ fraud and deception to mislead the people and cause them to practice religion in defiance of God’s law. Many centuries passed between the time of the making of the law covenant and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Within that time almost all the Israelites fell away from God, disobeying their covenant, and, under the deceptive influence of the Devil, turned to the practice of religion. The leaders in Israel claimed to represent God, and yet they had substituted the teachings of men for God’s commandments. They then named their formal practices “the Jews’ religion”. The scribes and Pharisees, who were the clergy of that time and the leaders, and who dominated and controlled the people, induced the people to believe that it was their bounden duty to obey whatsoever the Pharisees taught them. They exercised an influence over the people then similar to that exercised in these latter days by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is composed of a few men, who rule and control vast numbers whom they call the “Catholic population’’, which population is commanded to yield to the influence and teachings of the Hierarchy, that is, the clergymen of modern times. The men of the Hierarchy follow in exactly the same course as that pursued by the scribes and Pharisees. The scribes and Pharisees taught certain forms and practices, which had been transmitted to them by men who lived in the earlier days of the Jews. The Jewish clergy exalted themselves and sought the praise and service of the people for themselves, posing as great and mighty ones representing Jehovah God on earth. They laid great burdens upon the people, while for themselves they sought ease, comfort and honor amongst men. To them Jesus Christ, when he was on earth, said: “For they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments, and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi. But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.” (Matt. 23:4-8) Compare this language of Jesus with the present-day practices of clergymen who practice what they call “Christian religion”, but which is in fact a religious formalism, wrongfully named “Christian”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus, when on earth, taught only the commandments of Jehovah God. He was God’s duly appointed, anointed and commissioned Son to carry out Jehovah’s purposes. “Christ” means the anointed One, who acts with authority from Jehovah; and therefore Christ Jesus was the beginner of Christianity. Christ Jesus, although born a Jew, was not a religionist. On the contrary, he pointed out that religion is of the Devil. The Jewish clergy hated Jesus and repeatedly sought to entrap him, to persecute him, and to kill him. On one occasion when they came to Jesus for the purpose of entrapping him, Jesus clearly defined the difference between religion and Christianity. He pointed out distinctly that religion originates with God’s adversary, the Devil, and that the religion then being practiced by the Pharisees was contrary to the Word of God. The Bible record is: “Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. And he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">because of your tradition? . . </span><span class="font4">. And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition. Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, This people honoreth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain do they worship me, teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men.”—Matt. 15: 1-3, 6-9, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This testimony of Christ Jesus shows beyond any question of doubt that religion is an open defiance of Jehovah God’s law, and that it originated with the Devil; that religious practice is an abomination in the sight of God; and that those who practice the same make void the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those same Jewish clergymen, that is, the scribes and Pharisees who came to Jesus, all of them, claimed to be the representatives of God on earth. They were bound to know the terms of the everlasting covenant which God had given unto the Israelites (Gen. 9:2-6; Ex. 20:13), and yet in the face of that they repeatedly sought to kill Jesus, the beloved Son of God, because he told them the truth. Claiming to represent God, they were in fact the chief representatives of the Devil on earth at that time, and their chief act of representing him was in the religion they taught and the influence thereby exercised over the people. At this point it is important to read the Scriptural record found at John 8:37-44 (4.R.F.) : “I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you. I speak the things which I have seen with my Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from your father. They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham. Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech ? Even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.” Here Jesus pointed out definitely that those clergymen represented the Devil. It was that same class of men, the practitioners of religion, that caused the wrongful execution of Jesus on the charge of sedition and treason. The religionists follow the same course at the present time with reference to those who truly and in fact serve God and Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As further proof that religion is of the Devil the case of Saul of Tarsus, who afterwards was called Paul, is here cited. Saul was a Pharisee himself and practiced the Jewish religion. The weight of authority is that he was a member of the high court at Jerusalem, presided over by the high priest, and which corresponds to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of the present time, to which a few men belong, and which Hierarchy is presided over by the pope. After the crucifixion of Jesus Saul continued a vigorous persecution of the true followers of Christ Jesus. It is manifest from the record that Saul was woefully deceived by the Devil and was acting sincerely in persecuting Christians and that because of his sincerity God revealed the truth to him. The case of Paul is proof that a clergyman who honestly and sincerely practices religion, if he is honest and true, may become a Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Saul was bitter against Christians and in his heat vigorously sought them out that he might persecute them. As the Biblical record shows, he called upon the high priest and obtained letters of authority that he might go to Damascus and search out the Christians and persecute them there. Likewise today priests obtain authority from the pope to carry on their persecution against Jehovah’s witnesses in the earth. When Saul obtained this authority and started to Damascus for the purpose of carrying out his mission of persecution against Christians the Lord revealed to him the truth; and concerning this matter the Bible record reads: “But Saul, yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, and asked of him letters to Damascus unto the synagogues, that if he found any that were of [this] Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. And as he journeyed, it came to pass that he drew nigh unto Damascus: and suddenly there shone round about him </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">light out of heaven: and he fell upon the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutes! thou me! And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: but rise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do. And the men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but beholding no man. And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus. And he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink. Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said unto him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord. And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth; and he hath seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight. But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much evil he did to thy saints at Jerusalem: and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name. But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel: for I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name’s sake. And Ananias departed, and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way which thou earnest, hath sent me, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the holy spirit. And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight; and he arose and was baptized; and he took food and was strengthened.”—Acts 9:1-19, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Up to this time Saul of Tarsus had been a religionist. Now he immediately faced about and became a Christian, that is, a true follower of Christ Jesus, and the Lord caused his name to be changed to Paul. He became the faithful and true apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ and wrote under inspiration from the Lord. Thereafter he spurned religion because it is from the wicked one, and he taught only the commandments of God, even as Christ Jesus had said and done. Mark now the testimony of Paul himself upon this point: “For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God ? or am I striving to please men ? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ. For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man. For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ. For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it: and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">traditions of my fathers.</span><span class="font4"> But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, even from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace, to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood: neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.”—Gal. 1:10-17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This, together with the testimony of Jesus, is proof conclusive that religion is the means employed by the Devil to deceive men and to alienate them from. Jehovah God, and that the Devil follows this course for the express purpose of making good his wicked challenge to Jehovah. These scriptures also show that the Christian must avoid religion and faithfully obey the commandments of Jehovah God as written in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What was true in Paul’s day is likewise true in this day. When Paul was a religionist he sought the pleasures of men, that he might have their praise and approval. While doing so he persecuted Christians, because that was popular amongst the religionists. Today the clergy who practice religion seek the pleasure and approval of men, and this they do by persecuting those men and women who tell the truth to the people as contained in the Bible. Religion is a means of oppression. Christianity is the teaching of Jehovah God’s Word setting forth his great and right-cous purpose, and brings comfort and joy to those who obey God’s Word. Those who seek the pleasure of men and the approval and plaudits of men are an abomination in God’s sight. Upon this point Jesus plainly stated: “For that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.’’ (Luke 16:15) Following the lead of his Master, Christ Jesus, the apostle Paul said that servants of God who please God cannot be men-pleasers.—Eph. 6:6; Col. 3:22.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>DENOMINATIONS ORGANIZED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Even while the apostles yet lived on the earth the Devil attempted to plant religious practices amongst Christians. “Little children, it is the last hour: and as ye heard that antichrist cometh, even now have there arisen many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last hour.’’ (1 John 2:18, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> “And every spirit that confesseth not Jesus is not of God: and this is the spirit of the antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the world already.’’—1 John 4: 3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Within a short time after the apostles died there arose in the congregations of the Christian people certain ambitious men who desired to become leaders and have the approval of men and to receive the plaudits of men, even as the Devil desired when he defied Jehovah. Not many years thereafter passed until there was recognized in those congregations the distinction between “clergy’’ and the common people called “laity’’. Those bodies or congregations of people called “Christians” soon adopted and practiced formalisms based upon the teachings of men. They became religionists. Into the organizations there were introduced and practiced many forms and ceremonies that found no support whatsoever in the Bible. Those organizations then began to call themselves “the church”, and those congregations were formed into an organization and by men improperly called “the church of God”. The doctrines and practices of that organization the elergy then named and called ‘ ‘ The Christian religion”. That name was wrongfully applied to the organization. The clear distinction which Jesus Christ and his faithful apostle had made between religion and Christianity, as set forth in the scriptures above cited, was soon ignored and forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Roman Catholic organization was the first to introduce and practice man-made doctrines and formalism which is named “Christian religion”, and which they practice to this day. Then came into existence the “Protestant organizations”, so called, and which organizations after a time also adopted formalism and practiced that formalism, which they call “worship”; and they too called themselves and their formal practice the “Christian religion”. Hundreds of sects or denominations came into existence, and still exist. All of these practice what they call the “Christian religion”, and all of them differ in some respects as to doctrines and forms of practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the early doctrines introduced into the Roman Catholic organization was that of “purgatory” and the offering of prayers in behalf of the dead. That doctrine and practice has been a source of great revenue to the Hierarchy, because it has induced many noble people to give up their hard-earned money to the Hierarchy on the pretext that men of the Hierarchy can utter prayers in behalf of the dead and thereby shorten the duration of their punishment in “purgatory”. That doctrine is wholly unsupported by the Scriptures, but is founded only on the traditions of men, and therefore makes void the Word of God. Concerning the dead, God’s Word says: “For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward, for the memory of them is forgotten. Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.” (Eccl. 9:5,10) “The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.”—Ps. 115:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will be noted that every one of the sorcalled “Christian organizations”, which indulge in the practice and teaching of what they call the “Christian religion”, rely upon the teachings of the early fathers or men who have preceded them in the organization. Such self-wise men have advanced their own philosophy concerning the salvation of mankind. Many persons have been deceived by such teachings handed down to them by tradition and have believed themselves to be Christians, even though they were in no wise following Christ. Paul, the true and faithful follower of Christ Jesus, and therefore a Christian, warned Christians against such deceptive philosophy when he wrote to them: “Take heed lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil of you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.” —Col. 2: 8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At all times since the beginning of religion at Babylon the Devil has been diligent in putting forth doctrines and practices which have deceived sincere persons. By means of fraud and deceit the Devil has contaminated what at the beginning was a company of sincere persons desiring to serve God, and his contamination has been accomplished by substituting for the commandments of God the philosophy and traditions of men. Thereby the Devil’s representatives in the congregations have made the Word of God void by their traditions. Such action on the Devil’s part is exactly in accord with his wicked challenge to turn men away from God. His methods of fraud and deceit thus employed are in full accord with his name Serpent, which means deceiver. It is to be expected that the Devil would do all things within his power to keep the people in the darkness concerning the truth of God’s Word. For this very purpose he has caused the Hierarchy and other organizations to withhold the Bible from the people and to substitute therefore man-made prayer books and other teachings of men. Among those congregations have been and are many sincere persons who have been blinded to the truth by reason of Satan’s influence. There has been a little of the Word of the Lord mixed with the traditions of men, and this has afforded a more subtle and complete means of deceiving the people. The result has been, and is down at this period of time, exactly what God’s prophet foretold long centuries ago, that ‘darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the people’. (Isa. 60:2) Without a question of doubt the darkness amongst the peoples of earth today, in the lands called “Christendom”, is greater than it has ever been at any time previous. Millions of persons, who are called the “Catholic population”, blindly follow the leadings of men. Amongst these millions are some sincere persons who sigh and cry because of the wickedness done in that Roman organization and who are feeling after God and his truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>GREATER LIGHT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The second coming of Christ Jesus in power and glory is the teaching of the Scriptures emphasized by the faithful apostles. Christ Jesus instructed his disciples that he would come again, at which time Satan’s world should end. Jehovah’s promise is that greater light would come upon the sincere people of the world at the second coming of Christ, and that this would be at the end of the world; that at that time the true followers of Christ Jesus would be greatly enlightened and, continuing in obedience unto God’s commandments, would be led in the right way. (Prov. 4:18; 1 Cor. 4:5; 1 Cor. 10:11; Eph. 5:8,14) True to the promise of Jehovah, and strictly according to the prophecies and the chronology of the Bible, the second coming of Christ Jesus and the end of Satan’s world was due in 1914, and the evidence was there brought forward showing his second coming. Jesus had declared to his disciples that the first evidence of the end of Satan’s world and Christ’s coming would be a world war between the nations. Exactly on time, in 1914, the proof thereof began to be made manifest, and the physical facts show a fulfillment of the prophecy; and the chronology as well as the prophecies discloses the presence of the Lord. Immediately following the World War other prophecies uttered by the Lord Jesus Christ wrnre fulfilled, and the proof was and is overwhelming and conclusive that it was in the year 1914 that Jehovah’s prophetic words to Christ Jesus were fulfilled, to wit: “Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (Ps. 110:2) Clearly this means that the reign or rule of Christ Jesus was due and there began, even while the enemy Satan was and is actively carrying forward his nefarious work in his attempt to make good his wicked challenge. For many centuries Satan had exercised his power without interruption, but with the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in 1914 his rule began to be interrupted, and from that time onward Satan began his preparation for the final battle, which conflict is called Armageddon. Since 1914 the woes upon the peoples of the nations of earth have continued to increase. These woes are not, as the clergy would make the people believe, the result of infidelity of the people to the so-called “church organizations”. On the contrary, the Devil himself has brought these woes upon the people to cause them (as he had sworn he could) to ‘curse God to his face’. On this point applies the scripture as it is written: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. ’ ’—Rev. 12:12.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>JEHOVAH’S TEMPLE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The capital organization of Jehovah God is designated by the word “Zion”. Christ Jesus is the head of that organization. Together with the apostles, and the other faithful followers of Christ Jesus, these constitute the royal house of Jehovah, which is designated by his Word under the term “the temple of the living God”. This company of Christian people must be and is wholly devoted to God, and concerning the same it is written: “And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. ’ ’—2 Cor. 6:16-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the prophecy and chronology of the Bible A.D. 1918 was the due time for Christ Jesus to gather together his faithful ones and separate them specifically from the world, and this is spoken of in the Scriptures as the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple of Jehovah. The physical facts of prophecy prove beyond any doubt that Christ Jesus came to the temple in 1918 and there began the gathering unto himself of his faithful followers. Then, true to God’s promise, greater light began to shine upon God’s Word and to shine into the mind of each one of the faithful, and since that time Jehovah has unfolded and revealed to these faithful ones the meaning of his prophecies; and his glorious light, shining into the face of Christ Jesus at the temple, has been and is reflected to the members of the temple company, the faithful Christians, and these have been made to understand and to appreciate the Scriptures as never before. (2 Cor. 3:17,18) This enlightenment God gives not merely for the benefit of the faithful followers of Christ Jesus, but also that they might use the same to make the truth known to others who are seeking the way of righteousness. What they have learned they must tell to others according to God’s commandment.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>FAITHFUL AND TRUE WITNESSES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">One of the titles which Jehovah has given to Christ Jesus is that of “the faithful and true witness”. (Rev. 1:5; 3:14; 19:11) This title God gives to Jesus because Jesus is always true to Jehovah, always speaking and acting in obedience to Jehovah’s commandment. When on earth Jesus said: “My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.” (John 7:16, A.R.V.) “For I spake not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. And I know that his commandment is life eternal; the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.” (John 12: 49, 50, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> Jesus again showed the clear distinction between the teachings of men and that of God. Men seek honor and glory for themselves. The true witness of Jehovah honors the Most High. “He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.”—John 7:18, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In carrying out his expressed purpose to have his name testified in all the earth Jehovah sent Jesus to earth to be his witness, and concerning this Jesus said: “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.” (John 18:37) Thus is Christ Jesus clearly identified in the Scriptures as the beginner of Christianity, that is to say, the one who speaks the truth of God’s Word in obedience to Jehovah’s commandments. Every person who is a true Christian, therefore, must likewise speak the truth of God’s Word and refuse to be guided by tradition of men. Those who become Christians must follow in the footsteps of Jesus Christ; as it is written: “For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps. ” (1 Pet. 2:21) These followers in the footsteps of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesus Christ are subjected to persecution and suffer at the hands of religionists, even as Christ Jesus suffered. After the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple faithful Christians then began to see and appreciate these truths and they saw their obligation to be governed thereby and that they must be witnesses to the name and kingdom of Jehovah God amidst persecution inflicted upon them by religionists.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>“JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Persons who are not informed speak of the company of Jehovah’s witnesses in such terms as these: “ A religious sect or cult ”; “ another religious body. ’ ’ In this they are entirely wrong. The company of Christian people in the earth known and designated as “Jehovah’s witnesses” are those who are entirely devoted to Jehovah God and who faithfully endeavor to follow in the footsteps of Jesus Christ in obedience to God’s commandments. They are not religionists. They are Christians. They are not a sect or cult. They must obey Jehovah’s commandments and not the ordinances or teachings or the traditions of men. They become Jehovah’s witnesses in obedience to his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again attention is called to the truth that Jehovah said to the Devil, in answer to his wicked challenge, that in due time Jehovah would show forth his power and that he would have his name declared throughout all the earth. (Ex. 9:16) To this end Jehovah began with Christ Jesus to bring forth his witnesses who must declare his name throughout all the earth. For some time after the persecution of Jesus and his crucifixion even his apostles did not understand God’s purpose in this regard; but after they had received the holy spirit, and while in a conference at Jerusalem, the Lord enlightened them and they understood God’s purpose, and one of their number stood forth as a witness of the Lord and declared that ‘ ‘ God... did visit the [nations], to take out of them a people for his name”. (Acts 15:14) With the apostles God began the bringing forth of other witnesses to follow in the footsteps of his faithful and true witness, Christ Jesus. Thus over a period of time Jehovah has been taking out of the world a people for a purpose, which people must become his witnesses and show forth the praises of Jehovah. (1 Pet. 2:9,10) These are and must be wholly devoted to Jehovah God, and these thus taken out and devoted to Jehovah God are the ones whom the Lord Jesus gathers to the temple at his coming. It is to those thus taken out that Jehovah addresses himself, and says: ‘‘Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour. I have declared, and I have saved, and I have showed; and there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, [that] I am God.”—Isa. 43: 10-12, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The name “Jehovah’s witnesses” is the name which Jehovah himself gives to those who are the faithful and true followers of Christ Jesus. It is not the name of a sect or cult or denomination, but the name of true Christians by which they are identified. The same commission that Jehovah gave to Christ Jesus, the Head and Lord of Zion, is given to those who are his faithful and true followers; and which commission is in the following words: “The spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the year of Jehovah’s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn. ’ ’—Isa. 61:1,2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.B.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such anointed ones, therefore, God himself ordains as his ministers to declare his Word. The ordination of men by man-made organizations amounts to nothing. The only truly ordained ministers of God on earth are the ones who are ordained of God and become his witnesses. To them Jehovah further says: ‘ ‘ Thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall name.” (Isa. 62: 2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> Such faithful Christians must obey the commandments of Jehovah God; otherwise they cease to be Jehovah’s witnesses. Christ Jesus is their Head and Commander and Leader, and he is Jehovah’s great and mighty Prophet, of whom Moses was a type. To these followers of Christ Jesus, who are Jehovah’s witnesses, the Lord says: “And it shall be, that every soul that shall not hearken to that prophet, shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.”—Acts 3:23, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses have no alternative; they must obey God’s commandments as uttered by Christ Jesus, and a failure to do so means their destruction. When the law of men, made by the legislative bodies of the world, is in conflict with God’s law, then a Christian must obey the law of God even though by so doing he is brought into jeopardy by the laws of the land. The apostles of Jesus Christ announced this rule when they said before the high court of Jerusalem: “We ought to obey God rather than men. ’ ’—Acts 5: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, and particularly with his coming to the temple, the time is marked and due when the name of Jehovah God must be declared throughout all the earth in obedience to Jehovah’s law. (Ex. 9:16) This work of declaring the name of God must be done by the people whom he has taken out for his name, that is to say, Jehovah’s witnesses, Christians, the true followers of Christ Jesus. These Christians have been brought into the knowledge of the fact that Jehovah is the great and almighty God, that he is above all, and that his name he will now vindicate; that Christ Jesus is his chief agent and vindicator, and that the time is at hand for him to for ever settle the issue raised by the Devil’s challenge, and that he will settle it by the vindication of his name. To this end Jehovah God has sent Christ Jesus, placing him upon his throne of authority where he now presides in power and great glory. (Ps. 2:6) Jehovah’s kingdom has come, and Christ, the Head of that kingdom, is now actively carrying forward the witness work in the earth, and this he will complete, and at the completion thereof will manifest Jehovah’s power in the full vindication of Jehovah’s name; and his kingdom will work deliverance to the obedient ones of God and will establish everlasting peace in earth upon those of good will toward God. This is good news, or “gospel”; and all who desire and love righteousness delight in hearing the same. Therefore the Lord God gives to all the faithful followers of Christ Jesus this commandment: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. ’ ’—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses must obey this commandment, and in obedience thereto they go forth preaching or declaring “this gospel of the kingdom” to the people as a witness to the name of Jehovah. That witness work must soon be completed; and, when it is completed, what shall follow? The answer is given by Jesus in these words: “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” (Matt. 24: 21) That great tribulation will be upon the entire world, and this marks the end and complete destruction of Satan’s organization and his power. Such is the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and is otherwise called “Armageddon”. There Jehovah will destroy all his enemies.—Pss. 21:8; 145:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Jesus was on the earth he did not erect buildings, which he called “churches”. He did not install therein images of anything. To have done so would have been in violation of God’s commandments. He did not wear lace pants or a long flowing robe and have the boys walk behind him and carry it. He did not carry a vessel with fire in it and upon this fire cause incense to be sprinkled that others might see him performing some ceremony. He denounced the clergy for doing the things that call attention to themselves. Jesus was meek and lowly of heart; by that meaning he was taught of Jehovah God and spoke only Jehovah’s words and did not attempt to exalt himself and receive the honors of men. Jesus went about from place to place teaching the people and preaching the truth as Jehovah had commanded him to do. Jesus sent forth his disciples from house to house to instruct the people and preach to them the gospel of the kingdom of God, which was in obedience to Jehovah’s commandments. His disciples in obedience to such commandments did that very thing. (Matt. 10: 7-14) They went from house to house preaching the gospel of the Kingdom. Concerning this the apostle Paul wrote: “And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house.” (Acts 20:20) For so doing they were persecuted by the enemy Satan and his earthly agents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following the example of Christ Jesus and his apostles Jehovah’s witnesses today faithfully go about from house to house preaching to the people this gospel of the Kingdom by speaking to the people and calling their attention to the Kingdom message in printed form. They do this not for the purpose of receiving the plaudits of men, but they do it because they are commanded to do so by Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and they love to do as commanded. This detailed statement is here made for the purpose of clearly identifying Jehovah’s witnesses, to the end that those who desire to know the truth may see that Jehovah’s witnesses are not a sect or cult introducing another form of religion, but, on the contrary, they are the true and faithful followers of Christ Jesus obeying the Lord’s commandments to make known</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the name of Jehovah and his kingdom. These faithful men and women have heretofore been classed as members of the &quot;Catholic population&quot; or Protestant organizations, or outside of all of them. Becoming the true followers of Christ Jesus, they are no longer so identified, but are identified under the &quot;new name”, which God has given them, namely, Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CORPORATIONS</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font4">A corporation is a worldly legal title or name given and applied by the law of the land to a body of persons organized into a company to hold title to property and to perpetuate and carry on a work in harmony with the law of the land. For more than fifteen centuries the general understanding of men has been that religion and Christianity are one and the same thing. The lawmakers of the various states, countries and nations have enacted laws governing corporations and in such laws have designated these organizations as religious corporations. The clear intent of the lawmakers has been and is to regard religious organizations and Christian organizations as the same thing. In some of these laws, fundamental and statutory, these worshipers are referred to as “worshipers of Almighty God”, and that law declares that no restrictions shall be placed upon men who worship but each one may worship Almighty God according to the dictates of his own conscience. The laws of the land also designate these corporate bodies as charitable corporations. From the viewpoint of the lawmakers of the land religious corporations, charitable corporations, and those incorporated for the purpose of preaching the gospel, are all alike and all come within the same category. The law of the land makes no distinction between religion and Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the purpose of holding title to property, carrying on and perpetuating their work as Christians without being hindered by the duration of the earthly life of men, faithful Christian people in the year 1884 organised the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society under the law governing religious and charitable corporations. For the same purpose in the year 1909 the Peoples Pulpit Association was incorporated and organized under the membership corporation law of the state of New York but designated as a religious and charitable corporation. In the year 1914 the International Bible Students Association was incorporated and organized under the laws of England as a religious and charitable corporation for the same purpose. Later the International Bible Students Association, Ltd., and for the same purpose, was organized under the laws of Canada. Under those laws, religious and charitable corporations mean one and the same thing. Therefore the corporations above named are properly designated before the law and by the law as religious and charitable corporations within the meaning and understanding of the law of the land. They are charitable organizations in this, that they are devoted to a work that is prompted by love for God, for his Word, and for the people. All of the foregoing corporations work as one, and all of them are under one management and orderly carry forward the work done by Jehovah’s witnesses. They hold title to property, publish books and other publications, and generally conduct the work and affairs of Jehovah’s witnesses in harmony with the law of the land. They are all entitled to the full privileges and benefits of the law of the land governing religious and charitable corporations. That, however, does not constitute Jehovah’s witnesses “religionists”. Jehovah’s witnesses serve Jehovah God as He has commanded, even as Jesus Christ always does; whereas religionists are governed and act and carry on their work according to the teachings and traditions of men. The abovenamed corporations, to be sure, are merely inanimate bodies created and organized according to law and designated and named in harmony with the law and entitled to hold property, carry on work, and to receive the benefits of the law of the land as such corporations. Manifestly it was never the intention of lawmaking bodies to make any distinction between corporations merely because one body is religious and the other body conducts a work in the name of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no reason for nor an occasion for Jehovah’s witnesses to have a membership roll. No one is received into an organization known as Jehovah’s witnesses in accord with certain fixed rules made by men. When a person consecrates himself or herself to God and is baptized into Christ as commanded by the Scriptures, then he is in a covenant to do the will of God and it is the expressed will of God that he must be a witness for Jehovah; consequently he is properly designated Jehovah’s witness. Those now on the earth who are witnesses for Jehovah have at some time been connected with religious organizations, some of them designated as “the Catholic population”, others as Protestants, others as Jews, and still others who have been designated as heathen. Each one of these consecrating and devoting himself wholly to Jehovah and his service and accepted and received by the Lord into his temple becomes a part of God’s organization and is properly designated a Jehovah’s witness. Thus it is seen that men do not bestow this name upon others, but it is the name which is bestowed upon men by the Lord himself. It is not for men to determine who is and who is not a Jehovah’s witness. By the fruits that they bear before others they enable others to identify them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sole purpose of Jehovah’s witnesses is to do what the name implies, to wit: To declare the name of Jehovah throughout the earth and to bear testimony to others concerning Jehovah, his purpose and his kingdom through Christ Jesus, to the end that the people may learn of God and Christ, that they may take their stand on the side of Jehovah and receive his protection and blessing. There is no intention and there is no effort to build up a worldly organization known as “Jehovah’s witnesses”. These faithful and true followers of Christ Jesus could not have any part in the polities of this world, because their interest, their devotion and their allegiance is to Jehovah God and his kingdom under Christ. They must and do obey every law of the land that is not contrary to God’s law. Concerning the political kingdoms of this world ruled by men, Jesus declared that his kingdom had no part therein. The kingdom of God under Christ is that which is created by Jehovah God and supplants the kingdoms of this world. Christ Jesus having come in power and glory invisible to human eyes, and having been placed upon his throne by Jehovah God, now is fulfilled the prophetic utterance of the Scriptures, to wit: “The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever.” (Rev. 11:15, Z?.V.) This means that Christ Jesus is now the rightful ruler of the world and will shortly completely oust the Devil’s rule; but before doing so God is causing his name and purpose to be declared amongst the peoples of the earth. The present-day work of Jehovah’s witnesses is therefore to advertise Jehovah’s kingdom and his King. This they do by preaching orally and by exhibiting to the people the Kingdom message prepared for them to read in their homes. This message, in the form of millions of volumes of books and millions of magazines, is placed in the hands of the people; and this is done at a money sacrifice to all of Jehovah’s witnesses. It is done unselfishly because they love to obey God’s commandments. Jehovah’s witnesses represent God and Christ, and necessarily they call down upon their heads the enmity, hatred and persecution of their enemies, the Devil and all his agents.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>FIGHTING AGAINST GOD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">From the very beginning of the human race Satan the Devil has fought against God in his effort to sustain his side of the challenge and to oppose Jehovah God. Jehovah has permitted the Devil to proceed unrestrained until his due time to end the controversy, and that the Almighty will do at the “battle of that great day of God Almighty”, in which Satan and all his supporters will be completely eliminated from the world. Because the day of that great and final battle is nigh the Devil is desperately trying to drive all nations into destruction. The destruction of all mankind would be a victory for the Devil and would sustain his challenge; but Jehovah has provided for the preservation and salvation of all those of mankind that remain true and faithful to him, and thus the victory for Jehovah will be complete. It is the expressed will of Jehovah God that now his name and his kingdom shall be made known throughout the earth. For that reason he sends forth his witnesses to give testimony to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A brief reference is made here to Satan’s fight against those who have faithfully served God from the day of Eden till now. The Lord caused the apostle Paul to make a record thereof, and which record is set forth in the eleventh chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews. That record began with Abel, and names faithful men who resisted the Devil and served Jehovah faithfully thereafter until the coming of the Lord Jesus to the earth. Those faithful men of old were not interested in the politics of Satan’s world, but were seeking a better government, that is, God’s kingdom, having full faith that in his due time Jehovah God would set up a righteous government according to his promise. (Heb. 11:14-16) Those faithful prophets of old were witnesses for Jehovah, and because they stood firmly for Jehovah, maintaining their integrity toward him, they were objects of malicious hatred expressed by Satan through his worldly religious agents. Those faithful men were firm and steadfast, looking with complete confidence to the coming of the Messiah and his kingdom of righteousness. Further describing them and their faithfulness in enduring persecution heaped upon them the apostle wrote: “Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again; and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment: they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.’’—Heb. 11:33-38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Consider now who were the men that the Devil used to persecute and kill the prophets of Jehovah God. They were the religionists, who hypocritically posed before the people as good and law-abiding citizens. The persecutors are almost always hypocritical, assuming a high standard for themselves and at the same time resorting to the most fiendish and devilish things. When the leaders in the nation of Israel fell away to the Devil’s religion they became the vicious persecutors of men who remained true and faithful to Jehovah God. When Jesus was on the earth, as the Scriptures describe, the Pharisees and scribes were the clergy taking the lead in the Jews’ religion. Jesus told them that they were agents of the Devil, and that it was the religious class that had persecuted to death the faithful prophets of old and that thereafter continued to persecute faithful men. Note the testimony of Jesus: “Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of hell? Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city: that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. ’ ’—Matt. 23: 31-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When reading these scriptures concerning the persecution of the prophets, have in mind the record of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the skirts of the men of that organization that are stained with human blood unrighteously shed. For more than 1500 years that religious organization has persecuted the faithful witnesses who serve Jehovah, and it continues to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was the clergy of the Jews’ religion, the men who presided at the synagogues and pretended to be the servants of Jehovah, that carried on a vigorous and malicious persecution of the Lord Jesus himself, and they did so in obedience to the Devil. Jesus told those religious persecutors to their face that they were acting at the behest of the Devil. (John 8:44) Jesus then spoke a prophetic parable to those religionists and applied it to those clergymen. He told them that Jehovah God had sent his servants to proclaim his name in the earth and that the religionists had persecuted them and killed them. He told them then that the Almighty had sent his Son (meaning himself) and that the religionists sought his lifeblood. Jesus showed those leaders of the Jews that they had been charged with the obligation of teaching Jewish people the commandments of Jehovah but that not only had they failed to do so but they had persecuted every faithful man who had come to them. Then Jesus added: “But, last of all, he [Jehovah God] sent unto them his son [Jesus, the beloved One], saying, They will reverence my son. But when the husbandman saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance. And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.” (Matt. 21:37-39) The religionists fulfilled that prophetic parable in persecuting Jesus unto an ignominious death; and when they had succeeded they cried out: ‘Let his blood be upon us.’ Only a fiendish agent of the Devil could thus act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before his death Jesus spoke to his disciples concerning the religionists in the world, which words apply to all his true followers from that day to this: “If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me. ’ ’—John 15:18-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Almost immediately following the crucifixion of Jesus upon the tree the malicious clergy began a vicious persecution of the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. Stephen was the first one to meet a violent death by stones hurled at him by the clergy who practiced religion; and mark this, before his death Stephen was arrested, charged with speaking seditious words, and witnesses against him were hired by the religionists to swear lies against Stephen in order to obtain an apparently legal conviction. He was given a mock trial, similar to that which is today given to Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany, and in Hoboken, New Jersey, where cruel religious dictators rule. Convicted upon perjured testimony, Stephen was foully murdered by religionists. (Acts 6:8-7:58) Saul, the religionist who afterwards became Paul the Christian, participated in that crime because he was blinded by the influence of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostles of Jesus Christ and faithful witnesses of Jehovah were time and again arrested and brought into the courts charged with perverting the people by preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. The high court of Jerusalem, conducted by religionists, commanded the apostles to cease their preaching, and to that command the apostles replied: “Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. ... We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 4:19;5: 29) The apostles not only suffered much persecution at the hands of religionists, but almost all of them were put to a violent death by the religionists. All that wicked work was done at the behest of the Devil in his fight against God, and thus the religionists continue to fight against God. At least one member of the high court of Jerusalem, before whom the apostles were brought, saw that the persecution of those faithful men was in fact fighting against God, and he warned his fellow judges of that court to that effect: “And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men. For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought. After this man, rose up Judas of Galilee, in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed. And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.”—Acts 5:35-39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Later the Devil, by means of subtlety and fraud exercised by and through ambitious men, gained control of the congregations of professed followers of Christ Jesus. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy was then brought into action, and from that day to this the Hierarchy is in control and dictates to the multitudes of people who have supported and still support the Catholic organization. In order to compel honest persons to become Catholics and to support the Hierarchy the cruel and wicked Inquisition was organized and operated for years by the Catholic clergy, who at the same time posed before the people as the representatives of God, just as the Jewish clergy had done in their day. That devilish Inquisition, carried on by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, subjected men and women to all manner of cruel torture, many being put to death by burning at the stake. Not only were the people forbidden to have the Bible, but if they were found in possession of the Bible or any books explaining the Bible these were seized and burned and the ones possessing them were subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. The pages of worldly history are smeared with the blood of men and women who refused to obey the commandments of the “religious priests’’ and suffered death because of maintaining their integrity toward God. That bloody record of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy stands out now loudly proclaiming the wickedness of that devilish ‘ ‘ religious ’ ’ organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God foreknew that such would be their record, and he wrote in his prophecy these words, which apply to the Devil’s agents of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, to wit: “In thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.” (Jer. 2:34) The priests of the Hierarchy are the only men who wear skirts, and so Jehovah God specifically identifies that religious crowd as the murderers of the innocents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, in the early days of that religious organization, brought forward the doctrine of “purgatory”, which finds no support whatsoever in the Bible, but which is truly a product of the Devil taught by men and handed down by tradition, and the very object and purpose of the same is to turn people away from God and his Word. That doctrine in substance says that when a man dies he is in fact still alive in a place the clergy call “purgatory”. They then instruct the people that the priests of the Hierarchy on earth can utter prayers in behalf of the dead and relieve them from suffering. With that false doctrine they go to the bereaved friends of the dead and induce them to believe that by giving up their hard-earned money to the priests they can do good unto their beloved dead; and by this means millions of good sincere persons have been deceived, caused to give their money to the priests in great sums, and for which the people have received absolutely nothing. That of itself would be bad enough, but, above all, those credulous people have been made to believe that a just and loving God would permit men to suffer in the ‘fires of purgatory’ and at the same time permit selfish men on earth to make money out of that suffering. Thus the Devil further defames the name of Almighty God and causes honest and deluded men to ‘curse him to his face’. This doctrine originated with the Devil and is taught for the purpose of mocking God and deceiving the people. Those religionists who teach and practice the doctrine of “purgatory” well know that they are teaching a lie, because the scriptures written in the Bible declare that the dead are not alive in “purgatory” or anywhere else.—Eccl. 9: 5,10; Ps. 115:17; John 5:28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE END</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4">The end of Satan’s rule without interruption came in the year 1914. Then Jesus Christ was enthroned and sent forth by Jehovah to rule, while Satan the enemy is yet exercising his power. (Pss. 2:6; 110: 2) Satan induced the kings and rulers of the earth, all of whom practice some kind of devilish religion, to enter into a conspiracy against God’s kingdom and against all who declare that kingdom: “The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” (Ps. 2:2-4, 9) But before Jehovah dashes the wicked to pieces he causes his name to be declared throughout the earth, even as he promised. (Ex. 9:16) And whom does he command to declare his name and his kingdom ? The Scriptures answer, Those whom Jehovah has taken out from the world to be witnesses for his name. —Acts 15:14; 1 Pet. 2: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord Jesus about 1918 began the gathering the faithful men and women to the temple, where they are enlightened and are instructed and commanded to go forth and proclaim the name of Jehovah and his King and kingdom. To them this commandment is given: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come. ’ ’—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Looking back at the record that Satan by the religionists has made in persecuting the servants of Jehovah God, it is to be expected that Jehovah’s witnesses in these latter days would be subjected to a similar persecution. If possible, the present-day persecution is more subtle, cruel and wicked than ever before. Satan launches a war against these witnesses of Jehovah, and, true to his name Dragon, he seeks to devour or destroy those witnesses, as it is written: “The dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” (Rev. 12:17) This explains why Jehovah’s witnesses today are subjected to great and cruel persecution by religionists.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>DRAGON AND HIS AGENTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">That old Dragon, the Devil, now has on earth the most powerful religious organization he has ever had. That religious organization is the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which has invaded every nation and corrupted the politics of every country on earth. The Hierarchy and its agents rule by the hands of dictators, in Italy, Austria, Germany, parts of New Jersey, and many other parts of the earth. Such are the rulers who have conspired against God and against his anointed witnesses, as stated in the Second Psalm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few men control the Catholic organization. Many of the priests of that organization are vicious men who have no regard whatsoever for human life. It is well known that when a crocodile is about to kill its victim great tears fall from its eyes. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is prosecuting a revolution in Spain, and while this bloody work is on the pope sheds great crocodile tears concerning the unfortunate condition of those people, while at the same time his priests line up many little children and shoot them to death. In the organization there are underpriests, who are compelled to do the bidding of the Hierarchy under penalty of death. The higher-up men or controllers of the Hierarchy cause the underlings to collect from the “Catholic population” great sums of money, which the higher-ups use to suit their own selfish purposes. The evidence this year is overwhelming that these higher-up priests of the Hierarchy have hoarded millions in Spain to be used in the wholesale murder of innocents, and yet at the same time they hypocritically claim to represent the great Prince of Peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many women, who have been induced to enter the Hierarchy organization as nuns, are regularly sent about to collect money from the people which the Hierarchy appropriates to its own use. This money is collected upon the pretense that it is for charity, whereas in truth and in fact it is used for devilish purposes. The credulous “Catholic population” support the Hierarchy by reason of fear instilled into them and taught them by the precepts of men of the Hierarchy. (Isa. 29:13) The people are kept in ignorance of the Bible by the Hierarchy to prevent them from knowing the only way of escape. There are, therefore, two separate and distinct classes in the Hierarchy, as well as in the “Catholic population”: the sincere and the hypocrites. Without a doubt there is a great multitude of sincere persons in the Catholic population, and some amongst the underpriests who desire to know the truth, and God will give them the opportunity now to know and to embrace it. The persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses by the Hierarchy is opening the eyes of the honest people as nothing else would do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No member of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy suffers persecution for practicing his religion. Germany, now ruled by an insane dictator, who acts in full accord with Vatican City, persecutes all true followers of Christ. It was the Jesuits who organized the Nazis of Germany, and they see to it that anyone who tells the truth of God’s Word is cruelly persecuted. Occasionally the press mentions some poor Catholic nun who has been arrested, not for preaching the truth, but because that woman was attempting at the time to get money out of Germany, which money was to be used at Vatican City. The Hierarchy uses the poor, credulous nuns to get the money from the people and to smuggle it out of the country, but if these unfortunate women are caught one must occasionally be arrested in order to save the face of the Hierarchy in the eyes of the public. No Catholic in Germany is ever persecuted because of his religion, although the Hierarchy boldly declares that its law is superior to the law of the land. This is further and conclusive proof that the Hierarchy is the instrument of the Devil and, as Jehovah says, the entire organization of the Hierarchy is founded upon lies,—Isa. 28:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses are the only ones who are cruelly persecuted and imprisoned in Germany because they dare to serve Jehovah God and to give testimony to his name and kingdom. In every case the persecutors of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany are religionists, who declare that the teaching of the Bible is against the interests of Germany. Those faithful witnesses for Jehovah arc, without any just cause, thrown into jail, cruelly beaten, sterilized, and some of them murdered, in order to appease the rapacity of the bloodthirsty religionists of the Devil. Thus the Devil uses religionists to fight against God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The message of Jehovah and his kingdom now being proclaimed by his witnesses is enlightening to the sincere and honest persons of the “Catholic population”, as well as to all honest and sincere ones of other organizations. Such people of good will see that they must take their stand fully on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom or else go down to death with the Devil’s organization at Armageddon. Those sincere ones, whether Catholic or non-Catholic, desire to see righteousness done. They sigh and cry because of the wickedness done in the religious organizations. Jehovah uses his anointed witnesses to bring such people of good will in contact with the truth, and those who embrace the truth flee from the devilish organization and flee to Jehovah’s kingdom, even as the Lord Jesus warned them they must do. (Matt. 24:15,16) These honest and sincere ones who thus flee to the Lord the Scriptures designate as the “other sheep” of Jesus Christ, and they are otherwise called Jonadabs and the great multitude. When these see and appreciate the truth of God’s Word they too join in proclaiming the name of the kingdom of Jehovah and continuously serve God, singing his praises.—Rev. 7:9-15; 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The persecution of true Christians by the religionists of New Jersey and other places, in recent months, has caused many sincere and honest persons of the &quot;Catholic population”, as well as others, to abandon the wicked organization of Satan and to seek refuge and safety on the side of Jehovah and Christ Jesus. The work of Jehovah’s witnesses done in obedience to the Lord’s commandment is for the very purpose of enlightening those people of good will that they may be enabled to take their stand on the side of God and his kingdom and to thus escape the perils of Armageddon. Jehovah’s witnesses, under penalty of death, are commanded by the Lord to proclaim his message of truth giving warning to others of the approaching disaster that shall fall upon the world in the near future. (Ezek. 33:7-9) All religionists and practitioners of religion arc on the Devil’s side of the great controversy, whether they know it or not. Such persons must receive the testimony and warning in order that they may have to do with choosing their own final destiny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sole work of Jehovah’s witnesses now on earth is to give testimony and warning of and concerning the name of Jehovah God and his kingdom under Christ. They are in an unbreakable covenant to render such service unto Jehovah. They delight to obey his commandments. For this reason, as Jesus declared, they are ‘hated of all nations for the sake of the name of God and Christ’. (Matt. 24: 9) Such hatred is due to the fact that the nations of earth are now in full control of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every time one of Jehovah’s witnesses goes out to perform his covenant in giving testimony he knows that he faces the enemy and is liable to punishment at the hands of cruel religionists, but he goes courageously because he knows that back of him and fully supporting him is the supreme power of Jehovah God, who in due time will cleanse the world of all wickedness. For this reason fines and imprisonment do not deter the faithful witnesses of the Lord in doing their duty. They know that they may be killed by the religious agents of Satan, and they know also that Satan’s agents can only kill their body. God alone can raise them out of death and give them life everlasting. Therefore they give heed to the words of Jesus, who says to them: “Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” —Matt. 10 : 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God has promised to raise out of death and give everlasting life to every soul or creature that obeys his commandments and serves him faithfully. These faithful witnesses delight to obey Jehovah God and will do so. All persons of good will toward God of all nations of earth are now learning that the only hope for the people is centered in Christ Jesus, the great Servant and King of the Most High. Therefore they delight to hear and to give heed to the words of Jehovah and to direct the attention of others thereto, to wit: “Behold, my servant [Christ Jesus] whom I have chosen; my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles. And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.”—Matt. 12:18,21, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">To</span><span class="font4"> all reasonable persons the evidence conclusively shows that religion is of the Devil and is used to defame Jehovah’s name, to deceive the people, and to lead them into destruction; that Christianity is of Jehovah God through Christ Jesus, and that Christians obey the commandments of Jehovah even as Christ Jesus has always done, and that this is their hope, protection and salvation. The work of Jehovah’s witnesses is to faithfully obey his commandments and therefore to declare his name and his kingdom. This is exactly what they have been doing throughout the fiscal year of 1936, as is evidenced by the details hereinafter set forth in this report.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Brooklyn, New York, is the headquarters of the three corporations above named, which act as the publishers and otherwise serve Jehovah’s witnesses. The official address of these corporations is 124 Columbia Heights. Throughout the United States there are many companies of Christian people who meet together regularly to study the Bible, together with the books and magazines explaining the Scriptures, and which are printed and manufactured by the above-named corporations. The Peoples Pulpit Association, being a New York corporation, holds title to the property of Jehovah’s witnesses and carries on the work in that state, as well as in other parts of the country. Organized under the membership law of New York, the Peoples Pulpit Association is legally and justly entitled to all the provisions of that law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The law governing the corporation of the Peoples Pulpit Association exempts all such corporations from the payment of taxes. More than twenty years ago the courts of New York state, after hearing all the evidence, rendered decision that the Peoples Pulpit Association comes within the purview of the membership corporation law and should be exempted from the payment of taxes. For some years the property held by the Association has been exempt from taxes, but now, to show the relentless persecution of Christian people by the Hierarchy and its agents, attention is here called to the acts of discrimination against the Peoples Pulpit Association. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has its agents in all the political offices of the State. That religious organization holds title to millions of dollars’ worth of property in Greater New York and all of which property is free from taxation. Recently all the property of the Peoples Pulpit Association, heretofore exempted, has been taken off the exempted list, and that in defiance of the State law and the construction of that law by the courts of the State. The taxing board seeks to compel the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Peoples Pulpit Association to pay heavy taxes on its property, and the evidence at hand is clear that in so doing they are prompted by the malicious influence of the Hierarchy, At the same time the Roman Catholic Hierarchy owns much choice real estate within Greater New York and daily sends about credulous women to extract money from the employees of the various manufacturing and other business organizations, to carry on the work of the Hierarchy and to permit its indolent priests to live in ease and wantonness, while at the same time they exercise their influence to prevent the people from hearing the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Opposition to the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom has greatly increased during the year just passed. Many of Jehovah’s witnesses have been arrested on the charge of engaging in a commercial business without a license or permit, when in truth and in fact all persons well know that Jehovah’s witnesses in placing literature with the people are not engaged in any commercial business, and are not in competition with any person or organization in existence. The small amount of contributions received for such literature amounts to less than the cost of publication and is used to publish other or more literature for the benefit of the poor peoples of the world. It is the religionists, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, that carry on such persecution against Jehovah’s witnesses on the pretext that they are violating commercial laws. The nuns or sisters of the Catholic organization are never interfered with by any officials while collecting money from the people for the Hierarchy, but, on the contrary, they are encouraged and protected by officials to carry on such work. The reason that these women are not interfered with by the men that rule the world is because they also are of the world. Concerning these Jesus said to his faithful followers: “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world [rulers] hate you.” (John 15:19) Here again is shown the clear distinction between religion and Christianity, and it shows why the religionists are fighting against God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the Constitution of the State of New Jersey guarantees that every man shall be privileged to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of his own conscience, public officials of New Jersey towns, by enactment of municipal ordinances and enforcing the same, set aside the fundamental law of the land and deny the people their just rights of worshiping Almighty God as commanded. In other parts of the United States the same course is being taken by the religionists. In carrying out their cruel and wicked persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses during the fiscal year just closed, in ninety-eight different towns, Jehovah’s witnesses, in the aggregate number of 1,149 persons, have been arrested and imprisoned because they are preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom and because they refuse to indulge in religious practices that dishonor the name of Jehovah God. In every case such arrests have been made at the instance of religionists, chiefly those of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Such arrests and imprisonment of Jehovah’s witnesses are one of the Devil’s methods of causing men to fight against God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>FLAG SALUTING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The American flag stands as a symbol of the laws of the nation which have been enacted in harmony with the Constitution of the United States. When a law is enacted that would compel a Christian to dishonor Jehovah, the Almighty God, such a law is in violation of the Constitution, and certainly is in violation of God’s law. Every honest person in America respects the American flag and gladly obeys every law for which it stands. A law compelling a person to salute the flag is violative of the Constitution and, above all, is contrary to the law of Jehovah God, which is supreme. For more than 150 years the people have respected the flag, and until recently no one has ever thought of compelling others to salute it. Quite recently religionists desiring to further browbeat the people and put them in fear have attempted, without law, to compel the saluting of the American flag. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, although a foreign foe, takes the lead in this. The American Legion, which is nothing more than a secret organization in behalf of the Hierarchy, is also a religious organization created by the Devil and organized by the Hierarchy to carry out its unlawful, political schemes. Men of that organization attempt to compel the courts to unlawfully rule that children must salute the flag or else be expelled from school; and when private schools are established to teach these same children, the same religious, unlawful crowd attempt to break up that school and the law officers stand by and do nothing. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has neither love nor respect for the American flag, yet it loudly proclaims that the saluting of the flag should be made compulsory. The Hierarchy does not hesitate to declare its laws above the laws of all nations. Some of the unreasonable judges of the courts, acting under the influence of the aforesaid religious organization, have punished persons for declining to salute the flag. Finding no law on the books governing flag saluting these judges have charged the alleged offenders with disorderly conduct because of refusing to salute the flag. In the mind of every self-respecting lawyer the charge is ridiculous. No one who stands mute and does nothing is guilty of disorderly conduct. No judge who is sane and respects the Constitution of the United States and of the state in which he holds office would even attempt to hold a person guilty of disorderly conduct for refusing to salute a flag. Small children in the schools, who have no understanding of the meaning of the flag and the saluting of it, are compelled to salute, and the children of Jehovah’s witnesses are singled out and made examples of in this regard and are wrongfully expelled from schools because they insist on obeying what their parents have taught them concerning their duty to Jehovah God. These children ask to stand mute or be excused at such religious ceremonies, but not even this satisfies the insane religionists. A great amount of opposition against Jehovah’s witnesses has developed during the year because of their firm stand in obedience to God’s commandments concerning flag saluting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To compel any person to salute a flag would not make that person law-abiding. In proof thereof, public officials swear to support the Constitution of the United States, and straightway violate their oath by willfully disobeying the Constitution. The flag, being an inanimate thing, knows nothing about saluting it. The salute is merely an outward demonstration of the person, and it would be just as much sense to compel that person every day to stand out on the street corner and shout: “I will obey the law today.” Men are presumed to obey the law; and when they violate a law, then it is time enough to punish them. To salute a flag means more than merely a declaration of obedience to the law. The salute in effect says that the person saluting looks to the flag and what it represents for protection and salvation. All persons who desire to salute a flag should be permitted to do so freely. A Christian, however, can not and docs not, for the reason that in saluting he in effect declares that he looks to a flag for protection and salvation; and such declaration is a direct violation of the law of Almighty God. The Christian looks to and relies upon Jehovah God for protection and salvation, because there is no other means given under heaven whereby men may be saved, and this salvation Jeho-va&quot;h administers through Christ Jesus.—Acts 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the present time the religionists are preparing to erect at Washington, D. C., a great statue upon which will be mounted a supposed image of the Lord Jesus; and no doubt the next move will be to compel all persons to bow before that image and salute it. While every Christian joyfully bows to and worships Christ Jesus himself as commanded, to bow before an image is an entirely different thing. The erection of a monument or image of Christ Jesus is clearly a ruse of the Devil to induce people to violate God’s law openly and to mock him and in effect curse God to his face. Wherein would the bowing before such an image be a violation of God’s law? many will ask. Many will be deceived by receiving the wrongful answer from the clergy. The correct answer to that question is recorded in the Scriptures. Jehovah God positively and unequivocally commands concerning flags, monuments and images, that every Christian must refrain from making or bowing down before the same. He says: “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them.” (Ex. 20:4,5) Christ Jesus is in heaven and is “alive for evermore” (Rev. 1:18), and is clothed with all power and authority in heaven and earth. All Christians address him direct and not through an image, and to make an image of Christ Jesus and bow before that is to follow the religious practices of heathens and is a violation of Jehovah’s commandment. Anyone who has consecrated himself to God, and is privileged to pray, always presents his petition in the name of Christ Jesus. Why bow before an image when addressing the reality? The absurdity of the whole matter appears when honest consideration is given to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Religionists constantly hold before the credulous people images and crucifixes in violation of Jehovah’s law. All reasonable persons should readily see that such a practice of images and flag saluting is a subtle and deceptive move of the Devil to induce the people to defame God’s holy name. True Chi’istians will not yield to such devilish rule, regardless of what punishment is inflicted upon them by worldlings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the religionists have seized upon compulsory flag saluting as an excuse for persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses, while at the same time those religionists themselves are the ones who violate the law, for which the flag stands, by destroying freedom of conscience, freedom of speech, and freedom of worship. In order for one to maintain his integrity toward God he must resist the Devil, and Christians must refuse to yield to any of the Devil’s schemes. Thus standing firmly for the Lord God and his commandments constitutes a witness to the name of Jehovah and to his kingdom. Doubtless the Lord permits the Devil to carry on this persecution of Christians in order to furnish a clear and wider witness to the truth and to afford the faithful ones opportunity to maintain their integrity toward God by standing against the Devil’s assaults. The firm standing of Jehovah’s witnesses for God and Christ Jesus, and the persecution of them and their children by religionists, has served as a strong witness to the name of Jehovah and caused many reasonable persons to take their stand on the side of God and his kingdom that otherwise would not have done so. As Christ Jesus was reproached because of his faithfulness to Jehovah, even so his true followers must expect to be reproached for their faithfulness to Jehovah. (Rom. 15: 3) Throughout the year Jehovah’s witnesses have steadfastly gone forward in their work in the face of this increased opposition.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>FACTORY PRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">For convenience the visible part of the Lord’s organization as a whole is designated under the one word “Society”. The three corporations above named do the manufacturing for the Society. During the year the factory at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, has kept steadily at work producing books, booklets, magazines, sound equipment and other implements used to give testimony to the Kingdom message. On an average, 138 persons are employed at that office and factory. When an emergency arises the man force is shifted to the point where most needed, all working together that the best results may be obtained. Occasionally one becomes “weary in well doing’’ and quits; but there is always a better one ready to take his place, and therefore the Lord’s work does not suffer for want of workers. The factory and office operate five and one-half days per week, eight and one-half hours each day. On Saturday afternoons and Sundays the field service for the distribution of literature is engaged in, to the real joy of all those who participate. When requested to do so in order to meet an emergency, more than eight and one-half hours are worked during the day; and adding these extra hours, the factory has operated practically 276 days during the fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The booklets produced during the fiscal year are less than those produced during the previous year, and that is due largely to the greater number of clothbound books produced, and, furthermore, to the extra labor required to manufacture sound equipment used for preaching the gospel. The bindery has operated steadily throughout the year, and this was made necessary particularly because of the greater demand for the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font4"> Within nine months after the printing of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> began, and within six months after first released for distribution, the factory produced a total of 1,902,134 volumes, all of which were shipped out as fast as produced. In this factory during the year books and booklets have been produced in 31 different languages. The printing in other languages is done in different parts of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Loyalty,</span><span class="font4"> released for the first time during the fiscal year, has been produced to the number of 5,297,103; and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing,</span><span class="font4"> released during the latter half of the fiscal year, has been produced</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">to the number of 2,500,000. The production of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font4"> for the fiscal year exceeds that of the previous year by more than 5,000. Comparative table of production by the factory appears as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Material used for the foregoing production included 1,839 tons of paper; 218,288 yards of cloth; 32,785 pounds of ink; and 15,511 pounds of glue. The ink and glue are produced at this factory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>SHIPMENTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Brooklyn factory supplies literature to every part of the United States and to other countries. During the year there were shipped out from this factory elothbound books to the number of 2,906,154, and small books to the number of 17,127,325. It was necessary to draw on the reserve stock for these shipments. The book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> exceeds in circulation that of any other book in the period of time in which it has been available. The demand for this book is still very large. Its contents appeal to and afford the honest, sincere persons, and particularly those sincere ones of the “Catholic population”, to readily learn of Jehovah’s purpose.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>SOUND EQUIPMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Preaching “this gospel of the kingdom” is the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, and a great amount of such preaching is now done by the use of electrical sound equipment. The speech is recorded on wax discs and then reproduced on a harder substance. The sixteen-inch discs or records are used on the portable transcription machines and the radio. Many of-Jehovah’s witnesses have equipped their automobiles with such sound appliances, and these move about from place to place reproducing the Kingdom message in audible voice for the benefit and comfort of the people. Those sound machines arc so constructed that they can use both the sixteen-inch discs and the small phonograph record. There has been a very strong demand during the year for Sound Equipment Number 3. All of such equipment is manufactured for America and assembled at the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The portable phonograph is proving a great aid and blessing in the proclamation of the Kingdom message. During the year the Society has manufactured many phonographs of lighter weight and splendid tone which enable the field workers to carry the machine with them with a number of records as they go from house to house and to produce a clear speech. The phonograph affords an entry into many homes that otherwise could not be reached. The clergy have prejudiced many persons against the Society’s publications by misrepresenting them. Now when those very same truths are presented to prejudiced persons by means of the phonograph such persons, being reasonable, readily see that the clergy have hoodwinked them by lying about the Society’s publications and that they have thus lied in order to prevent the people from learning the truth. Such persons, after hearing a short address reproduced on the phonograph, readily avail themselves of the opportunity to get a supply of the books and booklets. During the fiscal year more than 1400 light phonographs have been furnished and delivered to those who use them. The demand now is greater than can be readily supplied. Many orders are on hand unfilled by reason of inability to manufacture them fast enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of Jehovah’s witnesses loan a phonograph and a few records to families for a few days upon the promise that the same will be used at least twice per day. This practice has resulted in much good. Those who are interested, and who do use the phonograph, are enabled to invite their neighbors to their homes and together hear the Kingdom message. A reasonable and forcible speech, fully supported by the Bible authority, breaks down the blind prejudice which the clergy have caused among the people. In this way the good work goes grandly forward.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>RECORDINGS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The short speech of four and one-half minutes is recorded and produced in the same manner that the sixteen-inch disc is made. Necessarily the speech must be abbreviated and the more important points included in the speech, but this calls attention of the persons interested directly to the point and enables them to find out how they can further pursue their studies by availing themselves of the literature. A few appropriate songs have also been recorded that are available for use at gatherings or meetings where Bible instruction is had. During the year the Society has made available for this purpose sixty different phonograph records and twenty-four songs and has delivered to the workers records to the number of 52,752. In addition thereto the Society has produced and delivered to the users the large sixteen-inch dises, which are used on the portable transcription machines and the radio, to the total number of 5,038. These records are now furnished by the Brooklyn office in English, Spanish and Afrikaans (Dutch). In other countries records are produced in the various languages.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>PUBLICATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A force of approximately 200 persons is kept and maintained constantly at the Brooklyn Bethel home in order to do the necessary work at the home and the office and factory. This work is done in order to keep others in the field supplied with literature and other means of preaching the gospel. The publishers are those who go from house to house in obedience to the Lord’s commandments and acquaint the people with the Kingdom message. They carry with them their sound equipment and literature. Each one carries a small card on which is printed a brief testimony concerning the Kingdom message, and therefore it is necessary to do very little talking. A few appropriate words together with the testimony have proved far more effective than extended speech. The business of the King, and the proclaiming of the gospel of his kingdom, requires haste, and there is no time for long visits and extended conversation, and those who are diligent in the Lord’s service avoid such. The purpose is to afford those persons of good will toward God the opportunity of learning the way of salvation and life and the proper way to worship the Almighty God. The publishers are divided into groups and are designated as pioneers, auxiliaries and company publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The main office at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, directs specifically the work in the United States and 26 small countries or provinces outside of the United States. During the fiscal year there has been a greater witness work done in this area of the earth than at any other previous time. That office also has general supervision of the work throughout the earth. Each country that has and maintains a local office is under the immediate direction of the Society’s representative there, which representative makes a detailed report every thirty days to the president of the Society. The office and factory at Adams street also makes a monthly report to the president. These reports must contain and do contain a statement of all money received and expended, an itemized list of all purchases made for the Society’s work, and literature and other things produced for preaching the gospel. All these reports must be carefully checked and examined by the president, and this entails, as one might well believe, a volume of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While this annual report embraces the work done in every country on earth during the year, under the direction of the Society’s executive, the report is divided under subheads which relate to the various countries, in order that the work may be better understood and appreciated. The Adams Street office and factory are in the same class with all the other offices and depots on earth, and all under the direction and supervision of the executive. These monthly reports from each office or factory on earth include also the amount of money on account with various banks, as well as an inventory of the stock on hand in all the countries. The Year </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Book</span><span class="font4"> is prepared annually by the president, based upon reports of the various offices which come to his desk, and which must be examined and passed upon by him. To be sure, every person in the organization has his or her assigned duty, which must be faithfully performed. In no other way could the organization function properly and in harmony with the Lord’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The foregoing reports from the various parts of the field embraced under the subhead “America” show that the number of booklets placed with the people during the year has been less than in the year previous and that the clothbound books have been more. It therefore may well be said that there has been a larger witness than in the previous year, although the total number of large books and small books is somewhat less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The testimony given by sound equipment has been far greater than that of the previous year, and a great amount of publication has been done in connection with the circulation of certain petitions. The net result shows an ever increasing number of persons of Sood will who hear the truth and who then quickly join with others in the publication of the Kingdom message as commanded by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneer : This branch of the work is beset by many difficulties and hindrances, but the blessings received and the result obtained in the joy of the Lord make up for all the handicaps and hardships. At a money sacrifice to themselves the pioneers go forward in the work. They must of necessity exist in a very frugal way and be denied many of the comforts that are often enjoyed in the home. They, like the faithful apostles and disciples of Jesus Christ in the early days, go from place to place preaching the gospel. This is strictly in accordance with the command of the Lord. They go with light equipment, call upon the people at their homes and tell them of the Kingdom, and comfort those who desire to receive consolation. They are often met at the doors with rebuffs and harsh words and sometimes with blows. They are reproached by extreme religionists, and denounced as the offscourings of mankind, even as Jesus and his apostles were also ill-treated. In this they find great consolation in the words uttered by the apostle Paul, who rejoiced in sufferings, and who said: “Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church.”—Col. 1:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sufferings of Christ and his faithful followers are not physical suffering, but result from hearing the name of Jehovah constantly defamed and themselves made of no reputation, despised, rejected, and pushed aside because they are faithfully proclaiming the name and the kingdom of Almighty God. It is such reproach and sufferings that pioneers, as well as other faithful Christians, share in. They do rejoice in the privilege of being counted worthy to thus suffer as Christ Jesus suffered, and which suffering is made available for them in order that they, under very adverse conditions, may prove their own integrity</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">toward God and prove Satan a liar. Withal, the pioneers are a joyful company. They go into every available part of the land, the isolated as well as the thickly populated, and as they go they hold high the Lord’s banner of truth and thereby advertise the King and his glorious kingdom now just at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The joy of the pioneers is greatly enhanced when they are received by those persons of good will toward God. Such kind ones are those whom the Lord designates as his “other sheep”. These kind ones minister to the physical needs of the pioneers to the extent of their ability. The evidence daily increases showing the division amongst the peoples into the two classes, “goats” and “sheep”. The “other sheep” class do good unto the pioneers, and the Lord counts it as done unto himself. The greater joy comes to the pioneers, however, when those of good will see and appreciate the Kingdom message and participate in proclaiming it. Often the pioneers and Jonadabs have a feast together talking over the precious things in the Scriptures and recounting the many blessings that flow from Jehovah and Christ Jesus to those who love and serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneers are not in the field for any pecuniary profit. Often they find themselves in straits, without money, scarce of food, having expended their little savings. Some of them find it necessary to go back to “tent making” as did the apostle Paul. Many of these dear souls have trudged along for years carrying Jehovah’s message to the people, and their declining days are filled with increasing joy as they have the evidence from God’s Word and the fulfillment of his prophecies that they are pleasing to him. Constantly the Lord is unfolding to them and to other Christians the meaning of his prophecies showing that very soon now the righteous Ruler, Christ Jesus, shall completely sweep away the refuge of lies and open clearly to the vision of all creation God’s gracious and wonderful provision for them. Never has there been a company of people on earth that have been subjected to so many indignities and caused to endure such suffering and ill-treatment and vile epithets hurled at them by the enemy, and at the same time have enjoyed such marvelous privileges and blessings, as that little company known in the earth as pioneers for Christ’s kingdom. Certainly these faithful pioneers are dear to the heart of Jehovah and his great King, Christ Jesus; and, continuing faithfully a little while longer, it is also certain that they will enter the abundance of the blessings which Jehovah has in reserve for those who love and serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the fiscal year the pioneers operating under the direction of Brooklyn number a total of 1,831, and the number of hours in the field service by them was greater than in any previous year. They put in the hands of the people more than five million copies of books and booklets, as will be seen by reference to the chart of field service. The increased number of clothbound books numbers upward of 70,000 more than the previous year. They doubtless would have accomplished much more had all the time been devoted to presenting the literature. Much of the time of the pioneers has been occupied in carrying about petitions and obtaining signatures, which has also served to advertise the King and the Kingdom. Their record through the fiscal year has been a splendid one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Auxiliaries: Those in the auxiliary work are the ones that are unable to devote all their time to the field service. They, too, have done a splendid work. The number in this company has been less than for the year previous. Some who were once in this branch of the work have joined the pioneer company, while others work with local company publishers. The result of their activities is seen by reference to the chart following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Company publishers: These are the persons who reside at a given place of residence who are required to keep the home and earn the bread for themselves </span><span class="font4">and dependent ones, and who devote what time is available to the service in their respective communities. Often these companies join together in a special campaign put on at some specific place. The reports show a healthy increase in the number of these publishers for the year and that they have collectively put in 140,000 hours in the field service, exhibiting and distributing the literature. They have called upon millions of persons at their homes, delivering the testimony and obtaining signatures to petitions, which constitutes a wide witness to the Kingdom and King. Each company has its own organization, including a company servant appointed by the Society, and other servants selected by the members of the company. Regular service meetings are held for the purpose of bettering the service organization and making it more efficient and effective. The company is organized into certain groups, and each group is assigned a specific territory within which to visit the people and present to them the literature. The afternoons on Saturdays and the forenoons on Sundays are especially devoted to this field service. In the afternoon on Sunday the company assembles at some central point for study of Jehovah’s Word and praise to his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In cities like Greater New York the company publishers are divided into groups, and each group assigned to a certain specific territory within the borders of the city. Each group has a captain with assigned duties and who leads them into the field and does other necessary service to perfect their local organization. All of these groups work together under the direction of the company servant. At regular intervals there is a general assembly of all the members of the company, at which assembly reports are submitted and methods are discussed looking to the betterment of the work. This manner of organization and its work have been greatly blessed by the Lord. Each group has its regular Bible study meeting, at which meeting </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> or other publication of the Society is used to enable those present to get a better understanding and appreciation of Jehovah’s purposes. A regular leader is assigned to direct this study, and where the study is conducted in a proper manner a great amount of good results to those who participate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses, like the true Christians, their brethren, in the earlier days, do not build houses and call them “church buildings”, but they secure meeting places where they can assemble together to study God’s Word and to organize and harmoniously carry forward their assigned work. Occasionally, sad to say, there is a company where the study leader is more highly impressed with his own ability and worth than he should be. Such one forgets the admonition of the apostle Paul “not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith”. (Rom. 12:3) A study leader should never attempt to make himself shine in the eyes of other persons, because by so doing he becomes a man-pleaser and therefore displeases God. The business of such a study leader is to keep order, keep the subject matter of the study clearly before the company, and endeavor to aid all present to more clearly understand the subject that is being studied. This is done by having appropriate questions propounded and properly considered and the text in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> or book read in support thereof. Where a company is composed of a large number it is well for a few appropriate questions to be prepared in advance and then at the study let such questions as strictly pertain to the subject matter of the article or book studied be discussed and considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who are wholly devoted to God are learning and highly appreciating the fact that the remnant and the Jonadabs are the ones on earth who are really showing forth the praises of Jehovah. Instead of feeling puffed up by reason thereof, all of these are endeavoring to walk obediently with the Lord as he has directed. The Jonadabs participate in the company study because it is their privilege so to do, and it is the privilege and duty of the remnant to aid the Jonadabs in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the first part of the year the distribution of the Kingdom literature by these publishers exceeded that of the previous year. During the latter months the distribution was not so great, due, without doubt, to the fact that much of the time was employed in circulating petitions. Again, the operation of the sound equipment requires much time in the service, and many workers. All this, however, is a part of the publishing work done under the commandment of the Lord. A summary of the publication of the Kingdom gospel appears from the chart or report below, prepared by the office at 117 Adams street.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>BETHEL FAMILY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">As the number of publishers in the field has increased in the area of Greater New York, it was deemed necessary for the Bethel family to have its own separate organization, by which it functions in full accord with other groups of the New York company. This arrangement has proved a great blessing to the members of the family in the field service. Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings and certain evenings the members of the family devote to the field service. This is not compulsory, but if one fails or neglects to perform a part of this service he misses a great blessing and soon sees the effect of it. The result is that during the fiscal year there has been an increased output of literature as follows: Bound books increased 94 percent; booklets increased 24 percent; hours in the service increased 45 percent; and in sound-equipment activities an increase of almost 150 percent over the previous year. The family is fully united and harmoniously working together. The following is a brief summary of the publication work done by the Bethel family:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The ordination of ministers of the gospel is performed by the Lord. He is the one who gives authority to preach his Word, and the commission and ordination of each one is stated by the Lord in these words: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.” —Isa. 61:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Everyone who is fully devoted to the Lord, spirit-begotten and anointed, comes within this divine ordination, and this is supreme and above all ordination that can be given by men. The Society recognizes as ordained ministers certain qualified men who show they have the spiritual qualifications, as set forth in the Scriptures, and these are sent out with authority from the Society to represent it; and those who are thus authorized to act are as follows, to wit:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">At stated times the Society holds conventions of those who love and serve Jehovah God. In February, 1936, there was held a most unique and enthusiastic convention of God’s people. The key convention was at Los Angeles, California, while at the same time many others of God’s people assembled in halls in various cities in America, Europe, Asia and Africa and the isles of the sea. The president of the Society spoke to those assembled at convention in Los Angeles, and the oral message thus delivered was transmitted by wire and wireless equipment to the other assemblies throughout the earth. That indeed was a great feast, which thrilled and made glad each heart of those permitted to attend and hear. Within a short period of time following the lecture above mentioned messages were received by cable and wireless from more than 35 different nations, these being flashed to the convention assembled at Los Angeles and read for the benefit of all. For instance, conventions assembled in 57 different places in Great Britain sent messages of greeting to California, and immediately heard their own message radioed back. Doubtless this never came to pass before. At that convention the Lord was pleased to disclose an understanding and showed a fulfillment of his great prophecy relating to the feast of ingathering. The remnant and the Jonadabs feasted together. It was indeed a convention on a large scale and may well be counted as many conventions. Other conventions were held during the year, which will appear in other parts of this report.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>RADIO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to the publication of Jehovah’s message advertising the King and the Kingdom, as above set out, the radio has been largely employed. Radio programs carrying the Kingdom message are produced by certain broadcasting stations regularly each week. During the year there were two extensive radio chain broadcasts, which radio chains broadcast the lectures delivered by the president of the Society. One of these was on October 6, 1936, concerning flag saluting. The other was the lecture delivered at the convention above mentioned on February 23,1936, on the subject “Separating the Nations”; and also the “Feast of Tabernacles”. These lectures were delivered at Los Angeles before a large and appreciative visible audience, and transmitted by 122 radio stations and other electrical means to most of the nations throughout the earth. Simultaneously with the delivery of the lecture ‘ ‘ Separating the Nations” it was recorded and thereafter was reproduced and broadcast by many other radio stations. Without a doubt the public lecture delivered on February 23 and broadcast, as above mentioned, covered a greater area than any other broadcast ever sent throughout the earth. All the praise is to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">The radio lectures have resulted in greatly increased interest to the awakening of the Jonadabs, who will form the great multitude, and there has been a largely increased inquiry by persons throughout the earth asking for more literature. At the same time the radio lectures have increased the venom and hatred of the religionists and show the line of battle more sharply drawn between the Lord of righteousness and Satan the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That old Dragon, the Devil, and his visible agents are greatly enraged by reason of the increased proclamation of the truth. The lecture “Separating the Nations”, broadcast throughout the earth, angered the enemy so greatly that these religionists, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, began to act more viciously than ever and to undertake more drastic action. Because the radio stations in various parts continued to broadcast the Watch Tower programs, particularly the lectures of the president of the Society, those religionists have threatened to destroy radio stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Against other radio stations the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has employed boycott and threats to coerce the stations into obedience to its will. A high official of the Hierarchy, together with his other assistants, served notice upon radio station WIP of Philadelphia that that station ‘must cease broadcasting Rutherford’s lectures ’. The station, put in fear of loss of something dearer to the owners than the truth, yielded to the Hierarchy’s demands. Then the listeners to that station, to the number of 128,413, signed a petition requesting the Rutherford lectures to be restored. To this date the station has not yielded to the request of these listeners. The question, therefore, may be properly raised before the Federal Communications Commission as to whether or not this station is broadcasting in accordance with the law, which requires the public to be served by that which is of public interest, public convenience and public necessity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Roman Catholic official element above mentioned, in a written statement and published in its press as well as otherwise, charged that the speeches broadcast by Rutherford ‘misrepresent the teachings of the Catholic church organization, and foment religious hatred and bigotry’. That statement, published, being so glaringly false and malicious, it was deemed necessary to institute in the courts damage suits against those members of the Hierarchy for libel. This will afford opportunity to prove that said Hierarchy officials have deliberately lied for the purpose of defending their own improper position, and to deceive honest persons of the “Catholic population’’, and others; and to prevent them from hearing the truth. Probably the cases will not be fairly tried if they come to trial; however, we trust in the Lord to use this as another means of advertising the truth and his kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>COST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The smile of approval of Jehovah and his King has been upon the publishers and the message published concerning the Kingdom as the year drew on. Great have been the blessings of those who are privileged to have a part in the publishing service. This is the true method of worshiping Almighty God as he has commanded, and this true worship is what angers the enemy and causes such opposition to the worshipers. The cost of the publication work has been very great as compared with the ability of those who have participated to pay. Many of the publishers pay out money for expenses in connection with the publishing work, which is not reported. The cost of the publications and the publishing work reported during the year has been far in excess of the amount of money received by contributions for literature. This of itself is conclusive proof to all honest persons that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is not in any manner or by any means commercial. What they do is not in competition commercially with anything else done on earth. The small contributions of money taken for the literature are not used for private gain, but are used toward the publication of more literature that the people may have the message concerning God and his kingdom at the least possible cost to them. Many of the poor are furnished the literature free of charge. Never in the history of the world have books and booklets been distributed to the people at such a nominal cost as those which the Society distributes. The purpose is to give the testimony to the name of Jcho-yah, and Jehovah affords the opportunity to those who love him to have some part in bearing the money burden. Not one penny of this is contributed by any political organization. Everyone who is not a Catholic the Hierarchy denounces as a Communist or a “ Red ’ Those who support this Society in the publication and distribution of the Kingdom message have no interest at all in the politics of this world. Their sole purpose is to obey the Lord’s commandments, and it is only these who desire to serve the Lord that bear the money burden for the publication. The deficit in the funds for the year will be met, without doubt, by those who love to serve Jehovah. Almost all of these are poor so far as money or worldly goods go, but they are rich in faith and love. The remnant and Jonadabs appreciate their privilege of showing their love for God and his kingdom and those of good will towards Jehovah, by making contributions in whatever amount they are able to contribute, that the work may be carried on to the Lord’s glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The enemy seems to be greatly worried about how Jehovah’s witnesses can obtain the-money to carry on their work. That does not worry Jehovah’s witnesses, however. They well know that all the wealth of the earth belongs to Jehovah, and it is certain that Jehovah does not permit his work to suffer because of the scarcity of money. In his own good way the Lord will provide, and those who love him are fully trusting in the goodness and loving-kindness of our God to provide for his own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a further testimony that Jehovah’s witnesses and Jonadabs are devoted zealously to the Lord’s work in obedience to his commandments a Declaration unanimously adopted at a convention in Newark, New Jersey, held immediately following the end of the fiscal year, is here inserted.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>DECLARATION AND WARNING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">This company of Christian people, assembled in convention at Newark, New Jersey, give thanks to Almighty God, whose </span><span class="font3">name alone is Jehovah, for the privilege of serving Him and His kingdom. We declare as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Because we have devoted ourselves to the service of Jehovah God and His kingdom under Christ, we, by His favor and appointment, are witnesses for Jehovah.—Isaiah 43:10-12; 61:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The law of Jehovah God is supreme, and should be obeyed by all persons, and must be obeyed by those persons who have covenanted to do His will. When the law of man is in conflict with God’s law we must and will obey God’s law rather than man’s law. In obedience to God’s law, as set forth in Ezekiel 33 and other prophecies of the Scriptures, we sound His warning that God will destroy all who willfully violate His law and who oppose His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The kingdom of God under Christ is at hand, and as Christians and servants of Jehovah we declare our unqualified allegiance to Him and His kingdom. The time for the execution of Jehovah’s judgments draws nigh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan is man’s worst enemy, and by means of fraud and deceit Satan is attempting to turn all the people against God and thereby bring about their destruction. Satan employs religion to deceive persons who are sincere. Keligion is a form of worship based upon the traditions of men. Christianity is the true worship of Almighty God by serving Him in obedience to His commandments. There are many religions. There is but one Christianity. A knowledge of the teachings of the Bible is therefore of vital importance to all who will gain everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In fulfillment of Jehovah’s prophecy there has arisen in the earth a powerful religious organization which is wrongfully called a ‘' Christian ’ ’ organization. That organization is not only religious, but also political and commercial, and is Satan’s chief visible instrument employed and used to rule the world and to keep the people in ignorance and in subjection to selfish men. That religious organization designates itself as the “Hierarchy of the Catholic Church” and names the millions of sincere persons who are supporters of that organization as the “Catholic population”, but which persons are not members of the Catholic Church. The Hierarchy is composed of a few men, the controlling number of whom are citizens of Italy, but who rule the masses of sincere persons called the * ‘ Catholic population ’ ’ who reside in every part of the earth. The “Hierarchy” is against God and His kingdom under Christ, and at the same time claims the right to rule the world in the name of Christ, thereby deceiving multitudes of good persons who are sincere supporters of the Catholic Church. Those who compose the Catholic Church are the men of the Hierarchy, and other priests, some of which priests are unduly favored, while many other priests are mere menial servants of the Hierarchy and compelled to do the bidding of the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures declare that all persons who by any means oppose Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are wicked and that in due time ‘all the wicked God will destroy’.—Psalm 145: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We call all the sincere people of the earth, including Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Gentiles, to witness that in Germany the true worshipers of Almighty God are cruelly and fiendishly persecuted, and many of them killed, and that such persecution is done by religionists who have forgotten God and who follow the teachings of men. It is well known and generally conceded that the Hitler government and the Hierarchy, that rules the Catholic population, are in full accord. Furthermore we call all good persons to witness that within New Jersey religionists, led by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, have indulged in and continue to indulge in the cruel persecution and punishment of true Christians, merely because such Christians declare the truth of God’s Word and carry God’s message to the people in obedience to Jehovah’s commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We vigorously protest against the cruel persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses by religionists, and we denounce as cruelly wicked the persecution of all persons because of their faith or belief. Regardless of all persecution we will continue to serve Jehovah God, relying upon His promise that in due time He will duly recompense the wicked by completely destroying them. Jesus Christ, as Jehovah’s chief officer, says to those who persecute His followers: ‘Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. . . . Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his messengers. These shall go into everlasting destruction. ’—Matthew 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The indisputable facts show that the world’s greatest tribulation is at the door and that there is only one way of escape. In obedience to Jehovah’s commandment we warn all persons, without regard to religion, race or color, that their only hope is in the kingdom of God under Christ. All who would live must take their stand firmly on the side of Jehovah God and His King, Christ Jesus, and give heed to the words of Jehovah, to wit: ‘Behold my servant [Christ Jesus]; He shall judge the nations, and in His name shall the nations hope.’ (Matthew 12:18-21) Therefore the people are warned that they must no longer rely upon and give support to religionists, but that they must rely upon Jehovah God’s commandments and must find protection and salvation only by and through the kingdom of God under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have no desire to influence the political affairs of this world, but in obedience to God’s commandment we must sound His warning, that the people may be informed and may intelligently choose whom they will serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We send loving greetings to our persecuted brethren and bid them be of good courage and to remember the words of our Lord: “Shall not God avenge his own elect? . . . He will avenge them speedily” (Luke 18:7,8); and, further, to give heed to the words of the Lord Jesus addressed to His faithful servants: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.” Blessed is the lot of those who are permitted to endure all manner of suffering for the sake of the name of Jehovah and His kingdom under Christ. (Matthew 5: 10-12) The everlasting peace, joy and life of the people is centered in the great Prince of Peace, whose government is at the door and which will be administered in full righteousness and to the good of all obedient ones.—Isaiah 9: 6, 7; 32: 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Resolved, That a copy of this Declaration and Warning be published throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Dated October 18, 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“THE WATCHTOWER”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font4"> is issued twice each month and brings to its readers the current report which the Lord, in the exercise of his loving-kindness, manifests in the unfolding of his prophecies to those who are devoted to him. Christ Jesus at the temple has gathered his anointed followers to himself. The light from Jehovah shines into the face of Christ Jesus and is reflected to those of the temple company. These are thus enlightened and instructed by their Teachers, Jehovah and Christ Jesus, who are not pushed into a corner, but now these Teachers are clearly seen and appreciated by those who are the real followers of Christ Jesus. (Isa. fjO: 20) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> being the means the Lord is pleased to use to transmit his message of truth to the people, it is a real comfort to the remnant and to the “other sheep” of the Lord to have this given to them regularly twice each month. Together they feast upon its contents, and together, in obedience to God’s will and commandment, they join in proclaiming the truth to those who have the hearing ear. (Rev. 22:17) The list of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower </span><span class="font4">readers has greatly increased during the year 1936. It is printed and sent forth from the Brooklyn office in twelve different languages, and in other countries it is published in still other languages. This shows that those who really love the Lord are on the increase. The Jonadabs are appreciating the fact that all their food comes from the Lord to enable them to grow strong in his organization. Every Jonadab should read </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> as well as the other literature of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;THE GOLDEN AGE”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> carries information that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is unable to publish. It is a great source of enlightenment to the honest and sincere people, and at the same time is a real stinging thorn to the enemies of God and his kingdom. It fearlessly publishes the truth. Its contents speak eloquently to all those who have a desire to see righteousness prevail in the earth, and a government over which the Devil can have no power or influence. A part of its mission is to make known to the people the crooked and malicious methods employed by the Devil and his agents to turn the people away from Jehovah God. Steadily its subscription list has increased during the year, and ever increasingly come the letters of appreciation from those who love righteousness and hate iniquity, stating that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> is a welcome visitor to their homes. The Lord has clearly demonstrated that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font4">has its mission and it is fulfilling that mission to the praise of Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>AFRICA (South, Central and East)</span></h2>
<p><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font4">For many centuries the practice of the religious organization, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, has been to send the Jesuits into the remote parts of the earth to build up and strengthen their organization. By this means they get the credulous people under their control, frighten them into submission, collect all the revenue possible, and feather their own nest and increase their power at Vatican City. These men always pose as great reformers and blazers of the way of Christianity. In fact they are not Christians at all, but are religionists prosecuting their work of building up a selfish organization. To be sure, they bring into their organization some sincere men and they hoodwink many sincere men and women, which they make a part of the “Catholic population”, which population supports the organization and bears the burden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the dark places in which this organization has put forth its effort has been that of Africa.- The natives are a simple and gullible people, not acquainted with diplomacy and chicanery, but earnestly desire to be led in the right way. They have therefore been easy victims of the Hierarchy. In Jehovah’s due time he sent his witnesses into Africa to bring to that people the message of his kingdom. Many began to hear and to appreciate the Kingdom message. This greatly enraged the religionists, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and again they employed subtlety, coercion and falsehoods to break down the Kingdom message and turn the people away from God’s kingdom and into the organization over which the Devil presides. For some time now this Society has maintained a local office at Cape Town, South Africa, which has carried on the work of the Society in South, Central, and East Africa. In face of a cruel and malicious opposition the Kingdom work has gone forward and Jehovah has greatly blessed the honest and zealous workers in the field and enlightened the honest and sincere persons of good will. During the fiscal year ended recently the Kingdom message has had a wider distribution in this territory than it has heretofore. Those in the truth are somewhat acquainted with the efforts of the Hierarchy in Northern and in Southern Rhodesia to maliciously misrepresent the Society and its workers and to induce the legislative bodies to enact laws which could be used for the purpose of suppressing the truth. Jehovah’s witnesses in those countries have put up a strenuous fight against this opposition. The unrighteous action of the Hierarchy not only has afforded a better opportunity for the witness work, but has so opened the eyes of sincere persons in that land that many more have turned to the truth. Those who love the Lord may be assured that he is not going to permit the enemy to defeat his purpose in having the witness given to the peoples who desire to hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Hierarchy has induced the public officials and the courts in Northern and in Southern Rhodesia to act adversely to Jehovah’s witnesses in the proclamation of the truth. An application is now made to the highest court of Great Britain at London to review this matter in harmony with its fundamental law and to cause to be reversed the policy that is now in progress in Africa. With what success this will meet is, of course, problematical. Whatsoever is the will of the Lord will come to pass. He is maneuvering the enemy’s forces, as well as his own, preparatory for the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Even though a prohibition has been issued against the publications of the Society a depot is still maintained in the territory, where the opposition is strongly manifested, and the work goes forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society’s local representative has so well covered the situation in his report to this office that it is deemed advisable to here insert a portion of his report as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There has been a healthy increase in the work of the Kingdom in the above territories during the past year. Very considerable opposition has been encountered in certain parts of the field, and in several countries outside the Union of South Africa a determined but unsuccessful effort was made to crush the work entirely. In the face of this opposition Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions have stood shoulder to shoulder fighting for the good news of the Kingdom. The Lord has blessed the witness and given the increase. During the year just ended there has been a total distribution of 69,607 bound volumes and 344,239 booklets, or a total of 413,846 books and booklets, to compare with 59,243 volumes and 316,038 booklets, or a total of 375,281, last year. The total increase this year is therefore 10,364 volumes and 28,201 booklets, or a total of 38,565 books and booklets. In addition to the books, 70,000 copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age </span><span class="font3">No. 425 were distributed. The literature spread was in twenty different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">House-to-House Witness Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The greater part of the Union, Southwest Africa and the Protectorates has been served during the year, some parts of the territory on more than one occasion. Freedom to worship God according to the dictates of one’s conscience is enjoyed by all in the Union of South Africa, and under these favorable conditions the work of spreading the good news of God’s kingdom has gone steadily forward. A considerable number of persons of good will toward Jehovah have manifested themselves during the past year, with the result that there has been an increase in the number of publishers and a corresponding increase in the placement of literature. The pioneers have again been in the forefront of the battle, and the Lord has richly blessed their efforts. Although fever and other sickness has seriously affected the time of some of the pioneers (one of our young pioneers has just finished his earthly course following upon a severe attack of fever), the outstanding zeal of others has enabled the little band to average 107 hours per month throughout the year. Of course, many hours were spent with the sound equipment, which time is not reflected in that figure. There is opportunity for additional pioneers in this country, and we hope that the recent clarion call from headquarters will enable some others to see their privilege in this connection. In recent months the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> and the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Loyalty </span><span class="font3">have had a wide distribution. No other book yet published by the Society has been so enthusiastically received by those desiring to acquire the “riches that endure’’. One company servant reports six </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> studies as having been commenced in company territory in the short space of one month, and it is already apparent that this book will be greatly used by the Lord to liberate the “prisoners” and help them to take a definite stand on Jehovah’s side. The special campaigns brought a special blessing to all who made a special effort to bear the fruits of the Kingdom to the people. Forty percent of the literature placed in the house-to-house work went out during the six special periods, and the total distribution was considerably greater than in the corresponding periods of last year. We are hoping that some of the company publishers and Jona-dabs who thus far have shared in the work only during the campaign periods will make the necessary effort to have a regular share in the work throughout the year. A more consistent effort week by week on the part of all would result in a much greater witness’ being given. Much time was spent by publishers in this country distributing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> No. 425, and their wholehearted and enthusiastic co-operation in the work and expense entailed in the special witness to the Rhode-sias was one of the outstanding features of the year’s work. The figures for the house-to-house witness in the Union of South Africa follow:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The arrival of Sound Equipment No. 3 gave a great impetus to the work with the sound machines. The pioneers in particular have found the sound car a big help in breaking down prejudice and arousing a real lively interest in the Kingdom message. Those who have made the best use of the equipment have had the best results in the witness work. Several of the pioneers report that approximately 50 percent of their placements are with people whose first contact with the message has been listening to a recorded talk. Much more work could be done with the phonograph and the 4J-minute records than has been done, and we feel confident that the announcement of a new and lighter phonograph will solve what to some has been an insurmountable difficulty. The phonograph is a provision of the Lord, and the witness with it is the ideal arrangement for consolidating the interest of new contacts; and when this fact is appreciated by all, then surely every publisher will have a phonograph and supply of records. The arrival of Afrikaans phonograph records has brought great joy to the publishers, and a more effective witness is now possible in the country districts. The Song records too are an inspiration to all who hear them. It is most encouraging to hear the quartet sing “Take Sides with Jehovah’’ while the same message is being proclaimed on the door step. It gives pleasuro to report a substantial increase in this part of the work as the figures submitted herewith indicate:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Machine</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The broadcasting stations in this country continue to broadcast almost everything and anything apart from the message of God’s kingdom. Accordingly a big effort was made both at London and at Cape Town to arrange for Brother Eutherford’s speech on “Separating the Nations’’ at Los Angeles, February 23, to be brought to this country by radio beam, thence by land lines to listening locations throughout the land. The Post Office, however, refused to oblige, although assured that the Society was willing to pay the bill even though only partial success was attained. The official “excuse” given at London was “technical difficulties”; but at this end we were frankly informed that “the channels in this country are limited and the policy of the department is to reserve the lines for matters of wide national importance”. In a personal interview the P.M.G. refused to see that this speech, which was of and concerning the kingdom of God and which was broadcast to all continents, was not merely of national but of international importance. The telephone lines are there for the convenience of the public, but one section of the public may not use them even though willing to pay for the service! The handbill announcing the broadcast and which set forth the facts concerning this unfair discrimination against Jehovah’s witnesses was widely distributed in this and neighboring countries. In spite of this effort to suppress the truth the lecture was heard clearly in many parts of the Union, Bhodesia and Portuguese East Africa, being received direct from several shortwave stations, and the listeners were greatly thrilled. By means of the transcription discs it is now being heard in every corner of the country, and in several months it will be read in every part of the land, too I Meanwhile post office and broadcasting receipts in this country are less than they might have been if a more sensible and just policy were followed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Conventions and Divisional Campaigns</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Several conventions and a number of divisional campaigns have been arranged at intervals throughout the year. Publishers have been greatly blessed by attending these assemblies and sharing in the witness work. Enthusiasm reached a peak at the Johannesburg convention, when 120 publishers placed 900 volumes and 2,000 booklets. Thirteen sound cars were in action at this rally, and 6,000 persons heard the Kingdom message by means of the sound equipment during the week-end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Postal Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some parts of this vast continent are very sparsely populated and a number of publishers who live in comparative isolation find it impossible to have a regular share week by week in the house-to-house witness work. Such, however, appreciate the fact that there are thousands of farmers and others who are similarly situated and that it is possible to have a regular share in the work by posting so many booklets each week. A very considerable number of booklets have again been distributed in that way and we have many inquiries at the office for more literature from grateful recipients. During the past year 9,520 volumes and 45,124 booklets (13 percent of the total distribution) have been placed with the public direct from the Cape Town office by mail, and quite a bit of that literature placement is the immediate result of the postal effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Nyasaland</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are now 41 companies in that part of central Africa. During the year there has been a monthly average of 538 publishers. The total time spent in publishing the good news of the Kingdom has been 77,528 hours, and there have been 15,396 obtainers of literature. Bound volumes placed numbered 1,888, and booklets, 13,740. The greater part of the literature placed has been in the Chinyanja language. Two phonographs have done much useful work. A regional servant has taken one of the phonographs with him when visiting the companies. The lectures are first put over in English and then summarized by the regional servant in the Chinyanja language, following which questions and discussion take place in the usual manner. Machine service hours numbered 130, and the total attendance was 21,851. Much good educational work has been accomplished, and as the banner of truth is kept on high many in that land are being brought to a knowledge of the fact that in the Kingdom lies their sole hope of salvation, and such are gladly taking their stand on Jehovah’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Northern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font3">very thorough witness has been given in that country during the past twelve months. There can now be no Europeans there who have not heard of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and Jehovah’s witnesses, and if any of them are not yet convinced that Jehovah’s witnesses were not implicated in nor in any way responsible either directly or indirectly for the copper-belt rioting it is certainly not the fault of the Society nor of the witnesses. The malicious effort on the part of the Commission of Enquiry to attach some blame to the Society by stating that the spread of the literature was “a predisposing cause” has been dealt with at length in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> No. 425 and that wicked lie has been fully exposed. All the facts show that a dastardly plot to crush the Lord’s work had been hatched out even before the rioting took place. The Catholic attorney general in the early part of May, 1935, piloted legislation through the Legislative Council giving the Governor in Council power to prohibit the importation of any book or pamphlet into the country without assigning any reason for so doing. The debate as reported in the Official Report No. 24 makes it clear that it was the literature containing the message of God’s kingdom that was under discussion. Several of the elected members raised their voices in protest at such un-British and autocratic legislation, but they were assured that the intention was ‘ ‘ to stop certain </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">seditious</span><span class="font3"> literature coining from outside ’ ’ and that “it is impossible that the Governor in Council is going to declare an ordinary newspaper, which we know would be tolerated in England, to be a seditious publication. He dare not do it”. And yet when the Commission published its report six months later tho majority of the Society’s publications which are freely read in England and all parts of the British Empire were promptly banned and an invitation previously extended to send a European representative to establish a depot held in abeyance. There followed a protest to the British Colonial Office, the outcome of which was that the Colonial Secretary decided that the Society’s desire to open a depot, and which had been communicated to the government of Northern Rhodesia on several occasions in recent years, should be granted, and this is now an accomplished fact. Meanwhile a vigorous campaign was carried on in the country. As soon as the Commission’s report was published a letter of protest and copies of the booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span><span class="font3"> found their way into the hands of every European in Northern Rhodesia. Several months later copies of your own dignified protest to the Commission and other relevant matter was distributed in the same thorough manner; and as the Commission’s false charge had been widely spread by the press in neighboring countries, the necessary steps were taken to have the people correctly informed. In all, 50,000 copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> No. 425 were distributed in the Union, and 20,000 of a specially titled publication in the Rhodesias. The editor of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Northern Rhodesian Advertiser,</span><span class="font3"> the only newspaper on the copperbelt, animated by the spirit of British fair play and convinced of the justice of our cause, gave much favorable publicity to the Kingdom message, and a special issue, comprising an eightpage sheet setting forth the facts, was widely distributed in Northern Rhodesia. The brethren, although deprived of many of their Bible study helps, have endeavored in all things to commend themselves “as the ministers of God” and have borne a true and faithful witness before “Caesar” and all with whom they have come in contact. The average number of publishers in action each month has increased from 350 to 409. Tho time spent in publishing the Kingdom message amounted to 92,513 hours, and the total literature distributed exclusive of the specially titled publication totaled 23,056 pieces, of which approximately fifty percent went into the hands of Europeans. The legality of the legislation under which some of the publications have been banned has been contested. The case has gone through the courts in Northern Rhodesia, and an application for leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is now pending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Southern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The conspiracy to destroy the work of Jehovah’s witnesses (Ps. 83: 3) lias taken definite shape in Southern Rhodesia during the past year. A very glaring example of ‘ ‘ framing mischief by law ’ ’ will be found in the Official Reports covering the debate on the various readings and committee stage of the Sedition Bill. Your timely warning to the prime minister and all members of the Legislative Assembly was duly served upon these gentlemen several weeks before the debate took place. In addition, 25,000 copies of your letter were printed and a copy was sent to every European whose name appeared in the current issue of the Southern Rhodesia </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Directory.</span><span class="font3"> The Native Preachers Bill was dropped, but, in spite of vigorous opposition, both inside and outside the Legislative Assembly, the government steam-roller majority placed the Sedition Bill (aimed primarily at our literature) on the Statute Book, and this notwithstanding the fact that even members on the government benches declared that we were not in any way responsible for the trouble in Northern Rhodesia. We have reason to believe that the literature is now under close examination, but no prohibition has taken place, and apparently those entrusted with the job are finding it more difficult to find even one seditious statement than they imagined would be the case. Meanwhile, the work of announcing the kingdom of Jehovah God under Christ Jesus goes steadily forward in that land. During the past twelve months there has been an average of 182 publishers each month. These have put in 21,889 hours in Kingdom service, and apart from your letter and the specially titled publication 8,721 books and booklets have been distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">East Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the latter part of 1935 four brethren from the Union visited Tanganyika, Kenya Colony and Uganda. An excellent witness was given in all three territories, and although orders of deportation were served upon the witnesses the work was completed in each country. Over 3,000 volumes and approximately 7,000 booklets were placed and a number of subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> taken. A vigorous protest was made against the deportation orders, but no satisfactory explanation was forthcoming from the authorities. It is not too much to assume, however, that news of the Jesuit plot in Northern Rhodesia had been communicated to these territories and the false charges made against the Society used to influence the minds of those in authority to fear another ‘ ‘ copperbelt riot ’ ’, even although they had no copperbelt or increased tax to cause such a thing. In Portuguese East Africa there are now eighteen publishers having a part in the witness work. The octopus at Vatican City, in its effort to grip the whole globe, has stretched out its tentacles to that part of the African continent also. As the campaign of enlightenment progresses a number of native Portuguese subjects are breaking away from the Catholic churches and taking their stand on Jehovah’s side. A report at hand indicates that government servants love Judge Rutherford’s books and are frequently found reading them at their leisure in their quarters. These men would not harass Jehovah’s witnesses unless compelled to do so. It is reported, too, that missionaries in that country crave to read the books which contain the warning to “Christendom”, and then proceed to conspire with the government to take action against the witnesses. No restrictions have thus far been put upon the work, which continues to make progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Blind</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and other publications in Braille continue to circulate regularly amongst a number of those who although without natural sight have nevertheless a keen appreciation and vision of Jehovah’s purposes. There is an increase of 50 over the number subscribing for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> at this time last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have had another busy and therefore happy year in the office. The brethren here have worked hard, and counted it a great privilege to do so. Letters received numbered 7,391, and there were 7,549 dispatched. Circular letters sent out totaled 6,421, and 6,000 copies of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> were distributed. With a competent printer on the staff now our hand-feed Flatten machine has been kept busier than ever before. In all, 569,200 pieces, comprising handbills, leaflets, testimony cards, office stationery, etc., were run off. We permit nothing to interfere with our regular share in field activity, and the five brethren here have spent 1,191 hours, or an average of five hours each per week throughout the year, in that part of the work. Bound volumes placed numbered 2,251; and booklets, 9,090. The total distribution of 11,341 exceeds the previous year’s figure by 4,725 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In closing this report we desire once again to express our heartfelt gratitude to Jehovah for his sustaining grace and for the bountiful provision of all things needful. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font3">with its never failing supply of “food convenient”, continues to be a source of strength and encouragement. The more and more efficient organization of the work at headquarters gives complete assurance that the Lord himself is directing the work. Your bold and fearless lead is greatly appreciated, and daily we remember you at the throne of heavenly grace and pray that the Lord will bless the direction of the work on earth through you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the foregoing report indicates, the publishers in this part of the field are alive to their privileges. They rejoice to work in complete unity with their brethren in all other parts of the earth. They are conscious of the fact that there is a war on and that it is expected of each one that he be a valiant soldier in the battle for truth, righteousness and the honor of Jehovah’s name against entrenched error, wickedness' and hypocrisy. With the inspiration of victory in our hearts and our battle song on our lips we will fight on, and, by the Lord’s grace, we will not tire, but continue to serve the warning notice and help the multitude until the Lord has released all the prisoners and smitten the enemy to the dust.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>AFRICA (West)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The countries known as Nigeria and the Gold Coast, on the west coast of Africa, are other places invaded by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their traditions, substituted for the Word of God. There they incite the ignorant to make war upon Jehovah’s witnesses and others who are striving to serve Jehovah and worship him in spirit and in truth. This has not deterred the brethren in that land from pushing forward with the work. Handicaped by climatic conditions, opposed by Satan’s representatives, and limited in their numbers, this little company of faithful souls has continued to lift high the banner of Jehovah during the year and proclaim the message of the Kingdom. The Society’s representative at Lagos, Nigeria, in his annual report to this office, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Amidst difficulties and opposition from the Devil’s agents (which is to be expected at this time; Kev. 12: 17) the work progresses. Among the opposers who openly put on their coat of identification and show themselves as Jehovah’s slanderers are those who were once with us but whom the angels of the Lord have gathered out. (Matt. 13:41; Ps. 50:16-23, and 1 John </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font3"> 19) But the more opposition, the more determined are the publishers to press the battle, and the more the work prospers in these parts. We are glad to say the publishers have put in more hours in the field this year and have placed more books and booklets than in the year past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The sound car equipment which you sent to us in January this year, and which we have installed in our car, has assisted greatly, in the output of the booklets especially. And now you have sent us another sound car machine for Nigeria and one for the Gold Coast, making three sound ears for West Africa, and the fourth is expected shortly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the publishers are determined to put in more hours in the coming year and also to triple 1936 output of books and booklets. How grateful we are to the Lord and to you, Brother Rutherford, for the instruments you have provided us with which to carry on the work! Is not this the fulfillment of Psalm 118, especially from verses 25 to 29?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In trekking the towns and villages of these parts, some days we distributed over 1,400 penny booklets. It is a pleasure to enter a village for the first time with the sound car, every one looking with astonishment at the car, and you can hear many saying: “Kingdom Message, Jehovah’s witnesses.” We always inquire for the center of the village, and from there we operate, commencing with a lively song record. You can see the people coming toward the car from all parts. In some places the farmers are almost a mile away from the village, plowing the farms, and on hearing the voice from the records or the microphone they look around and above to see where the voice of God is coming from. Not seeing anyone they rush towards the village, and there they are consoled by seeing the car. During a lecture, either by the record or by the interpreter through the microphone in Yoruba, you can see many clapping their hands gently and nodding the head, as if to say every word is true. After the lecture we announce the books and booklets; then they rush. Some days we were mobbed by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The pioneers have pushed forward the work and gone to the places which had not been previously touched. This year some made a daring dash into the French territories which are dominated by Catholic priests and put out a number of books and booklets in the French language. When the Roman Catholic priests heard about the circulation of our literature in their pastures, they gave orders to their flocks not to take more of our books, for they told the people that they would get mad if they read them. They also ordered that those who had got the books in their possession should burn them. Many of the priest-ridden and deluded ones tore many of the books and booklets in the presence of the publishers, and some burnt them, with threats to the publishers that if they returned again with the books it would be bad for them. But, on the whole, the common people or people of good will appreciate the message of the Kingdom. Many show kindness to the publishers, even some of the European district officers show to the publishers that they appreciate the work they are doing. Some of them go to the extent of telling the people to listen to the message and obtain the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The letter sent by the Society’s branch office in South Africa </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">the chief secretary of the Nigerian government about the wicked charges against the brethren in Rhodesia has had some effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the fiscal year we had two conventions, one in Ibadan, a distance of 120 miles from Lagos, and the other, here in Lagos. In both there was absence of disunion, and, as a brother put it: “There was nothing like the goat spirit during the three days’ convention in Lagos.” All went back to their spheres of work rejoicing and more determined to give wider witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The sixty cartons of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Iliches</span><span class="font3"> you sent to us for April testimony period went faster than any other book we ever had. 2,950 copies were swallowed up in less than two months. We also received three booklets in the Yoruba language, namely: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler, Who Shall Huie the World!</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government—• Hiding the Truth.</span><span class="font3"> 54,500 of the self-covered booklets went so fast with the sound car that we had to cable for more.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The witnessing work is directed from Buenos Aires for the countries as follows: Argentina, Paraguay and Chile. Although much handicapped because of the conditions existing, there has been an increase of the witness work and distribution of the literature during the fiscal year. The publishers in the field have placed in the hands of the people the total amount of literature, books and booklets, as follows: 149,681 volumes. The major portion of this work has been done</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">in Argentina, where more than 70,000 persons have obtained literature; and in the other two countries, approximately 4,000 obtainers. The zeal of the brethren has continued, and they are joyfully pushing forward in the work to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Society’s office at Strathficld, New South Wales, usually known as Australia, carries forward the organized Kingdom work in that part of the earth. The countries embrace Australia, New Zealand, the East Indian Islands, and Siam and portions of China. Recently a depot has been opened at Singapore, and from this point more direct connection is had with Java, Sumatra, and Malaya and Siam. The number of witnesses in this section of the earth is comparatively small, but they are strong in zeal and in the power of Almighty God. They arc soldiers battling faithfully for the gospel of the kingdom of Jehovah under Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As in all other countries on earth, “Catholic Action’’ is rampant in the foregoing countries. Secret methods, maliciously executed, are employed to defeat the truth and to turn the people away from God. The Jesuits bring influence to bear upon those who call themselves “Protestants” as well as the “Catholic population”, and also induce the officers of the law to act as the persecutors of Jehovah’s witnesses. They carry on a ceaseless persecution in an endeavor to prevent the proclamation of the truth. Recently in New South Wales a law has been enacted which is known 'as the “Charitable Collection Act”, the manifest purpose of which is to hinder the witness work as commanded by Jehovah. The Society is taking every possible means to resist this unrighteous law because the same is against Jehovah and against the law of God. In the island of Fiji an embargo has been placed upon the Society’s literature by order of the government, acting, of course, at the behest of other religionists. The same wicked method of opposition is carried on in other parts of the territory under the direct supervision of the Society’s office in Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Interest of many people in Siam is increasing. Those people are above the average of intelligence for those of the Orient, and they apparently desire to learn about Jehovah and his kingdom. This field is open for more pioneers who may see their way clear to go there to preach this gospel as Jehovah has commanded. Anyone devoted to the Lord in any part of the earth who has a desire to go to Siam should report to the Society’s office at Strathfield, which is 7 Beresford Road, Strathfield, N. S. W., Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society’s representative in New South Wales has very well covered the work in his report to this office, and the following excerpts are here inserted from his report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font3">tremendous witness to the name of Jehovah has </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">been given </span><span class="font3">in the territories under the supervision of the Australian branch office. The Lord has abundantly blessed the efforts of his </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">people </span><span class="font3">in these parts, and it truly thrills the hearts of all who had a share therein, when we visualize every part of Jehovah’s organization moving forward in complete unison, singing forth his praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There has been a further marked increase in the witness work in this territory and, as is to be expected, the “Philistines” are becoming more open in their opposition to the Kingdom message. The total literature distributed was 1,306,978 pieces. Bound books have increased over the previous year by 46,140, and booklets by 57,084.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The average number of publishers reporting each month increased from 1,181 (last year) to 1,379 (this year). The total includes 183 pioneers, 96 auxiliaries and 1,100 company publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pioneers throughout the year averaged 98 hours a month, in addition to which many more hours were spent in soundmachine work and in traveling long distances to their territory. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font3">few particularly zealous ones worked hours ranging from 150 to 200 a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The average time spent in the field each month by the auxiliaries was 44 hours; and by company publishers, 12 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the Australian branch the year’s total of hours amounted to 425,914; an increase of 22,138 over the previous year. However, we came short of the year’s quota of hours by about 24,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Everyone keenly appreciated the privilege of having a share in the six special testimony periods, during which 461,281 pieces of literature (37 percent of the total) were placed. The outstanding periods were the two international campaigns held during October and April. During ‘ ‘ World wide Praise Period” 174,448 pieces of literature were placed, and during ‘‘His Strange Work” period the total was 64,889 pieces, including 20,820 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font3"> The number of 12-inch records distributed throughout the year was 3,249.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The most intense witness in this territory is being given in Australia and New Zealand. In these two countries the average time spent in the field each month amounted to 34,934 hours. On this basis it is interesting to note that by averaging 15 calls an hour, and provided the publishers could be distributed evenly over the territory, it would be possible for the present number of publishers to witness to every home in Australia and New Zealand at least three times a year. However, lack of transport and other considerations have concentrated the publishers in the more thickly populated areas, with the result that most of the larger cities are being witnessed every six weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> subscription list shows a substantial increase in new subscribers. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> also shows a like increase. To those who love the Lord these magazines are a necessity and recognized as Jehovah’s provision for the instruction of his people that they may by their obedience maintain their integrity before him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our printing plant has performed good work and turned out during the year 1,338,086 pieces, consisting of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informants, </span><span class="font3">radio and transcription leaflets, circulars, office forms and service material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Economic conditions in Australia improved somewhat during the past year. However, there is still much unemployment and thousands are relying upon government relief work for their sustenance. The dark outlook in world affairs is causing the humble ones among the people to look to the kingdom of God as their only hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The publishers in Australia were responsible for placing 994,025 out of the total distribution of literature. This represents an increase over last year’s work amounting to 52,500 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The campaign with the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> was the most wonderful to date. So great was the demand that stocks were completely exhausted and for some weeks we could not fill orders. Still greater thrills await us in the work of organizing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> studies among the people of good will. Already this work is under way, and good results are being obtained in all sections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Boman Catholic press has been particularly hostile, and by lies and misrepresentation is seeking to frame mischief by law against God’s people. An attempt is being made to apply certain newly enacted laws to us. This is no doubt the outcome of a conspiracy on the part of the enemy, and it explains the veiled threats made by individuals from time to time that we would soon be stopped. Whatever the outcome, it is certain that Jehovah alone shall be our fear and him only shall we obey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The broadcasting of the Kingdom message has been almost totally confined to Australia. The Devil has effectively kept the truth off the air in other sections. Throughout the year 28 stations have been used; 19 o’f these for the whole year, and 9 part time. At present 22 are broadcasting Brother Rutherford’s lectures each week, 14 of which are using the five-minute lectures. These short, pithy lectures appear to arouse more interest than the fifteen-minute ones, as evidenced by the greater number of inquiries received from interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In September, 1936, the new 10,000-watt shortwave station, VDP2, located at Suva, Fiji, will commence broadcasting the lectures on a wave length of 31.45 meters, frequency 9540 kc. The time of the broadcast is appointed for 6: 00 to 6: 15 a.m., American Eastern Standard time, every Friday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s mighty power was manifested in the wonderful broadcast of February 23, 1936, received in Australia February 24, 6 to 7 a.m., Sydney time. Technical experts gave no hope of any signals whatever being received at the hour arranged. The Postal Department Accounts office demanded that we guarantee payment in the event of failure, saying in effect, “You are foolish enough to insist on the broadcast against the advice of experts, and we are going to make sure you pay. ’ ’ Everyone now knows it was the most successful overseas broadcast ever received in Australia. The Lord wanted the lecture “Separating the Nations’’ to reach Australia, and the Devil with all his schemes could not prevent it. What a thrill we received afterwards when we learned how the Lord had held the circuit open just long enough for the complete lecture to be heard. Immediately the program was finished nothing further could be heard from London. So sudden was the failure of the circuit that the telegraph officials were unable to send their report to London regarding the quality of the reception. The radio belongs to Jehovah, and he can do with it as he wills. What right has any creature to deny Jehovah’s witnesses the use of radio facilities to broadcast the truth of Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The mighty (?) men of-Satan’s organization forbear to come out in the open and fight. They fight like women. Reports are to hand telling of deputations of clergymen sneaking along to radio stations, demanding that they cease broadcasting the lectures. By threats of boycott they seek to intimidate the managers of radio stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s little army is highly mechanized. The average number of sound machines reporting each month amounted to 303, of which 90 are in the Bound car and portable transcription machine class, the remainder being phonographs. At the present time there are in use several No. 3 equipments fitted to sound cars. Many difficulties have had to be overcome, and we hope shortly to have many more of these instruments in the fight. Of the total number of sound machines in use, 258 are in Australia, 41 in New Zealand, and 4 in the Islands. All have given a good witness to Jehovah’s praise, and a total of 570,804 people heard the lectures. This is 319,066 increase over last year’s attendance. Hours to the number of 27,388 have been recorded for the seven months during which sound machine time has been reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the outback settlements the message is very much appreciated. Two pioneers traveling through Central Australia by truck arrived at Katherine after sundown. A musical item drew the crowd, and one old chap remarked that Katherine is on the map at last. After hearing the lectures many contributed toward the work and were astonished when they received literature in acknowledgment. The somewhat corpulent baker said, “I like those lectures. Got any reading matter?” He contributed 4/- and received four books. ‘‘That’s not the value of those books,” he exclaimed; ‘‘I must give you some more money.” Next day he contributed for all the literature and a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> subscription. In the evening ‘‘Separating the Nations” was presented in the main street in front of the hotel. The public provided seats and, after the lecture, drinks. A Chinaman brought along a petrol lamp to lighten the darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Warragul, Victoria, recently an angry man rushed up to a transcription machine and tried to break it up with a hammer. (Fortunately our boys make a strong job.) Foiled in his attempt, he pulled the speaker flex from the machine. Later a pioneer called on the convent with the literature and the enraged priest snatched some books from him and tore them to pieces, throwing the fragments at the pioneer. He then ran him to the gate and gave him a severe parting kick. The pioneer immediately made complaint to the police, and the cowardly priest sent along the man concerned in the hammer attack upon the transcription machine, who offered 18/- as compensation for the damage done. All the trouble Jehovah’s witnesses meet here and everywhere is inspired by the “Philistines”, who deal spitefully and by revenge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Following upon this incident a campaign was held at Warra-gul, and the mob spirit was very much in evidence, many of the brethren being threatened with physical violence. The Masonic Hall was engaged for a “Separating the Nations” lecture, but the management, due to pressure from the representatives of the Hierarchy, broke their contract and refused us the use of the hall. The Masonic order thus surrendered their principles to the Hierarchy. On another occasion Jehovah’s witnesses offered at their own expense to present the lecture “Separating the Nations” to a large percentage of the Masonic lodges in Australia, and not one of the lodges took advantage of the offer, thus providing further evidence that “Protestantism” is dead. Everywhere we look we see evidences of the truths pointed out in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> that the Jesuits are in control of every human organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">New Zealand</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The commencement of the year 1935-1936 saw New Zealand still suffering from the effects of the depression, and the publishers often found almost whole streets of homes where the people were on relief work or sustenance. A change to a labor government took place during the year and it was confidently hoped by the majority that this would bring relief to the suffering. Many schemes have been and are being introduced to absorb the unemployed into productive industry. Roads are being formed, waste lands planted with trees, and much money is being expended in an effort to assist the people. Despite all this there is no diminution of dissatisfaction, and many have come to realize that even though the present government were able to better the working conditions it could bring no lasting good to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses and those associated with them in proclaiming the Kingdom message know that this is so and have pressed forward with zeal in their endeavor to assist the people to see that their only hope is in the kingdom of God. In this they have been assisted and encouraged by the advent of the sound equipment, most of the pioneers and companies being equipped with either transcription machines or phonographs, enabling them to present a uniform message in a clear, convincing manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A sound car has also been provided and is at present engaged in a tour of the Dominion. Much interest has been aroused as a result, and the placements of literature considerably increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> arrived just when it was most needed and was quickly placed in the hands of the people. Already a number of Jonadabs have come forward as a result of reading tho instructions given therein. The zeal and fearlessness shown by them is remarkable and demonstrates their appreciation of tho favor bestowed upon them by Jehovah. In some localities they are devoting so much time to the service that the territory is covered quite frequently. We look forward to having a considerable army of publishers who can be gathered together and marched upon the cities where opposition is being shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a result of the activities of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy we are denied the use of the radio facilities, but one B class station for three months used the 12-inch discs and would willingly have continued doing so but for threats from the priests. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">New Zealand Tablet,</span><span class="font3"> New Zealand’s national Catholic weekly, which, by the way, carries on its editorial page a translation of the papal blessing, under the date May 13, 1936, denounced the station manager and the truth, and among other things stated, “ The net is closing in on him (Judge Rutherford) and every week brings a report of another station imposing </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">ban on his broadcasts.” It was pointed out that stations broadcasting the ‘offensive’ Rutherford talks ran a serious risk of losing their licenses, ‘‘and we will endeavour in every way possible to enlist the co-operation of the community in having them suppressed. ’ ’ Thus they admit that the agents of the Hierarchy in New Zealand are in league with those elsewhere in their endeavor to suppress the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The sound equipment is taking the message to the people, and wo find quite a number of Catholics who appreciate the lectures but who are too fearful to take the literature. Some, however, are coming aside from this system and rejoicing in the message contained in the books. It is good to know that the Hierarchy, together with the remainder of the Devil’s organization, will be destroyed in the near future that the people may be set at liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The publishers in New Zealand appreciate the provision of the various special periods set aside for witnessing and have made the most of these opportunities for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The amount of literature placed during the year in these islands totaled 227,678, or 35,089 pieces better than last year. There was an average of 197 publishers in the field each week, and these reported a total of 61,869 hours witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Islands and East Indies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The outlying territory under the supervision of the Australian branch includes the Pacific islands, the East Indies, Malay States, Siam and Indo-China. The field in these parts is almost unlimited, but there is a shortage of suitable publishers to cover the territory. The literature placed during the year (30,883 pieces) was almost double the previous year’s output. In addition to Europeans of many nationalities, this area includes a population of over 70,000,000 colored people. A large proportion of these are ignorant and illiterate. Others are difficult to approach because of religious and racial prejudice. But there is a large section now being reached with the Kingdom message. Difficulties in the way of the witness in this area are tropical diseases, language peculiarities, long distances, immigration laws. The Lord’s faithful people are accomplishing much with their limited resources. Upholding them is the great arm of Jehovah, whose instructions they gladly obey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Singapore is perhaps the most cosmopolitan city in the world, making it necessary for publishers to carry literature in a variety of languages. Attention has recently been paid to the slums of Singapore, and thousands of books in Chinese and Indian dialects have been placed. The hearts of these people are failing them for fear of what they see ahead, and although Singapore is perhaps the most strongly fortified area in the world, this gives to the people no feeling of security. Their safety lies in the kingdom of Jehovah, and in none other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is humorous to note the manner in which the clergy alter their mode of worship to suit local conditions. The people of the Bast are idol worshipers, and the Hierarchy has provided them idols without number. “Buck Nuns’’ may be seen walking down the streets in the tropical sunshine, long black robes trailing in the dust and filthy tobacco juice oozing from the long black beards which most of them possess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Singapore a cinema has been placed at our disposal once each week, and Brother Rutherford’s lectures may be heard by the audience during the intervals. At the same time slides advertising the publications are flashed on the screen. The proprietor of the cinema is a Chinese man of good will, and is not “religious”, for not one cent is charged for this service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society’s boat, the “Lightbearer”, has been operating around the Malay and Sumatra coasts. A good witness was given to warships lying in Singapore harbor by means of the boat's sound equipment, a report of which has appeared in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font3"> The Singapore press published a good writeup of this broadcast, but has since become antagonistic, due to Hierarchy pressure. At Medan, Sumatra, Batak natives, formerly under the control of the clergy, now conduct their own religious affairs. They thoroughly enjoyed a transcription machine program, ably translated into their own language by one of their “elders”. At the close of the meeting some </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions were taken, and about 100 pieces of literature were placed among the 200 Bataks present. These people are extremely poor. Practically all read Malay; some as many as four languages. The next day the leading Malay paper carried a two-column report of the meeting under the subheadings ‘ ‘ How Clergy Induce People to Give Them Money ’ ’ and “Satan’s Organization About to Be Destroyed”. Their present attitude indicates that the inquisitors have applied the “thumbscrew and rack”. However, we praise the Lord for the opportunity to present the message to this large and intelligent section of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The hazardous journey undertaken by this small vessel is in itself a wonderful means of breaking down opposition, both official and individual. Our enemies are invariably the clergy, particularly the Boman Catholic brood. The friendly Dutch people have proved more hospitable and tolerant than their English neighbors. The Kingdom message has been welcomed by many, both in Malaya and Sumatra, particularly among the Eurasian and Asiatic peoples, who are more naturally meek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year literature has been placed from the boat in ten languages totaling 10,500 pieces, and about 100 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> have been obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FIJI and Other Islands</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One lone pioneer is at work in the Fiji islands and is giving a good witness. There has been a hold-up of our literature for some months and the govenunent has refused to allow into the country two sliipments now waiting at Suva to be delivered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the Cook islands and in the islands of Tonga and Rotuma there are some deeply interested persons who are having a share in the work. These are translating the message into the native tongues and circulating the English publications among the few who can read that language. Communication with some islands is very difficult. Sometimes six months elapse between mails. At one of these places the mail is sealed in a tin can and dropped overboard from a passing steamer, whereupon a nativo swims out from the shore and secures it. This is known as the Tin Can Mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These are always assemblies for service, featuring house-to-house witnessing and sound machine work. The vindication of Jehovah’s name is of paramount importance, and for this reason Jehovah’s people love to get together to learn the most effective methods of carrying out organization instructions. There was first a big general convention at Sydney during the “Christmas” season, attended by brethren from all States of the Commonwealth. Then a convention at Perth during “His Strange Work” period, and a convention at Brisbane during August. All of these conventions brought great joy to those who attended, and many people of good will symbolized their stand for Jehovah by water immersion. The Brisbane convention concluded with a well attended “Separating the Nations” lecture, held in a cinema.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bethel family rejoice in their portion in Jehovah’s organization. Throughout the year they averaged nearly thirteen hours a month in field service and placed 11,177 pieces of literature. Additionally, their report shows 526 sound machine hours, with a total attendance of 18,827.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>BLIND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">For some time the Society has maintained a small printing plant and depot for the benefit of the blind, at Logansport, Ind. There has been little progress in the work. This may be due to the fact that although there are many without natural eyes, they have someone to read for them and a great majority of them have no interest in things pertaining to the Lord’s kingdom. The opportunity for Jehovah’s witnesses in various places who can see and read is to read for those who are blinded and help them to understand the truth and comfort their hearts. Furthermore, the phonograph furnishes a means of testimony and they can hear in this manner. The interest manifested by the blind hardly seems to justify the continuing of this branch of the service, in view of the fact that they can receive the truth by having it read to them by others and by means of electrical transcription and phonograph machines.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">For some time the witness work in Brazil has moved slowly. During the year the organization has been reconstructed and new office quarters established at Sao Paulo with an American as the Society’s local representative. The work is now moving forward with much better results. Brazil has a population of approximately 45 million persons, speaking many different languages. These people are scattered over a very large area. Many of them are quite illiterate, because for many years the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has dominated the country. Some of the people, however, appear to be of good will and seem to be in readiness to hear the message of Jehovah’s gracious goodness for humankind. Heretofore the people have been imposed upon and relieved of their money to build expensive structures called “churches”, which buildings the Roman Catholic Hierarchy uses in which to gather the people, hoodwink the credulous and extract from them their shekels. It is reported, however, that the people in general have very little respect for the clergy, but have tolerated them as a necessary evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the pioneers have proceeded with the work they have made inroads on the Hierarchy’s flock during the year, and this has aroused the ire of the religious crowd and the persecution has begun. More pioneers have entered the field in recent months, and Jehovah will bless them according to his own sovereign will. A first-class Portuguese translator is badly needed, and it is to be hoped that the Lord may be pleased to bring forward one who will do this work in a satisfactory way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year publishers have placed in the hands of the people 64,443 books, some bound and some selfcovered. Of this number, 8,878 have been placed during the last three weeks of the fiscal year. In recent months the field workers have increased to the number of 98 persons. The Jonadabs are awakening and the workers are going forward with much joy. Doubtless more pioneers will migrate to that country as the field seems to be ripe to do some important work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Assembly</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In July an assembly or convention was held in Sao Paulo. This was the first of its kind the Lord’s people have had in Brazil, and this has stimulated to greater activity all the brethren throughout the land. This convention was conducted in the same manner as conventions are carried forward in America, the sound equipment being used as well as the radio. On Saturday and Sunday during the convention those present devoted themselves to the house-to-house witness work. Discourses were given by the brethren in the languages, to wit, Portuguese, English and Hungarian. Those present were also instructed in the organization of the field service, which will doubtless make them more efficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Companies in the field have now been organized and have been instructed in their privileges of participating in the activities of bearing testimony to the people. In this connection the sound equipment has been used to good advantage. Portable phonographs as well as a sound ear were taken from the United States. We have hopes for the advancement of the work in that country.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s Judge is upon his judgment throne, and before him the nations are gathered. The separating work is in progress, and the result of that work is clearly made manifest in Great Britain. Jehovah’s witnesses are active in proclaiming the message advertising the King and the kingdom and informing the people that there is but one Almighty God and that his kingdom is the hope of humankind. At the same time the religionists grow more arrogant and dictatorial. The meek and lowly ones of the population who have the desire for righteousness, peace and life are making themselves manifest. There is a great disparity in the numbers on each side of the line of separation, and that is exactly what is to be expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord Jesus, the great Judge, has made it clear in his Word that this is the time to gather his “other sheep” and that these make themselves manifest by showing love for God and for Christ Jesus and by endeavoring to render good unto those who represent the Lord in the earth. He also plainly points out that the goat class will make themselves distinctly to appear at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is doing its secret work in Britain, and doing it with effect. It works through the Jesuits and has placed in all the departments of the government those who are not only in sympathy with the Hierarchy but some amongst whom are the active agents of the Hierarchy. These government officials representing Great Britain in various parts of the earth are manifesting themselves by taking their stand on the side of Satan and against Jehovah and his kingdom. In England the Fascists are growing in numbers and in power. They are extremists and are moved by religious influence. To them, like the clergy, the visible ruling officers constitute the higher powers. The Fascists hope to get in power their officers and representatives and then compel the other people to be subject to them. Not only are they employing their propaganda schemes, but they are openly manifesting themselves by riots. The evidence continues to increase that Gog is leading the forces of wicked ones and operating in Britain as well as elsewhere. Up to the present time there has been very little open persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses within England, Scotland and Wales, but there has been a great deal of persecution leveled against Jehovah’s witnesses in what is generally known as the colonies of Great Britain. It appears to be very much in line with Satan’s general method of playing politics. He goes into the country first, captures that, and then moves on the head of the government. This is clearly the policy being attempted on the part of the colonial governments to stop the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. It may be expected in the near future that the Fascist Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their combine will do a more effective work in England against God and his kingdom than has heretofore been done; and when that comes it will be still stronger evidence that Armageddon draws nigh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By referring to this report on the colonies of Great Britain, it will be observed there has been real persecution leveled against the witnesses of Jehovah there. In every instance that persecution has been done at the instigation of religionists, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which claims to represent God and Christ on earth. This has been particularly manifest in West Africa, Nigeria and the Gold Coast, and both Northern and Southern Rhodesia; also manifested in the British possessions of South America and in the Fiji islands. Jehovah’s witnesses in these various places, however, are vigorously prosecuting their part of the campaign, bringing to the attention of the visible powers of these worldly governments that they are fighting against God, and thus giving them the warning which Jehovah commands must be given. In obedience to Jehovah’s commandment this warning must be given to all the nations, and in particular to the land which is called “Christendom” and which is a misrepresentation of Christ Jesus and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was the privilege and great pleasure of the president of the Society to visit England and Scotland during the year. A convention was held at Glasgow, Scotland, at which there was a greater attendance at the public meeting than has ever heretofore been known. The Catholic population is quite large in Glasgow and, as elsewhere, many of these of the ‘ ‘ Catholic population” are sincere and desire to know the truth, but have been long held in subjection by the Hierarchy and prevented from grasping the knowledge of the Bible. At the Glasgow meeting a number of the ‘ ‘ Catholic population” were present, manifesting keen interest in what they heard, and doubtless received encouragement to prosecute their studies; hence many of them availed themselves of the opportunity to get reading matter explaining the Bible. The convention was also a great stimulus to the brethren, pointing out to them their privileges of increased opportunities in making known the gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Later a convention was held at London, England; likewise with a splendid attendance of the remnant and the Jonadabs. These gladly joined together in the field service in the proclamation of the message there. The public address was had at Alexandra Palace, where there was the largest attendance that there has ever been at that place for a similar meeting. Not only was the great hall filled, but large numbers on the outside who were unable to enter received all the lecture by means of a voice-amplifying system. This electrical appliance enabled the people to hear more than a mile away, and many who were not actually in attendance at the meeting could hear from their homes, and there was evidence that they had their windows open listening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The remnant and the Jonadabs in England are fully united in the joyful service of the Lord. It clearly appeared at the meetings held for these that there is a keener appreciation of the Kingdom than has ever heretofore been had. That is exactly what is to be expected. In obedience to the Lord’s commandment those of the anointed lift high the banner of truth, inviting all of good will to hear. And in obedience to the same commandment those of good will who do hear are joining in the proclamation. These are going throughout the country declaring the name of Jehovah God, pointing to his great Servant, Christ Jesus, and proclaiming to the people that his government is the only hope of the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Ireland, which is in fact a part of the British territory so far as the proclamation of the Kingdom message is concerned, there has been very little accomplished. Ireland is the darkest part of the British Isles. For a long period of time the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has held sway and browbeaten the people, frightened them into avoiding any and all literature, kept them away from the Bible, and increased their prejudice against those who proclaim the truth, and thus Satan has accomplished his purpose. In the extremely Catholic section in the southern part of Ireland the priests of the Hierarchy follow the pioneers from place to place, find where literature has been left with the Catholic population and immediately cause its destruction. In the face of all this opposition, the Lord’s faithful ones continue to prosecute the witness work there and to give the warning God has commanded must be given; and when it is given, the ones warned will take the responsibility upon their own heads. A special effort is now being put forth to warn the people in Ireland. In the northern part of Ireland, where the Hierarchy is not so strong, the witness work is making better progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year ending September 30 the Society, acting through the witnesses that go into the field, has placed in the hands of the people within the realms of England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland the total number of books and booklets, to wit, 2,659,130. They have done a splendid work with the sound equipment, have gone into many homes with the phonograph, have interested families, and established study classes. They have used the sound cars throughout the land and thus given a splendid witness to the glory of the Lord. His blessings have been upon these faithful ones doing the work, and their joy has increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the conclusion of the public address at Alexandra Palace a Resolution was read to the great audience, and by rising vote it was unanimously adopted. Thus a great many persons expressed their desire to be on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom. That Resolution so adopted is as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RESOLUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s witnesses now assembled at London, the capital city of the seventh world power, there to worship Jehovah in spirit and in truth, take this occasion to give thanks to the Almighty God, whose name alone is Jehovah, for his manifold blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Knowing full well that Jehovah God always faithfully performs his promise, and that long centuries ago he promised he would establish on earth Iris kingdom of righteousness with Christ Jesus as the world’s rightful Euler; and now seeing from the fulfillment of prophecy that the day of Jehovah’s kingdom is here, we rejoice in the privilege of being his servants and his witnesses, and we do declare our unqualified allegiance to the Almighty God and his kingdom and we delight to make known to suffering humankind that the kingdom of God under Christ is their only hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We fully appreciate that Satan the Devil is the great enemy of all who serve Jehovah God, and that Satan has used and still uses religionists as his agencies to oppose and persecute those who worship God in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The law of Jehovah God is supreme, which should be obeyed by all persons, and by his grace we will obey the law of Jehovah God, and not the law of man when such is contrary to God’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We direct attention to the clear distinction between religion and Christianity. Eeligion is a form of worship based upon the traditions of men, which forms of worship Satan has caused men to adopt and teach, thereby deceiving and misleading millions of sincere persons. Christianity is the true worship of Almighty God by keeping or obeying his commandments. We delight to declare ourselves the followers of Christ Jesus and that we are therefore Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In obedience to God’s law as written at Ezekiel thirty-three and other places in the Bible, we sound the warning concerning his purpose to destroy all the wicked and those who willfully violate his law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">True to and in fulfillment of Jehovah’s prophecy, there has arisen and yet exists in the world a powerful religious organization with its headquarters at Vatican City, Italy, and which designates itself as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and which official body rules, dominates and misleads millions of sincere persons who, by it, are designated as “the Catholic population”, but which persons are not members of the so-called “Catholic church”. That aforesaid religious organization falsely claims to be a Christian organization, whereas in truth and in fact it is a political organization, against the kingdom of God under Christ. Contrary to the Word of God the Boman Catholic Hierarchy participates in the political affairs of all nations of earth and desperately attempts to rule all nations by cruel dictators. Their methods today arc the same as employed by that organization during the wicked Inquisition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We call all good people to witness that in Germany, Austria and other places Jehovah’s witnesses and true worshipers of Almighty God are cruelly persecuted, imprisoned, fiendishly abused and many of them killed, and that all such wickedness and persecution is done against them by a cruel, malicious, wicked power, incited so to do by religionists led by the Boman Catholic Hierarchy. It is now boldly announced by the public press that the Hitler government and the Boman Catholic Hierarchy are in full accord. The Hitler government, aided and incited by said religious organization, has inflicted and continues to inflict all manner of cruel punishment upon Christians, even as Christ Jesus and his apostles were persecuted for righteousness’ sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God has commanded his servants to proclaim his warning, that full responsibility may rest upon the wicked for their wrongdoing; and for that reason we now sound the warning to the rulers in Germany and in other places, and particularly to the Boman Catholic Hierarchy, and to all like organizations that cruelly persecute the true and faithful followers of Christ Jesus and that oppose the publication of Jehovah’s kingdom message. God declares that the fate of such wicked ones is complete destruction. (Ps. 145: 20) Jesus Christ has declared that he counts his faithful followers a part of himself, and at Matthew twenty-five he pronounces Jehovah’s judgment against those who persecute the true followers of Christ Jesus, employing these words: ‘Inasmuch as ye have done it to [cruelly ill-treated] the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels. These shall go into everlasting destruction. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We vigorously protest against the cruel treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses by the Boman Catholic Hierarchy and its allies in Germany and in all other parts of the world, but we are delighted to leave the end thereof entirely in the hand of the Almighty God, who according to his Word will render to them a full recompense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We call attention to the indisputable truth that the world’s greatest crisis is at the door, and we sound the warning to all mankind according to God’s Word that those who would live must refuse to give aid and support to religionists who oppose Jehovah’s kingdom and persecute the true followers of Christ Jesus, and that they must take their stand on the side of righteousness and give heed to and obey the words of Jehovah God, to wit: ‘Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; he shall show judgment to the nations. . . . And in his name shall the nations hope.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the followers of Christ Jesus we have no part in and no interest in the political affairs of this world. Our sole purpose and commission is to make known the name and the kingdom of God under Christ, that the people may be informed and intelligently choose whom they will serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We send loving greetings to our persecuted brethren in Germany and other parts of the earth, and bid them to be of good courage and to rely solely upon the promises of the Almighty God, Jehovah, and Christ, and to remember the words of Jesus: “Shall not God avenge his own elect! . . . He will avenge them speedily’’ (Luke 18: 7,8); and, further, to give heed to the words of the Lord Jesus addressed to his faithful servants: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee [the] crown of life.’’ (Bev. 2: 10) Blessed is the lot of those who are permitted to endure all manner of suffering for the sake of the name of Jehovah and his kingdom under Christ.— Matt. 5: 10-12,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The everlasting peace, joy and life of the people depend entirely upon the great “Prince of Peace’’, whose government will be administered in peace and righteousness.—Isa. 9: 6, 7; 32: 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bbsolved that a copy of these resolutions be sent to Mr. Hitler and to the pope at Vatican City as the head of the Boman</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Catholic Hierarchy, and be freely published throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">September 13, 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who are interested in God’s kingdom will read gladly the excerpts from the report of the Society’s branch servant, from which the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the end of another year we acknowledge with gratitude to Jehovah that his grace has enabled the British publishers to continue to serve the interests of the Kingdom without serious opposition. In this land unemployment is considerably reduced and a large measure of prosperity has returned. This has increased the spending power of the people, but it has also increased the indifference of many to the message of the Kingdom. The evidence in these islands is conclusive that the people are rapidly being divided into the interested and the indifferent. It is noticeable during the last twelve months that the interested are not merely content with taking another book, but want to know “Where can I meet with you people </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1”</span><span class="font3"> or “How can I have a share in your work?” The Jonadab company are undoubtedly getting up into the chariot. In the London company alone, 187 Jonadabs have joined in the last six months and are attending 42 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Biches</span><span class="font3"> studies per week arranged for them. The majority of these are active service publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No branch of the witness work has brought greater joy to those who see the privilege than the phonograph visit. The light-weight Midget phonograph, made to your instructions, has been a great boon. It is so light that everyone can carry it with ease. The present generation are not such great readers as were their parents. The wireless receiver, now common to almost every house, is to a large extent responsible. Being accustomed to phonograph records, it is easy to obtain an invitation to “come in”, when calling with the 12-inch records. Many like to play the record on their own radio-gram. The great advantage of witnessing with the record is that it always provides an opportunity for questions. Frequently an invitation is given to “ come back again soon ”, This phase of the service will certainly extend because of the joy it brings and because it is service work which can be done in the winter evenings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The opportunity of once more participating in your world broadcast, this time from Los Angeles on the 23d of February, was enthusiastically embraced by the friends. Instead of six cities being selected, as on the previous occasion, this time 54 of the principal towns were selected and the broadcast was transmitted into the largest cinemas in each place. The reception was excellent and all the halls were filled to capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your visit to us this year was greatly appreciated. The convention and public lecture in Glasgow was the largest ever held in Scotland. On no previous occasion has any speaker filled two overflow halls in this country. The public meeting you addressed in Alexandra Palace, London, was also the largest assembly to be gathered there. The outside loud-speakers were heard distinctly 1J miles distant. There has been a greater request for literature, in particular the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> book, than we have had for any previous lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the first time for several years there is a decrease in the output of literature from the British branch. The output of 2,659,130 volumes is 401,537 less than last year. The decrease in output does not indicate any slackness by the publishers, because in spite of less hours their placements show a total increase of 441,919 pieces of literature. The decrease in output is due to the publishers’ drawing on the heavy stocks in the companies’ care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The reason for the decrease of 89,714 hours over all the branches of the service is the abnormal wet and cold weather. The last twelve months are recorded as having the heaviest rainfall for over fifty years. The large increase in back-call service with the phonograph, referred to above, also absorbs many hours which are not recorded. The advertising of the broadcast from Los Angeles and from Lyons, also the special effort made to advertise your lectures at Glasgow and London, occupied hundreds of hours which would otherwise have been recorded as service hours. The decrease in hours does not, therefore, reflect on the activity or faithfulness of the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> book has been received as a precious gift from Jehovah, and the demand is, for the moment, greater than we can supply. The increased shipment promised, however, will soon enable us to fill all requisitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Irish Free State is at present the only place where the Hierarchy have been unrestricted in their sway. The witness, however, is maintained by a faithful few. The pamphlet “You Have Been Warned’’, which you gave us for that dark spot just before you left London, is now being printed, and your instructions for distributing this will be carried out immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Service. In addition to the general convention at Glasgow and the assembly at London, mentioned above, there were 25 service assemblies arranged in various parts of the field. This gathering together of the publishers is much appreciated, and the attendance of 8,552 publishers is an increase of nearly 1,000 over last year. The 80,830 pieces of literature placed by these witnesses is an increase of 28,587.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The units organized for service and regularly reporting their activities are 364. These units contain 5,464 publishers. Of this number 32 percent on an average are engaged in transcription service most of their time. The total of 1,197,845 obtainers is only 5,816 less than last year, in spite of the fact that the service hours show a decrease of 134,744, due to the reasons already stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneer service. Last year we had 223 pioneers and 108 auxiliaries. Now we have 201 and 114 reporting. The decrease of 15 pioneers is entirely due to the fact that British pioneers are transferred from time to time to other countries, the majority to France, Belgium and Spain. We have room now for many more who can devote their whole time to the service, and we could accommodate at least another 100 auxiliaries. There is also a shortage in those who specialize on business houses. This branch of the pioneer service yields exceptionally good results, the placements of the business-house publishers being over 50 percent better than those who work in the rural districts. For one reason, because, less time is spent in traveling between calls, and further, because the businessman can usually afford a large combination, if you can get him interested. A monthly average of 179 pioneers report 216,853 hours, during which they placed 118,880 bound books and 620,490 booklets; a total of 739,370 volumes. This is an increase of 11,879 volumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A monthly average of 104 auxiliaries placed 21,761 books and 230,874 booklets; a total of 252,635, in 62,685 hours. This is an increase of 66,665 volumes. The auxiliaries are the only publishers who show an increase in hours. This, although small, is 421 hours better than last year. The wet weather does not affect the auxiliaries to the same extent, because they can pick the time to get in their hours of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Transcription. The large transcription machines operating the 16-inch discs have increased by 16, to 285; the companies owning them, by 18, to 210. These large machines are limited in use to largo halls and regular outdoor fixed sites, where they can use their horn projectors to the best advantage. The number of 16-inch discs in circulation has grown from 4,813 last year to 11,006; an increase of 6,193. This in itself manifests the increased use of this important phase of witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Phonographs. The phonograph is surely one of the most effective instruments provided by Jehovah for the use of his witnesses. Their number is steadily increasing. The total in regular use rose from 346, last year, to 824 in this year under review. The number of 12-inch record discs increased by 6,665. In addition, 1,715 Watch Tower quartet records are in service. The attendance of the public at these lectures was 1,117,763; an increase of 279,541 persons witnessed to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sound cars. The motor sound-ears, of which there are four operated by the Society, continue to give an effective witness. The last one was presented to the Society by the combined London Service Units, who contribute monthly to the running costs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year they traveled 22,482 miles. In 10,267 hours, to compare with 8,605 last year, they delivered 7,168 lectures, to an audience of 98,500 persons. This is 42,226 more who heard than last year. They also placed with the public, at the same time, 36,061 volumes; an increase of 1,902, to compare with last year. The sound cars have now covered all Scotland and nearly all England and Wales. One of the cars is now crossing over to the North of Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Watchtower. The subscribers for this most necessary publication have increased by 673. In addition, 25,536 copies are circulated in single copies. How faithfully Jehovah answers by it the prayer Jesus taught us to pray saying: “Give us this day our daily bread’’!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age. This magazine is also increasing in circulation. Its fearless and consistent exposure of the hypocrisy of the Boman Catholic Hierarchy, and its denunciation of the unfaithful clergy, appeals to all non-religious Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There were added 724 new subscribers, and 124,320 copies were distributed to regular readers singly. The increase of single copies in regular demand is 80,521, to compare with an increase of 43,799.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bethel family. No group of publishers in this land enjoys the privilege of field service more than the Bethel family. The arrangement you have made to enable each member to share on Saturday and Sunday is very much appreciated. This year, due to the wet week-ends and to pressure in the office, the hours of service have been much curtailed. Your rearrangement, however, will avoid this in future, and all are determined to press on while “the going is good”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The printing presses have broken all records. The great demand for advertising matter for transcription and phonograph lectures as well as for public lectures has put a heavy strain on the department. The output of items printed has increased from 4,385,795 to 10,128,126.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is a small increase in the correspondence received, the inward mail numbering 41,050 letters. The outward letters are reduced from 52,868 to 46,188. In addition, 7,917 letters have been redirected to pioneers and others. The number of small parcels packed and dispatched remains steady at 29,840, an increase of 662.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The detail of the work accomplished demonstrates the unity and devotion of the British publishers. Rejoicing in hope, we press on in the strength of the Lord, glad to be alive on the earth at such a time.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark129"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witness work has made progress in Canada during the latter part of the fiscal year, and the general result is encouraging and favorable, in spite of the great amount of opposition manifested by the enemy and of the deflection of some who had occupied a place in the ranks of the organization of the Lord on earth in that community. The total amount of literature placed in the hands of the people during the year has been somewhat less than it was the previous year. This, however, is not the only means of determining the mental attitude of the people toward the Kingdom. Much literature placed with the people in former years doubtless has been studied during the year, and more persons have manifested their interest in and determination to serve the Kingdom. The knowledge gained by such study has worked to the advantage of those who are seeking meekness and righteousness, and these new ones are showing zeal for the Lord and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of us know that now there is a great conflict in progress on the earth between righteousness and wickedness. On the one side is Satan, who employs his many subtle and deceptive methods to fight against those who have the testimony of Jesus Christ and who are obedient to the commandments of Jehovah. The enemy Satan is desperately attempting to hold the religionists in line in his ranks and to cause more of the human race to forsake God. Some who have been honored by the Lord in having a place in his organization have become weak and weary in well-doing and have slacked their hands. Some of these have grown weak because of their trust’s being put in men and not in the Lord. When one who is consecrated to do the will of God then becomes impressed with his own personal importance and his ability to interpret Scripture as applying to himself and others, and is therefore looking for admiration from men and advancement in the eyes of human creatures, that person is in a very dangerous position, and, failing to quickly turn about and take the right road, he is certain to grow cold and fall away. Those who rely upon and trust in men and forget to trust wholly in the Lord and who are thus influenced by such servants in the ranks of the Lord’s organization are certain to fall away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year it clearly appeared to be the will of the Lord that the Society’s representative at the Toronto office be changed. Confusion had arisen in the minds of a number of persons concerning the Watch Tower publications and the work being carried on in behalf of the Jonadabs, or great multitude. That confusion resulted from the attitude of the Society’s representative, and thus the work was being hindered. Nothing can be permitted to hinder the Kingdom work, and clearly it was the Lord’s will that a change should be made to the end that the Society’s representative might stand out boldly and uncompromisingly for God and his kingdom and follow the commandments of the Lord and the revelation of his purpose brought to his people in his chosen way. This change of the Society’s representative there was made by bringing a brother from London, England, and placing him in charge of the Toronto office. That brother for some years has been a faithful servant in the British branch and, by the Lord’s grace, has the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house, and it is expected that the faithful and loyal ones in Canada will work together with him bar-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">moniously to the Lord’s glory and honor. There has been a decided and healthy increase in the work during the last third part of the fiscal year. The joy of the Lord has increased and the Jonadabs are coming away from the religious organizations and joining with God’s organization in the proclamation of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan’s Tool</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Religion is the chief instrument employed by Satan to carry on his fight against God, because religion is based on the theories of men handed down by tradition and is a subtle means of turning people away from God. For many years the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, operating from Italy, has been strongly entrenched in the eastern part of Canada, particularly in the province of Quebec. The Hierarchy organization is religious and is also the strong factor in the political affairs of the world. The Catholic Hierarchy wields a tremendous influence amongst the people in Quebec because it has subtly worked as the instrument of Satan to keep the people in darkness. The Hierarchy has vigorously labored to prevent the people from reading any explanation of the Bible and has commanded particularly the “Roman Catholic population” to read nothing unless it comes with the endorsement of the Hierarchy. The truth of God’s Word exposes religionists and makes clear to those who want to do right that religion is against God and against the interests of the people. Satan, therefore, uses the religious political organization to persecute Jehovah’s witnesses and to keep them out of the community and prevent them from bringing the refreshing truths to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the face of all this opposition the faithful witnesses in the Quebec province have zealously sounded the warning to the people and to the Hierarchy in that part of the land. During the year some of the brethren have been tried in the courts upon the charge of circulating seditious and perverse literature. These court trials have furnished a splendid opportunity to give a witness to the truth and thus sound the warning to the religious political element and to serve notice upon the people also that Jehovah is God. These prosecutions or court trials have denied the right of freedom of worship of Almighty God; and upon the pretext that the proclamation of the truth is perverse and would induce riot and is therefore subversive and seditious, Jehovah’s witnesses have been convicted and incarcerated in prison. Some of these have been released by reason of the Supreme Court of the Dominion of Canada reversing the judgments upon technical points. Others have been tried and convicted on similar charges, and their cases are now pending in the courts. In every instance these prosecutions or persecutions are carried on at the behest of the clergy of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. These facts are becoming known to the common people, and many of the Catholics who are honest and sincere are getting their eyes open. Some of these are taking a bold stand on the side of God and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the end of this fiscal year the Society’s representative at Toronto, assisted by the loyal office force there, has submitted the annual report from that branch office, and the following excerpts are inserted herein and made a part of this report, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has taught us a great deal during the past year, and wo give all thanks to him for his goodness and blessing. The vision concerning the modern Philistines, our part in the warfare against them, and their defeat, has energized us to go forward with a great shout to Jehovah’s name. The revelation of the prophecy of Obadiah, with the ever-widening view concerning the great multitude, and their being gathered by the Lord before Armageddon, has enabled us to appreciate the work of the Lord in a clearer light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Knowing well that the outcome of the battle will be to the vindication of Jehovah’s name, the deliverance of the prisoners, and the humiliation and debasement of all opposers, we are surely placed in an advantageous position for the fight. The light from Jehovah shows our position very clearly, and also that of the enemy. We have been equipped with ways and means to obey Jehovah’s commandments to fight against the hosts of Satan, to carry Jehovah’s word of deliverance to those who sit in darkness and who are bound by the Devil’s lies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We magnify Jehovah for the gift of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font3"> The message contained in this book not only has brought light and joy to the anointed, but has opened the eyes of many for the first time to the truth concerning the Creator and his beloved Son. Now the people of good will can take the way that will give them riches which endure. Never before has there been so much pleasure in carrying the message to the people. It has been like .carrying water to thirsty souls who indeed have drunk well of this water of life. As the psalmist says, ‘ The Word of the Lord runneth very swiftly.’ To see this book going out day by day and week by week has reminded us of the revelator’s words, “Let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come; and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.’’ Our hearts are filled with gratitude to Jehovah for this gracious and beneficent gift. The response from the people with whom the book has been placed has been a joy to witness. This is manifest everywhere. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> studies are increasing, and we are having repeated requests for more helpers that the brethren may be assisted in organizing those who have recently come to a knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another marked evidence of Jehovah’s favor has been the handling of the new phonograph and the records. This is being taken into the homes of the people, and both phonograph and records loaned to the interested. Daily we are finding this modern equipment the best way yet of helping to place the literature, as it breaks down opposition and prejudice, and assists the interested ones to know the truth, and enables them, to see clearly the great issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An event of great importance during the year was the message that was broadcast by yourself from Los Angeles on February 23. This lecture came thundering into Canada, beating up against the Devil’s organization, particularly in the largest centers in Canada, namely, Toronto and Montreal. Jehovah blessed not only all the arrangements beforehand for the witness to be given here, but also, we have no doubt, the reception of the message itself, for every word was heard clearly and distinctly. It was carried into Canada from Los Angeles by direct telephone lines. In Toronto it was the occasion for a convention, and, despite the very stormy weather, many attended, and there was a very enthusiastic audience. Those assembled arose to their feet at the conclusion of the lecture, and showed, by this standing up, their determination to take the Lord’s side, come what may. The detailed report concerning this convention was published in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> for March 25, 1936. It is interesting to recall that just prior to the lecture’s being put on the air, the Canadian Broadcasting Commission in this city was besieged with calls from people desiring to find out the stations in Canada carrying the broadcast, and so numerous did the calls become that the Radio Commission Was forced to get in touch with the Telephone Company for information concerning Judge Rutherford’s lecture. Since that date, the transcription machines have been regularly used to carry this lecture, “Separating the Nations,’’ to others. Truly, a great hailstorm 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those having an understanding of Jehovah’s purposes today are not concerned about what man may think concerning the work and message of the Lord, and the means he uses to carry on his work. The faithful are like Gideon’s army, standing shoulder to shoulder. The Lord has sounded the alarm so that those in the organization will not be deceived by subtle teachings that our chief work is after the “first phase’’ of Armageddon. The faithful can well ignore such teachings of the opposers, knowing well that such emanate from a selfish spirit. The fact that some man or men may think differently from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> will not cause the faithful to move from the table which the Lord has spread so richly before them. They will not slack the hand, but will remain in the temple of Jehovah and continue to work and speak to his praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tho activities of all the brethren in the field service during the past year show an increase in spite of unemployment, drought, pests, and failing crops. There were more publishers reporting, and as a result more time spent in the field. We find that the people, generally, are depressed and low-spirited owing to the oppressive conditions. They have witnessed another year of practically complete failure of wheat and other crops. Many great wheat fields in the West have produced practically nothing. In many cases what has been grown is not worth cutting even for feed, and thousands of people in Canada face a winter without money or food. Indeed, it is anticipated that it will be the severest winter on record. The precious knowledge given to us by Jehovah is the only real comfort. We appreciate greatly the privilege of bearing the life-giving fruits of the Kingdom to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Whilst these fruits are being held out to the hungry, and the water of life carried to the thirsty, the modem Philistines not only look on with sneering remarks and jeering, but they endeavor to stop our work, manifesting one attitude to their congregations and another entirely to those who are the true servants of Jehovah. They oppose in every possible way, but cannot stop the exposure which is continuing with ever-increasing momentum. A striking example of the opposition of the clergy, who work behind others hired to do their dirty work, will be found in the following experience:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“During 'His Strange Work’ period we met with stronger opposition from the enemy, and not one book, and very few booklets, have been placed in the hands of the people in this territory. On April 5, when we reached the witnessing field, we were suddenly met by a gang of hoodlums armed with sticks. They sprang out from all directions as if Satan had warned them of our coming with the Kingdom message. They followed us from house to house until we called at the last one in their district, and, calling us everything they could think of, they sneered and jeered and hollered, sounding the alarm at every house, telling the people to use hot water on us, or to get their guns and shoot us. However, this did not deter any of us from keeping right on with the Lord’s work, calling at every house in that vicinity and presenting our testimony cards under much difficulty, without getting much chance to talk to anyone owing to the interference of the gang, and mostly all identifying themselves on the enemy’s side. It was a strenuous day for us, walking over twenty miles and working under such conditions. On our way home we found that many of the scoffers along the way had some rag flags up to ridicule us, and when the day was done we all rejoiced all the more for having had the privilege to suffer for His name’s sake. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Quebec: Fierce opposition continues in this province. Just recently three of our brethren were tried before the court, and arrayed against them was a Catholic judge, an all-French Catholic jury, and a Catholic priest and an Anglican canon. These brethren were found “guilty” on a charge of seditious conspiracy. This conviction was made because of our opposition to the Catholic Hierarchy, although based on a technical point, namely, that our literature had a tendency to cause ill will between the classes. The only proofs that were forthcoming were the plain declarations of truth against the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. To show the absurdity of this trumped-up charge we give passages taken from the evidence of the Church of England canon and the Society’s lawyer at this trial:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Canon: “ It is my opinion that the reading of these passages referred to has a tendency to cause the people to revolt against constituted authority of both church and state.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lawyer: “This was not the intention of the writer or of the distributors.” Ho showed that by reading the context it changed the substance of the paragraphs referred to. This was admitted by the canon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lawyer: “Can you name any instances where the reading of these books has had the effect stated f”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Canon: “No.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lawyer: “In the great division of the people at Armageddon—and remember, there are only two sides—which side do the books advocate the people to get on?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Canon: “What is Armageddon?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This was answered by the lawyer, and then the canon replied, “I believe the people are urged to take their stand on the Lord’s side.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Later on, the prosecutor objected to so much cross-questioning, but the judge said, “Let him continue; this is intensely interesting. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This case was appealed and is now due to come before the Supreme Court. The expenses involved through these court proceedings, lawyers’ fees, and other additional expenditures, are very heavy. All these disbursements are met by the Society, because the witness to the Kingdom must go on and the Baal worshipers be given opportunity to don their garments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We pray for the time when Jehovah will fully expose the Hierarchy and ‘make them small before the nations’, and turn their pride to shame, and bring hurt to them as they have done to Jehovah’s name and to his faithful people. All haste now is being made to hurry to the rescue of the multitude as Joshua did to the Gibeonites. Every effort is being put forward to contact quickly all those who’ show interest, and those who are isolated, with Jehovah’s organization. The brethren in the companies and the pioneers are co-operating in a splendid way so that all the brethren and the interested shall be compact in one body. There is no time for anything else today but to hurry on with the King’s business, and we are mighty glad that Jehovah has granted to us these privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year, the total output of literature for Canada has been 153,885 bound books; 902,637 booklets; making a total of 1,056,522 pieces of literature. The abnormal output of bound books is accounted for by the fact that over half of this output is made up of the one book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Biches.</span><span class="font3"> This has totaled 80,336. There has been an increase in the output of bound books of 37,491 over last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Field service report for companies and servants: There has been an average of 2,110 publishers monthly, and this has meant during the whole year that the hours devoted have been 224,720; also 26,914 hours spent in using the sound equipment. This work has resulted in the placing of 55,629 books and 713,834 booklets with the public, making a grand total of 769,463 pieces of literature. The machines reported in use were 544, and the message preached in the hearing of 587,338 persons. The electrical transcription machines are doing fine work, heralding the good news far and wide. By this means the public have been able to hear the great message broadcast on February 23 from Los Angeles, “Separating the Nations,” as well as other lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers : The zeal of these brethren manifests that they love Jehovah with all their heart, mind, soul and strength. Some find it necessary to leave the pioneer service during the winter months, but the majority of the pioneers fight on through the heat and the intense cold, seeking all the time to make known the praises of Jehovah. They have maintained an average of 152 in the field monthly, and put in a total of 205,819 hours, placing with the public 68,398 bound books and 364,504 booklets, a grand total of 432,902 pieces of literature. Equipped with 109 sound machines, 6,770 sound hours were reported, and the lectures were given in the hearing of 195,808 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The reports received from these brethren show that they appreciate their privilege very highly, and count it the greatest honor to be in the service of the Lord and have his approval. The conditions under which these brethren serve during the winter season in this country can be appreciated to some extent by the following experience:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘ ‘ The snow is now quite deep and roads are impassable for a car. I had no means of conveyance and did not wish to work city territory, so I got a hand-sleigh to haul my phonograph and books around and have been working rural territory. During the whole of December I worked in a solid Roman Catholic district, traveling on foot and pulling my sleigh. It was very slow work, but many Catholics took books from me and enjoyed the lectures on the phonograph. I placed 67 bound books and 238 booklets during that month. Please find enclosed four </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions from four Catholics.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society has in use a boat working down the British Columbia coast, and it is doing splendid work reaching places that would be otherwise absolutely impossible to reach. One interesting experience is quoted from a letter received from the brother in charge of the boat:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘ ‘ In our work by boat along the B.C. coast, we are finding the Outdoor Public Address equipment a very efficient instrument in reaching the people. &quot;With this equipment we reach by far the majority of the people living in these parts, and we find the volume all that could be desired. Some of our experiences during the past month seem well worth repeating, and have given us added incentive to use the equipment at every possible opportunity. At F---- there is a population</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of 100, including a logging camp with a crew of some 70 men, and also some settlers up the valley. We were refused permission by the one in charge of the camp to get in touch with the men because no one was permitted in the camp, it being private property. So we used the sound equipment from the boat and put on the lecture ‘Shall the Truth Be Suppressed?’ and briefly mentioned over the microphone the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">fact of our refusal The lecture could be heard </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">mile and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">half up the valley as clear as a bell. A couple of the settlers headed for the bay looking for the origin of the voice, and when told whence it came and what it was, they said they had begun to think they had gone nuts, as the voice seemed to come from everywhere and yet that was impossible. The Catholic priest was in the camp at the time, staying at </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">home only some 300 yards away from our boat and must have heard the entire lecture, for the lady at whose home he was staying promised she would open up the windows so that the priest would be certain to hear. She has shown herself very friendly towards the truth, and expressed herself as tired of having to look after these priests whenever they come around. She took some books and said she would have to hide them until the priest left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ At a large Indian village on------island, we had rather</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">an amusing reception. Arrived later than we had intended and anchored just over half a mile away and put on the lecture ‘Jehovah Is God’. It was too dark for them to see us and the entire population rushed out of doors to hear, and the general conclusion reached was that the voice was coming from the graveyard and it must be the last days. Two young bucks dared further than the rest, and by the time the lecture was over they had managed to locate us, and when we spoke they came aboard. Both were absolutely soaked with perspiration, but were as tickled as kids on hearing just what it was all about. Missionaries have been very active here for many years, but, as usual, knowledge of the Bible is not what they have sought to instill, and the natives here still continue to practice black magic to quite an extent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Two pioneers working in northern British Columbia report the following interesting experiences:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘‘On the previous night we rose at midnight to cross the ------ river bridge, which threatened to give way, only to be caught by the main force of the flood; so we are bottled up until such time as the excitement is over. The present flood is the highest and most widespread of any within the memory of the oldest inhabitants, native or white. The Indian villages of K----and G---- are inundated, and the entire</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">population moved to higher ground. Some have anchored their houses with ropes and cables to try and save them. All available men were hastily organized into relief crews to assist in the rescue work. We have shared in all this, as we were caught in more or less the same fix; food supplies had to be brought to those forced from their homes. At one place we stopped to give a broadcast to a bunch of Indians who had piled all their rescued belongings among the rocks and woods, beside the road. They seemed completely at their</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">wits’ end. AU listened carefully, and the program was en</span><span class="font3">joyed by all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another pioneer writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘‘Quite often prejudice is replaced with interest. One businessman in T----, who two years ago had refused me</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">a hearing, was the first to step forward and voice his appreciation, and asked for the books. The hotelkeeper in the same place exclaimed, ‘Congratulations for tone and volume.’ He walked away with the books </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> under his arm. At F---- we broadcast ‘World Becovery’ at 9 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Next morning a businessman said, ‘We heard you fine. My wife didn’t agree with you, so we argued until after 1: 00 a.m., but I’m going to read up on these things. ’ He took 15 bound and 13 lectures. I feel that only the Lord’s method of presenting the truth so clearly made this possible. Another man said, ‘I’m certainly glad you came, for you have spoken the truth.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘‘At another place we called just in time to interrupt an argument amounting to almost physical combat. A man very interested in the truth was told by another that we were collecting money for our broadcasts and selling books at a profit, whereupon man No. 1 was going to show him where to get off. It was a delicate situation, but we were able to definitely settle the question, and I never before witnessed a man getting such a scathing denunciation as man No. 2, who was, of course, not able to substantiate his statements with facts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The following letter is to the point on the value of the phonograph:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘‘I have a phonograph now, and every day I see the value of it. Am just thrilled through every time I play it. I feel it is our most valuable way of giving testimony, and I have only once played it that I have not had a placement, and that was where they were Latter-day Saints. I had the joy of playing it twice last week where there was a death, and seven people heard it in one house, and the words were so comforting and better put together to fit the situation than I could ever do. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Auxiliary publishers: These brethren have continued to have a share in the work to a very large extent. Thirty have taken part, and have placed 5,428 books, 40,480 booklets; totaling 45,908 pieces of literature. The hours devoted have been 18,601. There were 11 sound machines in their possession, and they have witnessed to 5,336 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Summary report of field service: The summary for the field activity in Canada shows an average of 2,292 publishers engaged monthly; the hours devoted, 449,140, and a total of 1,248,273 pieces of literature placed. 664 sound machines were </span><span class="font3">in use, and the message preached to 788,482 people. These figures help to appreciate that while individually there may not appear to be very much accomplished, yet, when taken collectively, a mighty flood of truth is rushing forward, and a great witness being given to Jehovah’s praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bethel family, Toronto: During the past year, the Bethel family have joyfully engaged in the service, and the results show 2,234 hours of witnessing, or an average of 17.1 hours per publisher per month. An average of 4.4 bound books and 68 booklets were placed by each one monthly. The results for the year, as compared with those of the previous year, show a splendid increase in every way. The hours are 2,234, as against 1,282, and the bound books 634, as against 290. The new phonographs are greatly appreciated by the family, each member possessing his own, and they would feel strange going to the homes of the people without it. In order to properly equip themselves for service, in conducting </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> studies, as much time as possible is devoted to careful study of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and other publications. The instructions from the Lord concerning the Kingdom work equips the brethren to serve the surrounding companies. With the ever-increasing opportunities for engaging in the Kingdom work, each one is happy to find ample use for all his time in the service of our King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Regional servants: Four regional men have been regularly engaged in the service, and one working part time amongst the foreign brethren. To carry forward this service the cost to the Society has been $5,221, but the service of these brethren is much appreciated by the companies. In addition, brethren from this office have served the companies. All this service resulted in a total of 469 appointments during the year, and 87,712 miles traveled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The regional servants organize the brethren for service, and where possible gather together the newly interested and bring them into line for activity. They have taken their share in the assemblies arranged, conducted funerals, and have been used of the Lord to assist in various other company business. Three of the regionals use the highly powered transcription machines, and lectures are given on every occasion possible. They spent 517 hours in sound work, and lectures were given in the hearing of 63,386 people. 2,496 hours were spent in door-to-door witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Witness periods: During the year the six special periods, into which we have fully entered, resulted in an enormous output of literature. Many of the interested make a special point of taking a share in these campaigns. These witnessing periods, with their encouraging Scriptural designations, have been a real source of encouragement and strength to the brethren for the future work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Radio: During the past year, five radio stations in Canada have been broadcasting the message of the Kingdom as contained in the Society’s publications. This has been done despite the opposition. The enemy has not been successful in shutting off this means of publishing the news of the Kingdom. In addition, the lectures which are given over the American stations reach the Canadian listeners regularly and, to advertise these stations, well over one million folders have been distributed amongst the people of Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watchtower subscriptions: We all appreciate daily, if not hourly, the food Jehovah supplies through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> and constantly give thanks to him for the light, strength and joy we continue to enjoy by reason of his bounty. It is very pleasurable to see that the subscriptions for this journal have increased by 507 over the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Golden Age subscriptions: Subscriptions for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> have increased by 361, but, in addition to this, the issues sent in bulk to the brethren, apart from regular subscriptions, show an increase of 4,974 over the past year. Without doubt, the information concerning the lectures and the persecutions upon Jehovah’s anointed, the fight against the Hierarchy, and the continual exposing of this abominable system through the pages of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font3"> have accounted for the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In conclusion, we are very grateful for every privilege of service granted to us by Jehovah, and are doing with our might what our hands find to do, knowing well that faithfulness in the Kingdom interests today will receive the approval of Jehovah and we shall be counted worthy to witness the vindication of his glorious name and the end of all wickedness. Gladly we go forward, singing his high praises, and march to the battle shouting, “The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon.’’</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>CENTRAL EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Since William Tell broke the Roman Catholic power in Switzerland that nation has operated as a republic. That has been for more than a thousand years. For a long while greater freedom was enjoyed in that country than in others round about where the Roman Catholic power exercised its authority. In recent months the Hierarchy has become more bold, arrogant and cruel in its action in Switzerland, and the so-called “Protestants” have followed with them because of their fear of man. The opposition in Switzerland has become much greater for this reason during the past twelve months. The Nazis have come over from Germany and attempted to make it more difficult for the truth to be proclaimed. They have caused suits to be filed against the Society’s representatives in Switzerland, charging the Society with the circulation of trash literature, and that case was heard recently. It was decided in favor of the Society. Thereupon the Hierarchy began a campaign of abuse against the court before whom the case was heard. This is a sample of its efforts to browbeat the people and hold them in subjection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society maintains at Berne, Switzerland, its chief office for Central Europe, and that office performs service work under the supervision of the Society’s executive at Brooklyn for the following countries in addition to Switzerland, to wit: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, France, Holland, Hungary, Italy, Yugoslavia, Luxemburg, Poland, Rumania, and the Saar region. Recently Germany has been put under the supervision of the Central European office; but little can be done in Germany. The total distribution of books within the foregoing territory aside from Germany during the last year is, to wit: Bound books, 158,288; small books, 2,053,216. It is difficult to get any definite report from Germany, but the information obtainable shows that the brethren have put out in that country, and that under the most adverse conditions existing anywhere on earth, a total number of books and booklets, to wit, 452,840. In addition to the distribution of books in Central European territory, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> magazine to the number of 813,409 copies has been circulated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the activities within this territory are separately reported herein, the above figures apply generally to the entire territory, the report merely giving the salient features of the work performed within that district. Compared with the witness work accomplished in this territory for the year 1935, there was a reasonable increase for the fiscal year ending September, 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the fiscal year just ended the sound equipment was increased and meetings in which the discourses were given by such electrical sound equipment were held to the number of 6,148, to an audience totaling 158,130. The sound equipment for Switzerland and adjoining territory is produced at our own factory. Also the records are made there. Thus is afforded an entry into the homes, and a better way of transmitting the Kingdom message to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses at the instance of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the Society’s representative at the Central European office says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have a record of nearly every case where our brethren have been persecuted, where the brethren were ill-treated, where some were killed, as the Lord prophesied, and where others were imprisoned. In Germany, during the last few weeks, more than 1,000 brethren were again imprisoned, yet the witness work continues and the brethren in that land receive the food in due season. Not counting Germany, more than 2,000 days were spent in jail by brethren in Central Europe; yet the work of tho Lord goes grandly on and nothing can deter the zeal or quench the love of the faithful remnant. One brother returning to Germany from the Lucerne convention, and who is serving the Lord faithfully in that country, reported that our German brethren are not discouraged, but say with Esther: “ If I perish, I perish. ’ ’ Many of these faithful brethren, who have faced death and other dangers, are a great inspiration to us all. We know that we are under the Lord’s protection and that the Lord is leading his faithful army to certain victory. United with all our brethren throughout the world and feeling very close to them all in this day of battle, we follow our Leader joyfully and are confident of certain victory. Herewith follows a table showing the results of the work of this year in all countries under the jurisdiction of this office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the work in the countries above mentioned may be readily discerned, reference is had to the following abbreviated report:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The countries aforesaid are now here considered separately and based upon information received and the reports submitted by the Society’s representative in each of the countries respectively,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy controls Austria and has during the year exercised its power in a cruel and fiendish manner. Some idea can be obtained by reference to the excerpts from the local representative’s report as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the war the Catholic ruler of the house of Hapsburg, which house ruled in Europe for centuries, was overthrown in Austria-Hungary, and a more liberal form of government was maintained until the Catholic bishop, Seipel, prepared the way in Vienna for a Catholic corporate state according to the plan hatched out by the Vatican. Under the Catholic chancellor, Dollfuss, a great massacre took place and thousands were killed or imprisoned at the instigation of the Catholic Hierarchy. Then, with the rise of the Catholic government and power in Austria, the opposition against the truth and against the freedom of the people increased in the same ratio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In July 1935 the Society’s branch office was closed and the Society in Austria dissolved by order of the State according to the same Jesuitical method which is followed by the ‘ ‘ Catholic Action” throughout the world. Although the false governmental authorities assured the American embassy and the Society that the Society could appeal to the courts, we received at the same time a reply from the Federal Court that our complaint could not be entertained for the reason that a dissolved Society cannot enter complaint in court. However, on October 1, 1935, the Society submitted a statement to the Vienna government containing, among other things, the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1. The matter of dissolving the Society must be decided by the federal court of administration. 2. Jehovah’s witnesses, formerly called “Bible Students”, have the right as other Austrian citizens to practice their faith according to the rules laid down in the Constitution and in the treaty of St. Germain. 3. Jehovah’s witnesses may, further, in their home, study the books and booklets published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, and they may order them as individuals in their own name and pass them on to like-minded persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although with interference, these points are acquiesced in by the rulers, because the Austrian government does not wish to advertise the fact that the Catholic Hierarchy really has seized the government and is the most intolerant institution on earth. Several times when the brethren have gathered in their homes for study, the police have swooped down upon them and taken them to headquarters, but when it was determined that it was not a political meeting, the police offered excuses, released the brethren and the literature, including Bibles. On the other hand, a number were arrested and imprisoned for proclaiming the message of the Kingdom. This happened particularly at Salzburg, where a bishop rules supreme and where brethren were imprisoned for months. Others lost their positions for refusing to join political organizations. True to their tactics of ruthless force, they seize upon little children. Children who are neither Catholic nor Protestant are being forced to join that religion which the parents adhered to at the time the child was born. The children of the brethren refused to take part in religious service at the school and the parents were then told that the children would be taken away from them by force and that they would be brought into a Catholic institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A number of brethren traveling together from Lucerne were asked by the officials, when crossing the line into Austria: “Are you Catholics, Protestants or Bible Students?” It appears from this that shortly only Catholics may travel freely in Austria. As a witness a protest against this ruthless, devilish “Catholic Action” will be entered with the League of Nations, which is supposed to guarantee the Austrian Constitution and the treaty of St. Germain, which is supposed to stand for liberty of faith and conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, while Austria is sinking into darkness and despair, the brethren and the Jonadabs are rejoicing in the light, and they exclaim with David, ‘ ‘ Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.”—Psalm 23: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Leoben, a shipment containing nothing but Bibles was confiscated and these Bibles were not released. They were not delivered nor returned to the sender. The publishers in Austria under great stress and difficulty worked 28,409 hours despite the opposition, distributed 4,064 books, 57,941 booklets, 414 Bibles, and 53,174 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> copies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark134"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Society maintains a depot at Brussels, Belgium. The witness work there is done under difficulties because of the opposition that proceeds from the Catholic Hierarchy. There is a large Catholic population, many of whom are sincere, and into the hands of these during the past year there has been distributed literature to the amount of 150,833 pieces. The inhabitants of Belgium use three languages, namely, French, Flemish and German. Many foreigners are employed in the mines, and it is therefore necessary to have in Belgium literature in 17 different languages. The pioneers in that country are required to travel chiefly by bicycle. They necessarily lead a strenuous life, but they are joyfully engaging in the service, pushing on with a zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Machines</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The electrical sound equipment has accomplished considerable in Belgium during the year. While there have been only three transcription machines in action, a large number of phonographs have been used. These have been kept busy. One pioneer worked in the mines at night and then put in a part of his daytime in operating the transcription machine. To be sure, Jehovah’s witnesses in Belgium do not ask for a permit to preach the gospel, nor do they receive one. In order, however, that their position may be properly understood, the following is quoted from the report of the local representative of the Society:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Belgium everyone going from house to house has to procure daily a commercial license from the police. We are not asking for this permission, because we are carrying out God’s commandment. Formerly we lost time giving explanation to the authorities regarding our work, and therefore we wrote to the Ministry as follows: “We request a confirmation in writing that our voluntary missionary work with books explaining the Bible is free and that our activity does not come under the law of commerce or under the law of canvassing for commercial purposes. ’ ’ We received this confirmation and have furnished a copy to each publisher. As long as we have the opportunity, we will do our best. The political conditions, however, are threatening, since the new ‘ ‘ Rex ’ ’ party, the Belgian Fascism, naturally Catholic, is more or less progressing. A journalist of this party has ordered all of our books.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark136"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses, by his grace, carry on the work in Czechoslovakia in six different languages, to wit: Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, German, Russian and Rumanian. In addition to this work there is some English literature placed, but very little. The witnesses in that land have pushed forward with the work during the year with a real zeal, and there have joined with the remnant Jonadabs to the number of 400, and these are still increasing in number. The publishers in that country have increased twenty percent during the year. There was a twenty-percent increase in the distribution of literature during the year. The subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> published in the Czech language have increased fifty percent during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two sound cars, 13 transcription machines and 62 phonographs have been active during the year, bearing testimony to listeners to the number of 76,969.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is quite probable that a greater witness is being given amongst the Russian-speaking people in Czechoslovakia than in any other part of the earth just at the present time. The only opposition to the proclamation of the Kingdom message in that country is from the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. This is further evidence that “Catholic action”, as it is called by the Hierarchy, is exhibiting itself in a strong manner in every part of the earth. This crowd of religionists are impressed with the fact that the time has come for them to rule the world. They may have a little season cf prosperity, but it will not last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year sixteen regional service conventions were held, in which the brethren participated as well as in the field service during the convention. Says the local representative of the Society: “The importance of redeeming the time is emphasized, and both the remnant and Jonadabs are asked how many hours they will work in the service. The result has been surprising. A large number of the publishers work not only Sundays, but also during the week as they have opportunity. Punctuality at the meetings is urged as well as at the service assemblies, and this is observed .and time is saved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some printing is done in Czechoslovakia, and the purpose is to do other printing there if we ean remove our machines from Germany. This removal has been hindered greatly by the secret police. The German crowd that rules at the present time is absolutely unreliable: says one thing, and does another.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark137"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark138"></a>DANZIG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">When the League of Nations reconstructed the map of Europe, what is known as the ‘‘District of the Free City of Danzig” was formed. The Nazis of Germany, however, control it today. This element, which, of course, is backed up by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, has heaped a great amount of indignities and persecution upon Jehovah’s witnesses in that land. During the year the Society’s office was closed, property confiscated and much of it destroyed, and many of the witnesses subjected to terrible persecution at the hands of secret police and other officials, all this taken upon the advice of the secret police in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the Danzig government was illegally overthrown, the commissioners appointed by the League of Nations were ousted, and men now supported by the Nazis of Germany rule. Necessarily this has decreased the distribution of our literature in that land; but it has not'at all dampened the zeal of the Lord’s people. In the face of this wicked persecution they have gone forward with greater courage and determination than heretofore. The number of witnesses has been reduced, but those who stay on the firing line by the grace of the Lord show increased zeal and determination to represent God and his kingdom. The people in general have respect and consideration for the witnesses of Jehovah. It is estimated now that each family in the entire area has received on the average thirteen pieces of literature published by the Society. The people show such consideration that often one piece of literature is passed from one to another for the poor to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the phonograph has been used to good advantage. Eighty meetings were held at which the lectures have been given over the phonograph, and this has awakened a number of persons of good will. Some of the younger people and children have shown keen interest in the Lord’s work and participated in the witness in the field, and six of these recently were arrested, fined, and the oldest one of them sentenced to a prison term of three months. This is the Catholic spirit, that is, the spirit shown by the Jesuits and others of the Hierarchy. They have no respect for man, woman or children, but arc maliciously against every one who is on the side of Jehovah and his Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Protest</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the Lord’s people in the land circulated a petition in protest against the opposition to the Kingdom message, which petition was presented to the high commissioner of the League of Nations. But that body has done nothing. The commissioner even refused to receive the representatives of the Society. The petition emphasized the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses are not asking the League of Nations for help, but protesting against the cruel and wicked treatment heaped upon them and at the same time giving warning to those who participate in the persecution. The League of Nations is of no effect in Danzig now. During the year the Society’s representative in Danzig was expelled from the country. Another man was appointed as his successor, who is a citizen of Danzig, and recently he has been arrested. No legal charges can be, placed against him, except that he is for Jehovah’s kingdom. He is now held in some secret prison, and the secret police who have him in custody refuse to tell his wife or children where he is. Such is a sample of the persecution emanating from the Hierarchy and that crowd.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Society maintains an office and a Bethel home in Paris, from which the work of witnessing to the people is carried forward. The number of publishers in the field during the year has increased, and these include at least 150 Jonadabs who have joined in the work. Because of the uncertain, disturbed political conditions existing in France, the work has been somewhat retarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These faithful witnesses, the pioneers, meet with increasing opposition from the clergy, who go about and warn the people to refuse to read the literature that they receive. A number of pioneers have been working in the field during the year who are unable to speak the French language, but they carry with them a card on which the testimony in French is printed, and this seems to work even better than talking too much. It is exceedingly regrettable to here state that during the year the Society’s local representative did not co-operate with the pioneers as he should; but this matter has been remedied and it is expected that conditions will be improved so far as this is concerned. Most of the pioneers travel about on their bicycles, carrying their literature and the phonograph which they use to interest the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year transcription machines and phonographs to the number of eighty-seven have been employed, and this has added an impetus to the witness work. Some of the brethren work in the coal mines and carry with them their phonographs and use them to proclaim the Kingdom message to other mine workers. In one mine a transcription machine was installed for several days and all the records were reproduced for the benefit of the miners. The following experiences of interest recounted by the Society’s representative are here set out:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One publisher found an old lady all alone in a certain home. She refused the publications because ‘she could not believe any longer in God, who had taken her son during the war, although she had gone to church every day and had prayed for him daily’. She would not be comforted, but she permitted a record to be played for her. As soon as she had heard the first part, concerning the resurrection, she changed, and with tears in her eyes she invited the brother to place the machine outside of her home, where she then invited her neighbors and called for another lecture to be given. Thankfully she then took two books and several booklets, and those present also received literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The most important events during the year were two radio lectures, the first in English by Brother Rutherford from Los Angeles, retransmitted by three stations here, and which were well received everywhere, and the second radio lecture transmitted by Radio Lyon in April in the German language on “Separating the Nations’’, which was received by hundreds in this country and by thousands outside of France. It is known that this German lecture was listened to by agents of the German government at Berlin; thus a German lecture was given by a French station as an evidence of Jehovah’s power and guidance of His work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the radio has been used to good advantage, at least three stations broadcasting the Kingdom message regularly. A total of 282 lectures was given by radio during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year an exhibition was held in Paris, at which the literature of the Society was exhibited. Again it is the pleasure of the Society to report that the secretary-general of the Central Office for Expositions, under date of June 24, sent a very pleasing letter to our office, advising that the exposition had awarded the grand prize to the Society for its publications, both in appearance and in contents. This is acknowledged with thanks, and is a further evidence that the truth has been proclaimed in the presence of those who exercise some authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It seems quite certain that the Nazis and Fascists, which are one and the same organization, engineered by the Hierarchy, are desperately trying to start a revolution in France, and, if so, this will necessarily retard the witness work there for the time being.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Because of the activity of the secret police of Germany, which are the sleuths of the Hierarchy persecuting the Lord’s witnesses, not a great deal has been accomplished during the year, and much of the witness work that has been carried on has been done secretly and it is impossible for us to report the same. About 300 brethren attended the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses at Lucerne the early part of September, and almost all of these were arrested when they returned to their homes, and since it is reported that some of them were murdered. It is estimated that still there are approximately 6,000 who continue to carry on the witness work in the best manner possible. They do this individually, of course, because they cannot organize and cannot work under the direct supervision of the Society, since the German government has dissolved the corporate organization in that country. A faithful brother in Germany transmits to the Society, amongst other things, the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Great was the wrath of the enemy upon the faithful in this country during the past year. Many brethren were dismissed from their jobs simply for being Jehovah’s witnesses. Every human support was taken away from them, and often they were arrested, simply for the fact that it was made known that they are Jehovah’s witnesses. A number of brethren were mistreated in a most brutal and cruel way by certain members of the Gestapo (Secret Police), and several were done to death. Reports of these most wicked and most cruel persecutions, which hark back to the days of the Spanish Inquisition, are being published in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font3"> not against the German people, but for the sake of the Lord, his truth and our brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After the Lucerne convention it was reported that the Gestapo had given orders to arrest by the 8th of September all of Jehovah’s witnesses who had been active in any way in the witness work. Thus during the past weeks a large number of brethren were again thrown into prison and into concentration camps. However, more than 300 German brethren attended the Lucerne convention and gave remarkable testimonies to Jehovah’s honor. Some who intended to come were arrested when they asked for their passports, others had to give up their passports, but the blessing of the Lord upon those attending, and which they passed on to others when they got home, made up for the sufferings. Several reports are missing on account of recent arrests, but the reports at hand show that approximately 6,000 brethren continued the witness work and they distributed approximately 452,840 books and booklets during the past year. The brethren receive </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> regularly and are strengthened by Jehovah’s grace to remain steadfast and to glorify Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A copy of the resolution passed at the Lucerne convention was dispatched to Mr. Hitler, and an acknowledgment of reception from his office at Berlin was received.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark143"></a>HOLLAND (THE NETHERLANDS)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It is gratifying to note that the work in Holland continues to progress and that there is a healthy increase. The electrical transcription machines and phonographs have added considerably to the witness work during the year. One thousand and forty-two meetings have been held with these electrical appliances, which has given a wide witness to the people throughout Holland. Concerning the work in that land the Society’s local representative says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The activity of the pioneers in Holland shows an extraordinary zeal. A Hollandish pioneer averages per month 141 hours in the service and 47 hours’ travel. The efforts of several pioneers show that some worked 200 hours a month and that they traveled 2,000 kilometers in 100 hours of travel. There are two pioneer homes, and each uses one car to cover the more distant territory in the summer, and the near territory in the winter. When the distance is too far, they camp in tents for the night in order to save the time for travel. Two brothers have a trailer on their bicycle to carry the necessary literature, a tent and other utensils, in order to camp out during the summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One group was very successful with the sound car, with which they traveled to Lucerne and witnessed in several countries on the way. The Lucerne papers mentioned the Hollandish sound car in connection with the convention report. All together, there were 33 pioneers and 9 auxiliaries, who worked 61,092 hours, traveled 419,816 kilometers in 18,717 hours of travel, and distributed 20 Bibles, 9,520 books, 101,373 booklets and 37,890 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> copies, and obtained 139 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> subscriptions.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The country of Hungary is another place where the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has long held sway and held the people in darkness. There has always been opposition in Hungary to anything that would enlighten the people concerning the Word of God. Amidst this cruel opposition, Jehovah’s witnesses with courage have pushed forward in the work. From the report of the local representative the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The enemy has done what he could to hinder the work. There were many arrests and confiscations of literature and cases of cruel persecutions. Except in three towns, all meetings are forbidden by the police, but the witnesses have not lost their confidence and courage and have continued with greater zeal and faith. In Hungary there never was real liberty to proclaim the truth as is true of the western countries. Nevertheless, 70 companies and isolated ones have taken part in the preaching of the gospel which alone is the hope of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One thousand and sixty persons partook of the Memorial, and most of these have done some service, although in the regular monthly reports only 207 publishers are reported. The 207 regular publishers worked 50,310 hours and distributed 212,484 books and booklets during the past year. Seventeen pioneers and 6 auxiliary pioneers are also engaged in the service. Some of these are of foreign nationality, and they are pioneers in the truest sense of the word. They generally get only permission to remain three months in the country and then they travel to another country. Realizing the hardships and the unsettled political conditions in Europe, it must be said that the pioneers are very courageous and faithful soldiers of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These pioneers worked 27,356 hours and placed 6,869 books and 89,920 booklets, and 9,060 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> copies and 122 Bibles. This means 80 percent more than last year. Many of them spent a number of days in prison, and five of these pioneers were arrested on the way to the Lucerne convention when they passed through German territory. The branch servant was also arrested. Several service conventions were held. Concerning </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the last one, held at Budapest, August 20, the branch servant reported as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“They had come from all sections of the country. Thanks to the Lord, the spiritual condition of those present was much better than last year. It is quite certain that in Hungary in the companies there are qjiite a number of hangers-on who will not survive the coming storms. In many companies the brethren appeared to have still the Elijah spirit, and they are not equipped for the work of this day. Last year, at the service convention, one could see certain “pastoral’' things and ideas, but that is now gone. The discourses were timely, in accordance with recent </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> articles, and the declaration meeting gave evidence that the old Pilmer-brother system is dying out. Brethren in peasant attire engaged in the house-to-house service in Budapest, and within a short time 300 booklets and 50 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font3">copies were distributed by forty publishers. That was the first united action in Budapest. Fifteen Jonadabs were then immersed in the Danube. It was also resolved to write to Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ ‘More than 100 witnesses of Jehovah from all sections of Hungary, on the occasion of this service convention at Budapest, express their desire, as Jeremiah, in their corner of the prison court, not to be silent, but to testify openly as Jehovah has commissioned his people. We are determined, by Jehovah’s grace, not to allow the Philistines to rule over us, but to be blindly devoted, faithful subjects to Jehovah God and to His great King, Jesus Christ. For your faithful service we have great appreciation, and wish to say that we are fully united with you and all our brethren throughout the world, and in this spirit we convey to you cordial greetings and our best wishes.’ ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of course, the work in Hungary had to be supported financially in order that the poor in that country might have an opportunity to learn of the coming deliverance through God’s kingdom. For the first time, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> was published in the Hungarian language; and thereby many persons of good will have been brought into touch with the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a limited way the sound service work has begun also, and many families in Hungary have heard the truth about God’s kingdom for the first time from the records on the phonographs.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>LUXEMBURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The small province of Luxemburg has received its share of the witness during the fiscal year. It has been done amidst cruel opposition from the enemy led by the Hierarchy, but this has not prevented the faithful ones from bearing the name of Jehovah before the people. Approximately double the amount of literature was distributed during the past year compared with that of the previous year. The local representative in his report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year, we have had to work more distant territory and have traveled often from six to eight hours on our bicycles going to and coming from our territory. Looking back, we see that the Lord has given us much and that he requires the more of us. With the joy of battle, we look forward to the coining year, confident of the Lord’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are three companies in our little country, counting, all together, 29 brethren. Nineteen of these are regular publishers, and two, Jonadab workers. During the six special testimony weeks, we accomplished fifty percent of the work of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Phonograph activity: On account of the interference of the Catholic clergy we have not done much along this line as yet, but hope to use the autumn and wintertime more for this activity. We have now one transcription machine and three phonographs in the service, and several hundred people have listened to the lectures given in that manner. There was one regional service convention, the 17th of May, 1936, at Esch, which was a great encouragement to us all. Eighty brethren and friends were gathered, and in the evening there was a public meeting attended by 120 persons.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Beset by many difficulties, facing cruel opposition, the work in Poland has moved steadily forward. There has been an increase of 40 companies during the year, which arc now thoroughly organized for the work. At least forty other smaller companies are receiving instruction. The distribution of the literature throughout the year has been far better than in the year previous. The organized service weeks have resulted particularly to the advantage of those engaged in the service. United action not only encourages some, but enables them to get a better view of their work, and more has been accomplished. The clergy in Poland, as in other places, are not so popular with the common people, but they can still keep the common people in subjection by acting through the local politicians. The following excerpts from the local representative of the Society will be read with interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This part of the service has developed wonderfully and the brethren show great enthusiasm for this activity. The high and the lowly have thus received a thorough witness, and the most wonderful experiences are reported in this connection. It has happened frequently that the clergy have ordered men who were armed with hatchets and other utensils to destroy the phonographs and to threaten the brethren using them. However, when these men thus incited by the clergy heard the first words of the phonograph lecture, they observed that the lecture said more about God and his purpose than what they were accustomed to hear in the sermons of the priests. It so happened that the men who were ordered to injure the brethren became interested; they obtained literature and asked the brethren to come again with their phonographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A case in point follows herewith:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When a church procession passed through a village, a sister played a lecture record behind an open window with the intention of helping the ‘ ‘ prisoners ’ ’ passing by. This enraged the priest, and he entered a complaint against the sister. The sister was summoned to the court and her defense was so convincing that she was acquitted. She offered to play the incriminated record in court; this was refused, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the last four months in which the phonograph activity was organized, we held 588 meetings, which were attended by 8,843 listeners. Sixty phonographs are now in the service, and 542 lecture records were ordered, which are manufactured in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While the activity of the publishers is intensified, the hatred of the clergy naturally increases. Continually the brethren are haled into the courts on the pretext of violating the Sunday laws, the regulations re canvassing, re begging and other police regulations. In most cases, however, the proceedings are suspended, or the brethren are acquitted. The clergy thus realize that they cannot successfully hinder Jehovah’s witnesses, yet they continue their attacks obstinately; they molest the police authorities by telephone and by letter whenever they notice a publisher at work. The Catholic Action particularly is very aggressive in its opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One gets the impression that the opposition is meant to discourage, if possible, the activity. The matter becomes more difficult where the Catholic Action controls the courts. The accusation or the charge generally made is &quot;blaspheming God’’. Under this false charge brethren were condemned. In one case a Jonadab was accused of this &quot;crime’’ because he read a Scripture text to his natural brother in his own home; he read the text which shows that Jesus had brothers and sisters. The words were overheard by a neighbor who passed by and who had been commissioned to spy upon the brother, and the matter was then taken to court by the priest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the course of the year 68 cases were reported where brethren were beaten and ill-treated. 327 court cases are recorded, 73 of which were settled in our favor. Eight cases ended with a sentence re “blaspheming God”, but most cases were suspended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Devil sought to hinder the work greatly by causing the Polish edition of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> to be forbidden. The case is pending in court, and our appeal was partially upheld, in this, that the magazine may again be published. With joy and great enthusiasm we hold our ground in the battle and continue to do with our might what our hands find to do, not to please men, but to please and obey the Most High, helping the Gibeonites to learn the truth in order that they may be spared in the day of the Lord’s anger,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark150"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark151"></a>RUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">During the year Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions have suffered much in Rumania; but they have borne this with joy. Although the Devil, acting through his visible representatives, practically destroyed the witness work in Rumania a few years ago, still there are more than 2,500 persons that are going forward proclaiming the message of the Kingdom as they have opportunity. The Judas class, acting together with the Hierarchy, has increased the burdens of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses in that land. In the face of all this the distribution of literature to the common people is decidedly in excess of what it has been in any year for the past five years. The following is taken from the report of the local representative:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this country, in every village, the priests are the selfappointed representatives of the government. In many places the priest is also the mayor and sometimes the justice of the peace. In other little towns, the priest also holds the office of postmaster, and there the brethren do not get their mail, and this often furnishes a cause for their being persecuted. In some places the priests have organized the roughest men and have told them to take the brethren, when engaged in the service, to the priest by force, and the priest then turns the brethren over to the police. In. the Swiss </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> of the first of October, 1936, some of the most cruel persecutions instigated by the Roman Catholic clergy in Rumania were published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Public meetings are impossible, because Rumania is under a martial law and under severe censorship. However, there are 124 organized companies, and these often meet secretly for the study of God’s Word, and under great difficulties they have obtained, by Jehovah’s grace, a result in the distribution of the literature which is ten percent higher than the result last year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark152"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark153"></a>SAAR REGION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This small country has long been the bone of contention between Germany and France. It was held under the so-called protectorate of the League of Nations for some time, but during the year the Hitler regime held a fake election and succeeded in getting control of the Saar Region again. In the face of these political changes Jehovah’s witnesses continue to carry the message to the common people as the Lord graciously permits. When Germany took over the country, the promise was that everybody should enjoy liberty, but, of course, that promise was not kept. In recent months the persecution by the secret police has been carried on viciously. Immediately following the Lucerne convention, in September, thirty persons were arrested in the Saar Region by these secret police. When these brethren returned from the Lucerne convention, the secret police came at night and surrounded their homes and arrested them and imprisoned them. In the face of all this opposition, the population of the Saar Region, however, have received a fair warning and good testimony. The common people understand the purpose of Jehovah’s witnesses, and many of them listen gladly to the truth. In the face of such persecution spme of the brethren carry on earnestly and zealously, using discretion in going about amongst the people bearing testimony to them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark154"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark155"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It seemed to be the will of Jehovah several years ago to establish at Berne, Switzerland, the chief office for Central Europe and from there to have immediate direction of the work in several countries. This was done. The property was purchased and the factory built, the home established, and much work has been done. An American citizen is the Society’s representative, and has been there for some time, and has faithfully and earnestly carried forward the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In September a general convention was held at Lucerne, Switzerland, which was attended by persons from more than twenty countries. The Society’s local representatives of the various countries under the jurisdiction of the Berne office were there. A lengthy conference was held by them with the president of the Society in order that the work might be more efficiently carried forward in the various countries. The opposition developed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy against that convention and those who attended has heretofore been published in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> magazine, and is not repeated here, for that reason. That opposition, however, resulted in a greater witness in Switzerland and other places than could otherwise have been had. The honest and sincere people, Catholics as well as others, readily saw the wickedness on the part of the Jesuits and other officials of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and many of these were awakened to the danger that now threatens the liberties of all the peoples of the earth. Many persons of good will in Switzerland are being awakened, and these Jonadabs or “other sheep” of the Lord are rejoicing in their privilege to help in bearing the financial burden and also to carry the message in printed form to the people. This, together with the phonographs and the reproduction of lectures, brings the message to the attention of those who have a hearing ear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Farm</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Appreciating the ever-increasing difficulty of food supply it has been deemed necessary to acquire some land upon which food is produced for the Bethel fam-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ily at Berne, Switzerland. The local representative, therefore, acting under the instruction of the executive of the Society and by the aid of the brethren in Germany, acquired title to a piece of land on which much food is produced, and this enables the Bethel family at Berne to be supplied with good food at a less price. Some raise objection to this; but these objections are not well taken. Those who put in all their time in trying to produce the literature for others in the field to work must have some means provided for their physical welfare; and this is deemed to be the best thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society’s local representative, amongst other things in his report, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Switzerland is one of the oldest democratic republics, and yet the tendency is now to break away from the Constitution and to leave the ground of freedom and liberty for the people in matters of faith and conscience. A certain canton, where the Hierarchy has influence, demanded of the Cantonal Government in Berne that the office be closed and that the literature be confiscated. The Cantonal Government had sent a circular letter to the priests and preachers in that canton and to other officials asking their opinion concerning the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom,</span><span class="font3"> and they thought to make a case charging the representatives of the Society with violating the law concerning the defamation or desecration of a church recognized by the State. However, the Berne Government turned down the request and stated that they would not assume the responsibility for any measure against the Society and its work. Our knowledge concerning the secret action planned against the work in Switzerland reminds us of the case where Gideon overheard what the enemies said in the camp of the Midianites. Another severe attack was made when Nazi agents entered serious charges against two representatives of the Society of the Berne office on the 28th of May, 1936. The charges were based upon the law regarding trash literature and the law regarding desecration of religion. Brother Rutherford was present when the trial came off August 26 at Berne. The president of the Society had entered his testimony, as the author of the literature incriminated, and the accused also entered an overwhelming amount of proof that the charges were false and that the real purpose of the accusers was not to defend the churches or religion, but was to destroy the Lord’s work in Switzerland by using the same wicked methods which were used in the days of the Lord and his apostles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The full report of this interesting ease is published in the Swiss edition of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font3"> and some of it will probably be published in other issues of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font3"> It may suffice here to state that the case ended with a full victory all along the line. The accused were acquitted, and the opponents were ordered by the judge to pay 300 francs towards the costs of the defendants for their defense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The climax of the year was the convention at Lucerne, September 4-7, at which the president of the Society presided. A full report of the convention has been published also in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span><span class="font3"> We merely state here that the Lord’s blessing was richly manifest upon that convention. 3,500 brethren and Jona-dabs, from twenty countries, were present. 952 publishers engaged in the service in so-called ‘ ‘ Catholic ’ ’ territory. In 1,257 hours they placed 2 books and 12,215 booklets; 2,232 booklets were confiscated. 108 brethren were arrested, but soon released. The public meeting was forbidden by order of the Cantonal Government. They threatened to arrest the speaker, Judge Eutherford, and to stop the meeting by force; yet the meeting was held, the lecture was given, hundreds were outside of the hall, held back by the police, and these events, which were reported in the press, aroused thousands to think about the message of the Lord. Satan’s efforts were thwarted, and a grand witness was thus given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year a special effort was made for the distribution of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font3"> and thus 6,369 more books than last year were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The placement of books in Switzerland means a real sacrifice, because the literature must be donated freely, according to police regulations. However, the obtainers are privileged to give a voluntary contribution for the cause. Even this method is sometimes objected to, and thus the service work is rendered ever more difficult. Nevertheless, the brethren and Jonadabs have carried on with much joy and zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Obeying the word of Bevelation that “the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come: and whosoever will, let him take the water of Efe freely”, we approached the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> readers and called their attention to their privilege of participating in the work of the proclamation. By way of a special letter, we invited them to obtain the books and the booklets and to help in the distribution, as opportunity affords, to their friends and their acquaintances. This took some time and effort, but it was rewarded, in this, that more than 1,000 books and more than 4,000 booklets were ordered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sound service: The sound-service work has increased in </span><span class="font3">Switzerland also. 1,583 sound meetings were held, before 28,065 auditors. The attempt to invite the people into halls and give lectures to them by playing transcription records was not successful, for the attendance was meager. Now we have advised the brethren to employ the phonograplis; and this activity is developing marvelously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We now have 100 phonographs in the service, 22 transcription machines and 4 sound cars. The activity therewith is further developed and improved. A large number of lecture records were manufactured at the Berne office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A great day for the companies at Berne, Basle and Zurich was the day when Brother Rutherford's lecture from Los Angeles on “Separating the Nations” was received. The reception was excellent from beginning to end. We also received word from many isolated ones who reported the good reception of that lecture. A further event causing joy was the first German radio lecture transmitted via the Lyon station in France, on April 4. Letters from Lithuania, England, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Belgium and other places, even from the captain of the ship “Sirius” on the high seas, reached us, telling us that the lecture was heard well and that copies in print were desired. It was reported also that the lectures over the French radio stations are also received by the Nazi crowd at Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Resolution passed at Lucerne was dispatched to the pope and to Mr. Hitler. The Post Office furnished a written confirmation that both copies reached their destination at Vatican City and at Berlin. The Resolution follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Resolution at Lucerne</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Adopted unanimously)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s witnesses now assembled in Lucerne, Switzerland, having come from many parts of the earth to worship Jehovah in spirit and in truth, take this occasion to give thanks to the Almighty God, whose name alone is Jehovah, for his manifold blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Knowing full well that Jehovah always faithfully performs his promise, and that long centuries ago he promised that he would establish on earth his kingdom of righteousness with Christ Jesus as the world’s rightful Ruler; and now seeing from the fulfillment of prophecy that the day of Jehovah’s kingdom is here, we rejoice in the privilege of being his servants and his witnesses and we do declare our unqualified allegiance to the Almighty God and his kingdom, and delight to make known to suffering humankind that the kingdom of God under Christ is the only hope of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We fully appreciate that Satan is the great enemy of all who serve Jehovah God and that Satan has used religionists at all times to oppose and persecute those who worship God in spirit and in truth. For this reason many true followers of Christ Jesus are today prevented from attending this convention, they being held in restraint in Germany and in other places, not for wrongdoing, but because they serve God and Christ Jesus and declare his Word and his kingdom as God has commanded them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The law of Jehovah God is supreme. He is above all; and as Jesus and the apostles served God first, last, and all the time, and as they declared so we declare, we will obey God rather than men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We call all good people to witness that in Germany, Austria and other places Jehovah’s witnesses are cruelly persecuted, imprisoned, fiendishly abused, and many of them killed, and all such wickedness is done against them by a cruel, malicious, wicked power, incited so to do by the religious organization, to wit, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which for many years has deceived the people and blasphemed God’s holy name. The Hitler government, aided and incited by the Jesuits of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, has inflicted and continues to inflict all manner of cruel punishment upon true Christians even as Christ Jesus and his apostles were persecuted for righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God has commanded his servants to now give warning to such wicked ones (Ezekiel 33: 8,9) that full responsibility may rest upon the wicked for their wrongdoing, and for that reason we now sound the warning to the rulers in Germany and to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and to all like organizations that cruelly persecute the true and faithful followers of Christ Jesus, that the fate of such God declares is complete destruction. (Psalm 145:20) Jesus Christ, at Matthew 25, pronounces Jehovah’s judgment against such wicked persecutors who persecute the true followers and brethren of Christ Jesus, in these words: ‘Inasmuch as ye have done it to [cruelly ill-treated] the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels. These shall go into everlasting destruction. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We vigorously protest against the cruel treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and its allies in Germany and in all other parts of the world, but we are delighted to leave the end thereof entirely in the hand of the Lord God, who, according to his Word, will render a full recompense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We sound the warning to all mankind that if they would live they must refuse to give aid and support to religionists who persecute the true followers of Christ Jesus, and that they must take their stand on the side of righteousness and give heed to the words of Jehovah, to wit: ‘Behold my servant, whom I have chosen . . . He shall show judgment to the nations. . . . And in His name shall the nations hope. ’—Matthew 12: 18-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As the followers of Christ Jesus we have no part in and no interest in the political affairs of this world. Our sole purpose and commission is to make known the name and the kingdom of God under Christ, that the people may he informed and intelligently choose whom they will serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We send loving greetings to our persecuted brethren in Germany and bid them to be of good courage and to rely solely upon the promises of the Almighty God Jehovah, and Christ, and to remember the words of Jesus: ‘Shall not God avenge his elect shortly? He shall avenge them’ (Luke 18: 7, 8) ; and, further, the words of the Lord Jesus addressed to his faithful servants: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.’’ (Revelation 2: 10) Blessed is your lot that you are permitted to endure all manner of suffering for the sake of the name of Jehovah and his kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The everlasting peace, joy and life of the people depend entirely upon the great “Prince of Peace”, whose government will be administered in peace and righteousness.—Isaiah 9: 6, 7; 32: 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Resolved that a copy of this resolution be sent to Mr. Hitler and to the pope at Vatican City as the head of the Boman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year 174 police charges were made and 104 cases were taken to court, 40 of which were decided in our favor. Twenty-one days and 174 hours, all together, were spent in prison. Five cases of ill-treatment are reported, and the fines amounted to Fr. 1,360.75.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Last fall the Society placed the literature manufactured at Berne at an exposition near Berne, and thereupon the Society was awarded a special diploma or document.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An average of 63 publishers residing at the Berne office placed 3,035 books, 18,989 booklets, and 6,134 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font3">copies, in 4,990 hours of service. Although less hours could be spent in the field service by the brethren of the Berne office on account of the increased work in the office and in the printing factory, the same number of books as last year was distributed by the brethren of the Berne office in the house-to-house service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Eleven regional service conventions were held, with 1,400 taking part therein, and a four-day general convention with 3,500 attendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The prospect of continuing and increasing the proclamation of the Kingdom in Switzerland is good, and with very few exceptions the brethren in Switzerland are loyal and faithful. They realize fully the seriousness of the day of battle, and they are joyful and willing to obey the Lord and cany out his organization instructions. The unrest in the political world is affecting also Switzerland, the heart of Europe. The Catholic and also the Protestant clergy increase their efforts to influence the political rulers and to cause them to take measures against the work of publishing the truth. However, by the Lord’s grace, the brethren and Jonadabs in Switzerland are determined to press the battle to the gate. They rejoice in the privilege of having a part in this glorious battle, and they are determined to prove on their part that the Lord has men in Switzerland who will maintain their faithfulness under every condition.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark156"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark157"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The small country of Yugoslavia at one time was a part of Austria. The population of this country now is approximately 48 million, and amongst these people six different languages are spoken regularly. Thirty-nine percent of the population is Catholic, and in several of the counties the Hierarchy is strongly entrenched. After the assassination of the king the Hierarchy succeeded in gaining political supremacy in the country, and then the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses increased. The Society’s local representative in Yugoslavia, among other things, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From all pulpits in the Yugoslavian churches, the people were called upon by the clergy to turn “these pestiferous people with the books’’ at once over to the police. This warning was given, not only from the Catholic pulpits, but also by the Servian Orthodox church and by the Mohammedans. This shows clearly that the three leading confessions in Yugoslavia have entered into a conspiracy to destroy the Lord’s people. The initiative for this action naturally came from the Hierarchy, which from the beginning has opposed our activity violently; however, the faithful take no notice thereof. Courageously and determined, Jehovah’s people take their stand, knowing that they must obey the Lord and that if they prove themselves loyal and faithful they shall ever be under the sure protection of Jehovah. The conditions described here and the subsequent persecutions have only strengthened the faith of the little company of the Lord’s people in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus in Yugoslavia a general progress is again reported. Sixty-seven publishers were engaged regularly in the service, including 25 pioneers. Several backstanding groups were injured by the activity of the “evil servant” and withdrew. The present workers, however, show a good spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord’s blessing was visibly manifest upon all efforts. Neither the crisis nor the strong opposition of the clergy could dampen the zeal of the brethren. During these special testimony weeks alone, 34,610 books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people. In February we began in Slovenia with lectures illustrated by Creation-Drama slides. Five such lectures were held, until the clergy interfered and caused the authorities to take measures against the holding of the public lectures. Thereupon we commenced with the phonograph activity, which is quite successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A great incentive for the Croatian brethren is the fact that they may now read the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> articles in their own language. They are grateful for this provision, and this will help them to go forward in the battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As formerly reported, the road conditions and the transportation facilities are bad; yet it is pleasing to record that the hours of service increased from 28,010, last year, to 38,612, this year. The distribution of books increased 73 percent, and was 11,492. This year 86,718 booklets, an increase of 16,883, were distributed. For two months now, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> is being published in Croatian, and the pioneers have distributed more than 1,000 copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Notwithstanding many disagreeable and unpleasant working conditions, the average pioneer’s hours are 129; an average travel of 414 kilometers in 51 hours of travel. Several reached the amount of more than 200 hours of service a month, and in more than 100 hours of travel they covered more than 1,000 kilometers on foot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Several pioneers worked, this year, the most distant parts of this country and had to use more hours of travel than hours of service each day. Their lives were often threatened, when fanatical inhabitants and officials, incited by the clergy, drove them out of town and caused them to cross pathless mountain ranges and cross dangerous rivers; yet no word of complaint was found in their letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Repeatedly pioneers were arrested and the literature was confiscated, particularly where a Catholic priest was one of the officials. Now, however, the authorities themselves are beginning to see that the hypocritical Hierarchy is persecuting honest and good men. It often happens that the police, after the priest had departed, released the brethren and returned their literature to them saying: “We know that this is a good work, and we do not wish to disturb you in your activity, but often we have to act thus because they [the Hierarchy] are in control; but go on with your work, we have seen nothing.” Thus we see how the Hierarchy presents their poisonous cup to this people, a people which otherwise gladly hears the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark158"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It seems like a small thing when the work done in China is considered with the tremendous population living in that land; but when we have in mind that these people for many centuries have been deluded and caused to practice the devil religion, it is gratifying to know that the testimony is being given and even a few maintaining their integrity towards Jehovah. It appears quite certain from the facts that Jehovah is fulfilling the prophecy to bring some from the Orient who will maintain their integrity toward God and prove the Devil a liar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society maintains an office at Shanghai, China, and from that place the brethren go out and bear testimony to the truth. Not a great deal has been done, but the few workers have placed 15,602 books and booklets during the year, the persons obtaining books to the number of 5,618 families; and 688 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> have gone to the people. A sound machine has been employed, and with this 61 meetings have been held, with an attendance of 1,371. During the year one radio station has regularly broadcast the truth once each week, by electrical transcription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More people of good will, otherwise known as “ Jona-dabs”, are coming to a knowledge of the truth and rejoicing in the privilege of study of His Word. Three Chinese independent congregations have requested the Society’s representative to deliver discourses on the truth at their regular meeting place. There is prospect of forming classes there. The local representative, amongst other things, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The annual report shows God’s rich blessings upon the workers in China. During the year this country has been suffering great depression, floods, warfare and foreign aggression, and the people are in a state of mourning. Amidst such tribulations, difficulties and troubles we were privileged to give a witness to the name of Jehovah God and his gracious provision made on behalf of suffering mankind. The people, though poverty-stricken, are anxious to hear the gospel of the Kingdom. Being wroth with the remnant for delivering the testimony of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus Christ to the people, the Devil is causing much trouble in this country with hopes of preventing the truth and light from being given to the people. The arm of the Lord is not shortened, and he will surely accomplish what he desires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The boy who came from Shensi whom I mentioned in my previous report symbolized his consecration after he learned the true meaning of baptism and its necessity. He is now on his way home. When he started from his home he had to walk sixty miles to the railway station; and being short of money for travel, he has to walk three times as much before he gets home. This shows his eagerness of learning the truth even though he has to undergo much difficulties. Enclosed is a picture of him just after the baptism. He applied for the pioneer arrangement and has taken some literature with him on his return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A new class on Sunday afternoon has been started for the study of Chinese </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation.</span><span class="font3"> This class is devoted to the Chinese. Mr. Li, the editor, is still a regular attendant to the class. Two classes on </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Piches,</span><span class="font3"> all foreigners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The translation on </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Piches</span><span class="font3"> is finished and the printer is now setting the type, and it is hoped that this will be completed by the end of October.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The witness work is carried on in Greece under a great handicap. Recently the absolute dictator of Greece was visited by a representative of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy working together with the priests of the Greek church, and influence has been brought to bear causing the enactment of a law in Greece that permits no literature to be published except it is first passed by the government censor. A violation of this rule results in the seizure of not only the literature but the printing presses used to manufacture the same. The seizure results in destruction. In the face of this great opposition the faithful witnesses of Jehovah continue to press on in the work. During the year they have placed in the hands of the people bound and paper-covered books to the number of 75,278. In addition thereto, in Albania, under the Greek office, 6,479 volumes have been placed in the hands of the people, making a total of 81,757. The Society’s representative in Greece says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The close of the fiscal year finds the anointed of the Lord here in Greece rejoicing in the Lord and active in his work. We thank the Lord for all his mercy and goodness to his people, who under his protection try to glorify his name. Satan has been very busy against the anointed of the Lord through his visible organs, trying by every means to hinder the giving of the message of the Kingdom. For months </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">cannot reach the brethren because of the order of the Government prohibiting the entrance of our literature into Greece. Even the mats which were sent to us were ordered to be sent back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now we are under martial law and nothing is allowed to be printed and circulated without first being submitted to censorship. In one town all the books of the brethren and the magazines sent to them for distribution were seized and burned. Notwithstanding this we are determined to go on bringing the message of the Kingdom to the people of good will. Because of the opposition of the enemy and the financial distress of the people, especially in the rural districts, we fell back in the output of books and booklets this year, though the number of hours is somewhat increased.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>HAWAII</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">From the Society’s depot in Honolulu the witness work is carried on in the Hawaiian group of islands. There has been a healthy increase of the work during the year, the total of the books distributed being 21,866, which is more than 2,500 increase over the previous year. The rainfall in that country is very great, and the witnesses who go about the country are handicapped in getting about from place to place. Five pioneers are engaged actively in the work and all the time, two auxiliaries, and company publishers. A good witness is being given to the peoples of the various languages in that part of the earth. The special testimony periods have been a great impetus in the field, and enabled the few brethren in the islands to appreciate their privilege at the same time with their brethren throughout the earth in giving the testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Witnessing by means of transcription machines and phonographs has greatly aided in the delivery of the testimony. Meetings to the number of 642 served by sound equipment have been held with an aggregate attendance of 47,818. Phonographs and records have been loaned out to others, who have expressed themselves as greatly benefited thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The opposition has interfered with the use of the radio during the year, even refusing to take the chain program of February 23. By means of shortwave, however, and the sound car, the lecture was heard well in Kingdom hall to a good-size audience there assembled. In May, 1936, a new radio station began operations at Hilo, Hawaii, and since then the Kingdom message by electrical transcription has been broadcast each Sunday. The Society’s local representative reports that this radio station is creating increased interest amongst the Filipinos, Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Hawaiian people. This, together with the phonographs and sound ears, is making known the Kingdom message throughout the islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Riches” Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In two months three study meetings with the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> have been inaugurated, and others are manifesting a desire to have studies in their homes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark163"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The great population of India, held in subjection to the devil religion, are receiving the witness, and many of these are having their eyes opened. During the year, reports the local representative of the Society, </span><span class="font3">steady witness has been given over a great area of India, much of Burma, and some in Ceylon. There is evidence that the “sheep” who are receiving the mark in their foreheads are coming to the fore, while the goats, of course, are in much majority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There has been a substantial increase of English literature distributed, this in spite of the fact that English pioneers have suffered greatly by reason of climatic conditions. These English pioneers have placed 80 percent of the bound books and 60 percent of the English booklets during the year. The distribution of vernacular literature shows a decrease. The total distribution of English and vernacular literature is, to wit, 111,467.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">House-to-house witnessing with printed literature still remains by far the most important section of activity, though the sound machines form a very effective adjunct, and their scope is gradually increasing. They certainly seem to be the most effective means of dividing the people, for it is from the sound machine work that we have experienced the most active opposition and also found the most response to the witness. In this country, where the language difficulty is a very real drawback to the use of the sound machine equipment (for as yet we have no recorded lectures in the vernacular and very few publishers capable of speaking to native audiences through the microphone), its use has been mostly confined to Bombay city and suburbs and on house-cars operated by English pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Bombay city and suburbs an intensive witness has been given throughout the year. In the Catholic sections particularly there have been many threats to do damage to the equipment, but so far the only interference has been caused by bands of youths beating tins and otherwise creating a hullabaloo. The people have been warned by their priests not to read our books nor to listen to the lectures, but still the books go out and still the people listen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the provinces English pioneers have toured in the housecars equipped with electrical transcription machines and done a very thorough work. One such party in particular has effectively stirred up the minds of the people in the various mission centers which they have visited. They are usually denied the privilege of using the mission premises for a lecture, but generally get to work immediately outside, much to the indignation of the missionaries concerned. We have three house-cars and five transcription machines in regular service, and it is estimated that about 20,000 people listened to the lectures during the year. If only we had lectures in the vernacular, the audiences would be very much larger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Special testimony periods : The six nine-day periods organized for world-wide effort were indeed blessed of the Lord. During those 54 days we placed about 30 percent of our total literature. The friends everywhere entered into them with enthusiasm, and many of the Indian friends made these campaigns the opportunity for getting away from their native villages and assembling in parties for an intensive witness in the more thickly populated areas. The largest number reporting for service at any one time was during the April period, when 364 took part in publishing the message of the Kingdom. They distributed 5,052 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Indian work: It seems necessary to make some distinction between the purely Indian work and that done by English pub</span><span class="font3">Ushers, not because of racial distinction, but because of circumstances. Whereas there are only a few English publishers, they are at liberty to work in any part of the country and amongst any community, whilst the Indian publishers are mostly in “companies” and their activities limited to their own village folk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has been said that “the Englishman tends to regard the foreigner as a sort of unfortunate by-product of the Creator’s early work”; and this attitude is seen, not only in the average European, but also among the Anglo-Indian and so-called “high caste” Hindoo communities whenever a poor native Indian presumes to enter their presence and offer the message of the Kingdom. The poor Indian publisher works under great difficulties. He is either cast out and abused for his supposedly inferior status or else regarded as a dangerous heretic by his missionary-deluded brother; but in spite of all these disadvantages the Indian friends are pressing the battle to the gate with zeal and gradually overcoming the prejudice which for years has made progress seem slow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are two well-established fields of activity amongst the Indians in India. One is in the south, in the state of Travan-core, and the other in the Punjab, in northern India. There is also now regular activity, but on a smaller scale, in the Tamil, Telugu and Kanarese-speaking countries in the south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Unfortunately the Indian publishers do not seem to be capable of maintaining the sound equipment in proper order, and the English pioneers who have the sound cars are not capable of speaking to the Indians in their own tongue, so until we have records in the vernacular we have to do the best we can by combining the two. During the month of February an English pioneer with a sound car made a tour through Travancore along with some Indian pioneers, who used the microphone to speak to the people in their own language, and great crowds were gathered. I hope that it may soon be possible to have recording apparatus of our own by which we shall be able to equip our English pioneers with recorded lectures in the vernacular and thus enlarge the scope of the sound machine equipment very considerably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vernacular publications: One of the greatest handicaps, so far as being able to witness to the great mass of Indians is concerned, is the language problem. Not only are there many different languages spoken in India, but almost every one has its own peculiar characters. Translation into these languages is never entirely satisfactory when done by people who do not understand our message, especially when such translators are not “Christians”. The difficulties are gradually being overcome by reason of the fact that people capable of translation work are being gathered into Jehovah’s “fold”, and for this </span><span class="font3">we are grateful to the Lord. We now have capable translators who understand the truth for Malayalam, Urdu, Tamil and Kanarese.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year we have published 47,000 booklets, representing four different booklets in eight different languages. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font3"> booklet was published in Marathi, Urdu, Malayalam, Tamil and Kanarese. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hereafter</span><span class="font3"> was published in Gur-mukhi, Burmese, Tamil and Kanarese. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near</span><span class="font3"> in Malayalam and Tamil was reprinted, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Who Shall Rule the World?</span><span class="font3"> was published in Coneanim. Besides these we have printed a small tract on the “trinity” in Kanarese, Tamil and Telugu. We are now busy with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing</span><span class="font3"> in the principal languages. This phase of work entails a rather heavy expenditure, for which we get little in return, but we are grateful to the Lord for all the provision he has made to carry on with this work, even in this limited way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> has not yet been made available to the Indian brethren, and so this formation of study classes has been confined to the more oral form of instruction and by means of the older publications; but the response from the Indians to gather together for such instruction is very much greater than it is from the Europeans. Every effort has been made to keep the Indian friends up to date with the revelation of truth by means of oral instruction (for we are still unable to provide them with all the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> articles in their own language), and in this way much progressive work has been done. We hope to have the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> ready in the various vernaculars by the end of September, and this should help forward the work of helping the Indians to see their responsibilities toward their fellow creatures in pointing the way to life.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark164"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark165"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In the isle of Jamaica, the West Indies, Jehovah’s witnesses work under difficulties. During the year there have been placed in the hands of the people 40,642 books and booklets. The sound cars have served public meetings to the number of 30, with a total attendance of 178,471 persons. From the Society’s local representative’s report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year we enjoyed special blessings, such as were never experienced before. The visit of Brother T. E. Banks to Jamaica opened up a new leaf for us, as we had the privilege to appear before judges for the sake of the truth, and since then opposition to the sound car and other transcription machines increases in Kingston, Jamaica. We already had three actions filed against us, two of which were already tried and the other to be tried soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We do not allow the restrictions to prevent our giving forth the message of the Kingdom through this most effective means. In harmony with the suggestion from the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font3"> we endeavor to secure private premises at which places the public can attend. In various parts of the island the sound car delivered lectures to thousands of interested persons, who showed much appreciation for the Kingdom message. This feature of the work is very effective, as many persons are having the privilege of hearing the message by this means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We regret to state that the pioneer service is not as efficient as we would like. The conditions existing in the island make it very hard for those who are engaged in this feature of the work, so that only a few can hold out, while most of the others can only meet the requirement of an auxiliary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The companies are putting forth much effort to keep the Kingdom message before the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark166"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark167"></a>JAPAN and KOREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In Japan the Roman Catholic Hierarchy exercises a tremendous power. Although the most of the Japanese people are not of the “Catholic population”, the Hierarchy succeeded in inducing the government of Japan to prohibit the publication of ‘anything written by Rutherford, and the use of any phonograph records made by him’. This is further proof that the Hierarchy fears the truth more than anything else. The only means of giving the witness in Japan is by the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> magazine, published in the Japanese language. During the year 1,133,563 copies of that magazine in Japanese and Korean were distributed in that country. With these the faithful witnesses of Jehovah go about and testify to the truth. The witnesses in the field have increased thirty percent above that of the preceding year. From the report of the Society’s representative the following is inserted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Romanists: The Roman Catholic has a strong power among the financiers, army officers and university professors. This old harlot is doing her best to grab Japan and Manchuria into her net with the bait, such as Japanese-Germany alliance, and obtaining the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">immi</span><span class="font3">gration colonies for Japan in the Catholic countries in South America. The old harlot knows well how to approach her victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Propaganda: The Romanists proceed with their propaganda work to cover and hide the fact and truth about their conspiracy against Japan four hundred years ago. Now they are endeavoring hard to get Japanese militarists into her net by contributing Yen 52,000.00 for the army and navy. The Romanists agreed to worship Japanese gods, and this is made clear by the pope’s declaration. The declaration was presented to Japanese Government by the Papal nuncio at Tokyo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Public press: The Osaka </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Asahi Shimbun,</span><span class="font3"> the largest and the most powerful newspaper in Japan, carried an entirely false report about the Watch Tower last March. It condemned us that the Watch Tower is the dreadful secret society of the Communists and also a secret agent of Jewish society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“International News Service” and the “Universal News Service” are American corporations and owned by Randolph Hearst. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yomiuri Shimbun,</span><span class="font3"> one of first-class newspapers in Japan, and five other large local papers are controlled by this Romanist news agency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exposure: Japanese </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age,</span><span class="font3"> in every number, exposed the facts and truth about the secret activity of the Roman agents. We have found that the editor of the Osaka </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Asahi Shimbun</span><span class="font3"> is a Roman Catholic. The articles in Japanese </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Ages</span><span class="font3"> expose the fact and truth concerning secret activities of the Romanists since 1549 till 1937. The archbishop for Japan and Korea and Manchuria is a foreigner now. There is just one Japanese bishop at Nagasaki district. His name is K. Hayasaka. The Romanists raised a slogan, “Japanese bishops for Japan Catholic Church.” Now she attempts to appoint Hayasaka as their archbishop for Japan and Manchuria. Under this camouflage she wants to grab whole Japan and Manchuria into her net. This appointment will take place sometime early in 1937. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> has exposed her attempt beforehand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The exposures about the Roman Catholic has created very much sensation among every class here in Japan and Manchuria. We, Jehovah’s witnesses, press the battle to the enemy's gate now. And Devil and his agents are absolutely helpless as far as these exposures are concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Protestantism: As a fact, Protestantism is dead in Japan too. It is entirely powerless, and every denomination began to adjust themselves to meet the paganish requirement. They built their ‘church’ buildings which are imitations of Buddhist temple. Many of these denominations agreed to worship Japanese gods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anglican Church: Samuel Heazlet, the archbishop for Japanese Episcopal church, issued a declaration to state that the Watch Tower is heretic and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font3"> is the most dangerous publication. This declaration was sent to all its clergymen here. I got a copy of it. I have sent a certified letter to Heazlet to demand an open debate on the subjects of the false doctrine of the “trinity”, the false doctrine of the immortality of the soul, and ‘ ‘ the Anglican Church is a part of the Devil’s organization”. The August number of Japanese </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font3">carried full twelve-page article about the particulars. The Anglican Church keep silent on the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Testimony periods: Every testimony period was observed here in Japan and Korea with the distribution of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Ages.</span><span class="font3"> We have so much rain here during all seasons of the year. For this reason nine-day period is not enough for the workers in Japan and Korea. So we add another seven days to nine days. This makes sixteen-day periods here, and we get far better result for every period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Weather condition: The weather condition is extremely bad in Japan and Korea. We have much snow here, and fifteen feet deep is not unusual in the northeastern district. We have many calamities such as typhoons, flood, earthquakes all year around. Jehovah’s witnesses go forth to do their duty in the snow and rain just the same. For instance, two pioneer brethren were to move from a town to another town which is seventy-five miles in distance. It was a heavy rainy day and the road was very muddy. They covered the whole distance on their bicycles, the right hand on the bicycle’s handle and the left hand was compelled to hold an umbrella to keep rain off.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark168"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In Mexico the Roman Catholic Hierarchy received a heavy blow from the government under General Calles. At the expiration of Calles’ term he made his friend Cardenas the president, or rather, his influence put him in office; and since then the government has been more considerate with the Catholics and the Hierarchy officials have again become haughty and arrogant and heap their persecution upon Jehovah’s witnesses in the expression of their wickedness. Amidst all this opposition the fiscal year has shown a result of the witness work in the distribution of a greater number of books and booklets than any previous year. The distribution of books, bound and paper-covered, during the year totals 216,778. The following is quoted from the Society’s local representative’s report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During this fiscal year the witness was given in places never before reached. In the state of Tabasco five witnesses were thrown into jail, their literature confiscated, and were put out of the borders of the state into a mountainous part of another state, and penniless, as their money was also stolen by the authorities; but they were happy, because it was not done until they had left plenty of literature in the hands of the people. At our complaint before the governor of the state, the “municipal president” was put out of office. This branch is expecting to send more workers into that section.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Universal War Near</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government—Hiding the Truth</span><span class="font3"> had a very wide circulation. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Etches</span><span class="font3"> came very near to the 6,000 mark in six months, not a mark as high as we would like, but a record mark in Mexico. Financial stress prevented many that would like to have it, while the indifferent ones came out with the customary “I am not interested”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Campaigns: In the six campaigns during the year the Mexican friends placed 63,535 booklets and 3,644 books in the hands of the people. Certainly campaigns are a great help to make figures come up, as the result of 54 days has a very good showing in the report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kadio anb sound machines: Radio was not much used this year. Of course, Mexico partook in the world chain for February 23, but nothing short of a miracle accounts for the chaining of three powerful border stations and a Mexico City station as our unit to the world’s chain. The border stations went through to the end. The Mexico City station only halfway. However, as the Mexico City station was the official station, it served to induce the others to take part, and it is doubtful the others would have taken a part had not this been in the chain. The Mexican Government does not oppose our message, but has tightened up radio facilities for anything that is classed as “religious” matter, claiming that it is to hinder the Catholic Church to use radio, but actually serving the best interests of the Hierarchy, which wants silence at any price. She has not much to say, but plenty to hear and to prevent others from hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Conventions and visits: The first month of this fiscal year we had a very encouraging convention, and very helpful too, at Monterrey. Some Spanish-speaking friends from the States were present, to our joy. Service from house to house was partaken by most of the attendants, and the radio lecture was a splendid witness, as it was broadcast by the best station in Monterrey, well announced, and there not being any other station at that time, local or otherwise, to interfere. It seemed that all radios were tuned to it, and, witnessing later on from house to house, the friends were informed by many that listened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the groups in the country were visited, some of them several times, throughout the year, and helped to proceed with their share in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Office and shipping room: The office took care of translating and proofreading of all Spanish booklets published the first time during the year, and also of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches.</span><span class="font3"> It prepared also </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Luz y Verdad</span><span class="font3"> (Spanish </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age)</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year 3,646 letters were sent out; 1,272 full cartons and large packages of literature were shipped, and smaller packages and other small pieces to the number of 8,281.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>NORTHERN EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Strenuous opposition confronts Jehovah’s witnesses in their work in every part of the earth. This is to be expected, because these are perilous times about which the Scriptures have given us warning. Such opposition has not dampened the zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses. They know that the work now being done will not convert the world, but is done under the commandment of Jehovah that his name may be declared, that warning may be given of the approaching disaster upon the world, and that all those of good will toward God may flee to the only place of refuge. The Northern European office acting for the Society gives attention to the witness work in the following countries, to wit, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania. Within this territory the distribution of books and booklets during the fiscal year aggregated 1,548,914. In addition thereto copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> to the number of 179,469 were distributed. This marks a slight increase over the previous year. A healthy part of it is an increase in the placements of clothbound books. In that part of the earth the Lord Jesus is gathering his other people, as the evidence clearly shows. The great multitude are coming to the front and are participating in the service, showing an increased number each week in the Lord’s little army in the field. The world-wide testimony periods were observed in the area above mentioned during the year, and in each one the number of workers and the work accomplished increased. There is some slight opposition in that country aside from the Boman Catholic Hierarchy, but, to be sure, all opposition to Jehovah’s work proceeds from Satan the enemy. There are still some in that land strongly impressed with their own importance and of the necessity of developing character to the point of perfection whereby in the eyes of men they might reach an exalted place. These constantly murmur, complain and find fault, but the real loyal and faithful ones of the Lord’s organization give no heed to such opposition but push forward with the work they have in hand. The remnant and the Jonadabs are working zealously side by side, following organization instructions, and the results are gratifying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The main office is in Denmark, from which immediate supervision is exercised over the territory above mentioned. The report of each one of the countries is here set out separately. These reports, of necessity, must be brief, but the same afford a general view of the progress of the testimony work that is being carried on under the Lord’s direction in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year a number of local conventions were held throughout the territory, these conventions being visited by one of the Society’s representatives from Brooklyn. The attendance at those meetings was good, and the result encouraging. A brief report thereof has heretofore appeared in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Society’s representative in Denmark reports improved conditions in that area. As in all other parts of the earth at this time the economic conditions become worse, and yet the people who are really thoughtful, instead of being turned away by adverse conditions, are seeking to know just why such conditions exist, and some are diligently seeking instruction at the mouth of the Lord God. The Society’s servant in Denmark, amongst other things, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is a real pleasure to send you the report for Denmark for the year just ended, because it constitutes another record. The workers in the field have increased and more hours have been put in, and a greater distribution of the literature than heretofore. We are grateful to the Lord for the increase granted in spite of the fact of adverse conditions. The view has been expressed that the great multitude would not come forth until Armageddon. The facts here show to the contrary. In this land there is quite a decided appearance of those who are of the Jonadab class, and these are showing a real zeal for the Lord and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Until recently the lectures by phonograph were little used in Denmark, because the machines were not available. Now they are being used, and with good results. Further quoting from the Society’s representative for Denmark concerning this part of the work is the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The work done in Copenhagen to get in touch with the great multitude deserves special mention. Last winter 42 public meetings were held by four brethren, who each prepared a talk and gave it ten or eleven times, as we are short on sound equipment. In the result 4,226 people attended, 421 books were spread, and no less than 142 people left their names as being willing to attend studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In one district a man came to the speaker at the last meeting and said, “Here am I and nine others with whom I have met here; we want a meeting, my home is at your disposal, and all we need is that you should send us a leader.” Here were “ten men ’ ’ laying hold of the ‘ Jew’s skirt ’! Soon eight Jonadab meetings were arranged, and these were served by brethren with gramophones, who played records and dealt with the questions propounded. Copenhagen has, of course, nearly a quarter of Denmark’s population, but what was done there on a large scale was also done all over the country. For example, in the town of Sonderborg, near the German border, a pioneer held gramophone meetings for the interested after regional servants had held some public meetings, and in the April period six Jonadabs were out there and spread 402 pieces of literature. In all, 140 public meetings were held during the year, and we have constantly tried to look after the interest aroused. It has meant a lot of work, but what happy work it has been and how rejoiced the brethren in all Denmark are to see the increased numbers taking part in the work and the great witness given by the Lord’s grace! There were 249 Jonadab meetings in the year, with an attendance of 5,282; 331 gramophone meetings were held, with an attendance of 4,725.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We have much appreciated the “meat in due season” which we continue to receive in the pages of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> and the great multitude are also rejoicing in the good things the Lord is giving us. This is proved by the fact that our subscription list for Denmark and Norway has increased in the year by 270, from 1,727 to 1,997. Without a doubt these are Jona-dabs in Denmark and Norway, who are now drinking of the waters of life and with palm branches in their hands crying “Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I must not omit to make mention of the visit of your special representative. It coincided with our annual service convention, which was attended by 667 brethren, and all were much encouraged by his ministrations and by hearing of the fight against the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in New Jersey. At this convention 5,631 pieces of literature were placed. The public meeting was attended by no less than 2,100, and it was well advertised by “sandwich men” and by a lorry with large advertisements (12 feet by 6 feet) on its sides. One paper also gave quite a good interview with Brother Howlett. Additionally, 125,000 folders were distributed. Such visits emphasize the unity of the work and of the Lord’s people all over the earth. I was also greatly privileged to be present in Lucerne and London and shall be passing on the encouragement and renewed energy for the fight there received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Clothbound and smaller books to the number of 435,116 were placed in the hands of the people during the year. The book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> has not yet been published in the Scandinavian languages, but will be published shortly. As this report is being written, the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> in Danish and in Finnish is going forward.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark173"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark174"></a>ESTONIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This small Baltic state is so near the border of Germany that the Nazis slop over and affect Estonia. These agents of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have exercised great opposition in Estonia during the fiscal year, causing the confiscation of much of the literature of the Society and thus preventing the people from receiving the same. The amount and kind of books and booklets have been so limited that it has been difficult to do a great deal of work in that land. A few pioneers have been at work, however, and these pioneers alone have put out 37,075 of the large and small books. Most of this work is done in the rural districts. It is almost as bad in Estonia as in Germany. The total number of volumes placed in the hands of the people is 41,597.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark175"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark176"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Almost all people of Finland, with but few exceptions, live under adverse conditions. This applies particularly to those who are striving faithfully to serve the Lord. This does not at all, however, dampen their zeal for Jehovah and his kingdom. During the year they have manifested their love and devotion to Jehovah by earnestly and zealously carrying the message of the Kingdom to others. There has been an increase in both the number of publishers and the amount of literature published during the year. Considering the adverse conditions under which the witnesses must operate, the result is encouraging. From the report of the Society’s representative at Helsingfors the progress of the work there is apparent, and from that report the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is a great and appreciated privilege for me to send you a report of the work done in Finland during the now finished year. It has been a year of fight, with many joyful opportunities to sing the praise of our great God Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The special periods have been the most blessed opportunities in giving testimony about the Kingdom. It has been wonderful to see how it has pleased the Lord to bless just at that time all the efforts made by his consecrated ones. Not only have the friends been filled with greater zeal for “His house’’, but the people in general have been more willing to listen to the message. It is as if the Lord had made the men more prepared to accept the message when he specially has sent his messengers to proclaim it. The biggest number of the publishers during these periods was 777, and the whole output of literature was 185,392, which, compared with the previous year, shows an increase of 55 publishers and 26,520 pieces of literature. As the whole output of literature has been 390,623, it shows that almost half of it has been spread during these periods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers have to overcome many difficulties. As the homes are very far from one another, they are not able to work in many houses during the day, and for that reason the output of literature in many eases is too little in order that a pioneer could go on in the work, but many of them must always try to get for a little while some other work in order to get some money with which they can again continue the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Companies have even this year done the biggest work in our country. Helped by the regional servants, they have spread 230,572 copies of books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The conventions have always proved to be labor feasts, by which the work for the Kingdom has been emphasized and the friends given an opportunity with rejoicing to take part in the proclamation of the Kingdom message. We have had, together, 59 conventions, visited together by 3,356 friends; 46 were baptized, and 1,600 took part in the work, spreading together 29,512 books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to fix the attention of the people on the important message which we are privileged to give them, 165 public lectures have been arranged. In connection with these lectures have been spread 146,155 folders. Once more we succeeded to get our biggest hall, Messuhalli, and although the working people, among which we have our greatest number of hearers, had arranged a big feast with great attractions, yet 4,000 came to hear our message, and to our great joy they took 3,596 pieces of literature, and many left their addresses so that we could visit them afterwards. That was also done, and still 331 were put in the hands of the people. The total attendance at the public meetings has been 28,697, and the whole output has been 6,139.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To our great joy we have had this year the privilege to start the work with records. The interest was so great that as soon as the friends knew that we had records, we at once got so many orders that we could not fill them all. As every record was separately spoken and we for that reason had no mats to make new ones, we have not been able to provide records for the great demand. For that reason it was a great joy for us when you kindly arranged the matters so that new records could be spoken in Berne, and as mats are made from them we have now a good hope to get soon a good supply of new records. We have had, all together, 117 meetings with the records, with the total attendance of 1,787 and an output of 93 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our connection with the whole God’s organization has been emphasized during the year in many various ways. In February we had the very great joy to be connected with Los Angeles and hear your lecture to all nations in the whole world. It was wonderful and encouraging to be present at this great occasion. We are also very grateful to you as you arranged so that Brother Howlett could visit us. It was very encouraging for us to hear how courageously our brethren in America have fought against our great enemy. Let me also in this connection express my deeply felt gratitude to you as you arranged for me an opportunity to be present at the marvelous convention in Lucerne. On coming home the big meeting in Messuhalli was arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the end of that meeting I read the declaration taken in Lucerne, and after it the whole auditorium with loud ‘ ‘ ayes ’ ’ greeted the coming Kingdom. Some days afterwards we had a meeting for more interested, and 470 came, which was the greatest number we ever have succeeded to gather to a meeting for more interested. It seems that the ‘ ‘ multitude ’ ’ is more and more ready to come out and join with Jehu in the big work which still must be done.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark177"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The witness work in Iceland during the fiscal year has not been great. Two faithful pioneer women and one man have trudged through that rugged land and done everything within their power. They have placed a goodly number of books and more booklets, but in addition to that they have borne verbal testimony to many people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark179"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark180"></a>LATVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">If any sane person has had reason to doubt that the Devil through the religionists is exercising all possible power to turn the people away from God and hold them in subjection to the clergy, Satan’s visible representatives, the facts that come to light in such countries as Latvia should serve to convince them of the truth beyond any question. In the face of this opposition, however, a few of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses have gone about in the land during the year and placed in the hands of the people 8,748 books containing the message of the Kingdom. Another evidence that Protestantism is dead is this, that Latvia claims to be a Protestant country and yet yields to the cruel influence of the Hierarchy. The fact is that the “neck” of the Devil’s organization, Gog, is exercising his power over all religionists throughout the earth. The following is quoted from the report of the Society’s representative in that country:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There has been little change in the general conditions obtaining in the country since the report sent to you a year ago, but the grip which the administration exercises over the lives of the people becomes ever tighter. Martial law has been reimposed as each period for which it was in force elapsed, and the latest proclamation decrees that it be continued until February 1937. No meetings of any kind may be held unless first a written permit has been obtained. There have been quite a number of instances where wedding and similar parties have been surprised by the police and the householder and all the guests have been heavily fined owing to the failure to take the precaution of first obtaining a permit for the assembly. In another instance a man obtained a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government.</span><span class="font3"> He appreciated its message so much that he mentioned it to some of his friends, and four or five of them met together on several occasions to read the book together with the Bible. Some evilly disposed person, who knew what they were doing, informed the police, with the result that one Sunday the little party were surprised, arrested and taken to the police prefecture. When before the prefect, one of the party had the temerity to ask, &quot;What harm were we doing that we should be arrested? we were only studying the Word of God.” &quot;You have the churches where you can study the Word of God; you are not allowed to do it in your own homes,” was the churlish reply. Latvia is professedly a ‘ ‘ Protestant ’ ’ country. The Constitution, but eighteen years old^but now suspended for two and a half years—guarantees religious freedom and freedom of conscience to every inhabitant of whatever nationality. Here, as elsewhere, Protestantism is dead, and the power of Rome grows apace and intolerance becomes more and more manifest. Pictures have appeared in the local newspapers showing the dictator kissing the hand or ring of the papal nuncio; this gives an indication of the trend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is no law; there is no Constitution; the people have no right. Judges sentence those brought before them in accordance with the instructions they receive from the political police. For ordinary infringements of the regulations, the police have large powers and can impose very heavy fines and commit to prison without the matters’ coming before a judge or magistrate at all. The British consul, in a booklet written by him, makes the statement that visitors to the country should be extremely careful because of the large powers the police possess to impose heavy fines without the possibility of there being any appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These conditions have been and still are a considerable hindrance to the progress of our work. Our Society has been closed, as previously reported, and we have no legal right to hold meetings; most of the pioneers have had to take other employment in order to support themselves. There is also manifest a reluctance on the part of some of the people to take the literature; they are afraid they would be punished if it were found in their possession. With the help of the Lord, however, some 8,748 books and booklets have been placed in the hands of the people, and quite a few expressions of appreciation have been made by those to whom the literature has brought a message of hope. These figures, although but a small contribution to the grand total of what has been accomplished throughout the earth, are five times greater than those reported from Latvia last year. We hope that the new year just beginning will see some relief from present hindrances, and a far greater witness given to the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>LITHUANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In Lithuania the “Catholic population” is about 85 percent of the total, and the Hierarchy, desiring to keep the “Catholic population” in subjection, put forth every possible effort to prevent them from hearing the truth. For this reason it has been exceedingly difficult to carry on the witness work in Lithuania. There has not been as large a distribution of literature in that land as in the previous year, yet the small number of workers have made a good showing under the circumstances. From the report of the Society’s local representative the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Laws were passed at the beginning of the year which have had the effect of greatly impeding the Kingdom work. One of these states that only Lithuanian subjects shall be permitted to spread literature of any kind. This law was ostensibly passed to prevent German propaganda being spread, and, as we have only one non-Lithuanian worker here, that may have been tho ease. After some experience with the methods of the clergy, however, it is not difficult to believe that there was another reason for its promulgation. Another law seeks to regulate the spreading of literature, and when some of our workers have experienced difficulties with the authorities, the latter have told them that neither the Bible nor books about the Bible are required in Lithuania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In answer to a subscriber’s question as to why Judge Rutherford's lectures were not permitted over the Lithuanian radio, the answer was broadcast that his teachings were communistic with a religious covering. Although proof was submitted that such an answer was false, and known to be so by the one giving it, no attempt was made to correct the statement. In an interview the director of radio did not challenge the assertion that the clergy were really responsible for the answer. Yet it is commonly thought that the latter and the nationalists at present in power are opposed. The facts prove that, as in other lands where similar conditions obtain, the Boman Catholic Hier-arehy is the real power, covering its slimy tracks in order to hoodwink the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although 85 percent of the population is “Catholic”, many of the people are against the clergy and their methods. That is one of the reasons for the bitter opposition of the Devil’s agents here. They realize that the message of truth will expose their hypocrisy to an even greater extent and that their hold on the people will be lessened. For years civil registration has been promised, but up to the present births, deaths and marriages must be registered through a ‘church’, and many of the people greatly resent this. Thus the clergy seek to maintain their control of the people and to assure a continuance of their revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The semi-official newspaper </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lietuvos Aidas</span><span class="font3"> recently reported the trial and sentence of certain of the witnesses of Jehovah in East Prussia. Care was taken to mention the crimes of “treason”, “communism” and “pacifism” with which they were charged. While such a report serves its purpose, to some extent, in blinding the people to the facts, it also affords an opportunity for many to take notice of the attitude adopted by the “goat” class and to see how the latter look for refuge in lies. This newspaper is not too friendly towards Germany, but the bitterest of enemies sink their difference when it comes to opposing the Lord and his Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While practically all of the work of witnessing in Lithuania is done by a few pioneers, that in Memelgebiet, Lithuanian mandated territory, is carried on chiefly by small companies. Conditions in this district are not so restricted as in other parts of Lithuania, but it has its difficulties too. Formerly a part of the German empire, many of its inhabitants are affected by the propaganda broadcast from that country. As is to be expected, many of these people are more “Nazi” than the Nazis in Germany themselves, and correspondingly their hatred to the truth seems greater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From time to time omnibus loads of Jehovah’s witnesses set out from their home-town to cover the distant territory. This sometimes means a journey of four or five hours back and forth, with between six and eight hours in the field, in order to make the journey worth while. Sometimes a service gathering is combined with such a “drive”, and two of these have been held during the year, besides one in Lithuania proper. On such occasions at least five hours, commencing between 7: 30 and 8: 00 a.m., is spent in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The average number of workers in Memelgebiet is the same as for last year, but results are lower. While the conditions above mentioned and the poverty of the people are largely responsible, it is to be noted that those workers who by careful planning are able to put more time in the service of the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font3">gdom are the ones whose results do not drop, despite increasing difficulties. Some, allowing other matters to share their interest, become lukewarm, while others, increasing in zeal, have their Kingdom interests increased, as has been promised. It is to be hoped that the present conditions in Germany, Spain and other countries will awaken these lukewarm ones to a realization of the fact that the time to work is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">now, ‘ ‘</span><span class="font3"> while it is called today, ’ ’ and that, thus doing, they may prove their worthiness to share in the kingdom of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The total number of books and booklets spread in Memel-gebiet during the past year is 6,894. In addition, 2,708 copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font3"> previously mentioned, were spread in this district alone, and the workers also shared in the distribution of this journal to the regular subscribers. A total of 1,760 hours was spent in this branch of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mention must be made of the world wide broadcast on February 23. That occasion must have been one of great joy to all of the Lord’s people who were privileged to hear, and especially to those who are more or less isolated. The message came over with hardly any disturbance, and practically every word was clear and distinct. It was impossible not to be enthused as one realized that that great witness for Jehovah and against the Devil and his organization was being heard by multitudes of people throughout the earth. Later in the year we were again encouraged as we listened to the same lecture in German, which came over just as dearly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark183"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah has some zealous and faithful witnesses in Norway carrying the message of truth to the people who will hear. There has not been very much opposition to the work in Norway, but recently this is being manifested by religionists. It is apparent that the Lord’s people must have some opposition almost everywhere, and it is to be expected that this will increase, reaching a climax at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Seven service conventions have been held in Norway during the year, and practically every one of the Lord’s remnant has attended one or more of these conventions, and a portion of each day has been used in witnessing to the people in the field. This has been stimulating to those who are faithful to the Lord, and has encouraged others to join .them. The phonograph work has just begun in that country and is creating considerable interest even thus far, and no doubt will do more in the near future. From the local representative’s report to this office the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Radio lectures: In Norway we had the great joy to listen to your speech “Separating the Nations’’, from Los Angeles, February 23. We had a good hall in Oslo, and got the speech from London per telegraph cable. In many places it was heard direct from Lyon. We heard it clear, and were very encouraged thus to be on the Los Angeles convention. Your speech “Hope for the Nations’’ over Radio Lyon, August 30, we heard very little of because it was in the daytime, and a great thunderstorm was over the most of south Norway. Here we hear best in the nighttime, from the long distances. Still only the priests in Satan’s organization speak over the Norwegian radio stations. On Svalbard (Spitsbergen) are nearly 2,000 Norwegian people living also in the dark wintertime. In their about-four-months-long winter-night one of their best joys had been to listen to your radio lectures, as have been sent out in Swedish, from Tallinn, Estonia. But the Devil’s Hierarchy got it stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Divisional campaigns: Oslo, Bergen and Skien classes have had from five to eight such campaigns in the year, especially with starting the special service periods. These divisional campaigns have been a great stimulus and encouragement to us. On such trips fifteen to sixty publishers have traveled with boats, buses and smaller cars, to places twenty to seventy miles away from these three towns. Sometimes distributed 100 books and 2,000 booklets, in only one such trip, with 50 publishers. Sometimes we could hear the people say, “Now they are here again”; the righteous loving people, with glad voices, and the goat-minded, with indignant voices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Motorboat “Ester” with the two brethren has also this year done a very good work on the west coast of Norway. As before, they have had some hard storms, and other difficulties, but the Lord has helped them in a wonderful manner. They have distributed 11,460 pieces of literature; 2,103 more than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Howlett’s visit was a great joy and encouragement for us. We are thankful and glad that you sent him to us, when we had not the joy to see you Mere. At the Bergen convention, August 5-7, 125 friends attended. At the public meeting the hall was crowded with 810 very attentive listeners. About 200 went without getting a place. Sixteen State-priests, with their bishop, and some other clergymen, were there. Neither at the meeting nor afterwards did we hear anything from them. At the Oslo convention, August 8, 9, 140 brethren attended. At the public meeting the hall was crowded with 1,014 listeners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some friends standing at several places in the hall spread 23 books and 379 booklets. Brother Howlett also went to Skien, where 100 very glad friends attended.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The work in Sweden in bearing testimony to the Kingdom of Jehovah has not only held its own during the year but made a slight progress so far as the number of books distributed is concerned. The most important thing, however, has been the continuous efforts on the part of the witnesses to honor the name of Jehovah, not only serving as a blessing to themselves, but advertising the King and his kingdom to others of good will. The local representative, amongst other things in his report, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In taking a review of happenings during the past year, the one most prominent in one’s mind is, quite naturally, the latest one. And so our convention and the good public meeting during Brother Howlett’s visit here first present themselves. I take this opportunity to again express our gratitude to the heavenly Father who graciously called his people here together at that time for a season of real refreshing, and we also desire to thank you, as his instrument, for arranging this feast. After the last few months of partial unrest and uncertainty on the part of quite a few, for a reason well known to yourself, this convention came like a strong wind from the north, sweeping away the mists and fogs that were trying to settle down upon the minds of some among us. The grave danger of looking up to men and admiring men’s persons was very clearly and strongly pointed out to us, and at the same time we were reminded that the Lord is using human agencies to carry out his purposes here on earth at this time, hence the absolute necessity for keeping in close harmony with Jehovah’s earthly organization. How the humble and unlearned ones were being used in a remarkable way to give a witness that confuses the enemies, we were told through striking examples from New Jersey and other places. And that each one who is to be allowed to stand must be willing to sink his own individuality and be just a little, tiny cog in the great wheel within wheels and go round and round and round to the glory of the Father and his King, was another reminder. All the really loyal ones rejoiced and went away with renewed determination to press on and praise the glorious Majesty without cessation or slacking of hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The public meeting at that occasion has had its effects </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">many parts of the country, the interview with Brother Howlett, which one of the Stockholm dailies carried, being reprinted in full or partly in quite a few papers in various towns, and the message “of the day of doom”, as it was styled, has thus been made conspicuous in papers which usually do not allow us any publicity at all. There have, of course, also been some attacks upon us as a result, but to the fair-minded public these only act as a stimulus to look into the message. So we praise ths Lord “without qualification”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each year now is bringing us to see more clearly our obligations in connection with the great multitude, and right here I desire to express my great appreciation of the food we are now getting through the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> series “Gathering the Multitude”. It certainly is food convenient at this season. In Sweden this multitude has continued to make itself manifest, the Lord graciously gathering them together and letting them come in contact with his fighting organization. One hundred and fifty Jonadabs have been reported as having symbolized their consecration to do Jehovah’s will since October 1 last year, and we know of several places where quite a number are just waiting for an opportunity to do so. At each service convention several of this class come forth and start out to witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And now as to the number of books and booklets that have been placed as a result of the efforts of the zealous witnesses and their companions. With 353,602 receivers (or obtainers) was placed a total of 486,196 copies. Of these, 51,626 were books (increase 2,977). Of booklets we placed 434,570 (decrease 1,014). Additionally, there were taken 20,689 subscriptions for the Swedish </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age.</span><span class="font3"> The number of hours worked in order to do this work of placing the literature was 154,789, which is 3,058 more than last year. The book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Eiches</span><span class="font3"> was, of course, the special feature during the year, and numerous incidents show that this was a gift from the Lord in due time, making its appeal to the very ones who are to have their foreheads marked before the slaughter of Satan’s crowd starts. The first edition of this book was placed within four months. Right now we are in receipt of the second edition, just in time for the “Battle Shout” period. We thank the Lord for his rich provision and care, that we are enabled to give to the humble ones just the right food at the right time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The various testimony periods have been a great blessing, as ever, and it is really remarkable to see how the witnesses are able to go over the ground time and time again and place almost as much each time (taking the country as a whole) ; surely the Lord himself is preparing the soil to receive what he wants to be placed there, and so it is our happy privilege to just go round and round and show ourselves and show the message, and where there is a ready heart, there the seed is being received, and each time new blessings are ready for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How foolish are those who give way to the tendency of slacking their hands, now when we are beginning to see the real harvest being brought home: the great multitude being brought into the King’s palace, following after the bride with songs of praise and rejoicing!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your radio discourse from Los Angeles, as you know, was heard in some places here, although not so clearly and distinctly as the one from Washington, D.C., last year. Its message against the Hierarchy, however, was received with much appreciation, and we rejoiced to place it among the public in booklet form later. Although there are very few Catholics in Sweden, it is certainly of great importance that all the people be told what that old and sinful organization has been, and is doing. And especially since the civil war started in Spain it has been easy to interest people by pointing to the fact of the Hierarchy’s being behind that trouble, etc., and encourage them to look into these matters for themselves. The discourse broadcast from Lyon last August, however, we were wholly unable to pick up.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark187"></a>PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Philippine Islands, composed of several thousand, have long been priest-ridden, and the people in general are quite ignorant of anything pertaining to the Lord’s Word. In Luzon the Society maintains its office in the town of Manila. The majority of the people in Luzon are of the “Catholic population”, but these are ignorant of the Scriptures, chiefly because of the predominance for centuries by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The priests teach the people that the Bible is a dangerous book for them to read; consequently the people become fanatic. A number, however, are beginning to awaken to the truth and show their appreciation thereof. The Society’s books distributed amongst the people during the year total 102,667.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“Evil Servant&quot; Class</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are those in the Philippine Islands who have attempted to carry on a religious work in opposition to the true witness work. Some of these have organized under the title of “Watch Tower Bethel and Pulpit Society”, manifestly for the purpose of causing confusion, and some confusion has resulted, but those who are really devoted to the Lord are not stumbled by the efforts of the selfish and “evil servant” class. The faithful witnesses of Jehovah in that country, acting under the direction of the apostle Paul, “avoid” such. The witness work continues to increase, to the great joy and blessing of those who participate in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another difficulty to the witness work: there are 82 different dialects spoken by the people in these islands, whereas the published literature is limited to a few dialects. However, the faithful ones are putting forth their best endeavors to proclaim the name of Jehovah in that land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark188"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark189"></a>PORTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Because of disturbed conditions in Portugal it is impossible to get very much information from there. Portugal has been under the direction of the Madrid office for some time, and no reports have come through. One pioneer brother working there reports that he has placed in fifteen days 24 bound books and 228 booklets, but the report is very indefinite and covers only a short period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SPAIN</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark190"></a><span class="font4">Spain is now torn with a terrible revolution, which has practically stopped the work throughout the country and has effectually stopped it in every part where the rebels have occupied the territory. Proof upon proof continues to be supplied showing conclusively that Nazism, Fascism, Jesuitism and Hierarchism of the Roman Catholic system are one and the same thing. Without a question of doubt, the Jesuits organized the Communist party in Germany and used that “bogey man” to frighten the people while the Nazis, organized by the same crowd, seized the government. Such is the policy and political action of that satanic crowd in every place on earth. The same thing is being pursued in other countries. Everything that is anti-Catholic is branded as Communist. In truth and in fact, the Communists are organized, encouraged and pushed secretly by the Jesuits for the sole purpose of frightening the people, while the stronger Catholic organization seizes power. Without a doubt there are some sincere persons in the Communist organization as well as in others, but the sincere ones are overreached and blinded by the cunning and subtle course taken by the Jesuits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Spain the work of proclaiming the Kingdom message was making progress, and during the first nine months showed a decided increase over the previous year. Political conditions resulting in a severe war became such that the work now is practically stopped for the present. The Society’s representative in Madrid is fully acquainted with conditions in Spain and reports the distribution of literature, so far as it could be ascertained, to have reached the aggregate number of 105,570 pieces during the year. Comments upon conditions in Spain made by the Society’s local representative are herein inserted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The work was progressing steadily and would have shown a considerable improvement over the previous year had it not been suddenly cut short by the civil war. Hence our results represent only a little more than nine months’ work; and even so, we have reached practically the same total as the previous year. But for these circumstances, we would have exceeded last year’s figure by about 25 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Spain is now being devastated by the worst civil war known in history. The Boman Catholic Hierarchy in its lust for power has not shrunk from enlisting the aid of the foreign legion, composed chiefly of hardened and bloodthirsty criminals, and the Moors in order to maintain its particular brand of religion. The people are fighting for dear life; for they well know that if the Hierarchy should win, it will mean a return to slavery and the conditions of the Middle Ages and the Inquisition for them. If it is true that the people’s anger has at times gone to extremes and vented itself against religion by the burning of churches and convents and by the killing of priests and monks, it must be stated emphatically that the latter “had asked for it” and that what has come to them was but their due. One may also say with equal emphasis (as the Communists have published in a manifesto) that their fight is not against religion as such, but against those who under the cloak of religion have betrayed the people and are endeavoring to continue to exploit and oppress them as in the past. As a matter of fact, they have not once interfered with the free exercise of the true worship of God, as is borne out by the fact that during the first six weeks of the civil war several German pioneers were active in Madrid and others have continued till this day in other parts. One of those working in Madrid placed over 2,000 booklets and numerous books and copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Luz y Verdad </span><span class="font3">in one month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the other hand, most of our pioneers working in districts which fell under the power of the rebels were bitterly persecuted and imprisoned for periods ranging from ten days to three weeks by those who make such a great palaver of serving “God, country, order”, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is impossible to foretell with certainty which side will win, but even though the Jesuit-Fascist side should succeed in defeating the people with the help of certain foreign powers that have intervened in the conflict in violation of every international law, they will not be able to count the victory theirs. The people are determined never again to submit to the yoke of the clergy, and on several occasions have expressed their determination to rid the country once and for all of these enemies of mankind. If the government, i.e., the people, win, we shall probably be able to look forward to a period of great prosperity in the work for some time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ever since the beginning of May, we have been able to publish the good tidings by radio from station EAQ three times a week: twice in English, and once in Spanish. These broadcasts from this powerful shortwave station are, of course, directed towards America, though they can also be heard in other parts. We were also able to relay your speech at Los Angeles on Febiuary 23. This station has now been taken over by the workers’ movement, yet our broadcasts continue regularly. In fact, the manager, who is also the manager of the local Madrid radio station that would never have even considered our programs in the past, actually offered us a contract for that station too and, gleefully rubbing his hands, said: “What would the listeners of Badio Espana say if they were now to hear your talks from that station?” It is apparent, therefore, that it is not ‘true religion’ that is being persecuted by the people, but only the hypocritical and mercenary humbug of the Vatican. It is also true that the most violent religious intolerance prevails where the rebels are in power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As to Portugal, complete figures are not available at the moment, but the work was pushed on there in spite of difficulties. The people are under the heel of the Jesuits, and the consequent “blessings” of poverty and ignorance bear their fruits. However, two or three pioneers, on the average, have been active there all the time, carrying the message of the Kingdom to these poor oppressed people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark191"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>SYRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Society has a representative in Aleppo, Syria. There the witnesses are few in number, but are putting forth their best endeavors to give a witness for the truth. They have distributed literature during the year in the Arabic language and in some other languages. The total distribution for the year is 7,204 books. Those who are on the Lord’s side are manifesting the zeal peculiar to the house of Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark193"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark194"></a>TRINIDAD, PORT OF SPAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Trinidad and adjacent islands are provinces under the British Empire. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, following its fixed course of cruel action in every part of the earth, exercised subtly its influence in that pre inee during the year to stop the circulation of Jehovah’s message to the people. A law had been placed on the statute books with reference to forbidding the importation of seditious literature. The law gives the governor the power to act under certain conditions. The governor was temporarily absent, and during his absence the Colonial secretary acted as governor. He exercised his supposed power to defy Jehovah God, and an order was issued by him forbidding the literature of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society to be brought into the country. Up to this point the witness work was progressing in these islands, and during the year 48,002 books, bound and self-covered, were placed in the hands of the people. This was an increase over previous years, and much more would have been accomplished were it not for the foregoing “Order in Council”. An effort is being made to get this matter presented before the Privy Council at London to see what can be done there. From the report of the local representative the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The people seem to be more well-disposed towards it. This I think is partly due to the transcription lectures; for persons who listen to your voice from the machine, as its inflection places emphasis as appropriate, are more well-impressed and convinced of the Scriptural presentations, and more ready to investigate by reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There has been an increase in the literature sent out, and markedly so in the bound books, and also there is an increase in the actual time spent in the service, but we would particularly like to see more done in this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The islands which we usually serve are Antigua, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St. Vincent, Tobago, Trinidad. During the year, am glad to state, work was also done in the islands of Guadeloupe and St. Lucia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As you were advised at the time, the sound car equipment at Tunapuna was seized by the police; the magistrate threw out the case, and the machine was returned to the brethren in time that its amplifying system was used in connection with the big broadcast, February 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As regards August, without any previous notice or warning, the local government of this colony of Trinidad and Tobago, by its executive council, passed a proclamation on the 20th of that month, prohibiting the importation into the colony of any publications, past or future, of the Golden Age Publishing Company, or of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society (this therefore even applies to Bibles and Song Books, which we have, published by the Society), deeming the same to contain periodical articles of a seditious character, and to be otherwise subversive of good order and duly constituted authority. By other provisions of the ordinance, as soon as the proclamation is made public, all such publications already in the colony are forfeited to the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The above was done while the Colonial secretary was for a brief period acting as governor. On arrival of the new governor, two petitions were presented, one signed by 18,145 residents of the colony, the other by representatives of various companies of Jehovah’s witnesses, protesting against the ban and requesting that it be revoked, also with a request that the governor receive a deputation to put forward some further views and information in connection with the subject. In due course the deputation called upon him, and was courteously received; during our presentation of our views he practically ruled out the charge of sedition. A number of the publications were left for his perusal, and we are to hear from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We look to Jehovah to open the way that further work be done in his name in this colony, and much appreciate your co-operation and that of London, in the matter.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Turkish government has forbidden the distribution of any of our literature in that country, but, in the face of this, one zealous pioneer has placed in the hands of the people during the year, as reported to this office, 65 bound books and 2,861 booklets. These placements have been in 1,299 homes.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>SUMMARY</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">Because it is Jehovah’s time to make clear the issue, that all those of good will toward him may be free to take the right course, the following truths more clearly appear than in times past, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That Jehovah, the only true and almighty God, is the everlasting Friend of all who seek meekness and righteousness; that Christ Jesus is the great Vindicator and faithful Servant of Jehovah, the Leader and Commander of all righteous creatures, and the world’s true Ruler; that the Devil is the enemy of God and Christ, and man’s worst enemy; that the Devil long ago organized religion and ever since has caused men to practice religion in defiance of God and to defame God’s name, that the people might be turned away from God; that the Devil has caused men to practice religion, by which means many millions have been deceived and held in darkness; that the leaders of religion are man’s worst visible enemies because they deceive men and cause them to defame God’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The proof is also clear that “Christianity” means knowing and fully obeying the commandments of Jehovah God, as Christ Jesus always does; that all Christians follow in the footsteps of Jesus; that Christianity and religion are directly opposed one to the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The proof is furthermore clear that the so-called “Christian religion” is a false name and that it had its beginning with the Roman Catholic leaders or clergy, which men, according to the words of Christ Jesus, are the sons of the Devil; that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the governing body of the Catholic organization, teaches and practices religion, thereby deceiving millions of persons; that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy substitutes religion or traditions for the Word of God, which works to the injury of the people and is a defamation of God’s name; the proof is furthermore clear today that all true Christians must be witnesses to the name of Jehovah God and declare his name; that upon his witnesses Jehovah has laid the obligation and duty to inform the people as to his truth set forth in the Bible; that in obedience to the commandment of Jehovah, and acting on authority set forth in their commission received from Jehovah, these faithful Christians, who are properly called “Jehovah’s witnesses”, go forth into the earth from place to place, teaching the truth of God’s Word, and for this reason the Devil sets the clergy against them and causes the clergy to cruelly persecute Jehovah’s witnesses, and thus the religionists are fighting against God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The evidence conclusively proves that the final day of reckoning is at hand and that soon the battle of the great day of God Almighty will be fought and Satan and all his forces will be completely defeated; that before that battle is fought Jehovah’s witnesses, in obedience to his commandments, must ‘preach this gospel of the Kingdom as a witness to all nations’. Such preaching they do by word of mouth, by the distribution of books and other literature containing the gospel message, and by means of sound equipment, which reproduces the message that it may be audibly heard. Such is the work these faithful witnesses have been doing for some time, and at the close of another fiscal year, ending September 30, 1936, this brief report is made that the work accomplished may be known to all who desire to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the fiscal year approximately 4,000 sound machines have been used to reproduce the message of the Kingdom; and assuming that these are used on an average of two discs or records per day, that would mean the preaching of approximately 8,000 discourses each day of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to the sound machines and phonographs above mentioned, approximately 100 radio stations, once each week, broadcast by electrical transcription the Kingdom message. Radio station WBBR broadcasts the message by electrical transcription twelve times each week, and some other radio stations as many as seven times during the week. This makes a total oral proclamation of the truth by electrical transcriptions approximately 56,119 speeches per week. Add to this the international broadcasts by radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This marks a witness work not heretofore known in the earth. As will appear from the previous year’s report, up to the end of the fiscal year of 1935, there had been placed in the hands of the people bound books and self-covered books to the total of 205,217,917. During the fiscal year ending September 1936 there were placed in the hands of the people the total number of 24,457,111. Since the publication of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font4"> in 1921, the books placed in the hands of the people, and which contain the message of “this gospel of the kingdom”, are in the aggregate number of 229,675,028.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Amidst great persecution and much suffering inflicted upon them by religionists who serve the Devil, Jehovah’s witnesses, with patience and courage, go onward, singing the praises of Almighty God. These faithful followers of Christ Jesus, serving as Jehovah’s witnesses, are confronted by an enemy horde of overwhelming numbers; but they do not fear, because now Jehovah says to them: “Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s.” (2 Chronicles 20:15) Jehovah will get himself the victory by his great Vindicator, Christ Jesus. Of this there cannot possibly be a doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This report is submitted with full confidence in Jehovah God and in his precious promise to his people that he will “keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee. . . . For in the Lord JEHOVAH is everlasting strength”.— Isaiah 26: 3, 4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.&quot;—Obadiah 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font6">HESE WORDS are a war-time command given by Jehovah to those of his organization and who are under the leadership of Christ Jesus, the Commander of all the heavenly hosts and of all his faithful servants on the earth. The command is to rise up and make war against Satan’s organization, because the time has come. The visible part of the enemy consists of religionists who defame the name of Jehovah and oppose the proclamation of his name. No longer shall Satan and his earthly representatives be permitted without hindrance to defame Jehovah’s name. The Lord Jesus, in obedience to Jehovah’s command, goes forth to war upon the enemy, and for that purpose his hosts are now assembled. The battle of the great day of God Almighty is nigh!</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark199"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark200"></a>All those persons on the earth who love righteousness and hate iniquity must have a part in carrying out the command of Jehovah as given in the year text. Their part is not to fight with carnal weapons, but to use God’s Word. As Jehovah’s witnesses they must go forth with courage, having in mind his precious promise: “The Lord will be with you.” The part of the earthly witnesses in this war is to now sing the praises 203 of Jehovah, bearing testimony to his name. This they will do without fear of man or devil, because backing them up is the Almighty God and Christ Jesus, the great Warrior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The warning must be given, and no Christian dare fail to obey Jehovah’s commandment to give the warning. The sounding of such warning with confidence and joy strikes terror into the hearts of religionists and gives courage and hope to those who desire to know Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. With the completion of the witness work the hosts of heaven move into action. The result will magnify the name of Jehovah. Satan and his organization must perish. The world shall be cleansed of all unrighteousness, and then 'everything that hath breath shall praise Jehovah’. Do your part now!</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The comments following the daily texts are taken from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> (W).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">To him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.—Ps. 50: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah does everything in order. He gives life to his creatures, “every man in his own order,” those who are made members of the royal house being placed by him in the highest order. Each one of the members of that capital organization is placed in a position in the body according to God’s own pleasure. (1 Cor. 15:23; 12: 18) To be pleasing to God the creature must take an orderly course, and for this reason the man of good will, having sincerely desired to serve God, prays to him: “Order my steps in thy word; and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. Deliver me from the oppression of man ■ so will I keep thy precepts. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.” (Ps. 119: 133-135) “The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord; and he delighteth in his way.”—Ps. 37: 23.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing . . . thou shalt not bozo down thyself to them.—Ex. 20: 3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When one voluntarily agrees to do God’s will he enters into a covenant with God and therefore he takes the name of Jehovah God. If he divides his devotion and service between God and the Devil or any of the Devil’s agents or representatives or images he takes the name of God in vain. That means he takes God’s name without any good resulting, but, on the contrary, there results to such a ereature disaster. He becomes an idolater, and must suffer complete loss. God’s emphatic commandment above is given for the benefit of the ereature, because the ereature who has agreed to do God’s will must keep and perform his covenant or agreement and this he can do only by having no god besides Jehovah. Hence one in a covenant cannot pursue a course contrary to God’s law. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/36</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Number fifty days; and . . . ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves, . . . taken with</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">leaven; they are the firstfruits.—Lev. 23:16, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The two loaves waved by the priest at Pentecost were baked with leaven. Leaven being a symbol of imperfection and sin, the leaven in the two loaves therefore seems clearly to say in symbol that the offering in behalf of the people would not be without taint, that all would be contaminated to some extent with the world, and, when informed by the Lord, it would be the responsibility of those presented to the Lord to purge themselves by separating themselves completely from Satan’s organization. This is exactly what the remnant are commanded to do. This supports the conclusion that the two loaves waved by the priest at Pentecost pictured the division, that is, a separation, of those who are accepted by the Lord, from those who are rejected by the Lord.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.—Ps. 106: 47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah gathers unto himself all to whom he gives life everlasting. He does such gathering by his anointed One, Christ Jesus the Beloved. He does not gather to himself any who oppose him, but does gather only those who seek him and comply with his requirements. He gathers to himself first those who have made a covenant by sacrifice and who keep that covenant faithfully. (Ps. 50: 5) Jehovah is not in a contest with Satan to determine which one may get the greater number. God has fixed his rules by which men may get life, and only those who comply with those fixed rules ever gain everlasting life. The Lord Jesus at the command of his Father gathers first the saints to the temple, and these form the royal house, the “little flock”. Then he gathers others, “other sheep”: “Them also I must bring.”—John 10: 16. TV </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, . . . The Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.—Jer. 37: 7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the Lord foretold that, at the end of the period of testimony from 1918 on, his warriors should again fight against the Devil’s organization. The Lord maneuvers the armies of both sides to suit his convenience. The World War came suddenly to an end in 1918, and thus Jehovah shortened the days of tribulation for his elect’s sake. The worldly armies were held back from fighting. Thus Jehovah did that his witnesses might go forth and proclaim the kingdom message. In due time his heavenly armies, which were then withdrawn, will come back and bring fiery destruction upon “Christendom”. Between the end of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">World War and Armageddon his witnesses have also come back and now engage in bearing testimony concerning the kingdom, and giving the warning of the approaching day of Armageddon.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, . . . behold, he shall come.—Mal. 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This declaration concerning the Lord’s coming to the temple is a special announcement to those who had made a covenant by sacrifice to do Jehovah’s will and who therefore are in line for the priesthood. The words which Jehovah put in the mouth of his prophet definitely show that the announcement is for those who had agreed to be entirely submissive to Jehovah’s will. Says Malachi 2: 1: “And now, 0 ye priests, this commandment is for you.” The inference is that there would be some who would show their faith and faithfulness and would receive the Lord’s approval at his coming, and some who would receive his curse because of unfaithfulness. “If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the Lord of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you.” (2: 2) His coming marks a crucial testing.

<p><span class="font4">ZZe </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? . . . The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night.—Isa. 21:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mount Seir was the country of the Edomites, which pictured the political and hypocritical religious leaders who claim the birthright to the kingdom but who are in truth and fact representatives of the Devil. The watchman to whom the prisoner class (those under restraint) calls is Jehovah’s anointed witnesses, who must be constantly on the watch in behalf of the kingdom interests and see to it that they do not compromise with any part of Satan’s organization. The watchmen or servant class must be blind to everything except the kingdom of God and its interests. (Isa. 42: 19) That class must hear the Word of God at his mouth and be diligent to proclaim it in the presence and hearing of others who have an ear to hear. “So thou, 0 son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel.”—Ezek. 33: 7.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">And Aaron . . . shall take the two goats, and present them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.—Lev. 16: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At this point the two goats pictured all those who during the period of sacrifice consecrate themselves to do God’s will and whom God justifies. This period of sacrifice began with the Lord Jesus and the apostles and continues until all the members of Christ’s body are selected. The fact that both are in line for the sin offering is shown by the law which required both goats to be without blemish. The justified man stands before God as approved and is fit to be offered as a sacrifice before the Lord. The two goats in the court therefore pictured the justified and spirit-begotten class in the entirety, because God’s granting justification to men during the period of sacrifice is for the very purpose of qualifying them as his sons to be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">the sacrifice with Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font4">The father and mother of Moses and Aaron were distinguished for their faith in Jehovah rather than for the fact of being of the tribe of Levi. They were commended for their faith in Jehovah. Aaron was called and chosen to be the high priest, not merely because he was a Levite, but because of the fact that he was a brother of Moses, who had shown his faith in Jehovah God. Moses was chosen by Jehovah as a priest superior to Aaron. He was also a prophet, because of his faith and faithfulness, and not because he was of the tribe of Levi. Both Moses and Aaron, in the performance of their duties to which they were officially assigned, foreshadowed Christ Jesus, the great Prophet and Priest of Jehovah. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The day of Jehovah is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?—Joel 2:11, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s day began in the autumn season of A.D. 1914 and continues thereafter. The “day of the Lord” marks the beginning of sorrows upon Satan’s organization, because it is then that Jehovah by the hand of Christ Jesus interrupts Satan’s long reign of wickedness. Within that period of time there must be a great witness to the name of the Lord God, and this must be given throughout the earth. (Isa. 19: 19, 20) In that time God will take account with all the nations because they serve Satan. (Isa. 13: 6, 9, 13) While Satan’s organization will be in great sorrow the remnant of God’s organization on earth will sing. (Isa. 26: 1, 2; 28: 5, 6) While they sing multitudes of people will turn away from Satan’s organization and seek the Lord. (Isa. 29: 18, 19) The day of Jehovah is a great day, a day of wondrous things, and blessed is the man who is wholly on His side in that day. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/36</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, . . . and the Jebusites.—Josh. 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The advance of God’s chosen people against the enemies occupying the promised land was about to begin and the first important thing was that the Israelites should know that Jehovah is the true and only God. Jehovah, performing a miracle, led them across the Jordan river, so that the whole host of Israel passed over on dry land and in safety. When the Israelites got on the west side the fight did begin against the enemy. Why Jehovah did this is stated as “that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty; that ye might fear the Lord’’. (4: 24) God was there showing that the most important thing is vindication of his name, that all may know he is the Almighty.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1 have loved you, saith the Lord: yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us?</span><span class="font4"> Was </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">not Esau Jacob’s brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob.—Mal. 1: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah proved this by restoring natural Israel from Babylon to the Holy Land, thus preventing Satan’s world power from destroying them completely. Jehovah proved this statement to the remnant of spiritual Israel after the harrowing experiences of 1918. The Deliverer came out of Zion, and, as written at Romans 11:26, “so all [spiritual] Israel shall be saved; as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob [all of God’s people].” Cold, unresponsive ones seek to justify themselves in not obeying the Lord’s commandments, and therefore propound to the Lord the question: “Wherein hast thou loved us?” After the unfolding to the faithful ones the purpose of Jehovah their love increased and they more readily responded to his commandments.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1 will abide in thy tabernacle for ever.—Ps. 61: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The chief objective of the faithful servant class is to serve Jehovah and his kingdom, knowing full well that the Lord is directing their course and will bring about the result according to his holy will. These faithful ones have entered into the joy of the Lord, which is the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and, knowing that Armageddon will vindicate Jehovah’s name, the faithful servant class are perfectly willing to wait on the Lord and continue loyally and faithfully serving him. These faithful ones are in the Lord’s organization, and by the Lord’s grace they delight to remain there for ever, and the place of service they do not even care to choose. They well know that God assigns all members to a place in the body as it pleases him and doubtless he assigns all in his organization to a place, and that he requires of each and every one full obedience and faithfulness.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Who shall stand when he appear eth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ sope.—Mal.. 3: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great Refiner causes the dross to be separated from the real and to appear on the surface as scum so that it may be taken off and cast away by the angels attending upon the Lord, the great Judge, at the temple. Up to the beginning of this judgment the consecrated were mixed up in Babylon, Satan’s organization. When they came out they returned to the Lord with garments soiled, they being soiled with such marks or spots as would identify them as having been associated with the unclean. They must be cleaned up, and the great Judge cleans up all who submit themselves willingly to his cleansing work, and he makes their garments such that they are identified thereafter as God’s sons and servants. That would include the taking away from them of improper names or means of identification. They will have only the “new name” which Jehovah gives them.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother.—Prov. 6: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah requires absolute loyalty and faithfulness of every one whom he makes a member of his royal organization. The same rule appears to apply to all who receive life everlasting. Jehovah is the Father, or Life-giver, and there is no life everlasting received save that which proceeds from him. He dispenses the great gift of life by and through Christ Jesus, his executive officer. The mother of the members of the royal house is Jehovah God’s organization, his “woman”, otherwise called Zion. All who are born of her receive life from and are taught by Jehovah God. (Isa. 54: 13) In brief, Proverbs 6: 20 means this: That the sons of God must keep his commandments and be guided by the law of his organization, for “the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life”. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Even the “faithful servant” class, the remnant, did not discern the Lord’s coming to the temple at the time it occurred. Those faithful ones were fully trusting in the Lord and waiting upon him, yet it was not until 1922 that the Lord revealed to them that he was at the temple for judgment. Now all who love God must bestir themselves and be diligent in his service. The darkness that had partially surrounded those who afterward became members of the remnant class completely enfolded “Christendom”, and particularly the “evil servant” class, so that the day of the Lord Jesus Christ overtook them as a thief. The clergy have no conception of the Lord’s coming to the temple for judgment. All “Christendom” is beastly drunk, like night revelers, filled with and befuddled by the strong drink of Satan’s joy in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses and trying to destroy the Society.

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah works, and he requires that every creature whom he approves shall work, and such work must be done according to Jehovah’s will. The perfect guide for the creature is God’s Word. It is important to know the will of God and then to do it, otherwise one could not work lawfully. Jehovah knew the end from the beginning, and at all times his work is according to his purpose. He says: “I have purposed it, I will also do it.” Jehovah has a due time for everything. (Eccl. 3: 1-8) He completes one work and then proceeds to another, and likewise all his approved creatures must do, as he has commanded. The great purpose of Jehovah, as it is revealed to man, is the vindication of his holy name. In performing his purpose Jehovah exhibits his supreme power, and in connection therewith he causes his witnesses to proclaim his name, thus giving them a part in his work.

<p><span class="font4">The antitypical High Priest, Christ Jesus, began selecting the two antitypical goats in the day of the apostles. That work of selection must continue until the required number of the Lord’s goat class is selected and offered before Jehovah. The two goats taken from the congregation of the Israelites were at the expense of that people. The Israelites pictured mankind seeking reconciliation with God and out of which certain ones are taken to be offered up with Christ Jesus. Both of the goats were selected and in line to be used for the sin offering, but only one was actually used as an offering for sin. That one was called “the goat of the sin offering”. The scapegoat prophetically pictured a spirit class that form the “evil servant” class. Its members go into perdition. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The second outpouring of the holy spirit has disclosed two classes of persons, both of which were presented before the Lord when he appeared at the temple and began judgment at the house of God. Those of both classes claimed to be sincere when presented to the Lord at the temple, but the Lord caused the selfish ones to demonstrate that they were moved by selfishness and therefore not unqualifiedly devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom. The sincere ones have nothing to do with the insincere ones who continue to compromise with Satan’s organization. The two loaves, therefore, show that one class is rejected and one class accepted by the Lord. The feast of Pentecost is limited to those in line for the Kingdom. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Then came the great Messenger of Jehovah &quot;suddenly”, that is, unexpectedly, instantly, straightway. For that reason it was very necessary for the ones expecting him to come to be watching, as Jesus had told them they must do. It is Christ Jesus that appears at the temple as the official representative of God, and thus Jehovah appears in a representative capacity at his temple. At the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple the new covenant is inaugurated at the hand of Jehovah’s great Messenger or Angel, the Lord Jesus in glory. It is this messenger in whom those who love him and his appearing have great delight. There could be no doubt of his coming when Jehovah’s due time arrives, because Jehovah brings to pass his purpose according to his will. &quot;He shall come.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/36 Fret not thyself because of evil doers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.—Ps. 37:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord’s faithful servants do not fret themselves concerning others who fail to do their duty. Each servant stands or falls to his master, and therefore the faithful one is deeply concerned about proving his own integrity. He knows that he cannot succeed in doing so by finding fault with others who appear to fail or who do fail to faithfully perform. It is entirely proper for brethren to point out to one another the great privilege of serving God and his kingdom and to urge one another to do all he can to magnify Jehovah’s name, but such admonition should always be given in kindness and never by way of harsh criticism. All at the temple will be in exact harmony and will dwell together and work together in peace to the glory of God, which means the forgetting of self and the magnifying of the name of Jehovah.—Ps. 29: 9.

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah lays responsibility upon his anointed witnesses, having made them the watchman for his kingdom interests, and commands them to give warning, and states what will be the penalty for failure to obey his commandments. The Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, commands the witnesses what to do, and it is far better for them to obey the commandments than sacrifice, because all who fail or refuse to obey will suffer destruction and therefore the sacrifice previously made will avail nothing. If they faithfully obey, they shall live. The service of the remnant is different, for that reason, from what it was previously, for there is more important work now to be done. The great issue, which has been pending for centuries, is now about to be settled for ever. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There is only one way to seek righteousness, and that is to diligently seek to know and to do God’s appointed way. He is the righteous and holy one: “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.” To “seek meekness” means that one must be teachable, that is to say, must be willing and anxious to learn what is in God’s Word. Some who believe themselves to be of the “faithful servant” class do not deem it essential to continue to study God’s Word, and the explanation of his truths which he gives through the Watch Tower publications. One who takes that course is certain to fail unless he quickly recovers himself from that wrongful way. Only those who are diligent in the study and application of the Word of God are safe from the Devil’s assaults, whether they be of the anointed or of the “great multitude”. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Today Jehovah, by his Greater Joshua, Christ Jesus, has led the faithful antitypical Israelites, Israel in the spirit, into the “land” or place that Jehovah has assigned to them, and now the war is on with the enemies, particularly the religionists who fight against the remnant at the instance of the Devil. The purpose of the war now in progress is to magnify Jehovah’s name and to make known to the people that Jehovah is supreme. In this way both the enemy and those who desire to do right are informed and warned. It is the testimony delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses that causes the enemies to war upon them preceding the battle of the great day of God Almighty. It is Jehovah’s name that is involved, and his kingdom which is now advancing, and his name shall now be exalted and vindicated and his kingdom rule the earth. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/36 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you?

<p><span class="font4">There is danger of defiling. Those who take such a course find the same fate as that meted out to the scapegoat. The faithful remnant are the children of light, and never has it been more important than now to walk in the light, which means to go in the way God has commanded and to give all diligence to joyfully obey his commandments. The “Lord’s goat’’ class are the ones faithful in performing the covenant by sacrifice and are made joint sacrificers with Christ Jesus, are built upon the true foundation, and are approved by the Lord when he appears at his temple. To them are committed the kingdom interests, and these continue faithfully rejoicing in what the Lord permits to come to them and continue to sing forth the praises of Jehovah. 17 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/36</span></p>

Any part of the kingdom interests entrusted to such, be it ever so small, will be carefully safeguarded, looked after, protected, and duty and obligation in connection therewith will be honestly performed.

<p><span class="font4">“Obadiah” means “serving Jehovah” or “servant of Jehovah”; which shows that the prophecy is for the servant class of Jehovah. The identity of Obadiah is uncertain. It is not certain whether the prophet, the writer of the prophecy, actually bore that name Obadiah or used the name as an appropriate title for the prophecy. This is very interesting for the reason it suggests that in the fulfillment of this prophecy the personal identity of those who compose the servant class (whom Obadiah pictured) is neither necessary nor important. This excludes the reason and opportunity for personal shining and adulation. To be sure, the Lord Jesus, who is the head of the servant class, is always definitely identified; but as to the persons who are made members of that servant class, their identity is not at all important.

It is therefore a time of judgment, which begins at the house of God and extends to all those who are in an implied covenant to do God’s will. The question is raised, Who will abide that day ? who will maintain his integrity and show himself truly devoted to Jehovah during that trying period ?

<p><span class="font4">Responsibility of the creature to the Creator is in proportion to the knowledge possessed by the creature or that which, by exercise of due care and diligence, the creature might acquire. The knowledge which the creature receives from God’s Word discloses to him the opportunity to serve God and to thereby prove his integrity toward God. As opportunities increase, the responsibility of the creature increases. Negligence or indifference finds no support in the Scriptures. “Neglect not the gift that is in thee.” (1 Tim. 4: 14) ‘ ‘ How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.” (Ileb. 2: 3) This rule applies both with reference to acquiring knowledge of God’s purpose and to performing service as opportunity is afforded.

<p><span class="font4">At his judgment work the Lord must apply the fire, the crucial tests, so as to cause the separation of approved from disapproved and thereby show up or make manifest that which is precious and that which is base or dross. The fire that causes the separation appears to be the prophetic truths which the Lord reveals, together with the -publication and service of such truths in vindication of Jehovah’s name. “Is not my word like as a fire? saith the Lord.” (Jer. 23: 29) Those who have received or used the truth for a selfish purpose will not and do not stand the fiery test. Likewise those who fear men or man-made institutions will not stand it. Fear of man, which leads one to refrain from telling the truth and testifying to Jehovah’s name when opportunity offers, leads that fearful person right into Satan’s snare. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/36</span></p>

If one compromises with the enemy and suffers from that, such suffering avails nothing. If one suffers because of faithfulness to the Lord, happy is he, because that suffering is like the suffering that came upon Christ Jesus. The faithful are now rejoicing in the Lord that they are permitted to fill up some of the sufferings of Christ left over. (Col. 1: 24) No one can prove faithful and maintain integrity toward God and at the same time compromise with the enemy by failing or refusing to serve God by reason of fear of enemies of God and his kingdom.

They were to eat and drink and rejoice before the Lord. This matter is specifically emphasized when some of the captives returned from Babylon. In captivity they did not keep the feast of tabernacles. When Nehemiah and others returned, the people were found weeping because they learned that the law of God commanded them to keep the feast of tabernacles, which they were not doing. It was then that preparation was made to celebrate the feast, and Nehemiah said to the people: “Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, . . . for this day is holy unto our Lord; neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the Lord is your strength.’’—Neh. 8:9, 10.

He did not permit the firstborn (Esau) to receive his love merely because of the rule governing the same, well knowing in advance that he would be unfaithful and that Jacob would faithfully obey Him. God hated Esau because of his selfishness and lack of faith in God’s promise. For the same reason the “wicked servant” class and all persons composing that class are hated and cast away from the Lord. Their heritage as heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ Jesus is brought down to barren desolation, because they refused to suffer with Christ Jesus and did not give honor to Jehovah their Father and to his kingdom. This judgment and its execution against that class began with Christ’s coming to the temple in 1918 and is certain likewise to be visited upon any of the temple who become unfaithful thereafter.

The faithful consecrated ones were practically inactive and unable to act. The World War closed with Jehovah’s faithful ones, “my two witnesses,” apparently dead. But the Lord declared that these should again come up (Rev. 11: 3-12), and they did come up and since then have been scattering God’s fiery judgments over “Christendom”.

<p><span class="font4">Having received the grace of God in vain there is no other place to send him and he is sent away out of God’s organization and unto Satan, that is, delivered over to Satan. (1 Cor. 5:5) The class pictured by the “live goat” wanted to live and be free and not be subject unto the higher powers, namely, Jehovah God and Christ. Accordingly it is given all the freedom of action it wants, but not in God’s organization. It is given freedom of choosing its own course of action with Satan and his organization. The wilderness does not necessarily signify a place or condition of violent death of this goat class at the hands of Satan and his agents, but rather a condition void of all light and truth, a condition of outer darkness and destruction. —Matt. 13: 42; 25: 30.

The Devil would use some now to induce Jehovah’s witnesses to believe that they should slack up their work and not expect to do anything particularly important until after Armageddon. To influence or induce one to take such a course is seducing or turning one aside from the right way. But the Lord shows that it is not possible to deceive the very elect. Those fully devoted to the Lord will refuse to be influenced or seduced by such efforts to keep them quiet. They will be on the alert at all times and resent any and all subtle influence of the Devil, which may appear to be put forward by him through any creature, whether that creature claims to be consecrated to the Lord or not. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/36</span></p>

(1 Pet. 4: 17) From that time on judgment is laid to the line, and righteousness to the plummet, with respect to things earthly, including the Devil’s visible organization.

<p><span class="font4">That means that every creature who comes to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">knowledge of the truth, and who receives God’s approval, must also proclaim to all who will hear the truth of and concerning Jehovah and his purpose. The entire matter is leading up to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Jesus therefore is the perfect pattern or example set before men, and every person who faithfully follows that perfect pattern or example is caused to suffer because the wicked one, Satan, defames God’s name and attempts to heap disgrace and suffering upon all who faithfully serve God. No other condition is to be expected until the manifestation of Jehovah’s power resulting in the destruction of that wicked enemy. Jehovah performs his work, and Christ Jesus does his work, and every man who undertakes to obey God must do the work assigned to him.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites.—Neh. 13: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sanctuary must be cleansed by removing all compromisers, who seek the favor of creatures. Any who indulge in compromising with the Devil’s organization for any reason whatsoever are prevented from entering or remaining in the temple. The Lord judges all according to the heart condition, and all selfishness and the compromising spirit will in due time be made manifest and the disapproved set aside from the Lord’s holy organization. The cleansing and refining work applies to the entire antitypical tribe of Levi. This proves that the Levites aside from the priests do not picture a class of consecrated ones that are partially faithful and that must be forced into sacrifice. Antitypical Levites serve in different places and in different capacities in God’s organization, but all the approved ones must be equally clean and equally faithful and dependable.

<p><span class="font4">The Israelites were informed and knew that when they entered the land of Canaan it meant war with the enemy. Likewise Jehovah has informed his people now on earth of the combined forces of the enemy. They must expect to fight, and hence now the remnant are engaged in the fight and they know the reason why. The enemies in Canaan formed a conspiracy against God’s people. Likewise now the Devil and his gang, invisible and visible, have formed a conspiracy against the people of God. The Hivites of Gibeon and neighboring towns did not join that conspiracy, and therefore were the exception. They showed fear of God and his hosts and sought a way of obtaining God’s favor. The fear of the Gibeonites foreshadowed a class of people that have now fear of God, which marks “the beginning of wisdom”. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">His delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.—Ps. 1:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The law of Jehovah, that is, the rule of action or conduct prescribed by him for man, is perfect. He who walks truly and sincerely in the law of God goes in the right way. Continuing therein, that man will receive the everlasting favor of God. (Ps. 19: 7-9) Of Jesus these words are recorded: “I delight to do thy will, 0 my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Ps. 40: 8) That means that at all times Jesus is entirely devoted to Jehovah God’s rule prescribed for the righteous, that such at all times was the rule of his heart, and that at all times he delights to do God’s will. To meditate on the law of God day and night means to consider it all the time, that is, the man who is blessed of God always considers the will or law of God and is diligent to be guided by that law. He is constantly examining his course of conduct in the light of God’s law. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/36</span></p>

Jehovah’s witnesses, the little flock, and the Jonadab or “great multitude” company must walk together and work harmoniously together. It is the duty of the anointed to render aid and comfort and encouragement to the Jonadab class. All of these then must be faithful and true to the Lord. Arrayed against them is the Devil and all of his representatives. Therefore the greater necessity for all those who are on the Lord’s side and in his organization to stand firmly together, dwelling in peace, and working harmoniously, and making known to others that Jehovah is God, Christ is King, and the kingdom is here.

<p><span class="font4">It is the whole “day” or entire period of time under consideration that comes as the thief. The coming of the Lord Jesus has already taken place, but “sudden destruction”, which takes place in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ, is yet future. The beginning of the “day of Jehovah”, to wit, 1914, did not come as a thief. The beginning of the “thief” day arrived in 1918. Prior to 1918 “Protestant” clergy and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy fought and since continue to fight against the messengers of Jehovah’s kingdom and by opposing the kingdom show they are drunk or sound asleep as to privileges of serving the King. Likewise the foolish-virgin class now soundly sleep and are inactive and in darkness. All such being in darkness, the day of the Lord Jesus Christ has overtaken them as a thief.

<p><span class="font4">The work to be performed by the followers of Christ is not the same at all times. One part of the work assigned is finished and then another is begun and carried on. It was and is so with Christ Jesus. He was engaged for three and one-half years in bringing testimony to the hearing of others as God had commanded, and, having obeyed the commandment of his Father, he made report and said to his Father: “I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.” (17: 4) One work of Jesus being completed, he proceeds to another. While all his work relates to vindication of Jehovah’s name, that work must be done orderly and at the proper stated time. For this reason, when Jesus ascended into heaven Jehovah commanded that Jesus should wait until the proper time to make the enemy Satan his footstool. (Ps. 110: 1) That time related to the second coming of Christ. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">10/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">All the people of God, including the spiritual and the human class, have been brought onto Jehovah’s side during the time that Satan has ruled in wickedness. Dwelling in booths therefore seems to say that they are not part of Satan’s organization but are separate and apart therefrom, that temporarily they must dwell in Satan’s world but arc no part of it, and that they are looking for a permanent and righteous government in which righteousness dwells. Abraham and the other faithful men of old, being on the Lord’s side, were in that condition. Concerning Abraham it is written that ‘he dwelt in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise, for they looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God’.—Heb. 11: 8-16.

<p><span class="font4">The consecrated, spirit-begotten ones that are wholly and unselfishly devoted to God stand on the side of Jehovah and firmly hold that position regardless of all outside influence. They are not selfishly looking for reward, but are looking to God for his approval, and hence they devote themselves faithfully to God. Their faithfulness and the maintenance of their integrity toward God results in their fulfillment of their covenant with him by sacrifice. (Ps. 50: 5) These, pictured by the Lord’s goat, are accepted as joint sacrific-ers with Jesus, the sin-bearer, and therefore, as it is written of them, they “are buried with him by baptism into [his] death”. (Rom. 6: 4) It is only those who share in the sacrificial death with Christ Jesus that live and reign with him. “If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.”—2 Tim. 2: 12.

<p><span class="font4">All the other nations of Canaan were in a conspiracy to fight and, if possible, to destroy the Israelites; and for the Gibeonites to stand aloof from that conspiracy, and in the face of it to seek favor at the hands of the one leading the fight against the conspirators, required some real faith on the part of the Gibeonites. Likewise today all of Satan’s organization and those under his organization, with but one exception, are bound together in a conspiracy to fight against and, if possible, to destroy Jehovah’s chosen and anointed people. That one exception is the class that forms the “great multitude”. The Gibeonites showed themselves dependent upon Joshua. All men seeking the way to life are dependent upon Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There is no occasion to give any special honor to any man or men. The special adulation and honoring of men is for the past, and at the present time it finds, or at least should find, no place among God’s people. This further explains also that some of those once of the servant class may fall away and hence a change in the personnel of the servant body be made, but the purpose and the work of the servant class are never altered. There is no individual of the servant class who is so very important that he must be set up on a pedestal. What counts with the Lord is faithfulness in the performance of duty. Those who remain of the servant class must be dependable; and if some become unreliable they will be quickly set aside, but this would in no wise affect the result concerning the work and the purpose of the servant class.

<p><span class="font4">The fact that the entire tribe of Levi was separated to the Lord’s service in the place and stead of the firstborn is a very persuasive argument that the Levites, both priests and nonpriests, were typical of the &quot;church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven”, and which prove faithful to God and are made members of the royal house. (Ileb. 12: 23) It was a privilege God had given to Aaron and his sons to minister unto him at the tabernacle in the priest’s office, and it was no less a privilege from the Lord that the others of the tribe of Levi were assigned to specific service at the tabernacle to assist the priesthood. Being a gift to the priest to do service at the tabernacle as assistants to the priest would strongly argue that all the Levites were members of the household of the high priest, all brethren of one family.

<p><span class="font4">There is nothing that cleanses like fire. Only the pure and indestructible can remain. The antitypical Levites, at the Lord Jesus’ coming to the temple, had associated themselves with “Babylon” by adopting ceremonies such as Babylon used, and showed they cared more for approval of men than for the approval of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. After the Lord’s coming to the temple and the applying of the ‘refiner’s fire’ test he sends forth his angels and clears out or cleans out all those antitypical Levites once in line for the kingdom but who had failed to keep their covenant and to serve God in spirit and in truth. This the Lord does that the remaining or purified ones may be like gold and silver made pure, faithful, dependable and indestructible.

They will ‘never for a moment quail before their antagonists’, but will bravely and firmly and courageously stand for the Lord. Their ‘fearlessness will now serve as a sure token to the enemy of the enemy’s impending destruction’, and to the faithful ‘their fearlessness will be to them a sure token of salvation from God!’ (Phil. 1:28, 29) Jehovah has given his word that he will preserve those who maintain their integrity toward him.

The Lord’s anointed now know they are among the enemy, and they are cautious to consider one who approaches them and to first ascertain whether one approaching is a friend or foe. The instructions given by Jehovah to his anointed people are to refuse absolutely to make a covenant or have anything in common with any part of the condemned Devil’s organization. Jehovah’s people know there are those in the world who are not in accord with the Devil’s spirit, but they act with due care to make no covenant with anyone until they first see some evidence that the others are sincerely seeking the way of the Lord. “What agreement hath the temple of God with idols? ...

The descendants of Esau, the Edomites, represent a class of persons who are apparently the firstborn and in line for the kingdom. The priests and Pharisees of Jesus’ time claimed to be children of Abraham and hence in line for the kingdom blessings promised to Abraham, but Jesus told them they were sons of the Devil.

The priest and the others of that tribe are always associated together. The nonpriestly part of the tribe served their brethren who were serving in the priest’s office. Both were servers of the Lord, but not all were assigned to the same place of service. It is even so in the body of Christ that God hath “set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him”. (1 Cor-. 12: 18) The nonpriests of the tribe of Levi served the priests, not as the servants of men, but “as unto the Lord”, as the Lord had assigned them places of service.

As the “Edomites” sought to kill Jesus when he was on the earth, so the modern-day Edomites seek to bring about the death of the members of Christ now on earth, and therefore they ‘’thus do unto the Lord Jesus himself’ in this day; and because these are his faithful followers he counts them as a part of himself. The clergy seek the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses because they insist that a true follower of Christ Jesus must obey God rather than men.

Likewise those who form the great multitude in this day of Jehovah must and do hear of him and his King. This message of truth they receive at the hands of the witnesses whom the Lord has sent forth to give that testimony.

When the Israelites returned from captivity they made booths, sat under them and were glad. For a long while persons of good will have been captive to Satan’s organization.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon.—Jer. 38: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ebed-melech’s name means “servant”. He was not an Israelite. This is made certain by the fact that he had been sterilized and made a eunuch, which is contrary to Israel’s law. He was in effect a prisoner of unfaithful Jerusalem, being a trusty and harmless one, who had general access to the king’s house to serve the king. Not at all in sympathy with the harsh deeds of the ruling house of Jerusalem, he therefore pictured a class subjected to “Christendom” but not at all in sympathy with her harsh and cruel methods. He saw the great injustice that had been done to Jeremiah. He had faith in Jeremiah’s God; therefore he pictured the “other sheep” of the Lord Jesus, and therefore pictures the same class of persons as did Jonadab. As an Ethiopian he symbolized a natural sinner who desires to learn of God. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">When all the Levites had gathered themselves unto Moses, then Moses commanded them to “slay everyman his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour”. The Levites did according to Moses’ words, and about three thousand fell that day. “For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, even every man upon hig son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.” (Vss. 25-29) On this occasion it was the tribe of Levi that exhibited their faith and devotion to Jehovah God. After the Israelites had left Egypt the Levites were selected instead of the firstborn of all the tribes of Israel and were assigned to&gt; the tabernacle service of the Lord. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/36</span></p>

Now they see more clearly than ever that those who form the great multitude must hear of Jehovah and his kingdom and must know the only way to salvation and must take their stand on God’s side by confessing with their mouth and showing by their course of action their faith in God and Christ Jesus. By giving the remnant this information the Lord is clearly pointing out the duty and obligation laid upon them, to wit, the necessity of bearing the kingdom fruits before those who may desire to seek the way of salvation. The result would be wholly disastrous to the remnant believing and acting otherwise, and also disastrous to those who might desire salvation and who might be of the great multitude.

<p><span class="font4">The temple company has now become a part of God’s elect servant and is under direct command of the Head of the servant class, Christ Jesus himself. The motive that induces them now to engage in the work must be love, unselfishness, a willing and joyful devotion to God and to his King and kingdom. The King is on his throne, at the temple conducting judgment and instructing and directing the temple class. That is the beginning of the exercise of God’s power through Christ Jesus toward the world, and in behalf of his own people. Those of the temple must now become willing and are willing to do their work, and they do it joyfully: “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning.” (Ps. 110: 3) The morning of the new day has come. Its light discloses the beauty of holiness of the Lord, and those of the temple are like strong young men going into battle.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Azazel</span><span class="font4"> means a person or creature in opposition to Jehovah, and which creature is Satan the Devil. By the selfish course of action taken by this class, represented by the scapegoat, they stand on the Devil’s side, and not because the Lord arbitrarily so determines. The Lord judges them according to the selfish course taken and manifested by them. The heart condition and course of action taken automatically put them in that goat class according to Jehovah’s unchangeable law. These are not offered, but are “presented”, that is, “set alive,” before the Lord that attention may be called to the fact that this “goat” has not fulfilled the covenant with Jehovah by sacrifice but is alive contrary to the terms of that covenant. The judgment or decree is then with Jehovah as to what shall be done with that “live goat”. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The people of good will now seeking the way to God’s organization recognize Jehovah as the Supreme One and Christ Jesus the Greater Joshua as the “higher powers”. To the petition of the Gibeonites Joshua replied: “Who are ye? and from whence come ye?” How well the Gibeonites’ course fits the condition upon which the great multitude seek God’s organization. First they must have a good will toward God and toward his kingdom and the King Christ Jesus, the Greater Joshua. As Joshua required the Gibeonites to identify themselves, so the Greater Joshua requires those coming to him to identify themselves and to confess whether they are on the Devil’s side or on the side of God and Christ and his people: “For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”—Rom. 10: 10.

<p><span class="font4">If one has been entrusted with the Lord’s service in the name of the Lord and he is faithful, having in mind only one thing, that is, to exalt Jehovah’s name, that person will not be hunting something to find fault with and hinder the work of God’s organization. On the contrary, he will show his full faith and confidence in the Lord and that the Lord knows how to conduct his own affairs, and he will have faith that God and Christ Jesus will permit no interference therewith. The faithful well know that those who insist on interfering with the Lord’s work, he gathers out and separates from his true and faithful ones. Those who thus by faultfinding are interfering in any manner with the forward progress of the proclamation of God’s kingdom-message show they are entering into darkness and will soon be in full darkness and have no appreciation of the prophecies now unfolding.

<p><span class="font4">Those of Zion, the remnant, pronounce the judgments of God, which he has previously written and which judgments mark and condemn to destruction the hypocritical religionists, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and her allied clergy. It is the declaration of the vengeance of Jehovah God against the hypocrites which the remnant are commissioned to declare. Pronouncing of these judgments of Jehovah against the scornful men, the Hierarchy and their allied clergy, necessarily provokes a war, because it exposes the frauds and hypocrisy of that wicked crowd. Jehovah’s witnesses are now engaged in declaring the divine judgments, proclaiming the Scriptures that make known that God’s time is at hand when he takes account with his enemies.

<p><span class="font4">There is much work to be done on earth by those who are of the temple company, and the Lord gives to them an understanding of his truths that they may be fully equipped for such work. To such anointed ones, therefore, much has been given, and of them much will now be required. Being equipped, they must use that equipment. If the equipment furnished by the Lord is not properly used it certainly will be taken away and opportunities for service will be gone and the one from whom these gifts are taken will be relegated to complete darkness. Many have been deprived of this divine equipment by reason of failure to measure up to requirements. Such requirements must be met and performed while the anointed are on earth. Those unselfishly devoted to God and who joyfully do with their might what their hands find to do are the ones that are equipped to do the work in hand and the ones to whom the Lord entrusts much more.

It means watchfulness and carefulness in observing and performing a duty or discharging an obligation. To be faithful means to be honest, constant and unchangeable. It means integrity. To maintain one’s integrity toward God one must be faithful. That means he must be true and constant in his allegiance and devotion io God, because he is bound to God and Christ by a solemn covenant. It means that one in the covenant with God must be thorough and firm in the observance and performance of service entrusted to him. It means to be true, reliable, worthy of dependence and entirely dependable. Only the righteous who maintain and preserve integrity toward God enter into his royal house.

<p><span class="font4">The princes of Israel, who were with Joshua, picture those wholly and completely devoted to God and who speak in the name of Jehovah and Christ, not for any selfish purpose, but only that God’s will may be done in them. They have spoken in God’s name and are determined to carry out their covenant with the Lord. They stand out against those who object to carrying the message to the great multitude. Jehovah’s anointed remnant has sworn to do God’s will, and his will to them is expressed in his Word and reveals that they are to bear the kingdom fruits before and to minister to the great multitude, and this must be that the ones marked as God’s servants may be delivered from the Executioner’s sword at Armageddon.

They include the priestly and nonpriestly class, that is, some who have occupied one place in the service, and some a separate and different place in the service, but all standing equal and having an equal and fair trial before the Lord. Not all of these have served in the priest’s office, because there are not enough places, but all who are “Levites” are set aside for the Lord’s service and all are equally responsible to prove their faithfulness to him. The tribe of Levi stands here for all consecrated ones in line for the kingdom of God and who necessarily must appear before the Lord Jesus when at the temple for judgment.

<p><span class="font4">To the Greater Joshua Jehovah has committed all power and authority concerning those of the great multitude. These come seeking the way to Zion, and the Greater Joshua, Christ Jesus, deals with them. He sends forth from his temple his servants with instructions as to how they are to deal with those seeking the way to the kingdom. These witnesses see the soiled garments of the persons of good will and they see the unwholesome provender which has been handed to these people to feed upon and which they have received at the hands of the clergy; and the remnant, having received their instruction concerning the servants of the Lord, then endeavor to show such honest-hearted ones the way to the kingdom by exhibiting to them the fruits of the kingdom, the lifegiving food that proceeds from the Lord, W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Lord judges from a different viewpoint from that of man, because God looks at the motive that causes man to act. Unless one delights in doing God’s will he cannot live. The moving cause for obedience to God’s law must be love, that is, a ready response to the requirements of the law without reference to what may be personally gained in this life. The right motive must be a sincere desire to serve God because he is right, righteous and just. Hence God’s commandment is of greatest importance, which says to man: ‘ ‘ Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.” The creature who is pleasing to God cannot divide his affection or devotion between God and any creature or any image or thing.

<p><span class="font4">The Abrahamic birthright privileges were claimed by the clergy because they have always claimed to be the ones favored of God. Jehovah foreknew that they would be unfaithful and would fall away completely to the Devil, and therefore he foretold such in this prophecy concerning the Edomites. The Abrahamic birthright privileges as held out to and claimed by the clergy, Jesus foretold would be taken away from them because they failed to bring forth the fruits (the truth) of the kingdom. It is only the clergy that have tried to compete with Jehovah’s true saints for the kingdom privileges. This corresponds exactly with Esau’s (or Edom’s) rivalry toward Jacob forthe birthright of his father. Esau tried to kill Jacob, and the antitypical Edomites likewise now try to destroy Jehovah’s true witnesses, pictured by Jacob.

The Roman Catholic Hierarchy have induced themselves to believe that their organization is invulnerable and that ‘the gates of hell cannot prevail against it ’, and claim to have made an agreement with death and hell and that therefore they are entirely secure. That organization is certain that it will rule the world, and in saying “Peace and safety” they would not be referring to the world’s peace among the nations, but to what they think is accomplished by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies against the forces that have disturbed their peace.

This of itself shows that the remnant on earth bear some relation thereto, that is to say, that those who compose the “little flock” must be closely associated therewith and that those also of the “other sheep”, the “great multitude”, arc included in what the feast of tabernacles foreshadows. This is the only place revealed by the record that Jesus taught in connection with the feast of tabernacles. By associating himself with this feast Jesus proves conclusively that he fulfilled the type in miniature and that the fulfillment in completeness must begin while the remnant members of his body are on the earth and during the time when Christ Jesus is at the temple for judgment.

The Gibeonites had stated their case before Joshua and declared their willingness to be his servants. Thus they showed their good will toward Joshua and his God. Those who compose the great multitude get life by the grace of God, and they must get life through Jesus Christ and must exercise faith in his shed blood and so declare themselves before the great antitypical battle of Gibeon is fought. Those of the great multitude seek the Greater Joshua and then obtain peace, and must continue to seek righteousness and meekness, and do this before the battle of the great day of God Almighty begins.

The people have been advised that all those under “Christendom” who would break away from Satan and put themselves on the side of Jehovah and his Vindicator may live. Jehovah’s witnesses have continued to make this statement in the presence and hearing of the worldly ones from then till now.

The judgment is written against them, and God will not reverse it. He will not send prosperity to them. Jehovah does not grant resurrection and life to those who are assigned by his judgment to perdition. “And men [7?.V.] shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.” These “men”, who are on God’s side, thus speak, and speak at his direction against those unfaithful, and this shows the obligation upon the faithful to thus speak the truth.

The time comes, following the beginning of the temple judgment, when the Lord makes known these truths to his faithful ones that they may see and appreciate the justice and loving-kindness of our God. Jehovah hates the wicked, pictured by Esau, and loves those pictured by Jacob, that is, the faithful who love and serve him unselfishly. Seeing and appreciating the judgment and love of Jehovah, the faithful magnify his name from the place occupied by them, that is, the place in God’s organization, and beyond it, by continuously giving praise to and testifying to the name of Jehovah and his kingdom; and they do this amid great opposition.

They speak to each other of the Lord’s judgments and tell others who have the hearing ear of the Lord’s judgments. The ambassador is not sent to the Devil’s army, but sent to the members of God’s organization on earth, who are found scattered among the nations but who are no part of the nations of this world. Jehovah is calling or summoning his own people. It is Christ Jesus and his army that do the treading of Edom.

Not that God is a respecter of persons, but that the princes of Israel foreshadowed the spiritual Israelites who shall be for ever with Christ Jesus, the great Prince, and with him be priests in the royal house and members of the temple, whereas the great multitude shall serve the princes.

Likewise it must be with the remnant of this day, that they see that it is the Lord’s time to carry the message forward. They go, and do not stop to listen to the platitudes and high-sounding speech of some self-important man who thinks he has some “understanding”, but in fact has none.

Jesus’ words above mean this: When the people of good will toward God have a mental vision of the coming destruction of the present-day hypocritical Jerusalem, then it is their duty to flee to God’s organization, because it is then certain that the destruction of “Christendom” is nigh at hand. For one to now be negligent and stubborn, and to hold out for a deathbed repentance or a more favorable season to flee to God’s organization, means to that one destruction, even as the Lord foretold.—Deut. 20: 16, 17.

(Lev. 16: 17) Not all the Levites could be called to the priesthood, because in the distribution of tabernacle service that service did not require such a great number of priests. That does not at all mean that the nonpricstly class was less faithful than those of the priesthood.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal.—2 Sam. 21:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">King Saul was selfishly stubborn and rebellious. He knew that the Israelites under Joshua had sworn that the Gibeonites should not die, and yet Saul slew them. He intentionally violated that covenant, and for that reason afterwards God brought a famine upon the land for three years and said that this famine was because Saul slew the Gibeonites, showing that God fully approved the covenant made with that people by Joshua, and disapproved Saul’s action. The Scriptural record as to the avenging of the Gibeonites upon Saul’s house shows that God settles the account with the “wicked servant’’ class, because their course of action is against the Jonadab or “great multitude” class, who seek life. The work today in their behalf is very important, precious in God’s sight. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">A specific class of persons, and not just one person, hear the “rumour” or “tidings”. It is God’s servant class, to whom the kingdom interests on earth are committed, that hear these judgment tidings from the Lord. They being devoted to him, their ears are attuned to the good news that proceeds from the Lord. Others do not have their ears so attuned, and because they are on the enemy’s side they do not hear, and therefore know nothing, about the judgment of the Lord. “An ambassador is sent among the nations.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.}</span><span class="font4"> Whose ambassador? It is the messenger or ambassador of the Lord, for the reason that the Devil would not stir up his own nations against “Edom”, whom the Devil has employed so well against God’s people. The ambassador is a heavenly angel, who assembles God’s army against the enemy. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/3G</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Have boldness in the day of judgment.—1 John 4:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This does not mean that the Lord’s servant should be rude at any time or attempt to provoke others to anger or wrath. God’s servant must be bold in declaring the truth. To be bold means to tell the truth without fear of men; to tell it calmly, plainly, firmly, and not to shun to declare it when required to do so. Boldness in telling the truth is what God’s people are commanded to have at this time. That means to be frank, outspoken, and to show complete confidence in the Lord, whom we serve. Some conceive the idea that they must use harsh speech in defiance of the officers of the world. Such a course is entirely wrong. Boldness and frankness mean never to hesitate to tell the truth when opportunity arises and to watch for opportunities to tell it. Such boldness and frankness evidences that they have the Lord’s backing, and this always puts the evil one to flight. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The “live goat” class originally had been presented before Jehovah that it might have opportunity to participate in the great atonement day sacrifice. It had been brought under the atoning sacrifice of Christ Jesus and justified by Jehovah God that such might have part in the sin offering. Before disposition was made of this goat the bullock of the sin offering was slain and its blood sprinkled upon the mercy seat before the Lord, thus showing atonement made by the great antitypical bullock (Jesus). The “live goat” was presented before the Lord for determination of its case thereafter, thus showing that atoning power of the bullock’s blood had been made available </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font4"> this goat class, but now this “live goat” class shows it had received this grace of God in vain.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.—Obad. 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is but one right side. “The other side” is anti-kingdom-of-God. In carrying on the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses by publie officials the clergy urged it be done, and stood with those more actively engaged as spoilers. Concerning the clergymen the Lord says: “Even thou wast as one of them.” The clergy hypocritically posed as the Lord’s representatives and as spiritual advisers of the “strangers” or “foreigners”, who actually imprisoned Jehovah’s faithful servants. They conspired, connived at and urged the committing of all the cruel atrocities against those who serve God and his kingdom. Now the Lord tells his witnesses to make known his purpose to mete out to his enemies a just recompense. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Gibeonites sincerely desired to be understood and treated as having fully forsaken the other Canaanites, though it led them to be slaves of the Israelites. Likewise now, those who will be spared must forsake Satan’s organization and become voluntary slaves of the Lord Jesus Christ and serve his anointed. At Armageddon only those who have previously declared themselves free and separate from Satan’s organization, and who have taken their stand with God’s organization and have faithfully held to that position, will be spared from the Executioner’s sword. The Gibeonites were bound by their covenant. Those of the great multitude are bound by covenant to become servants of Jehovah and his anointed King.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.—Prov. 7:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The law of God is his rule of action or conduct prescribed for all men. The commandment of the Lord is a positive and emphatic expression of his will or law concerning one that is in a covenant with God, the commandment directing the creature in the right way to go, and what he must do. Every commandment of the Lord is a part of his law. Commandments not only prescribe the correct course of man or conduct, but make it imperative that those to whom the commandments are addressed follow such course of conduct. With God’s covenant people each one must look well to his own course of action, that it is in harmony with the will of God. The covenant people of Jehovah God can be loyal to him only by strictly walking according to the divinely fixed rules. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Heretofore the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has been able to put to silence all who have spoken against it; and if, even for a short season, God permits these opposers to stop the proclamation of the truth of the kingdom the vexation of the Hierarchy would cease and that crowd would cry out, “Peace and safety.” As the clergy among the Jews said of Jesus, so now the clergy say of Jehovah’s witnesses: “We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar ’ ’ in refusing to obey men’s laws which say they cannot preach without a permit obtained from police officers. (Luke 23: 2, 5) The clergy said practically the same of Paul and his companions: “These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city.” “These all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar.”—Acts 16: 20, 21; 17: 6, 7.

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah has not commanded his witnesses to gather the great multitude now or at any other time. That work the Lord himself does in his own good time and way. The business and work of the anointed is to obey God’s commandments. He has commanded that this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached and completed before the slaying work begins. The Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, sends forth his followers from the temple and commands them to proclaim boldly from the housetops the kingdom message and the day of God’s vengeance. To refrain from so doing or to slack the hand and become negligent, or to attempt to exercise influence over the anointed to cause them to become negligent and slack the hand, constitutes a failure to give heed to the commandments of Jehovah’s great Prophet.—Acts 3: 23.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I will be a swift witness . . . against those that oppress . . . the widow, and the fatherless.—Mal. 3: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many persons now on earth are of good will toward God, the Giver of life, but, not having heard the truth, and not having had opportunity to embrace it and take their stand on Jehovah’s side, are truly “fatherless”. A widow is a woman (symbol of any organization) without a husband. Jehovah is the husband of his “woman”, or organization. There are organizations many persons among whom apparently desire to serve the Lord, but are held back by Satan’s representatives. Such organizations are “widows”, because, though claiming God as their husband, he rejected them. “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father, is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction.” Jehovah’s witnesses practice the “pure religion” by visiting such. Those who oppose the work of Jehovah’s witnesses oppress the widows and fatherless. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. And the Jews marvelled, saying, Hoiv knoweth this man letters?—John 7:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This corresponds with the present time. As Jehovah’s witnesses stand in the public places and speak the truth, the clergy say of them: ‘How do these fellows know anything, seeing they have never been to a theological school?’ Jesus there continued to speak boldly, and so now his faithful followers boldly speak the truth, regardless of opposition. At the feast of tabernacles Jesus showed the clear distinction between those religionists whom he told that they were on the Devil’s side and those of honest heart who took the side of Jesus. He said: “Ye are from beneath; I am from above; ye are of this world; I am not of this world.” (8: 23) The religionists not only rejected Jesus, but sought to kill him. But many of the common people believed on him. And so now.

<p><span class="font4">The judgment takes place when the Lord Jesus appears at the temple for judgment. All the consecrated and spirit-begotten ones pictured by the two goats in the court go on together until the time of judgment and separation. The separation is not arbitrary, nor does Christ Jesus judge arbitrarily, but according to God’s law which directs him. (John 5: 30) The consecrated ones pictured by the two goats are not predestinated or fated by Jehovah without regard to the wishes or conduct on their part. The course of action of each individual determines the class into which he will be put, and the heart condition is the real determining factor. The class sincere and wholly devoted to the Lord, and hence in the right heart condition, become the Lord’s goat. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">King David, acting under Jehovah’s guidance, offered to make full amends to the Gibeonites because the covenant with them had been broken by Saul. The Gibeonites manifestly w<sup>T</sup>ere guided by Jehovah and called for retributive justice to be visited upon Saul’s house. This strongly emphasizes the blood responsibility under which Jehovah holds his watchman, the remnant now on earth, and proves that the work today in behalf of the great multitude is very important and is precious in the sight of God. If the remnant should slack the hand now, the responsibility for such neglect would fall upon them. All who do so neglect, fail or refuse to thus obey the Lord, put themselves in the same class in which Saul put himself by going contrary to God’s commandment.

Jehovah permits them to see his purpose in destroying the clergy and all of Satan’s organization, but it is not so important for the remnant to know just the order in which this will be done or the day when the destruction will take place. The remnant must be wholly obedient to the Lord, and, being obedient, they will not try to run ahead of the Lord and state how he is going to do it, a thing he has not revealed. The remnant must declare the message that Jehovah and Christ Jesus have placed in their mouth to declare, and not be only contented with so doing, but rejoice in that privilege. They must bear the kingdom fruits before the people, to awaken those of good will. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">8/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">What Jesus, when on earth, did at the feast of tabernacles finds a similarity in things that have come to pass since his appearance at the temple. As the Officer of his Father, Jesus, at the last of the feast of tabernacles, cried out to the people. Since coming to the temple he, as Jehovah’s Officer, cries out and calls upon all the nations to be silent and give ear to what he says: “The Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before him.” (Hab. 2: 20) At the feast of tabernacles Jesus told the religionists that they were of the Devil. In these last days the remnant, as his faithful witnesses and acting under his command, give warning to the religionists, calling attention to the fact that they are defaming the name of Jehovah and are the chief instruments of the Devil on earth. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/36</span></p>

The Lord Jesus Christ and his heavenly host will do the slaughter work. The remnant have a work to do now before the destructive work of Armageddon begins, which work they must complete before that destructive work does begin. From the time Jehovah put his name upon his anointed ones, giving to them the “new name”, he commissioned and sent them forth to perform their part by declaring the day of his vengeance. Jehovah exhibits his anointed witnesses before the enemy and thus shows his favor to his witnesses. Because he puts his favor upon them the fire of the enemy is drawn against Jehovah’s witnesses and the battle goes on. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">One must become willingly submissive to the Lord before he is teachable. In that manner he seeks meekness, that is, he seeks to learn. The Gibeonites had come to Joshua, God’s representative, of their own volition, declaring their purpose and desire to do as they were told to do in order that they might receive benefit at the hand of the Lord’s servant Joshua. It is just the same today with the Jonadabs, the great multitude company. They come not demanding something because of right, but they come in meekness, seeking to know the right way. They inquire of the Lord at the hands of those whom they believe to represent God. They are inquiring of God’s servants as to what they shall do, and it is the duty and privilege of the remnant to inform them what is the will of God concerning them.

All these now must offer a pleasant offering unto the Lord, because that offering must be entirely free from all creature-worship, which worship is of “the sin of Samaria”. Such offering also must be free from all Baal worship in any form whatsoever. It must be a service devoted exclusively to vindication of Jehovah’s name. It must now be pleasing to the Lord “as in the days of old”, when King David ruled in Jerusalem.

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses are his covenant people. The purpose of the new covenant is to take out a people for God’s name and to use them to his honor and praise. No creature is forced into such covenant. God takes out no one from the world and brings no one into the covenant until that person, trusting in the shed blood of Christ Jesus, voluntarily agrees to do God’s will. The creature is therefore solemnly bound by his agreement to render full obedience to the Lord. Those who willingly break that covenant by following a selfish course, contrary to God’s will, are covenantbreakers and are declared as worthy of death. The highest relationship a creature on earth could possibly enjoy with Jehovah and his kingdom is to be in covenant with him as a witness to his name. To break that relationship by neglect or willful commission of deeds can merit but one thing, destruction. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/36</span></p>

They would take no chances, but make themselves known and declare where they stood before that battle. Likewise the great multitude cannot now wait until the final battle of Armageddon, foreshadowed by that at .Gibeon, to make themselves known and take their clear and unequivocal stand. Had the Gibeonites waited until the battle came, no consideration would have been shown them by the Lord. If the great multitude wait until Armageddon to make their identity known, no consideration will be given to them. The Gibeonites’ statement that they came from a very far country simply represents that the great multitude are not of this world but look for a kingdom.

Can there be any doubt in the mind of the truly anointed temple class that the battle is now on between religionists and Jehovah’s faithful servants?

(Acts 4: 12) For such to attribute salvation to any man-made thing, rule or image, such as that which is represented by a flag of a nation or the man or men that control the nation, is a direct violation of God’s commandment and means that one so doing is taking God’s name in vain, and if he persists in such a course he must suffer destruction.

Let all the faithful bear in mind that he who is for us is greater than all that can be against us. The Lord has sent forth his servants to deliver his message.

At 1 Chronicles 9: 2 “Nethinims” are mentioned for the first time as associates with Israelites, priests and Levites. The Gibeonites are the original Nethinim, who are later mentioned in Scripture as engaged in menial service about the temple. Doubtless in time people of other non-Israelite nations were made bondmen by the Israelites and some would be devoted by the Israelites to service like that to which the Gibeonites were assigned. Therefore “Nethinim” would be applied to any such helpers that came from the many “nations, kindreds, peoples”, just as the great multitude is described as being.

His judgments rendered and executed there are swift against those who claim to be for the Lord and who are not; “against the sorcerers,” those who practice magic or witchcraft. “Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft. ’ ’ Those who sell themselves to the Devil would cast a spell over God’s faithful people, if possible. Such sorcerers are those who defy the Word of the great Prophet, Christ Jesus, and the true witnesses that speak his Word. Included are the ones who attempt to hinder the progress of the Lord’s witness work, by attracting attention of the workers to themselves, and thus interfering with the united and forward movement of God’s people in service.

<p><span class="font4">Is the Lord Jesus at the temple of Jehovah? All the evidence shows that he is. That being so, then Christ Jesus is conducting judgment and “before him [are] gathered all nations”, and he is separating them. He is determining who are the sheep, or great multitude. Christ is gathering them, and not we. If the gathering takes place after Armageddon, then when could it be possible for those people of good will to show favor to Christ and his persecuted remnant as the members of his body as stated at Matthew 25? At Armageddon the persecution will be done, because the persecutors will be slain. Those of the great multitude must be firm and bold in doing their work by informing others and thus giving them the opportunity to seek righteousness and meekness before Armageddon, because such is God’s plain word.

<p><span class="font4">This does not signify that the live goat was to stand for or take the place of the priest and his house in doing atonement work. Aaron’s both hands upon the head of the goat shows that the full power of Christ Jesus, the great High Priest, is directed toward the scapegoat class to reveal and expose the same, and shows the reason why this unfaithful class should be sent out of God’s organization. The head represents the place where responsibility rests, so that the “live goat” could not plead ignorance and use that as an excuse. The priest’s confessing over the goat shows that he makes public proclamation or declaration, and not that he makes allowance for or condones rebellion and disobedience and the compromising of that class with Satan’s organization. It means the true situation of this class must be made known. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/36</span></p>

Correspondingly early in the year 1919, while the representatives of the Lord’s organization were in prison, many thousands of persons of good will toward God and his people gladly signed a petition to the government that the Society’s servants might be given a hearing and released from prison. These also picture the prisoners in Satan’s organization other than the anointed coming forth and showing themselves and manifesting their sympathy on the side of those who served Jehovah God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/36</span></p>

The work of these must be exactly in harmony with the spirit of God and the Lord Jesus Christ. Jehovah is now working to the end of vindicating his name, and he permits these faithful ones to work with him according to his will and good pleasure. He does not need them, but grants this privilege to them. It is his expressed will that his name shall be vindicated.

<p><a name="bookmark207"></a><span class="font4">God’s “woman” is Zion. She gives birth to the sons of God and stands for Jehovah’s organization. Satan’s “woman” is Babylon and gives birth to the Serpent’s seed, that serves him. For one of God’s sons to have mutual relationship with the Devil’s woman (his organization) is spiritual adultery. One thus guilty is induced by selfishness, that his own selfish desires may be gratified. (Jas. 4: 3, 4) A person moved by a selfish desire to have some favor from that organization comes within the Scriptural definition of “adulterer”. Jehovah’s faithful witnesses must be entirely separate from Satan’s organization and must “touch not the unclean thing”. (2 Cor. 6:14-17) Every one that remains in God’s organization must be completely devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom, and his course of action must be so clear and straightforward for Him that there can be no doubt where he stands.

<p><span class="font4">The interests of all the tribe of Levi, including priest, underpriests, and nonpriests, were all common. All did service unto the Lord according to his commandments. Their division into groups according to the grade of service evidently was not meant to typify two separate and distinct classes of spirit-begotten ones, one faithful and the other less faithful; but to typify one service organization of God’s favored ones or firstborn ones at the temple doing service to which each one was assigned. It is exactly so today in the antitype. Not every one of Jehovah’s witnesses can serve at the same place. Whether in one place or the other, all are serving God and his kingdom and all are represented in the High Priest, Christ Jesus, who is their Head and Commander.

<p><span class="font4">The word “father” (Ex. 20: 12) means Jehovah, who gives life to all who receive life. The “mother” means God’s “woman”, God’s organization, that gives birth to God’s children. The major application of the text is to spiritual Israel, who have exercised faith in God and Christ Jesus and have entered into a covenant to do God’s will, and whom God has acknowledged as his sons. One who remains true and faithful to God will honor his Father’s name. The spirit-begotten sons of God are duty-bound to honor God by gladly obeying his and his Son’s commandments. Anyone who takes a contrary course dishonors Jehovah’s name. To dishonor God brings one into peril. The lawless refuse to obey God’s commandments and to follow his organization instructions. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/36</span></p>

Let the anointed now hear and give heed to Jehovah’s words: “Arise ... against her [Satan’s organization, the Edomites] in battle.” The battle is on now, and is growing in severity each day. Amid this great persecution by the enemy the work of proclaiming the kingdom message must go on to the end that the ‘hidden lies’ of the enemy may be uncovered and fully exposed to view in order that those who love what is right may flee to the city of refuge which is God’s organization, and remain steadfastly there until the wrath of God is past, W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s anointed witnesses practice the pure religion. This they do by making it their regular and formal business to work and go about in the land visiting the “widows” (those organizations that desire to know of God and his kingdom) and “the fatherless” (those who sigh and cry concerning the abominable things they see among men and who hunger and thirst for righteousness). It is the business of these faithful ones to visit and comfort such by exhibiting to them the truth. It is the “widow” and “fatherless” to whom the message must be carried, and who will shortly form the great multitude. The opposers are the ones who do not ‘keep themselves unspotted from the world’ but mix with Satan’s organization and by compromise or other means seek favor of it.

<p><span class="font4">Those who compose the great multitude cannot stand idle today and watch for the fall of Satan’s organization before obeying the Lord. They must know of Jehovah and his kingdom, must declare themselves on the side of Jehovah and his King, and must learn righteousness and meekness as a condition precedent to being shielded at Armageddon. They must be able to withstand the test which of necessity must come upon each one who receives God’s favor. If those of the great multitude would escape the sword of Jehovah’s Executioner, the Greater Joshua, they must act quickly and not wait until Armageddon is begun before they declare themselves. They must now offer themselves as servants of Jehovah and Christ, the Greater Joshua, before Armageddon begins. IV </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/36</span></p>

Such false ones take God’s name in vain. Such are “disobedient to parents [Jehovah’s commandments and the law of his organization]”, “covenant breakers,” against which God renders an adverse judgment. The Lord has hired his laborers to work in his vineyard. Now these have received the “penny”, the ‘new name, which the mouth of Jehovah has given them’. Opposers try to prevent the hired laborers from working in the vineyard, by trying to hold them back from using the “penny” in Jehovah’s service as his witnesses. Some hired ones complain because those hired later receive the same full wages. Those truly devoted to God rejoice to see the laborers working together. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/36 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou earnest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the</span></p>

His forces are led by his Chief Officer, Christ Jesus, his mighty Son, and the Lord’s armies know no defeat. The Israelites foreshadowed the spiritual Israelites of this day, that is, the remnant of God’s people. Long ago Jehovah of hosts caused his judgments to be written and recorded. Now he gives his people to understand the meaning thereof that they may have full assurance that he who knows no defeat shall fight their battles for them.

Therefore the Lord says to his covenant people: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.” (Prov. 3: 5, 6) The follower of Christ Jesus must measure his course of action or conduct by the law of God, and that alone. “The law of thy mother” is the proper course of conduct to be pursued by those of God’s organization. Great is the favor to man to be brought into and form a part of the Lord’s organization. No person will long be permitted to remain in that organization, however, who willingly violates organization instructions. To violate such means to “forsake . . . the law of thy mother”.

By causing his truth now to be declared, and by exposing the blasphemy of the religionists, the clergy, the Lord makes these men “greatly despised’’.

<p><span class="font4">For a time at least, the religionists, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allied “Protestant” and Jewish clergy “yes men”, will have co-operation of political and commercial bosses and the strong-arm squad in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses. Without such co-operation they could not well hollo, “Peace and safety.” The sudden destruction upon them begins at a time when the secular elements suddenly turn against the hypocritical religionists by bursting out in expressed hatred against the old “whore” and destroy that organization; because it is written: “God hath put [it] in their hearts to fulfil his will.” (Rev. 17: 16, 17) It is the act of Jehovah, the beginning of the final expression of his wrath against the enemy organization.

Later King Saul willfully and knowingly violated that covenant, and for that reason afterwards God brought a famine upon the land. As the princes of Israel disregarded the murmurers and objectors, so now the true and faithful followers of Christ will disregard all murmurers, objectors and interferers with carrying the message to the great multitude, but, on the contrary, will be diligent to carry out the Lord’s commandments at the present time.

<p><span class="font4">All those devoted to God and his kingdom, and all seeking the way to Zion, are strangers in Satan’s world and to his agents that govern the things of the earth. Such include the “other sheep’’ or Jonadabs, the great multitude. The Jonadabs “dwell in tents’’, symbolically saying that they are sojourners in this wicked world, looking for the kingdom. All those who seek the honor of God and Christ are strangers in this world. At the instigation of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy the political rulers try to crowd these strangers off the earth because they give testimony to Jehovah’s name and righteous organization. There are those today who claim to be in the truth and who put stumblingblocks in the way of Jehovah’s witnesses, and the Jonadabs, by telling them it is not now time for gathering the great multitude, but to wait. Such speech or course is injustice to the “stranger”.

<p><span class="font4">Jesus’ words show that his judgment would remove all those prompted by selfishness and that only those who are unselfish, that is, who love God and his kingdom, would remain. ‘Not every one who says, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven; but only those who are obedient to my Father in heaven.’ (Matt. 7: 21) Full obedience is required, and such obedience must be willingly and joyfully rendered. At the Lord’s coming to the temple all the consecrated had received the same gift or amount of truth. Some had received it into a selfish mind and heart and were assigned to the “evil servant” class. The faithful class, approved by the Lord, taken into the temple and anointed, received at his hands all “his goods”. Of such “faithful servant” elass to whom his goods were entrusted he demands a full and complete accounting. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/86</span></p>

No effort was made to do so until the people of good will filed an urgent petition with the public officials. These pictured the Jonadabs or “other sheep” class that showed sympathy for and interest in God’s faithful servants, whom the Lord released from prison in 1919. This releasing refers to all of those who were faithful, some who were actually in prison, and others under restraint. From the time of their release until now Jehovah’s witnesses have been under surveillance by the ruling factors, and particularly at the instance of the clergy, who increasingly try to limit the freedom of activity of his faithful servants.

The Edomites, or descendants of Esau, perched themselves high up on the cliffs of the rocks and became cliff dwellers.

Gibeon was a very large community; its people were multitudinous: a splendid picture of the great multitude, which no man can number or know.

Therefore the Lord says to the remnant, who now go out to face the confederated enemy: “Fear them not.” Jehovah has commissioned his witnesses and sent them forth to bear the kingdom fruits before the people. The witnesses go as commanded because they love God, and for this reason they do not fear the enemy.

<p><span class="font4">The waving of palm branches must be done with rejoicing before the Lord, the manifest purpose of which was a recognition by the people that Jehovah God was and is their Deliverer from Satan’s ppwer, and their Savior. The entire performance was looking to the vindication of Jehovah’s name, rejoicing in him as the supreme and holy One. That the people thus recognize Jehovah as their Savior and Deliverer he said that they must keep this feast, “that your generations may know that ... I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.” (Vs. 43) The palms must be used in connection with the feast of tabernacles, and in the use thereof others aside from today’s remnant are pictured.

That purpose shall be accomplished; as he said: “I have purposed it, I will also do it.” “Known unto God are all his works, from the beginning of the world.” (Isa. 46: 11; Acts 15: 18) His expressed purpose includes taking out of the world a people for his name, to wit, Christ Jesus and the 144,000 members of His royal house; and the gathering unto himself of a company of “other sheep”, the Jonadab or “great multitude” class. This he will do in his own good way and at his time, and according to his own will. He has expressed his purpose to rid earth and heaven of all things that interfere or try to interfere with his work. He requires full and complete faithfulness to him of all who shall receive his favor. He will destroy the wicked and preserve the righteous. His purpose is to reserve a remnant for himself in vindication of his name. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11/15/36</span></p>

Likewise the great multitude, to live, must be servants at the house of Christ Jesus, the Head of God’s temple. The Gibeonites must put away all idols, images and anything and everything else showing their allegiance to the Devil’s organization, and particularly so since thereafter Gibcon was made a priests’ city unto the Lord. Likewise the great multitude must put away all idols, images and formalisms and all evidence of being connected with any part of the Devil’s organization, and thereafter salute and serve Jehovah and Christ Jesus, from whom their salvation comes. That means that they will see that saluting any image, flag, thing or creature is a violation of God’s law. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Antitypically this marks the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ straightway to the temple for judgment, and a part of his work there is the cleaning out or cleansing of the sanctuary and separating the faithful remnant from the “evil servant’’, the “man of sin” class. The bringing of the live goat and sending him forth for Azazel pictures the “evil servant” class, the chief of that class which is the “man of sin”. This class is made up of spirit-begotten ones who were once in line for the kingdom. The scapegoat at this point pictures all those who during the great atonement day antitypically have been justified and spirit-begotten and who have proved unfaithful, the disposing of which class takes place when the Lord Jesus is at the temple conducting judgment.

Some are made a gazingstoek both by reproaches and afflictions, and others suffer by reason of being companions of God’s anointed ones who suffer indignities. (Heb. 10: 32, 33) In the eyes of men some occupy less honorable positions than others, but in the sight of God there is no distinction, because God is no respecter of persons. (Eph. 6:9) Faithful and complete devotion to him is what is pleasing and acceptable to Jehovah. There is not one scripture that even indicates that God approves and rewards an unfaithful class. There is no reason to conclude that God has a secondary spiritual class whom he rewards to some degree, because less faithful, and because they have gotten mixed up with the world and try to please both the world and God.

Continuing to follow in that course he is certain to fall. “Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.’’ (Prov. 16: 18) Pride quickly leads one to commit presumptuous sins, which are a shame before God and all who love righteousness. The Edomites perched high up in the rocks, regarded themselves as of supreme importance, and looked with contempt upon others. Likewise the clergy of the Hierarchy and their allies have perched themselves high up among men, deported themselves in a proud manner, and regarded themselves as far superior to the common herd.

The record (Joshua 10: 1-5) of what took place when the conspirators had heard of the action of the Gibconites shows exactly what comes to pass upon modern-day Gibeonites, or the “great multitude”, who have forsaken Satan’s organization and placed themselves under the command of Christ Jesus, the Head of Jehovah’s organization. Those who faithfully proclaim the kingdom message, whether they be of the remnant or of the great multitude, are now hated by all those of Satan’s organization.

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah caused illustrations to be made as to the manner of executing his wrath or vengeance upon the enemy. Mount Seir appears to picture the religious, and Moab and Ammon the political and commercial elements. These three enemies of Israel joined in an assault upon God’s chosen people, and when the attack began the Lord set an ambush against them. Then they destroyed each other in this wise: “The children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.” (Vss. 19-23) This is supported by other scriptures, that the Lord will first destroy the religious hypocritical element and then will follow the destruction of all other enemies in the latter part of the battle of the great day of God Almighty.

To have the approval of the great Judge and to offer before him an offering in righteousness, one must get rid of all selfishness, particularly the ambitious desire to have the approval of men. One who loves to hear it said of him that he is very wise and learned is on the dangerous way. The great test now upon those who have covenanted to do God’s will is, ‘Who may abide?’ that is, who will remain steadfast and maintain his integrity toward God under the great test? Jehovah will have no one remain in his organization who is not unselfishly and wholly devoted to him and not wholeheartedly supporting his cause.

<p><span class="font4">When Jesus rode into Jerusalem to offer himself as King, the common people met him, waving palm branches and shouting to his honor and to Jehovah’s praise. At the first outpouring of the holy spirit at Pentecost the faithful disciples rejoiced, recognizing Christ Jesus as Jehovah’s King whom he had raised up and exalted to heaven. In 1922, at the second outpouring of the spirit, the faithful servant company recognized Christ Jesus at the temple and greatly rejoiced. Recognition of the King as having come is occasion for joy. Since 1922 others not of God’s remnant but who are of good will toward God have recognized Christ Jesus as King, the Savior and Deliverer, and they have rejoiced.

<p><span class="font4">This corresponds to the release of God’s people then in prison. Ebed-melech the Ethiopian made arrangements to take Jeremiah out of the dungeon and to do so in the most comfortable manner that they could, thus preventing the least possible injury to him. This shows that antitypically the faithful followers of Christ Jesus were imprisoned and were visited by persons of good will, who were commended by the Lord Jesus in these words: “I was in prison, and ye came unto me.” (Matt. 25: 36) The Ethiopian showed much kindness to Jeremiah in putting old clouts under his arms to lift him out of the prison.

<p><span class="font4">Both goats were taken from among the children of Israel, but the live goat had not faithfully served the Lord. Likewise both antitypical goats were taken from the people who turned to the Lord and are consecrated to him, but the “wicked servant” proves unfaithful and receives God’s grace in vain and has not faithfully served God’s interests among the antitypical Israelites but has caused many of them to sin. They are workers of iniquity. Such iniquities consist of alliance with Satan’s organization, becoming ‘spotted with the world ’, and thus conniving at and consorting with Satan’s organization to do violence to and to oppose God’s organization.

The cities of refuge typified God’s faithful organization on earth as a whole and as a part of the royal house to which the man who slew unawares might flee. The antitypical cities of refuge apply at the end of the world and after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple and the beginning of the proclamation of the kingdom message. The organization of Jehovah could not be made up of two divisions, one faithful and one only partially faithful. The Levites pictured those faithful to God, and forming his organization, in which some occupy one position and some another position, as God has been pleased to place them in those positions, Christ Jesus being High Priest.

<p><span class="font4">The clergy, the antitypical Edomites, boast of their superiority and the strength of their organization. They make the worldly governments their “rock” and clamber up into high political places. An exactly contrary course is taken by the men who love God, as it is written: “The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.” “From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed; lead me to the rock that is higher than I.” (Pss. 18: 2; 61: 2) The faithful followers of Christ Jesus trust in Jehovah, the Great Rock, and in his beloved Son, the Foundation Stone of his organization.

Likewise those of the great multitude, particularly since the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple in 1918, have heard of the kingdom’s being given to Christ Jesus and what terrible destruction shall come upon Satan’s organization at Armageddon, and for them to have shown a fear of God would cause them to respect his name and to seek his favor and to show favor toward his faithful witnesses in the earth. This is the reason why these Jonadabs or great multitude have shown kindness to Jehovah’s witnesses, who are arrested, persecuted, thrown into prison, and otherwise ill-treated.

Having once become a servant of God, it is even more important that the person who is the servant obey. To such this rule is given: “To obey is better than sacrifice.” Going contrary to God’s will is rebellion. Negligence or refusing to obey instructions from the Lord is stubbornness and therefore lawlessness and a form of idolatry. (1 Sam. 15: 22, 23) If one is brought to the temple of God and becomes a part of it and then fails or refuses to be willingly obedient to God’s law and organization, such will be put out of the temple and therefore out of the kingdom.

To “get understanding’’ means to know and to appreciate properly the relationship of the creature to the Creator. That means that we must know and appreciate that there is but one Almighty God, whose name alone is Jehovah, who is supreme, the Most High above all, and from whom comes every good and perfect gift; that Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s beloved Son, is next to the Father and is the “right hand” or chief officer of Jehovah, and that those who are in Christ and therefore of the temple company are the servants of God and Christ, and that the servant must do the will of his Master and do it joyfully. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The “sons of Jacob” that are not consumed are those of the remnant, as this scripture applies at the end of the world, where we now are. Why not consumed? They have been tested by the fire of the great Refiner and have come through the fire because of their faith and faithfulness, and the maintaining of their integrity toward Jehovah. They builded upon the correct foundation, Christ Jesus, “and him crucified,” and when the “fire” burned away the “wood, hay, stubble”, these rejoiced that they are on the Lord’s side and continue to stand firmly on the everlasting foundation. They have maintained their integrity toward God, and now they must always maintain it toward him. The Lord expresses his purpose to consume the wicked and preserve the righteous: “For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed [on the unfaithful] shall overflow.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/36 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel.

And so they object to any work now being done in this behalf and refuse to have any part therein. The prophetic picture made with Joshua and his army shows the absolute necessity now to ignore the murmurers and take prompt action in carrying the message to those people of good will, that they may know and exereise faith in God and Christ Jesus and may have the opportunity to voluntarily declare themselves as servants of God.

Sometime after the second outpouring of the holy spirit in 1922, and not until the year 1935, was the true meaning of the great multitude discerned by the remnant on earth. “After this, I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, . . . stood before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.” (Rev. 7: 9) This shows the remnant beholding persons other than themselves recognizing the only name whereby men can be saved.

We are thoroughly fortified in our position. Hell shall not prevail against us. ’ But because they are high and lifted up among cruel and selfish men, does that make them safe? The modern-day Edomites, the clergy, cannot perch themselves so high that God cannot reach them when he chooses to do so.

The obligation is upon every one of the organization to be strictly attentive to and joyfully obedient to the instructions that the Lord sends forth from Zion. Christ Jesus, the head of that organization, is Jehovah’s great Prophet. All in the covenant with God must give heed to and fully obey that great Prophet. He who fails or refuses to obey suffers destruction. (Acts 3: 23) In that organization God has placed every man as it pleaseth him. No man can take that honor to himself.

<p><span class="font4">The sins the priest confessed over the live goat must be sins other than those wiped out by the atoning blood offered on the mercy seat, because the sins thus atoned for, the Lord does not again bring to mind. The sins and iniquities are put on the head of the live-goat class because it failed to warn the people as commanded. They fail to protest against the wrongful acts of Satan’s representatives against Jehovah’s witnesses. Jesus states the same rule in these words: “Therefore he that delivered me [Jehovah’s true witness] unto thee [the enemy] [for execution] hath the greater sin.” (John 19: 11) They are identified as the chief sinners on earth.

<p><span class="font4">The Lord Jehovah has certain interests on the earth, particularly since 1914, when he sent forth his King to rule, and since 1918, when he began to separate the true from the false and committed all these earthly interests of the kingdom to the faithful and designated such as the “faithful and wise servant” class. All in the covenant with God are obligated to contribute something toward the advancement and growth of the kingdom, because all they have belongs to the Lord, and these kingdom interests on earth must have attention in the name of the Lord. Their obligation is to carefully safeguard these kingdom interests and to look well to performing their own duties toward such interests. To be pleasing to the Lord they must be wholly dependable. They will render to God and his King what is symbolized by tithes. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/36</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall even bear</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">their iniquity.—Ezek. 44:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those consecrated and devoted to the Lord’s service were mixed up at one time with “Christendom” and indulged in such formalism as showed that they had gone astray from the Lord. They are designated as having garments soiled, that is, they were identified with others practicing forms of worship, and to some degree at least were mixing with the world. They got away from the true worship of Jehovah. After they bore their iniquity, a remnant returned to the Lord. Being cleansed by him at the temple judgment, and their iniquity (their lawlessness) removed, they were fit for service. Those, being cleansed and becoming a remnant of all the antitypical Levites, some priests and some nonpriests, were all assigned to certain parts of service in the Lord’s organization.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.—2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This does not mean to study carefully what may be advanced by other men, who to others might appear to be holy and sanctimonious. It means to study and to learn what is God’s will concerning his servant and then to work without embarrassment or shame because of that work, and to properly and rightly apply the truth. It is therefore necessary to constantly and consistently study God’s Word of truth and in so doing to use the helps which the Lord has provided for gaining a knowledge of the truth. The servant who is instructed in the Word of God is equipped for the good work to which he has been assigned. Being so instructed he must obey; otherwise he could not receive the Lord’s approval, but would lose everything. He has no discretion; he must obey.

<p><span class="font4">Those who truly love God and his King, who worship him in spirit and in truth, well know that this is a time of war between the modern Edomites and the faithful followers of Christ. It is not a war with carnal weapons, because Jehovah’s witnesses never use such weapons of warfare. The true and faithful ones use the “sword of the spirit, which is the word of God”, and that weapon is mighty to the pulling down of the strongholds that are hid behind the mountain of lies. Today the Edomites, the clergy, are high and lifted up in their stronghold. They alone are unable to withstand the onslaughts of truth. Therefore they enlist the aid of the ruling powers to enact laws to catch proclaimers of God’s Word, charge them with some offense, and imprison them.

<p><span class="font4">Even so today, when the pope and others of the Hierarchy and allied clergy hear the shout of people from practically all over the earth declaring themselves for Jehovah and his kingdom and against the Devil and his religious crowd, they are frightened and hasten to put into action their conspiracy to prevent the multitudes from going to Jehovah and his King and to prevent the remnant from carrying on the work of advertising to the people the King and his kingdom. Having no way to fight openly, they urge their allies to take some secret action to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. Included in their wickedness is enacting laws leveled directly at Jehovah’s witnesses to prevent the further spread of the truth.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I loved Jacob, and 1 hated Esau.—Mal. 1:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah loved Jacob because he exhibited an abiding faith in Jehovah and therefore received God’s approval. Jaeob therefore foreshadows the company that love God and prove their love by faithful obedience to him. Likewise God hates the class which Esau foreshadowed. God showed his love to both Jaeob and Esau until Esau proved his unfaithfulness to God. “And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness. ’ ’ (Mal. 1: 3) The law of God is explicit and never changes: “The Lord preserveth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.’’ (Ps. 145: 20) When his purpose is accomplished, Jehovah will have a elean universe and every living creature shall be on his side singing his praises. (Ps. 150: 6) Men who start to follow in Jesus’ footsteps should keep God’s unchangeable law in mind. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have enough. But 1 have made Esau bare, . . . and he is not.—Jer. 49: 9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah compares the action of thieves and robbers with what shall eome to religionists, the hypocritical clergy: “If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou eut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers eame to thee, would they not leave some grapes?’’ (Obad. 5) Thieves hastily grab what they see and go away. Gatherers of grapes leave some for gleaners. When Jehovah has caused the refuge of lies to be uncovered and the duplicity and hypocrisy of the clergy to appear, he will leave nothing of that crowd, but will elean them out completely. In the war now in progress Jehovah’s witnesses obeying the Lord’s commandments will spare no one, as Saul spared Agag. They must not be respecters of persons. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.—Josh. 10: 3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following truly in the way of his father the Devil, Adoni-zedec, that fraudulent “righteous lord”, apparently directed his conspiracy against the Gibeon-ites but in truth and in fact it was against Jehovah God and his officer Joshua. Having gone over to Joshua, the Gibeonites in effect belonged to Joshua and his God, who had saved their lives. The purpose of Adoni-zedec apparently was to attack the Gibeonites, but his real purpose was to destroy Joshua’s army. The purpose of the modern-day fraudulent so-called “righteous lords” of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is to direct their attack against honest Catholics who seek the Lord, but their real purpose is to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses, who are working under the command of the Greater Joshua.

<p><span class="font4">Those to whom Christ Jesus entrusts his kingdom interests must not be murmurers or complainers nor be moved by any selfish desire. (Jude 1, 16-19) Those taken out of the world to be witnesses to Jehovah’s name are God’s people, who must joyfully obey him. Therefore it is written of them: “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.” (Ps. 110: 3) The kingdom has begun; the morning thereof is here. These faithful ones are from the womb, born early in the morning. They have the dew of youth, strong, vigorous, and delight to energetically perform the duties that are laid upon them. The kingdom interests the Lord entrusts to the anointed ones and demands of them prompt, efficient and faithful action. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/36</span></p>

(Rom. 15: 4) The elect remnant see this clearly and will refuse to be turned aside or caused to become negligent by any trick the Devil may put forth. They know that Jehovah and Christ Jesus are their Teachers, and that they are not being taught by the opinion of any man, and they refuse to follow a cunningly devised and uttered speech of any ambitious man. As every ox knows his master’s crib, so every one of Jehovah’s little ones knows that their spiritual food comes from their Father’s treasure house. They will study the prophecies and receive the unfolding thereof from the Lord with joy and satisfaction and will give all praise to the heavenly Father and Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font4">If one is obedient to the great commandment to love God, nothing will stand in his way of serving God and nothing will cause him to withdraw from the service of the Lord’s organization. Those in the covenant with God and who love him and who will receive his ultimate approval will permit nothing to stand between them and absolute and complete devotion, obedience and service to the Lord within his organization. The citizenship of these faithful ones is in heaven. (Phil. 3: 20, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font4"> The Lord Jesus is their King, and has taken his kingdom.

<p><span class="font4">“Jacob’s trouble” is an attempt of Satan and his agents to destroy God’s faithful people, and is pictured by Jacob in great distress; out of which trouble God delivers his faithful ones. Antitypically that trouble came upon God’s faithful ones in 1917 and 1918, and out of it they were delivered. The sudden trouble too that befalls hypocritical religionists shall be like “travail upon a woman” (1 Thess. 5: 3) and is different from Jacob’s trouble, in this, that there will be no way of escape or salvation for that hypocritical crowd. Then they will cry out: “Anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.” (Jer. 6: 24) That trouble hour comes upon them suddenly and unexpectedly, when they say: “Peace, peace; everything is safe.”—Jer. 6: 14. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The true foundation is Christ Jesus, and the builder must follow the rules that the Lord has laid down for such in order that his building may survive in the day of fiery tests. The building work manifestly is done prior to the Lord’s coming to the temple, for the reason that it is at the time of coming to the temple that he sits to judge and is “like a refiner’s fire” and sits “as a refiner and purifier”. The builders are those who have consecrated to do God’s will, and they build upon the true foundation ■ but in building some use “wood, hay, stubble”, which are symbolic of those things that are combustible and hence will not stand inspection and fiery judgments. Works of such kind, not being supported by God’s Word, will not stand the searchlight of truth and the fiery test when the Lord appears at the temple.

If the Gibeonites continued to hold out against their besiegers, it might mean death to them; but if they yielded to the enemy, the besiegers, that would mean certain death at the hands of Joshua’s army later. Compelled to make their choice, they chose to stand by their covenant under Joshua. Even so now, if the great multitude continue to resist the conspiracy formed and carried forward by the Hierarchy, it might mean death to them; but if they return to the enemy’s camp, that means certain death at the hand of Christ Jesus when he executes the enemy at Armageddon.

In this war doubtless some of Jehovah’s witnesses will die, but the cause of Jehovah is certain to come through completely victorious. The faithful will not fear what the enemy can do, but trust in the Lord and go straight forward. Jehovah has given his word that “the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies”, and God always makes good his word. It is this warfare that affords opportunity for the “goats” to brand themselves as such and for the “other sheep” of the Lord to identify themselves on the side of God’s organization.

No longer do they fear or dread the coming destruction of “Christendom”, but with confidence they look forward to Jehovah’s protection and salvation of them because they have done good unto the least of Christ’s brethren and thus shown their love for the Lord himself. (Matt. 25: 40) They are not given over to the Executioner of Jehovah’s vengeance nor into the hands of the enemy rulers. The Lord’s hand shields and protects them.

At the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple for judgment of the house of God the antitypical Levites, priests and nonpriests, had gone astray and all such must bear their iniquity. There is no indication that there are two spirit or distinctly separate classes in this judgment. “He shall purify the sons of Levi.” (Mal. 3:3) This must of necessity apply to all the antitypical Levites, including the priestly and nonpricstly class.

Esau (Edom) lived by the sword, and so the Lord Jesus says concerning Esau’s descendants, the Edomites, that they shall perish by the sword. (Matt. 26: 52) First, however, the Lord shows that the refuge of lies binding together the modern Edomites, and behind which they hide their nefarious work, must be swept away, exposing the wicked ones to complete view of the world.

<p><span class="font4">On those who have continued faithfully serving God and his King he has showered numerous blessings. There have come down from heaven great downpours of truth in that God has unfolded to his people his prophecies and given them such a marvelous supply that they sing with joy. He has given them many separate pieces of literature and books containing his message to carry to the people. He has given his blessing by causing his message to be proclaimed by radio, transcription machines, portable phonographs, sound cars, fully equipped, and has used these and increased the opportunity to witness before rulers as well as common people. ‘There is not room enough’ for the anointed to enjoy all these blessings and carry the message to everyone, even as they desire.

The Gibeonites’ appeal to Joshua corresponds to the people of good will who cry unto Christ Jesus, the Greater Joshua, to deliver them from the abominations of “Christendom” in order that the people of good will may be preserved unto God.

God made the Levites his ministers. Some of these he made priests. Others of the tribe of Levi performed a separate service, but all were God’s servants and all foreshadowed the spiritual sons of God, who are also his servants.

This they do by putting forth their best endeavors to publish the kingdom message. They bring the full measure of their tithes into the Lord’s storehouse, “that there may be meat in mine house,” not for Jehovah to eat, but for his active servants engaged in temple work. So now those who bring their full measure of service to the Lord do not profit the Lord in any way, but prove their devotion, maintain their integrity and share in vindicating his name. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">To scorn, hate or willfully violate organization instructions, the law of God’s organization, is a foolish course to take. One reaches the point where he must decide quickly whether he will heed the reproof received and turn to the right, or will take his own selfish course and disregard the reproof that comes to him. One course leads to death; the other, to life and the Lord’s blessing. It is rank fallacy for a man to build up an argument to justify his own conduct and to willingly disregard reproof that comes to him for violating organization instructions. It may please God to put a man in his organization whose duty is to give instructions and who has less natural ability than many others, but that is no excuse or justification for others to disregard instructions. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">God stopped the World War for the sake of his elect, the faithful servant class. Had the war continued without abating until the destruction of the world, would those on earth and then in line for the kingdom have been saved? No; for the reason, all such must first be judged by Christ Jesus at the temple, which judgment began after the coming of Christ to the temple in 1918. At the Lord’s coming to the temple even those in line for the kingdom were displeasing to the Lord and could not have been taken into God’s capital organization without first being judged, repenting and receiving forgiveness. As Isaiah, picturing those saints of God in line for the kingdom, said: “Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips [failing to bear witness to the kingdom].”—Isa. 6: 5. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/36</span></p>

They attempt in this day to compel all, including those wholly devoted to God, to bow to the dictates of Satan’s representatives. In 1914 Jehovah enthroned Christ Jesus as King, but the modern Edomites, the clergy, rejected Christ the King. The Lord’s witnesses went forth as he commanded and declared to all who would hear that Christ is King, and that the Lord is in his holy temple and commands all to heed his words. Yet the clergy rejected Jehovah’s King and openly declared themselves on the side of Satan’s organization. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">7/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah has but one way of giving life to the fallen race, and that is by and through Christ Jesus, and those who receive it must exercise faith in his shed blood as the redemptive price. God does not make peace with his enemies, and particularly with those who reproach his name. When the messenger of Jehovah appeared at the cradle of the child Jesus this message was delivered by Jehovah to mankind: “Glory in the highest unto God! And on earth peace, among men of good-will.” (Luke 2: 14, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font4"> It is those who learn of Jehovah and his law and who love his law that receive peace.

The religionists of “Christendom”, led by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and claiming to be representatives of God and Christ, are certain to receive the withering rebuke from the Lord, and that shortly. Such have tried to prevent the remnant from carrying the kingdom message to those of good will and have opposed and sought to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. In this they have acted as agents of Satan, that old Dragon, who is the chief devourer. Jehovah’s remnant now bear before the people the fruits of the kingdom, ‘ fruits of the ground’ of the Lord and his people, and these shall not be spoiled by the enemy.

<p><span class="font4">Joshua reminded the Gibeonites that they were of the cursed Canaanites, Ham’s descendants. It was a great favor to receive salvation on any condition, because they were faced with death. The issue was life and death. Likewise those of the great multitude originally came under the curse, and it is a great favor to them to be saved and receive life anywhere, under any and all conditions. The Gibeonites were told that they could not be free and could not free themselves from service to the house of God. By sparing their lives Joshua became their savior, more so later at the battle of Gibeon. Likewise the Greater Joshua becomes the Savior of the great multitude and particularly spares them at the battle of Armageddon.

In keeping the feast of passover and Pentecost the remnant do not cease from their work and the joy thereof. They continue therein, but have added joy in having part in the work of ingathering of the great multitude. In this joy those of the great multitude join. All of Jehovah’s people keep the feast together, and particularly the great multitude is shown by waving palm branches and thus recognizing and hailing Christ as King, Victor and Savior sent to them by Jehovah. When Moses was concluding his instructions to Israel on the plains of Moab he said: “Rejoice, 0 ye nations, with his people.” This surely must indicate that those aside from the anointed, who take their stand on the Lord’s side, rejoice with the anointed.

Like Esau (Edom), the clergy of “organized Christianity” long ago became hunters, going about hunting with other elements of Satan’s world, and despising God’s promises. They sold their birthright for a mess of pottage to satisfy their own appetites. They have made their choice and must abide in it. In this day when the promise to Abraham is made clear to those who love God, and when these faithful witnesses, pictured by Jacob (Israel), go about proclaiming the meaning of that birthright, the “Edomites” seek the death of these servants of Jehovah.

Desertion from the Israelites now would mean certain destruction of the Gibeonites to which they had been doomed before making their covenant with Joshua. Now the people of good will, uniting themselves with God’s organization, are no longer desired by the nations of this world, but are hated by the worldlings because those confederated powers stand for Satan. Those who have turned to the Lord are marked for death by Satan and his crowd. They have looked to God and Christ, and now know their salvation comes only from God.

<p><span class="font4">The rulers in “Christendom” never turned loose any of the prisoners of the Lord. It is Jehovah’s own officers that loosened his prisoners. King Nebuchadnezzar’s officers, picturing the officers of Jehovah’s organization, came to Jeremiah and loosened him and told him he might go to Babylon or remain with his own people or do whatever he pleased. “Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people.” (40: 6) “Gedaliah” means “made great by Jehovah”, and manifestly refers to some creatures who render faithful service to the Lord and whom the Lord God has approved.

Being taken to the wilderness suggests no possibility of the live goat class’ being recovered and reinstated in God’s organization. “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.” (Heb. 10: 31) When the Lord Jesus appears at the temple he begins the cleansing work. A part of that work is to clear out the wicked, that is, those who have not a pure heart. Ousting of the rebellious ones continues, and everyone who becomes an offender, murmurer or complainer against God and his organization is cleared out.

<p><span class="font4">One who loves God is anxious to obey his commandments. He is fearful to do anything that would injure anyone, but tries to do good unto all, and particularly to those of the household of faith. Those who truly fear God rejoice and speak together concerning him and his commandments, and are diligent in assisting each other in obeying his commandments. The faithful servants of God lay aside all fear of man, because these fully realize that fear of man leads one into the Devil’s snare. There is only one thing to be done by God’s children, and that is, tell the truth and trust always in the Lord and acknowledge him in all the way; and the Lord, true to his promise, will protect and preserve such. God does not show partiality toward creatures; and it is our duty to walk with him obediently and show no partiality nor fear, but always to speak to his honor.

<p><span class="font4">Guided by the perfect law of God the consecrated cannot go wrong. To be thus properly guided the man must have a pure heart; that is, his heart must be right, free from selfishness, and his motive or moving cause must be to serve God and his King because such is the right course to take. Therefore the Lord says to such: “Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.” (Prov. 4: 23) Not only must the motive be right when one begins to serve the Lord, but he must continue to keep his motive pure and his love set upon God. If one’s motive to serve the Lord is selfish he is certain to fail and fall entirely away. When Jehu said to Jonadab, “Is thine heart right, as my heart is?” clearly he meant that only those who have and maintain a pure condition of heart can remain in God’s organization.

Thus the Lord is searching out and stripping bare the old “whore”. When the work of his witnesses is done God will completely strip bare those who have laid up great treasure to satisfy their own greed and selfish desires. This is not man’s judgment, but the announcement of God’s judgment declaring the day of his vengeance.

For the encouragement of the people of good will who seek to serve and worship Jehovah he says, “Fear thou not” the enemy. Likewise Jehovah says to the remnant of Zion, who are of his capital organization under the Greater Joshua, ‘Fear not the enemy’; and furthermore adds the command to the remnant: “Let not thine hands be slack.” Their work now must be done without any letting up. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/36</span></p>

This shows that ‘bearing their iniquity’ or lawlessness (meaning a lawless course of action) could not refer typically to the Levites’ being assigned to a secondary place or position in heaven. The entire spirit-begotten company had to be cleansed when the Lord came to the temple, showing that the entire company had gone astray and were proceeding in an unlawful manner and that all who possessed a right condition of heart were cleansed by the Lord and the faithful class who were approved constituted the Lord’s “faithful and wise servant” class.—Matt. 24: 45-47.

The apostle refers to those whose names are written in heaven at the inauguration of the new covenant. (Heb. 12: 23) Concerning such the Lord says: “The righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.” (Ps. 112: 6) The Lord does not hearken nor keep a record of the unfaithful, who fail or refuse to honor his name when opportunity offers. Evidently the “book of remembrance” is kept that the faithful may be remembered and saved and delivered at Armageddon.

This took place in 1922, when God’s faithful people on earth came to know that Christ Jesus is at the temple. Then the Lord, having cleansed those found faithful, sent them forth to be his witnesses. Since 1922 there has been a constant movement forward on the part of the elect to give testimony to Jehovah’s name and his kingdom. Had the war continued without cessation, they would not have given that testimony in obedience to the Lord’s commandment, and therefore it was for their sake, the elect’s sake, that the tribulation was cut short by stopping the war in 1918 until the witness work is done.

The “higher powers” are not the rulers of this world. The higher powers are Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. Only in recent years have the remnant come to know this great truth. Since then they have realized that they are free from worldly powers and from the iron bands of worldly government, and that these do not bind the spirit of such as are devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom.

They see the war is on and that they must fight and fight continuously, and that their part of the fight is to proclaim Jehovah’s praises and to continuously offer before him an offering in righteousness. The remnant are now hated by the ruling powers of all nations, even as Jesus was hated when on earth. The faithful remnant now delight to bear the reproaches that reproached our Lord and Head. “Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.

This must be done now in order that the preservation of the great multitude may be recognized and proved to be the act of God as he has foretold.

<p><span class="font4">This mighty and strong One uses his power as a tempest of hail, which sweeps away the refuge of lies and destroys the liars, and then as a destroying storm, which does the complete slaying of the enemy. “And the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.” (Vs. 17) A “tempest of hail” is one thing, and a “destroying storm” another and far greater thing, and may or may not be accompanied by hail. A great storm in which many hailstones fall would be a “destroying storm”. Jehovah sends forth his witnesses to proclaim his truth; by this he sweeps away the lies. But where there is a great storm, with hail of large size, it constitutes a “destroying storm”. Jehovah’s destroying storm does the destructive work. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">IV 9/15/36</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel . . , and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness.—Lev. 1G: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “fit man” was an appropriate man, therefore an unclean man. Thus is pictured a class of unclean ones on earth to whom Jehovah releases and turns over the live goat class, and these are led away to the Devil. This class, probably first by indifference and then by a positive and willing course of action, become the associates with the unclean class and thus take a positive stand against God and his organization. The live goat class therefore goes away from God’s organization and becomes a part of the world, Satan’s organization, and is thereby dragged away directly to the Devil, “into the wilderness,” outside the camp of God’s people for whom atonement was made, those in line for reconciliation with God.

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah is the Most High. Before him there is no other. Any creature who exalts himself to a high place commits a presumptuous sin and so is an abomination in God’s sight. It was Lucifer who said: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be like the Most High.” The Devil formed a conspiracy against God and drew into it a host of spirit creatures and a multitude of earthly creatures. Those conspirators have defied God and reproached his holy name. Their end is destruction, and Jehovah has so written the judgment. His rule is established, and he changes not. Destruction is the fate of all the wicked conspirators. Jehovah’s name is directly related to his faithful people. Those who hate them hate him and Christ Jesus. Those who conspire against God’s people conspire against the Lord himself. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The work assigned to the servant class must be done by Jehovah’s witnesses as preparation for the great battle progresses. Therefore they have a part in this war-work, but they do not fight with carnal weapons. Their weapons of warfare are the message of God’s truth. That is a mighty weapon for the shaking of the foundations of the enemy’s visible organization even in this day. Satan and his forces now war on the remnant, because to them the kingdom interests have been entrusted and they are declaring that message of truth to the people, and thus draw the fire of the enemy upon them. That is the reason for the wicked persecutions now inflicted upon them. Regardless of that persecution, however, the anointed must continue and will continue to obey the Lord. The course taken by them is a warning to others, and the persecution of them affords the opportunity for the remnant to prove their own integrity toward God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">People of good will will see and rejoice that the Lord’s blessings are upon his faithful remnant. Satan’s visible seed, the nations of “Christendom”, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, now curse the remnant and pray to their god to curse those who carry Jehovah’s message to the people. They conspire against the remnant and commit overt acts in performance thereof against Jehovah’s people. The Devil and all his organization will meet defeat at Armageddon, and then all survivors will be glad and rejoice that Jehovah’s witnesses have proved their integrity toward him and that he has delivered and preserved those who love him. Jehovah delights in his remnant because they are faithful in obeying his commandments, thereby showing their love for him. W</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11/15/36</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure.—2 Pet. 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptures do not set forth promises to two classes of spirit-begotten ones. There never was any Scriptural reason for holding before men the hope of a secondary place in heaven that might be reached by way of the “back door’’. It is positively stated, on the contrary, that all are called in one hope of our calling, not two hopes. (Eph. 4: 4) The begetting or acknowledgment of his sons to the heavenly place by the Lord is in one hope. That hope is to partake of the resurrection of Christ Jesus to an incorruptible inheritance. Instead of a heavenly opportunity’s being reserved for those who become “less faithful’’ by drawing back and mixing up with Satan’s organization it is plainly stated in the Scriptures that such as do draw back and become unfaithful are assigned to destruction.—Heb. 10: 38, 39. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">If I am a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, 0 priests.—Mal. 1: 6, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The true servant of God has understanding: he appreciates his proper relationship to his Master and to Jehovah and that he must honor the name of Jehovah and his beloved Son. Christ Jesus is the Master over the house of Jehovah God. “For one is your master, even Christ.” (Matt. 23: 8) Jehovah is the great Master and Lord over all. He was the Master to the priesthood of natural Israel. God was their Sovereign Ruler. Jehovah is the Supreme Power, the Chief of the Higher Powers. His sons cannot fear him and at the same time be men-pleasers. The sons of God are not the servants of men • they must stand or fall to their own Master, the Lord of heaven and earth. To give honor to men and not to Jehovah is equivalent to despising Jehovah’s name. The responsibility becomes greater when one knows that God’s purpose is the vindication of His name.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.—Luke 16:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The great objective in the outworking of God’s purpose is the vindication of his name. To that end he first causes a witness to be given to those who will hear concerning his name and his mighty organization under Christ Jesus, and thereafter demonstrates his great power by destroying Satan and all those who align themselves with Satan. There is nothing in the Scriptures to show that God has any purpose of exalting some creature and making that creature’s name great; and that God now, in this day preceding Armageddon, selects some man and assigns to that man “a great work that he must do”. There is no reason why the Lord should do such a thing, because exaltation of men is abomination in his sight. The prophecy of Obadiah emphasizes that, aside from the Lord Jesus, not one of the servant class is identified. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon.—Josh. 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Joshua, a type of Christ Jesus, led the Israelites to Gibeon. While the Israelites were there for war, it was Jehovah who fought the battle to a decisive end, Joshua being the visible leader. It was Jehovah who caused the enemy to get started on the rout. Was that an expression of Jehovah’s anger against the enemy? Was Jehovah wroth when he slew the besiegers of Gibeon? He so states at Isaiah 28: 21, and says that he will again rise up against the enemy and express his anger: that ‘‘he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon”. When Jehovah begins to take action against the enemy he will do so in anger, as he did when he began the assault upon the confederated enemy that was attacking Gibeon. Joshua was invincible because he was Jehovah’s servant and strictly obeyed God’s law. In this he pictured Christ Jesus, who knows no defeat and who will win at Armageddon.

<p><span class="font4">In the present-day conspiracy to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses the chief ones on earth are the Roman Catholic Hierarchy or clergy. In that conspiracy or confederacy have been drawn the commercial traffickers and professional political rulers. The clergy have taught their confederates to hate those who are on the side of Jehovah and his King. For that reason Jehovah’s faithful witnesses now are “hated of all nations for my name’s sake’’, says the Lord. But those confederate men, that is, the commercial and political elements, come to discern the hypocrisy of the modernday Edomites and they show those Edomites the exit and tell them to get out: they “brought thee on thy way, even to the border” (B.F.), that is, to the boundary line, the limit or jumping-off place. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Zeph. 2: 3, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Had not the war been stopped in 1918, would the “great multitude” have been saved? No; for the reason, the “great multitude” was not then in existence and could not be until the judgment of the house of God at the temple, and the selection of the elect. It has been only recently that the great multitude came into view of the remnant. Now the remnant must carry the message of truth to those persons of good will toward God in order that those may learn of God and his King and have opportunity to seek righteousness and meekness, that they may be saved in the day of God’s expressed wrath. This means not only a privilege but a mandate from Jehovah and Christ Jesus that cannot be avoided by the royal house. From the end of the war until the final tribulation the way is made clear for the elect to work. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/36</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">He that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. —Prov. 13:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord has his own good way of rebuking those who stray from the path of strict obedience to his law or organization instructions. If one takes the improper course and is reproved, such reproof is for his good if properly received, as it is written: “For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.” (Prov. 6: 23) The converse of this Scripture statement must be true. One in the covenant with God who disregards the commandment of Jehovah and the instructions of his organization is not in the way of life. If a man fears God he will think soberly and take the wise course, because “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom”. “The fear of the Lord is to hate evil,” to hate and refrain from anything that would do injury to God’s organization or those diligent therein. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.—Gen. 12: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The cursing and blessing are directly connected. Before the curse is executed Christ Jesus at the temple separates the blessed from the cursed, that is, the sheep from the goats. He puts Jehovah’s curse upon the goat class and administers blessings to his “other sheep”, the great multitude. This he does because the goats have cursed the faithful remnant, who are a part of The Christ, and his “other sheep” have blessed the remnant and done them good. This cursing and blessing take place before the time of regeneration begins. The little flock and the “other sheep” therefore rejoice together, because the “other sheep” have been gathered to the Lord. This being the ingathering of the harvest of the earth, and the little flock having been used in connection therewith, they all rejoice together to God’s glory.

<p><span class="font4">The very thing that brought so much sorrow among men was the covetous desire of Satan to be exalted. If any man makes it known that he is specially chosen of the Lord to do some specific work, we may know that such man is either weak in the mind or else being moved by the spirit of Satan. The great issue to be determined is, Who is supreme? The name of Jehovah must be and will be vindicated. Men are of no importance so far as they are individually concerned. The remnant will keep this point clearly in mind, and will therefore always know that it is worse than foolish to listen to the claims of a man who is looking for honor and exaltation among men. They will be guided by Jehovah through his Word, and by his Chief Officer, Christ Jesus, and, being so guided, will now heed and joyfully obey His commands.

The war against that wicked crowd now progresses; within a short time the modern Edomites will be completely exposed and their bluff and bluster will come to an end. Even now many commercial men and politicians clearly discern the hypocrisy of the so-called clergy “wise men” who attempt to give spiritual advice to others.

Had the wrongdoers’ acts been condoned the entire body of Christians would have been contaminated. The admonition is to shun the wrongdoer that the spirit of Christ may be preserved in the church unto his coming for judgment.

<p><span class="font4">No man ever gathered another man into the kingdom of God. It is the Lord who gathers the great multitude. The Lord uses the term “sheep” to illustrate those gathered to him and made members of the royal house of Jehovah. Then Jesus adds: “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” (John 10: 16) The great multitude are those of the “other sheep” whom the Lord gathers into his organization, and in due time all those gathered become a part of the fold of the Shepherd. The work of the remnant in connection with the great multitude is to proclaim this kingdom gospel. The duty and obligation laid upon the servant class is to show people of good will the way to God’s organization, that they may flee to it.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">‘righteous offering unto the Lord’ could not be mixed with and contaminated by any halfway faithfulness, such as compromising with any part of Satan’s organization. The offering must be unblemished. It must be a wholehearted devotion to Jehovah, together with “sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name”. ‘Offering an offering in righteousness’ must mean that soiled garments worn while among the Babylonians must be taken away from the antitypical tribe of Levi after leaving the Babylonish crowd, and all uncleanness be removed, that the acceptable service of God might be identified as being for him first, last, and all the time.

When the Amorite combined forces got into the valley, they were being pursued from the rear by Joshua’s army, and a great and destructive storm met them on their front, and so there was no way for them to escape.

It is to this covenant people that the Lord has committed or entrusted his kingdom interests on earth, and now, when he is exercising his power, he requires of everyone in the covenant faithful performance.

The last drunkenness of the modern Edomites will not be with jubilation and pleasure. That drunken brawl will witness the passing of the Edomites, for “they shall be as though they had not been”. Those who survive that day will put the Hierarchy and its allies for ever out of memory. It is Jehovah God who now maneuvers the enemy, and who will hand them a cup and compel them to drink it. It is a picture of their destruction. It is God’s act.

There is no excuse for the remnant to be entrapped now by the Devil, and we have assurance that the elect will not be entrapped.

The primary purpose of the Abrahamic covenant is vindication of Jehovah’s name. The added covenants are for the purpose of providing God’s instrument for his name’s sake to be used in vindicating his name. Vengeance, or vindication, and the blessing are tied together and show there must be some blessing before the vindication ; otherwise there would be none spared and taken through Armageddon as a vindication to Jehovah’s name. To this blessed class Jesus the Vindicator says: ‘ ‘ Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” This further proves that the antitypical feast of tabernacles to Jehovah has begun. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/36</span></p>

The answer is, “that we [the elect] through patience [that is, by steadfastly pushing on amid great opposition and confidently trusting in the Lord] and comfort of the scriptures [an understanding thereof] might have hope.” (Rom. 15: 4) Otherwise many of those who have covenanted to do God’s will might faint under the opposition and fall by the way. God has graciously made provision that those who love him may stand. Those who cry “Peace and safety” are in darkness, but the wise virgins are in the light. The glory of Jehovah shines in the face of Christ Jesus and is reflected upon those of the temple class, and such must let their light so shine that the great multitude may see that the kingdom is at hand and also tell of its blessedness.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall over</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">flow the hiding place.—Isa. 28:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That is, the judgment is so strict and straight and right that it is wholly righteous, and nothing escapes it. That judgment is by the Lord Jesus Christ, the great Judge at the temple, when the nations are gathered before him and he does the separating work. “And the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.” This does not seem to be Armageddon, but rather pertains to the fight now in progress. The Lord Jesus is separating the nations and at the same time sending forth his “faithful and wise servant” class with the cold, hard truths, symbolized by hail, which, being forcefully delivered, regardless of all opposition, uncovers the lies of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies, and exposes them.

<p><span class="font4">Did Jehovah tell Jeremiah to sit down and wait for a more favorable season to proclaim the truth within the city ? Has the Lord told his people in this day that they are to be indifferent and wait until after the fall of Satan’s religionists at Armageddon and then give the warning to the great multitude and gather them? Exactly the contrary is true. Jeremiah was not waiting for the Ethiopian Ebed-melech to come to him, but he must go direct to Ebed-melech, who pictures the great multitude, and see to it that Ebed-melech (picturing the great multitude) receives the Lord’s message, and to do this regardless of restraint or opposition. Jehovah’s witnesses must go to the homes of the people, with His message. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">To have part in the sin offering for mankind is not of first importance to those who become the followers of Christ Jesus, but to them that whieh is of first importance is to serve God’s organization and have a part with Christ Jesus in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The purpose of justification and spirit-begetting of such is not primarily to have a part in the sin offering and assisting to uplift the world, but that of chief importance is to answer Satan’s false charge against God by proving that the creature following in Jesus’ footsteps can withstand the assaults of Satan and maintain his integrity toward God even though that means to such a sacrificial death. It is thus that one becomes associated with the great Vindicator. The taking of men to heaven is not of primary importance. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The condition in the church at Corinth was dangerous to its life, and that body was urged to take due action to purge itself of wrongdoers. The apostle’s words subsequently written indicate that the body of Christians there followed his admonition and that the wrongdoer repented and turned to the Lord. Thus the spirit of the church was preserved, showing that such should be the course of those who receive the Lord’s approval at his coming to the temple for judgment. In cleansing the sanctuary Christ Jesus would not destroy the blameless spirit from among the sanctuary class, but would preserve and save it until the earthly work of the anointed is done. The Lord gathers out the offending or lawless ones. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah takes the faithful, who prove their integrity toward him, out of the world and into the temple, and they shall be his “peculiar people”, “a people for a purpose.” This they will be “in the day that I do make”.

<p><span class="font4">For some time political and financial men have furnished the wherewithal to ‘spread the butter on the bread’ of the clergy. The clergy have been considered an advisable adjunct to big politics and big business, and in turn the big clergy have attempted to supply some kind of so-called “spiritual food” upon which to feed the principal of their flock. But the time arrives when these principal of the flock see the progress of the war between the modern Edomites and the Lord’s remnant, and, clearly discerning the hypocrisy of the Edomites, they say to their erstwhile allies, the clergy, “It is enough.” The clergy during the period of the war now in progress will be exposed, disgraced and cast aside, and then will follow their destruction at Armageddon.

<p><span class="font4">The battle of Gibeon, when the forces were led by Joshua, was one battle, but not all fought at the city. The most destructive part of that battle was after the confederated enemy forces had fled and were going down to the country where the caves were situated. It was then that the “destroying storm” (Isa. 28:2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> of Jehovah overtook the enemy. Then Jehovah east down from heaven great stones, presumably chunks of ice formed by many pieces of hail uniting as they fell and making larger pieces of ice, which would easily kill a man when striking him. This gives us some idea of the manner in which Jehovah expresses his wrath against the enemy at Armageddon. Jehovah expresses his anger, and that expressed anger results in discomfiting and destroying his enemies. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">To obey is better than sacrifice.—1 Sam. 15:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sacrifice of the followers of Christ adds nothing to the great ransom sacrifice to give it more power or effectiveness in taking away sins. Therefore sacrifice for sins cannot be the primary reason for God’s justifying men and begetting them as his spiritual sons. Even the great sacrifice of Christ Jesus producing the ransom was only secondary in importance. That which stands out as of greatest importance is vindication of Jehovah’s name. The force of this argument is also strong proof that God will not fix a secondary place in heaven for some merely to save a great multitude from destruction. Such is not expressed in Scripture as a reason for God to provide a secondary reward in heaven and room for service for them to so serve. When we keep in mind that the great issue which must be settled is vindication of Jehovah’s name all other things take their proper place.

<p><span class="font4">The obligation of informing people of good will concerning God’s provision for their salvation is laid upon his anointed remnant as a whole. No one can perform the work that is assigned to another. Each one must do his own part as opportunity is given to him. Some reach the conclusion that a certain great work must be done by some particular individual of the remnant, and that therefore among the remnant there are some great men who will do that work. That conclusion is entirely without support in the Scriptures. On the contrary, the Scriptures, particularly the prophecy of Obadiah, disclose that no individuals are identified as members of the temple. All of the temple class are on a par or common level. There are none mighty and great or specially important. All are servants of the Lord. The duty of each one is to obey the Lord’s commandments and give all honor and glory to him, not any to man.

<p><span class="font4">The invitation is here held out to those who have started in the wrong way to return to the Lord, that is, to turn away from indifference and neglect and turn wholly to the kingdom interests and the vindication of Jehovah’s name and to get wholly and completely on the Lord’s side. Shun wrongful influence of men; turn away from fear of men, which leads into the Devil’s snare and which fear is employed by him to entrap the fearful. (Prov. 29:25) Turn away from idolaters or relationship with the Devil’s organization and refuse to compromise with or have anything to do with that wicked thing. Jehovah has left the way open to return before one has gone the limit, that is, provided such one desires in sincerity to be in harmony with God: “and I will return unto you, ’ ’ that is, ‘ ‘ with mercies. ’ ’-Zech. 1:16 W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11/15/36</span></p>

It is during this period of witnessing by telling the message of truth that the great' multitude is gathered unto the Lord, and this is done before the “battle of that great day of God Almighty” begins, that is, before the “destroying storm” (vs. 2) breaks upon the enemy. “When the overflowing scourge sweepeth past” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.),</span><span class="font4"> then Jehovah will express his indignation through Christ Jesus, who is his “mighty and strong one”, and in this expression of his wrath his “destroying storm” annihilates the enemy.

After the Lord has torn off the mask now worn by the hypocritical clergy, the Hierarchy and others, and behind which they have hidden to carry on their crookedness, and after he has exposed them to public contempt and disgrace, then he will literally destroy them.

That which is of all importance is God’s name; and that which he places upon his altar or “table” is in the interests of his kingdom and is placed there for his sons, and such is worthy of a full and undivided devotion of the sons that are in line for the kingdom. To attempt to mix worldly things with that which God has provided on his table is to dishonor his name. For those who claim to serve God to at the same time mix that service with that which brings honor and praise to men is proof that they despise God’s name and his provision for them.

He would not employ divers means and numerous channels through which to operate his organization and transmit his spiritual food. The Lord has proved to his people that he is feeding his people the truth through the Watch Tower publications. No human ingenuity or ability could set forth the meaning of the prophecies which God’s people have received within the past few years. Prophecy is not of private interpretation. He who attempts to place a private interpretation upon prophecy shows himself to be a fool, for by his course of conduct he says in his heart, There is no God; i. e., God and Christ are not directing the covenant people.

<p><span class="font4">What came to pass on that day at Gibeon being a prophecy, there was no like day before it nor after it, but it foretold a greater day when the prophecy should be fulfilled; and now we have come to that day of fulfillment. No doubt Jehovah sent his angel to put into Joshua’s mind the bold thought that caused him to utter the prayer to God that the sun and moon should stand still and continue to give light. Joshua pictured Christ Jesus, who acts at Armageddon in behalf of man, both for the remnant and for the great multitude, and to the honor and praise of Jehovah God. “The Lord fought for Israel,” and thus Jehovah furnished protection and salvation for the Gibeonites.

The prophetic picture (2 Chron. 20:23) seems to imply that the principal of the flock will drive the clergy into the hands of a mob from which they will receive no sympathy. That does not at all mean that the principal of the flock or the mob will then show any favor to the remnant of Jehovah.

The type shows that even before the reproaches cease which have fallen upon his name and upon his footstep followers, Christ Jesus must appear in glory and in power. Aaron came forth clothed in his garments of glory and beauty, and thus pictured Christ Jesus appearing at the temple in glory and beauty. Aaron then offered burnt offerings. The burnt offering for the people pictured God’s acceptance of the sacrifice and sin atonement which preceded. Such acceptance is now manifested in bringing God’s remnant now on earth to completeness and giving them the “new name”, and using them for the closing work of this period.

The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies now do everything within their power to prevent the message from going forth.

These are people of good will, the “great multitude”, and will worship in the outer court. Now by reason of faith in Jehovah and Christ Jesus and of fleeing to God’s organization, the city of refuge, they have a standing of approval before God and, there continuing faithful, they will have protection at Armageddon. In the tabernacle in the wilderness the people were excluded from the Holy. Only the priest was permitted there.

It means only those who take their stand on Jehovah’s side and obey him and who come from all nations. The blessed ones must keep the feast of tabernacles. Otherwise they shall have no blessing. “And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem, shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.” (Zech. 14:16) This scripture locates the beginning of the feast of tabernacles. It is those who are left out of the nations, which nations came up against Jerusalem, that keep the feast. The name “Jerusalem” applies to the new Jerusalem, God’s capital organization, which is Christ Jesus and those of his royal house.

<p><span class="font4">Teman was a prominent stronghold of the ancient Edomites, and therefore pictures the prominent clergymen strong in power of the church organizations with the political officers of the world. These are ironically called “mighty men”. Scornfully and boastfully they say: ‘We are safe and secure behind our mountain of lies; who can find us out?’ And Jehovah says: ‘The truth shall sweep away those lies and expose the hypocrisy of the liars.’ That now jars the Temanites somewhat, even to hear it at the mouth of Jehovah’s witnesses. It will jar them more in the Lord’s due time. The Lord says he will put it in the heart of the rulers, the kings of this world, to strip the old “whore” naked and apply the branding-iron. That will dismay them some more. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The man who really loves God will firmly stand on the Lord’s side and let his course of action be a sample or guide to help those who are near to him by earthly ties and who are also under the test. One has no excuse or justification for departing from a righteous way in order to help somebody who is out of the way. It is the small things that disclose faithfulness and unfaithfulness. God did not require of Adam the performance of a great task, but did require him to be firm, steadfast and obedient. God has not required of those following Christ Jesus to perform great things, but he does require them to remain steadfast, true, faithful and dependable. (1 Cor. 4:2) Whatever duty is assigned to one who is in a covenant to do God’s will, that servant must be faithful in the performance of such assigned duty.

<p><span class="font4">Ebed-melech and Jeremiah both survived the destruction of Jerusalem, because they were both on the side of the Lord Jehovah. The name “Ebed-melech” meaning “servant of the king”, and the class whom he pictured having taken their stand on the side of Christ the King, it shows that these become the servants of Christ, joyfully doing his service. They have washed their robes in his blood, having put their faith in him and in Jehovah, and have lined up on Jehovah’s side, and with palms in their hands they hail the “King of saints”, Jehovah, and his glorious anointed King, Christ Jesus. These give honor and praise to Jehovah and Christ and attribute to them all protection and salvation. They do not wave flags and hail men. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Nothing is impossible with Jehovah God, and manifestly this part of the prophetic picture foreshadowed that the light of God and Christ shall continue to shine while the destruction of the enemy takes place. Other prophecies show that when Armageddon is being fought the enemy will be in complete darkness, such as would accompany a destroying storm, while God’s people will have light. This shows that Armageddon will not be interrupted by things determining time, such as sun or moon, but that the battle will be fought through to a finish, to the utter destruction of Jehovah’s enemies. Only one battle! None of the forces of the Lord or of his people who sing his praises complain at the length of time consumed in the battle. They have light and they rejoice.

Today the faithful remnant, scattered throughout the nations, meditate on Jehovah’s name and his kingdom. They reflect that his name has been and is now being reproached by Satan and his earthly agents. They consider solemnly and thoughtfully that God has given them the privilege of having part in vindicating his name, and that therefore responsibility is now on them to tell the truth concerning his name and his kingdom, and not to shun to declare the whole counsel of God. They are called by his name and are subjected to persecution for his name’s sake. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11/15/36</span></p>

They seem to have no conception that they are fighting against God and his King. Jehovah has declared his purpose to humiliate those wicked persecutors by causing his witnesses to proclaim his message of truth throughout the world, and in obedience to his command the witnesses are now doing that very thing. The truth vexes the Hierarchy and puts its men to shame. Those who really love and serve God will not be ashamed. They will look the enemy square in the face and tell them the truth.

Our affections must be wholly set upon the Lord and his kingdom, and we must be blind to everything else. The remnant must keep a clear mind; hence there must be a helmet for protecting the head, and for that helmet ‘put on the hope of salvation’. The vindication of Jehovah’s name means the salvation of the remnant. Knowledge that this is the day for vindicating his name, and that the faithful may now have part in that vindication, should be a great hope and safeguard to the head, and the result is a clear understanding of the doctrines now due to be understood. It is time for the battle of that great day of God Almighty. Some of the faithful will see that battle and be carried through it while on the earth.

<p><span class="font4">In 1917 and 1918 Satan assembled all the nations of “Christendom” in particular against the Lord’s holy nation, the New Jerusalem, and ‘spoiled that nation’ by turning the “evil servant” class wholly to Satan. At the same time the Lord preserved the remnant, the “faithful servant” class, and sent the latter forth to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah. The bearing of this testimony must be done between the time of this attack upon “Jerusalem” and Armageddon. All nations came up against Jerusalem, and out of those nations subsequently comes the great multitude. These are now told that they must seek righteousness and meekness before the day of God’s wrath if they would be hid through Armageddon.

<p><span class="font4">They are his people, bearing his name; and that his name may be made known and vindicated, he spares those who are his witnesses. The consecrated and devoted ones that “feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name” and not upon themselves and how they might shine before men, are the sons of God that gladly serve him as their Father, even as Christ Jesus served God as his Father. Serving him is the condition precedent to their being spared. Nor does this mean they will be so shielded that the enemy cannot assault and persecute them, but that their lives or their existence will be spared and preserved everlastingly by Jehovah. Some will be carried alive through Armageddon, but whether one dies in the fight or is spared until after the fight is done makes little difference.

<p><span class="font4">That is, he burnt the fat of the bullock and of the Lord’s goat, for, as it is written (Lev. 3:16), “all the fat is the Lord’s.” Now the picture is made clear, in this, that while the scapegoat class roam about in the wilderness having what they call their liberty, and doing as they please, the zeal of the remnant of Jehovah’s anointed ones burns them up in the service as they joyfully bear testimony to his name and the kingdom. ‘ ‘ The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.” (Ps. 69:9) Thus it is seen that the Lord does not compel man to take a certain course, but gives him the opportunity to take the course desired and to receive the consequences.

<p><span class="font4">Likewise all the nations of “Christendom” continue to hate Jehovah’s witnesses because they proclaim Jehovah’s name, and these nations continue to restrict the sphere of activity of Jehovah’s witnesses, and will continue to do so, until the battle of Armageddon. Samson was held in prison after his hair began to grow, and this suggests the same thing as above. The king of Babylon renewed the siege of Jerusalem, and Jeremiah was there at the time. (39: 11, 12) Thus is foretold Jehovah’s orders through Christ Jesus, and to his angels, as to the disposition and protection of the remnant at and after Armageddon. This appears to say that Jehovah by Christ Jesus orders that his remnant shall be spared during Armageddon and shall be given service afterwards.

<p><span class="font4">The second outpouring of the holy spirit, fulfilling Joel’s prophecy in completeness, occurred after the Lord’s coming to the temple for judgment. That was the antitypical Pentecost, or complete fulfillment. All the consecrated were then presented before the Lord for judgment and determination as to which should receive his approval and enter into his joy. All presented were imperfect in themselves. This was represented by the leaven in the loaves. Not all possessed the same heart condition. There was a separation or division. This corresponded with the purifying of the sons of Levi. (Mal. 3: 2, 3) Out of that fiery test then applied came the “faithful and wise servant”, to whom the Lord committed his interests.

<p><span class="font4">The Lord says: “The hail [hard, solid truths] shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters [flood of God’s truth] shall overflow the hiding place.” (Isa. 28: 17) That the Lord says he will do in his judgment time. Such is not the battle of Armageddon, because in that scourge of Armageddon Jehovah by Christ Jesus and his army will annihilate all the enemy. When Jehovah says, “Rise up,” it means to battle “against her”, the enemy. This battle spoken of is now in progress, and is a battle of truth against entrenched lies. It is a battle between Jehovah’s witnesses on one side and hypocritical religionists, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, on the other, and takes place just preceding and preliminary to “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”.

The miracle, therefore, must be true. The recording of the aforementioned miracle concerning sun and moon was undoubtedly for the aid, comfort and hope of the faithful remnant now on earth. It is to be expected that the “Upright One”, Jehovah, would give his people in this day of judgment a revelation and understanding of why the record was made concerning Joshua and his army at Gibeon. It is insulting to the Lord for anyone to say that these things are mere expressions of man’s opinion.

<p><span class="font4">So likewise it appears that the Lord reserves the “kings”, both visible and invisible, of Satan’s organization for destruction in the final part of the battle. All such of the enemy were foreshadowed by the five kings who hid themselves in the cave. It appears that the Lord holds back the “beast”, the “false prophet”, and the Devil’s invisible hosts to the last for destruction that these might know that it is the hand of Jehovah that does the destroying work, and that the enemy must drink the cup of bitterness to the brimful in seeing all the host of the wicked wiped out. That proves to all that Jehovah is the Almighty God, “mighty in battle,” and that Satan is a cheap mimic and braggart, a fraud and a liar.

<p><span class="font4">The sacrifice represents the one offering it. If the offerer is blind to the great issue or question for determination and that blindness is induced by his own selfishness, his offering therefore is blind and hence an imperfect offering, contrary to the Lord’s commandment. In this day, when the King is at the temple directing his people what they must do, anyone who ignores His instructions and pursues his own selfish course, thereby says: “God is not directing his organization”; and “in his heart”, by his course of action, says, “There is no God.” Thus he declares himself a fool. He is blind to the real purpose of Jehovah. Jehovah provides the means for enlightening and making clear the vision of his sons that they may not bring him a blind sacrifice.

<p><span class="font4">Hanging the bodies of the five kings on five trees symbolically said, “These men are accursed of God,” and represented the accursed enemies of Jehovah that shall be humiliated and then destroyed. Hanging them on trees was a further humiliation to Satan, whose servants they were, and foreshadows the humiliation that must come to Satan on seeing his representatives destroyed at Armageddon. These things were brought to pass and recorded to strengthen the faith and courage of Jehovah’s faithful ones now on earth proclaiming the message of his name and kingdom. As Joshua slew these enemies, even so the Greater Joshua, Christ Jesus, will slay all of God’s enemies at Armageddon. The kings’ bodies were not buried with pompous and military honors.

Before the battle of the “great day of God Almighty” ends, even the enemy shall be compelled to see that Jehovah’s favor is upon Zion. While the modern Edomites persecute God’s people they hypocritically claim that deliverance of the people of the world shall be by the hand of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and her allies. Declaring that the hypocritical clergy shall come to an ignominious end, Jehovah says: “But in mount Zion there shall be those that escape.” (R.V.)

(John 10:16) The Lord Jesus uses his anointed ones to proclaim “this gospel of the kingdom” for the purpose of gathering to himself his ‘ ‘ other sheep ’ which ingathering must be done before Armageddon. These are the Jonadabs or “great multitude” class, gathered at the end of the antitypical year and after Christ Jesus has gathered the spiritual class to the temple.

Having once started to follow the Lord, then he who turns back shall not survive. This was pictured by Lot’s wife looking back and by the one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back or turns back. There is only one way that leads to life; and when one starts in that way and then turns back, destruction is certain to result, because, said Jesus, “strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life; and few there be that find it. ’ ’ Life is a gracious gift of God through Christ Jesus; and when one having learned the way of life starts in that way and then turns back, he draws back to perdition, and such is his fate.—Heb. 6: 4-6.

There it is shown that the angel of the Lord summons all on the side of Jehovah to come and see the complete vindication of his holy name. Then the “beast” and the “false prophet” are taken alive and destroyed, and then the Devil himself gets his deserts.

In God’s organization men are selected and sent forth to give aid to others to have better understanding of their privileges of serving God and Christ. Service in the organization is not for the purpose of enabling men to shine or show forth their ability. The Lord’s organization must be and will be harmonious and work together harmoniously, and one causing discord will certainly be removed by the Lord.

<p><span class="font4">The faithful ones who serve God do not hesitate to declare themselves for Jehovah and boldly declare that they rely upon him for salvation and do not attribute salvation to any man or man-made thing. The faithful discern that Jehovah’s judgment is now upon and against the wicked and that their destruction is because they have defamed God’s holy name and because of their murderous attacks upon Jehovah’s witnesses. It is not difficult for the faithful of the temple class to “discern between the righteous and the wicked”, that is, between those who serve and those who do not serve God. As the wicked face the fire of destruction, no doubt they will see God’s protecting hand over his faithful witnesses. The “glittering sword” of Jehovah’s Executioner shall slay the wicked, and they shall not return. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.—Ezek. 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The watchman is not one man, but is collectively made up of the “faithful and wise servant” class to whom God’s kingdom interests on earth are now entrusted. The Lord’s judgment day is here. The hour rapidly approaches when he will destroy all the wicked who persist in their wickedness. He says to the watchman: ‘If you give them not warning and they die, their blood I will require at your hands.’ He has laid upon the servant class the duty of giving warning and information to others; he makes his witnesses responsible for performance and demands full and complete obedience and performance by his servant, and he places responsibility upon all others who hear. It is the final testimony before the showdown between the Lord and the Devil. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/36</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.—Col. 3:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Faithfulness also means careful observance and diligence in performing assigned duties. One is sometimes heard to say: “I love the Lord and I am so glad to be on his side.” One must be more than that. He must prove his love for God, and ‘this proves one’s love for God, that he obeys His commandments joyfully’. If a task or duty of service is assigned to that one and he is forgetful, indifferent and negligent in performing it, such is clearly proof of unfaithfulness on his part. It shows he is not dependable. Not the one who says, Lord, I love you, but the one who does the Lord’s will proves his faithfulness. The Lord has committed to his people his kingdom interests. Such interests being entrusted, the specific duty of the servant is to be diligent in doing what he is assigned and to do it as unto the Lord. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah, by Joshua his representative, chased the enemy to Beth-horon. The fight began at the city of Gibeon, but did not end there. The beginning of the fight broke the confederated stronghold, because those confederated forces broke up and fled from before the Lord. There is now a confederacy between the religionist, commercial and political crowd to destroy Jehovah’s earthly organization. The beginning of the battle at Gibeon may well picture the beginning of the battle of Armageddon and which will destroy the religionists’ combine and break up the confederacy; but that is not the conclusion of the battle, for the reason that the conclusion shows the destruction of the entire wicked organization of Satan.

That devastating fire is no part of the refining, but is for destruction of Satan’s organization, and at that time all the proud (“all the presumptuous”—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser)</span><span class="font4"> and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble. Of all the proud, arrogant, presumptuous and wicked ones on earth those of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy stand at the very head of the vicious “goat” class. The Hierarchy is the Devil’s chief instrument on earth, but his organization is in for destruction, and includes all those against God. Now Jehovah’s witnesses are made objects of reproach and persecution by that wicked crowd. But the faithful are determined that these agents of Satan shall not turn them from the Lord and his faithful service. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font4"> the Devil’s henchmen and supporters those kings must now be humiliated. Thus the Lord foretells that at Armageddon the cruel, wicked rulers of the world, who have so grossly insulted Jehovah God and brought reproach upon his name, must be lined up to receive their dues, and Satan must look upon their humiliation and his own humiliation at the hand of Christ Jesus, the mighty avenger of Jehovah’s name. To this the apostle referred when he wrote: “The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.” (Rom. 16: 20) The humiliation of the enemy is well pictured by Joshua’s men treading upon the necks of those kings who had been so defiant.

<p><span class="font4">The Gibeonites were fully delivered from all enemies round about them, who would make them objects of assault and vengeance because they had forsaken Satan’s organization that fought against Jehovah’s representative, Joshua. Likewise the Jonadabs, who form the great multitude, will be saved and delivered from their enemies at Armageddon upon condition that they render full obedience to the Lord’s commandments concerning them. Like the Gibeonites, the Jonadabs arc the only ones that come out from Satan’s organization and take their stand with the Lord after Christ Jesus comes to the temple for judgment. These come fully on the side of Jehovah and Christ and associate themselves with God’s remnant. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Organized religionists are now being exposed by the proclamation of the kingdom message. This is the part in the war that is performed by Jehovah’s witnesses in advance of the destruction of modem Edomites. Let the fate of the Edomites be a warning to them that put a stumblingbloek in their brethren’s way. Jehovah makes clear that he will permit no creature to interfere with his work. Those who attempt to do so will come to grief. The faithful may expect no favor, protection or salvation from men or manmade organizations, and they will not look for such. Those who love God and his kingdom will look to the Most High for salvation through Christ Jesus. Even after the Edomites fall no favor will be received by Jehovah’s witnesses from the rulers of this world. It is war to the bitter end, and God through Christ will deliver those who love and serve him. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">&quot;In Mount Zion shall be a delivered remnant which shall be holy.” (EotA.) The faithful remnant, delivered from Satan’s crowd, will be holy and completely devoted to Jehovah and will render holiness unto the Lord. These faithful ones are holy, in having come clean from Babylon or Satan’s organization, and will be continually offering their sacrifice of praise to God and to his King. The great Refiner and Purifier sees to it that the &quot;delivered remnant” are made pure and holy and that they offer continually an offering in righteousness before the Lord. (Mal. 3: 3, 4) The faithful ones will not be putting forward their own expression of “wisdom” with a view to attracting attention to themselves. They will be blind to everything save the kingdom interests. They will be entirely dependable, faithful, true to God. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">8/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">When the Lord Jesus came to the temple and began judgment, he, at the same time, began to reveal the true meaning of many prophecies not understood prior thereto. The Lord’s fiery judgments revealed the kind of building men had been doing, and subjected such work to the most searching tests. Unsatisfactory building is unprofitable and is burned out of God’s organization because it is useless and really a hindrance to the work his people are appointed to do. All the consecrated were under orders from the Lord to build. The unwise ones, being misdirected, built the things that might be seen of man, convincing themselves that they must do so in order to attract others to the Lord and get them saved. Vindication of Jehovah’s name was not considered. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Joshua then pursued the fleeing army, and the Lord delivered them into his hand. The Giheonites had received their information and had taken their stand firmly on Joshua’s side before the battle began. This corresponds with prophecy concerning people of good will who, before Armageddon begins, receive the ‘mark in the forehead’, take their stand on Jehovah’s side, and obey his commandments, and who are spared during the slaughter work that follows because they arc on the side of the Greater Joshua. Joshua pursued the enemy, picturing Christ Jesus pursuing the enemy at Armageddon. Those with Joshua in the fight at this point pictured the invisible host of heaven that fight on the Lord’s side.

<p><span class="font4">If you find among the company of brethren those who are covetous, who gender strife and confusion, who manifest the spirit of selfishness, know that such are not of the temple company. Do not indulge in controversies with them, render no evil unto them, but follow the apostle’s admonition and avoid them. The faithful remnant must continue in peace together and must have and manifest the joy of the Lord, and with zeal perform the privileges and obligations laid upon them by the Lord. The unity of the temple class now exists, and those who do not show the spirit of harmony and unity thereby give evidence that they are outside the temple. This is the time when the anointed of the Lord truly sing: “Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.” —Ps. 133:1.

The coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple brought the healing blessings to God’s faithful people. The “Sun of righteousness” ushers in the day of righteousness and justice and is therefore the Sun of vindication. That glorious Sun will never go down. With the Lord’s coming to the temple the unclcanness of lip was removed; the mouth of the remnant was cleansed. When the faithful awoke to their privilege and the Lord’s anger passed away from them they were healed. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">We are mindful that the war is on to the finish of the enemy, and notice is now served on the Devil and his chief earthly agent, the Hierarchy at Rome, and her allies, that we will not stultify ourselves by compromising with or yielding to the enemy’s demands. Our trust is wholly in Jehovah and his King, and we will attribute salvation to none other. It is our privilege and duty to serve Jehovah, following the lead of his Faithful and True Witness. This by his grace we will do. If because of our faithfulness we die at the enemy’s hands, we die! If we survive, it will be as loyal subjects of Almighty God. Jehovah’s Vindicator cannot be defeated, and by his grace and in performance of our covenant we will follow him into the very jaws of death, being fully confident that God will preserve our everlasting existence.

The faithful remnant now on earth are the antitype of Jacob: Jacob represented them; and this promise means restoration of the remnant to their rightful place in Jehovah’s organization and to full privileges of service and activity in God’s organization. The kingdom privileges are taken away from the clergy and the “evil servant” and given to the faithful remnant to possess, because they are bringing forth the kingdom fruits. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the chief part of the visible enemy of God, and their allied clergy conspire to destroy God’s remnant and say: “We will possess it,” that is, the kingdom (Ezek. 35: 10), but their efforts are even now completely failing. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses must go to the homes of the people, not with their message, but with the Lord’s message. In doing this they must be bold, but not rude. Boldness means fearlessness in telling the truth faithfully for the Lord. Note that the Lord commanded Jeremiah to speak saying, ‘Thus the Lord of hosts says, ’ that is, ‘ the God of battle says, ’ which means that the great fight is near. The warning is given to those of good will to the effect that Jehovah says: ‘I will bring my words upon this city, or organization of “Christendom”, and wreck it, and thus will vindicate my name.’ The warning message is delivered to those of good will, and they heed it and hasten to the Lord, and these form the great multitude. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/36</span></p>

But it is only those who “seek righteousness, seek meekness”, that have the promise of being spared and taken through Armageddon. Lot was a just and righteous man, vexed because of the wicked ones dwelling about him. (2 Pet. 2: 7, 8) Sodom is set forth as an example of those whom God will destroy at Armageddon, (Jude 7) Lot corresponds exactly with that class who are marked in their foreheads, and in this prophetic picture he stands particularly as representing the great multitude.

<p><span class="font4">To put their feet on the necks of those proud, haughty kings required faith and courage on the part of Joshua’s men. Then Joshua spoke to them giving them courage, but his words of encouragement were more particularly for the benefit of the remnant now. The present-day rulers are haughty and proud and treat Jehovah’s remnant with insolence and contempt; but the time is not far distant when Jehovah through Christ Jesus will greatly humiliate those proud ones. For Jehovah’s witnesses to now continue to push forward their work in the face of such opposition requires faith and courage. That courage and faith must be strong in them to the very end.

The “fathers” are those in position of responsibility, such as leaders and expounders of God’s Word. “The children” means an offspring, sons, the true seed of Abraham. The work of preparing a'people for Jehovah would turn those who had made a covenant to do God’s will away from teachers of men and turn them to the true Father, Jehovah God. That would mean to turn elders and instructors in the congregations, who had been following teachings of men, back to the heart condition of the true children of God, the Father of all, and thus prepare a people for his name; and also turn the offspring, the children, from men’s teachings to that of God’s Word.

One who fails or refuses to feed upon spiritual food which the Lord provides, but feeds on what he thinks is right according to his own conclusion and which has been provided by man and not by the Lord, thereby clearly demonstrates that he is spiritually sick. One who claims to run in the narrow way as a follower of Christ and who then opposes or despises the work the Lord is doing to give a witness to his name shows himself out of harmony with the Lord and demonstrates his spiritual sickness.

This gospel of the kingdom must be proclaimed on this day, and that is their work.

Those who take the position that the major part of the work concerning the great multitude takes place after Armageddon, and who insist on that position, are hurrying along the road to certain destruction. There would be no reason why the Lord would give promise that those who seek righteousness and meekness may be hid in the time of his anger at Armageddon if there were a better chance for them to be of the great multitude after Armageddon.

<p><span class="font4">The “house of Jacob” and the “house of Joseph” include and cover the entire 144,000 of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel, and hence mean the entire body or members of Christ. (Rev. 7:4-8) The two houses named act in complete unity in the destruction of the enemy organization. The “house of Esau” clearly means modern-day Edomites, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allied clergy. Today all that is left of organized religion is but stubble, ready to burn. The clergy now have but a “form of godliness”; their hearts are turned away from Jehovah and his kingdom. Hence ‘ ‘ the house of Esau [shall be] for stubble”, fit only to be consumed.

In this day of Jehovah when he will vindicate his name Satan gathers all nations to Armageddon, because there Jehovah’s people are assembled and that is the principal point of the battle. Hence it is at Armageddon that Jehovah by the hand of Christ Jesus will fight the final battle, the battle of the great day of God Almighty. It is written: “And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the Lord God of Israel fought for Israel.” (Vs. 42) This statement concerning the battle and the forces of the enemy which Joshua did “take at one time” is proof that Armageddon is one battle, fought at one time, and not divided by a large space of time.

<p><span class="font4">“The sword” pictured the sword of Jehovah’s Executioner at the battle of Armageddon that destroys the antitypical Jerusalem, to wit, “Christendom.” It seems almost certain that the sons of Jonadab, the Rechabite, were also in Jerusalem at the very same time that Jeremiah and Ebed-melech, the Ethiopian, were there. Prior to this the Rechabites were there, and to these Rechabites, sons of Jonadab, Jehovah had commanded Jeremiah to speak and bring them into His house. (35: 2) The Rechabites then dwelt in tents, showing that they were looking for something better than a worldly government. (35:10,11) They took their stand on Jehovah’s side and were saved. This foreshadows the “great multitude”. They are shielded by the Lord and survive Armageddon. His words to Jonadabs arc like those to Ebed-melech.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord said unto David, Go up; for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand. And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The Lord hath broken forth.—2 Sam. 5:19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">David said: “Jehovah hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters.” (4.7?.V.) Isaiah’s prophecy reads: “Hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.” (28:17) The fight at Perazim therefore seems more particularly to represent the fight made now against the enemies by Jehovah’s forces under immediate command of Christ Jesus, the Greater David, and in which Jehovah’s witnesses engage at the command of Jehovah by vigorously proclaiming the message of truth against the enemy. Jehovah says: “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.” (Obad. 1) Christ’s invisible host, together with the visible witnesses of the Lord now on earth, are here commanded to rise up and go into battle against the enemy.

<p><span class="font4">In the war that is now in progress between the modern-day Edomites and the faithful servants of God the latter are now declaring Jehovah’s fiery judgments against the hypocritical Hierarchy or Edomites. Jehovah’s witnesses can be obedient to God now only by continuously bearing his message before the people of the world. His name and his Word must now be proclaimed far and wide. It is the Word of God in the mouth of these witnesses that is burning the clergy, even as his prophet foretold: “Wherefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy [Jehovah’s faithful witnesses’] mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.”—Jer. 5:14.

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s faithful witnesses declare the purpose of the Most High, announcing his judgments to bring burning devastation on the wicked, and therefore the wicked or lawless “shall be ashes under the soles of your feet”. Such will be the result of the day of burning described in verse one. Jehovah by his Right Arm, Christ Jesus, will lay low in ashes the Devil and all his crowd. ‘ ‘ The God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.” (Rom. 16:20) After that is accomplished all who survive will clearly “discern between the righteous and the wicked”. Only those who serve God will survive. Jehovah accomplishes this in the day which he long ago appointed for that purpose. In the “day of his preparation”, which is now, he makes ready for his complete vindication. “Jehovah of hosts” is his fighting name. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">When man hears the truth, the responsibility is upon him to believe and obey the truth. If he refuses to hear and believe the truth, the wrath of God continues upon him and is not removed. The condemnation is removed from those who do hear and believe and take their stand on the side of God and his kingdom. Having taken their stand on the Lord’s side, then the responsibility is upon such to faithfully serve God and Christ Jesus. The responsibility begins with the beginning of knowledge of Jehovah and his purpose. (Ps. 18:44) He now affords them an opportunity to choose whom they will serve. Therefore he causes his witnesses to bear testimony in their hearing that they may choose to take their place on the Lord’s side and live, or remain on Satan’s side and die. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.—Ps. 97:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah has not written his Word as men write. It has pleased him to write some in one place and some in another, that only those who devote themselves to Jehovah wholly and completely can understand the same. It is only those made righteous by full faith and obedience unto God and Christ Jesus and who humbly continue in the right way that will now understand. “Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good.” (Prov. 14:22) Not truth, but “light” is sown for the righteous. God’s Word is truth, and is published freely that all may get ahold of it who seek it. Jehovah causes the glory of his light to shine upon his Word, and that light is for the righteous. These are the ones who understand. These are in the temple and are righteous because under the “robe of righteousness”. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.—Matt. 25:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If one thinks to treat lightly the small things committed to him to do because they are of small moment, such is a tendency to unfaithfulness. Fidelity to the Lord requires one to exercise great care and thoroughness in performing duty or discharging an obligation in the Lord’s organization, however small it may appear to be. If you are assigned to a duty and you say, That is such a small, insignificant matter I will let someone else do it, such is a lack of appreciation of serving the Lord and a lack of fidelity and faithfulness. Honesty, integrity and the discharge of obligation or the performance of duties do not constitute character development, but such is proving whether we love God and his organization or will please self or some other creature. If unfaithful in small things it will be easy for one to be negligent and unfaithful in matters of importance. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; hut let us watch and be sober.—1 Thess. 5:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do not now permit yourselves to fall asleep, but be on the lookout and ready, watchful and anxious at all times to have part in the service and to well care for the kingdom interests which the Lord has committed into the hand of the “faithful and wise servant”. At all times and under all circumstances resist the Devil and let your forehead be as adamant against the enemy, and firmly stand in the Lord and for his kingdom. Such faithful ones will not be indifferent to an opportunity of service, but will be eager to grasp the opportunity to joyfully perform the duties accompanying it. Instead of being in confusion, like drunken men who imbibe the wine of the Devil’s organization, the faithful will be sober and watch. They will ‘drink the wine of joy of the Lord new in the kingdom’, because it is here. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/36</span></p>

This taking possession by Christ Jesus was foreshadowed when King David brought Edom into subjection to the typical kingdom of God. Modern Edomites have exercised power over many peoples, but all those who forsake that wicked organization and turn to the Lord will come under control of God’s kingdom under Christ and be in line for the blessings which Jehovah promises.

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah having commanded his chosen people to keep the feast of unleavened bread and of Pentecost and of tabernacles, the antitypical fulfillment of such prophetic feasts (including the feast of tabernacles) must be performed while the remnant are on the earth and those who participate with them in the last feast are the great multitude. None of all the nations aside from the great multitude do participate in that feast. The remnant and great multitude must continually celebrate that feast when once begun. They must do it “from year to year” (vs. 16), which means all the time, rejoicing and praising Jehovah. The dead who will be resurrected and given an opportunity for life shall have a blessing only if they come up to God’s organization and worship the King.

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God has now risen up by his representative, Christ Jesus. His “strange work” is now in progress. Surely the fight now being made against the modern-day Philistines by the proclamation of the truth is like “a flood of waters” and is God’s work. It seems very strange work to many, particularly those who have not an understanding of his prophecies. That work of Jehovah will, as he states, completely expose to view the great lies of modern Philistines and will enable those of honest heart to break away from the powerful influence of the devil-religionists and take their stand on the side of Jehovah and his organization. That fight described, foreshadowed by the battle at Mount Perazim, is not Armageddon, but is his work done by his forces, led by Christ Jesus, which will expose and disgrace the enemy.

<p><span class="font4">The “healing in his wings” is the light, comfort, rest and protecting covering given to those who remain true and faithful to the Lord. Being healed and refreshed by the Lord, the “faithful servant” class is sent forth. The faithful go forth actively in Jehovah’s service as his witnesses. They have been released from the conditions of restraint in which they found themselves during the World War period. The faithful remnant, being released and being free to enter Jehovah’s service, did leap for joy, just as a calf that is turned loose from the stall and let free out into the pasture gambols and leaps. God’s people were stalled in Babylon and were fed on fodder found there which gave them no strength; but when set free and sent into the green pastures of the Lord, they grow up strong in Him.

<p><span class="font4">Lot received warning and fled before the city’s destruction. Likewise the great multitude must receive warning and flee to the kingdom organization before Armageddon, which will destroy Satan’s organization. Not only must they who compose the great multitude flee before Armageddon breaks, but they must abide with the Lord’s organization, seeking righteousness and meekness; otherwise they will be destroyed. This is clearly shown by what befell Lot’s wife. “In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away; and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.

Likewise Jehovah by his great Marshal, Christ Jesus, lights the battle at Armageddon for his covenant people, and the antitypical Gibeonites, the great multitude, who must be on Jehovah’s side before the fight takes place. The enemy attempts to destroy all those of the great multitude who are set free from Satan’s organization, because they have devoted themselves to God’s organization under Christ Jesus. These are preserved and taken through Armageddon. Like the Gibeonites, the great multitude are the only ones that today forsake Satan’s organization, come over on Jehovah’s side, and covenant to be servants of God and his kingdom.

<p><span class="font4">The day came for the Lord to take account with his servants and to make inspection of their building material. The one who had used the wrong material suffered loss. Loss of what? Service privileges in the interest of God’s kingdom under Christ. The approved ones being those who had used indestructible material, symbolized by the precious metals, their work of building withstands the fire and they receive a reward, their reward being kingdom interests and temple service while on earth. Such are designated the “faithful and wise servant’’ class. These also receive the reward of the “new name” which the mouth of Jehovah names. The one who suffers loss is saved “so as through fire”. It depends on how he receives his loss, and his course of action thereafter. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah suffers or permits his enemies to take their own course until it is his due time to act, and when the due time arrives the enemy must be ousted. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the modern Edomites, for many years have wrongfully assumed possession of that which belongs to the true people of God. The time to dispossess the modern Edomites is after Christ Jesus is enthroned and begins his reign. Since 1914 “the kingdom of the world” rightfully belongs to Jehovah God and his Christ, and Christ “shall reign for ever and ever”.

(Josh. 10:11, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.')</span><span class="font4"> The easting down of these great stones was an act of God, and not of man. It was a violent expression of His righteous indignation and anger against the enemy. Isaiah’s prophecy says nothing about Jehovah’s being wroth at Mount Perazim, but expressly mentions his wrath (or anger violently expressed) at Gibeon. David’s fight against the Philistines at Mount Perazim pictured the war now on between the seed of the Serpent and the seed of promise. (Rev. 12:7; Obad. 1) The battles at Gibeon, the one by Joshua and the one by David, both pictured the violent expression of Jehovah’s anger against the enemy at Armageddon, “his strange act.” W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/36</span></p>

Likewise the “other sheep’’ class, whom Ebed-melech represented, ‘shall go away into life everlasting.’ (Matt. 25:46) They are shielded by the Lord and survive Armageddon, and continuing faithful they gain everlasting life. The Ethiopian was shielded because he was a eunuch, that is, one who had unselfishly devoted himself to Jehovah God. Jehovah preserved his life as a spoil to himself. Why? Because the Ethiopian had put his trust in Jehovah. The class whom he represented have not put their trust in earthly governments or men or things which symbolize men or governments.

It is God through Christ Jesus that is conducting his work; his servant is responsible to the Lord, and the Lord will determine whether that person is properly rendering service or not. What difference does it make where one serves in the Lord’s organization ?

<p><span class="font4">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is an inanimate thing (like a corporation) and can be destroyed without destroying the individuals who operate that body or corporate thing. Jehovah does a work which exposes the hypocritical religionists and their system to view, brings them into disgrace and destroys their power and influence with the people. Thus he does by causing a flood of truth like a mighty flood of waters to overflow and sweep away the lies. This is done in connection with hard, cold truths, “hail,” which his witnesses proclaim. Destruction of the religious systems appears to be a very “strange work” to those not understanding God’s purpose. After the systems are brought into the full light and exposed and the clergy that operated those systems are disgraced, they try to repudiate their titles as clergymen and claim to be common laborers.

David was instructed by the Lord at that battle that he should not begin the attack in the usual way, but that he should make a flank movement on the enemy, and then wait until he heard the signal from the Lord. That is conclusive proof that the invisible host of heaven led the fight against the enemy, in which David was the visible leader and in which the enemy was completely defeated.

Then he is saved as a member of God’s approved remnant. Such unwise character developer or builder, who joyfully lets such building be destroyed, comes ‘through the fire’ rejoicing, glad that his unwise building is gone and that fire has been the means of saving him.

<p><span class="font4">The country of the ancient Philistines was contiguous with that of the Israelites after the flesh and was subdued by David. The Philistines were allies of Edom (Esau). Both of these peoples are employed in prophecy to foretell the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and those other clergy who walk with the Hierarchy in this day. Jehovah declares his purpose to destroy all those enemies. The Ephraimite and Samaritan hybrids must be cleared out or willingly come under God’s kingdom through his royal Son Christ Jesus. Benjamin went into captivity with the royal tribe Judah and returned to Zion with it. His coming into possession of Gilead (“strong rock; heap of witness’’) pictures the blessings Jehovah bestows on those faithfully devoted to the interests of God’s kingdom. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Fulfillment of this prophecy begins sometime after 1918 and while the remnant are still on earth and before their work on earth is finished. The host of spiritual Israel was in captivity to Satan’s organization, that is, Babylon, prior to and in 1918. Up to that time they had even recognized rulers of this world, the servants of Satan, as the “higher powers”. This they did ignorantly, of course, but remained faithful and true to Jehovah. The promise is that these faithful ones shall possess the place wrongfully occupied by those who oppressed them. God takes note of those who remain true and faithful to him and in due time delivers them and gives them supremacy over their enemies and his enemies.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The blind . . . the lame and sick, . . . offer it now unto thy governor: will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the Lord of hosts.—Med. 1:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not even a human ruler would be pleased with a blind or sick sacrifice, and the one making the offering should be ashamed to be caught offering it. Certainly the Lord Jesus Christ at the temple (God’s palace or royal residence), the Governor of spiritual Israel, would not dishonor Jehovah’s name by accepting a blind, lame or sick offering. This is conclusively proved by the fact that Christ Jesus upon appearing at the temple began his final judgment with the “Levites ’ ’ and cleansed the approved ones who had shown their faithfulness, in order that such might offer an offering in righteousness, acceptable unto Jehovah. Those antitypical Levites not approved by Christ Jesus at the temple judgment have no offering to bring that is acceptable before Jehovah, and hence their offerings are rejected.

<p><span class="font4">When those of spiritual Israel consecrated to the Lord, it was necessary to make a covenant by which to show their willingness to sacrifice every earthly hope and prospect and follow in Jesus’ footsteps that they might share with him in his kingdom. Now, since his coming to the temple of Jehovah, His light, which is “sown for the righteous”, shines in the face of Christ Jesus and is mirrored to those under the “robe of righteousness” and reveals that obedience to Jehovah’s commandment is vitally essential and better than sacrifice, which is also necessary. It now appears to the anointed that there is much more to do than merely keep one’s mind upon the fact that he has agreed to sacrifice all earthly hopes and prospects. They see they have been taken out as a people for his name and that they must be zealous, energetic, in obeying his commandments.

<p><span class="font4">Now the Greater Moses is here and speaks with full authority from Jehovah. “Every soul which will not [obey] that prophet [Christ Jesus] shall be destroyed from among the people.” (Acts 3: 23) This destruction is not at the end of Christ’s millennial reign but in the fire of devastation that God sends upon Satan’s organization at Armageddon. After the Lord’s coming to the temple, the temple class is anointed and sent forth to do His service, and Jehovah forcibly reminds them, saying, “Remember ye,” in order that ye may obey. He impresses it fully upon the mind of those who have undertaken to do his service. These are in the covenant by sacrifice and in the new covenant, mediated by the Greater Moses.

<p><span class="font4">The Devil brought to bear upon Christ Jesus all his cruel and wicked agencies to cause Jesus to cease bearing the message of his Father to men. Jesus stood firm and immovable, always remaining faithful, true and steadfast, and therefore God gave to him the title “The Faithful and True”. Jesus warns his followers that they must be subjected to similar persecution. (John 15: 19, 20) God permits such wicked persecutions to be carried forward by the Devil until his time ends, and this affords to man an opportunity to prove his integrity and to prove the Devil a liar and to have a part in the vindication of God’s name. While His covenant people are passing through these terrible trials Jehovah continues to say to them: “The Lord preserveth the faithful.’’ (Ps. 31: 23) The unfaithful shall perish.

<p><span class="font4">Being in the light of the temple, ‘that day docs not overtake the faithful as a thief,’ meaning that particular part of the day when sudden destruction cometh upon those who say “Peace and safety’’. “The day of the Lord Jesus Christ’’ began even on the elect as a thief, but they awoke and hastened to obey the Lord, and after 1922 went forward in obedience to the Lord’s commandment, proclaiming his kingdom message. Thieves found breaking in at night were legally slain. Now the thieves of “Christendom”, the hypocritical religionists and the “evil servant” class, that are trying to steal the devotion and worship from Jehovah God and take the honor unto themselves, by crying “Peace and safety”, will be killed without violation of the everlasting covenant.

<p><span class="font4">The Lord’s promise is that he will carry some through Armageddon. Those few will be the ones who keep the feast of tabernacles to Jehovah’s praise. Armageddon will work an indescribable devastation of the nations. Those of all the nations who refuse to keep the feast of tabernacles by worshiping the King shall not be left, but shall be destroyed. The great multitude must joyfully obey, worship and serve Jehovah God all the time if they would be carried through Armageddon. They must prove their integrity toward God before his wrath is expressed. They must hear and learn the truth and obey it now. The obligation is laid upon Jehovah’s witnesses and all who hear to proclaim the truth from now on. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Some who mingle with the faithful anointed remnant for a time are covetous, having a desire to receive honor among men. Such ones seek to push themselves forward into what appears to them a more favorable position. That is entirely the wrong spirit and means that they are following a course of lawlessness. The Lord declares he will gather such out of his kingdom. (Matt. 13: 41) The Lord’s angels at his command do this ousting work, and these are the angels who attend upon Christ Jesus at the temple. (Matt. 25: 31) These angels doubtless perform in connection with and toward the people of God many things that they cannot see with their natural eyes or hear with their natural ears. These angels under Christ Jesus’ command have a special interest in and oversight of the faithful servants of God on earth. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">8/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jesus told the Pharisees they could not escape the damnation of Gehenna, and therefore marked them for destruction. Likewise their counterpart, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies, who resort to all manner of means to make proselytes, are condemned to the same fate. Let those who have been induced to follow and obey priests of the Hierarchy take notice that God’s law declares that it and all such perverters of truth will find their end in perdition. The people of good will, who will form the great multitude and find a place of safety, must now quickly forsake the Hierarchy and like religious organizations and flee to God’s kingdom. That time is short in which they must find safety, if they find it at all. IV </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W/l/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Remember ye the law of Moses . . . Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.—Mal. 4: 4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah gives fair warning before he executes his enemies. The Elijah to come was to be a forerunner or preparer; the Moses to come was to be the executioner. The original Elijah preceded Jehu and was therefore a forerunner of Jehu, the executioner of the wicked rulers of Israel and those who practiced devil religion. Fulfillment of the Elijah prophecy in completeness therefore precedes the execution by Christ Jesus, the Greater Jehu, of the wicked rulers and practieers of devil religion, which takes place at Armageddon. Elisha finished the work begun by Elijah and therefore was anointed and commissioned in his place to finish that work. The Elisha work in completeness began approximately in 1919. That “great and dreadful day of the Lord” is when Armageddon falls upon the world. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There are two separate and distinct things to which we must give consideration: (1) What has been </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">given </span><span class="font4">to us; and (2) what has been </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">entrusted</span><span class="font4"> to us as servants. God gives to his servants a knowledge of his Word, thereby making known to them his purposes. The Lord entrusts to his servants the kingdom interests. The Lord Jesus’ coming to the temple took place in 1918, and that marked a definite dividing point as to things given and as to things entrusted to God’s servants. Prior to 1918 all who had made a covenant with God had been given something and something was required of each one who had received knowledge of the truth. Requirements and responsibility were in proportion thereto, and faithful obedience was required of all who had received the truth.

<p><span class="font4">The “third part” is the remnant, otherwise described by the Lord as the “brand plucked out of the fire”. (3: 2) The fire tries and puts to the test every one in line for the kingdom. This is done by the great Refiner’s applying the fiery test at the temple, even as the apostle says. (1 Cor. 3: 13) Those who insist on and persistently hold on to combustible material go down with that material in the fire. Those who gladly let it perish and hold on to the Lord and his truth, looking always to his glory and honor and faithful service of him, shall be saved and ‘brought through the fire’. Those who come through the fire Jehovah rewards and uses to look after his kingdom interests, and gives the “new name”. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Those who now seek an excuse to await a more favorable time are certain to fail of Jehovah’s approval. Those who are wholly devoted to God and his kingdom will hasten to obey his commandments, and that without any delay. Their privilege is to obey God’s commandments now, knowing full well that they within themselves can accomplish nothing, but that, by God’s grace, through Christ Jesus, they will faithfully continue to do with their might what their hands find to do, having full confidence that the Lord will bring good results in his own way and time. It is not ours to determine just when Armageddon will break upon the world, but it is our duty and solemn obligation to be diligent and joyfully obedient in carrying the kingdom message to the people that those so desiring may seek safety in Jehovah’s organization.

<p><span class="font4">David established his kingdom at Jerusalem. This pictures the enthronement of Christ Jesus in 1914, and later his coming to the temple as Head over Jehovah’s capital organization. Later the temple was cleansed and all the faithful were brought into unity and have since been busy proclaiming the kingdom message. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allied clergymen are the chief ones among the wicked and were foreshadowed by the ancient Philistines. As the Philistines determined to destroy David and his people, so now the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allied clergymen are bent upon destroying the Lord’s anointed that they might prevent the kingdom of God from being established and prevent the remnant from becoming a part of that kingdom or nation.

<p><span class="font4">This does not mean that one must merely believe on God and Christ Jesus and continue so to believe until death overtakes him. It means that faithful followers of Christ Jesus will, by his grace, remain true and constant, giving to God and Christ full and complete allegiance, and immovable, unbreakable love, and thus they will remain even as they go down into death. They will be faithful to God and his kingdom when everything is serene, and faithful when opposed in service by many, and will carry on to the end. They will be faithful amid tribulation and persecution, refusing to yield to devilish influence and to compromise with any part of Satan’s organization. They will steadfastly maintain integrity even with the very last breath.

<p><span class="font4">God is light, and Christ is the light of the world; and the elect, being sons of God, are sons of light. Such are “children of the day” because they are born of God’s woman and are sons of God, upon whom in the day of the Lord Jesus Jehovah has bestowed his holy name. They are sons of the Father of lights (Jas. 1: 17), and hence brethren of the Lord Jesus Christ. They are brought forth by the Lord and exhibited to the world “for signs and for wonders”. (Isa. 8: 18) Being God’s children, they are all taught of God and continue to walk in his light. Those in darkness, spiritually speaking, rebel against the light. They delight to persecute all who faithfully tell the truth. They and their allies arc asleep as to their opportunities and privileges of knowing God and his kingdom and serving the King.

They rejoiced because they saw that the main purpose of the Lord Jesus is to vindicate Jehovah’s name, and now they had entered into the joy of the Lord, seeing that the remnant has a part in vindicating Jehovah’s name. Others among the nations observed the Lord’s favor upon the remnant, that the remnant had returned as it were from the dead after the World War and were going forth ■with greater zeal and earnestness than ever in witnessing to God’s kingdom, and thus they saw and remarked concerning God’s favor upon them.

God’s due time has come to show his favor to his organization. Hence it is written: “Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion; for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.” (Ps. 102: 13) When Jehovah sent Christ Jesus to the temple for judgment, that marked the time of the beginning of the showing of his favor to Zion. He takes pleasure in those who have remained true to him; “the Lord tak-eth pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.” (Ps. 147: 11) The people of all nations who do survive and live must in due time hear the truth and put themselves on His side.

<p><span class="font4">The prophet calls these deliverers “saviours” because they represent the Great Savior, Jehovah, and are directly associated with Christ Jesus, the Savior of the world, through whom Jehovah accomplishes salvation of those who love and serve him. “Saviours” therefore properly applies to and includes Jehovah’s remnant now on earth, just as certainly and as fully as it applied to human creatures whom Jehovah used to deliver the Israelites of old. The Lord uses the faithful members of his body in his work and counts what is done to them as unto himself. Today at Jehovah’s command the remnant go forth and ‘publish salvation’, which God provides and which is the only salvation for any creature.

They do not, however, have any part in the expression of God’s wrath, that is, the execution thereof. Vengeance belongs to the Lord. An act of God is a specific exhibition of his supreme power against the enemy. Armageddon, the battle of the great day of God Almighty, will be an act of Jehovah executed by Christ Jesus and his invisible army, resulting in complete destruction of every part of Satan’s organization. The “strange work” of Jehovah brings into disrepute and disgrace in the eyes of many the religious systems that have so long defamed God’s name, and will destroy the power of those systems over the people.

<p><span class="font4">This means, antitypically, that the feast must begin at the conclusion of the gathering of the temple company, each one of whom has made a covenant by sacrifice. (Ps. 50: 5; 2 Thess. 2: 1) When gathered to the Lord in the temple and anointed, then the remnant discerns the true meaning of the great multitude and that the gathering thereof has begun, and then the feast of tabernacles antitypically must begin. It has begun and is progressing with increasing joy. The witnessing to the great multitude must now be energetically done, and no one who loves God will now slack the hand in doing that work or cease to rejoice in this feast of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font4">The Gibeonites returned with the remnant of the Jews from Babylon to rebuild the temple at Jerusalem. They participated in repairing Jerusalem’s walls. (Neh. 3: 7) The Gibeonites and their descendants remained faithful to their covenant. Although not Israelites nor in the law covenant nor in the covenant of faithfulness, yet they faithfully served Jehovah and his house as Nethinim. In the Gibeonites, therefore, is found the beautiful picture foretelling the great multitude, who forsake Satan’s organization and put themselves under Christ as servants and work with the remnant, and thereafter continue in the service of God and Christ Jesus “day and night”, continuously, and all the time do so with joy.

Almost all were indulging in “character development”, and were giving great honor and adulation to some creatures, to some, more, and to some, less, and some were more or less committing the “sin of Samaria ’ When the Lord appeared at the temple, some quickly discerned the truths revealed by the flashes of light from the temple and which consumed the combustible material. These were glad that it was gone and that they could escape “through the fire”, and they began to build quickly of “gold, silver, precious stones”.

(Heb. 6: 4-6) Such constitute the “evil servant” class or wicked servants. Of course, in those described as wicked are included Satan and Gog and all those who were once in the light and have been turned to darkness. It includes all those who have turned against God and his kingdom. They “shall be stubble”, which the fire quickly consumes.

(1 John 4: 17, 18) Any person who is prompted to engage in the service for a selfish reason, such as a desire to be placed in a position another occupies, or with a desire to shine in the eyes of other men, shows that he possesses an impure heart and, continuing in that way, is certain to fall. Only those who are perfect in love for God and his kingdom can possibly stand, and those who love God and his kingdom will put forth every effort in obedience to his commandment to proclaim the name and the kingdom of the Most High.

Some of these are pictured by the underpriests, and others by the others of the tribe of Levi. All are Levites, but not all occupy the same place in the earthly part of God’s organization. There are no bosses in God’s earthly organization. If anyone arbitrarily assumes to boss he is almost- certain to be removed by the Lord. That does not mean, however, that no one shall transmit the instructions of God’s organization to others. The Lord is conducting his organization according to his perfect wisdom and has his own good way of directing his work.

Gibeon was even made a priests’ city. It was a high place. Likewise the great multitude is given a prominent mention in the Scriptures. Moses built the tabernacle in the wilderness; but in King David’s reign the tabernacle, together with the brazen altar, was located at Gibeon. The use of the high place at Gibeon continued until the reign of Solomon. The result to the Gibeonites in covenanting to be servants of God’s people Israel was that they were rewarded beyond their expectations in becoming the intimate servants of Jehovah’s house of worship. They did serve Jehovah. They had become proselytes to the faith of Jehovah. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">W/io </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts.—Mal. 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On coming to the temple the Lord Jesus found before him spiritual Israelites serving for selfish gain and not for the honor and praise of Jehovah’s name nor for the purpose of accomplishing his will. Such selfish service brought dishonor upon God’s name. The Lord tolerated such for a time and gave full opportunity to demonstrate their real motive or heart condition. If anyone in the temple brings a selfish, imperfect offering before the Lord, both offering and person are rejected and the offerer is ousted from the temple. Let none be so foolish as to believe that, once in the temple company, he may then pursue any kind of selfish and unrighteous course and expect to remain in the temple. Those who remain must comply with the rules the Lord has given. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/30</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Elijah . . . shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth.—Mal. 4: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The nations of “Christendom” are composed of millions of persons, many of whom profess to be God’s children, but almost all these are children of the Devil. The great multitude are those, and will be those, who gladly hear the word of truth and turn away from Satan’s organization, declaring themselves on the Lord’s side before Armageddon. Very few of the professed followers of Christ in church organizations have been turned and become true children of God. The Elisha work continues that begun by Elijah, and is used by the Lord to bring the great multitude into his fold; but by far the greater number of the human race will stay out of God’s organization and on the Devil’s side. Therefore the alternative announced by the prophecy must follow. That means the complete downfall of “Christendom”. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/36</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Now these are they that came to David to Zihlag, . . , and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war. They . . . and Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty.—1 Chron. 12:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a time of war, and the faithful remnant delight now to join battle with the hypocritical religionists. It is the time in which every one of the remnant must have on and keep on the whole armor of God. Now the Devil and all his agencies make war upon them because the testimony which they bear is borne in obedience to the Lord’s commandments and exposes to view the crookedness and hypocrisy of the religionists, the chiefest representative of the Devil on earth. In this war the great multitude, antitypieal Gibeonites, participate with the remnant. They hear the message of deliverance and in obedience to the Lord’s command take up the glad cry and say: 'Come; let all who hear come.’—Rev. 22: 17.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s.—Obad. 21, A.E.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This corresponds exactly with the picture recorded at Revelation 14: 1, which shows the 144,000 with Christ Jesus the Savior on Mount Zion. All the scriptures disclose the fact that salvation is from Jehovah and comes solely through the channel of his provision, which is his official family Zion, and that salvation comes not from any of the clergy crowd, such as the hypocritical Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Jehovah God has provided salvation, and there is no other name through which it comes save that of Christ Jesus. God’s faithful and true remnant watch out for the interests of their brethren and co-operate faithfully with one another in safeguarding the kingdom interests. The remnant, Jehovah’s faithful witnesses, take the lead over the highway and lift high the standard of Jehovah, pointing those people of good will to the way of salvation. All this the remnant do under the command and leadership of Christ Jesus, the Savior, and hence they are included in the term “saviours”.

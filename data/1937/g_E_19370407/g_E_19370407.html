<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Judging the Hierarchy by Its Fruits</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(Part 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HATEVER </span><span class="font7">else you may do, do not fail to read carefully the serial now running </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> from the pen of Judge Rutherford, entitled “Exposed”. It goes directly to the Word of God to uncover the most dreadful institution of all time. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> is glad, happy and thankful for the privilege of going along, and pointing to some of the fruits of the Hierarchy, past and present, supporting the points made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cartoons are used in this work, as well as words, because some people are thus aided to clearer conception of actual conditions. If the cartoons grieve you, because they make you laugh or cry or shudder, remember that some need to laugh, to cry and to shudder. Some appreciate them, and say so.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">It’s their river; they made it for themselves</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Here is a letter from R. B. Brickell, pioneer Jehovah’s witness in the wildest part of Australia. In a friendly note he says that he and his companions put out 800 copies of last year’s “Philistia-Catholic Action” numbers and found that “the pointed cartoons in recent issues are a big factor in arousing interest”. That is what the cartoons are for. They may be a little hard on hypocrites, and it may take some courage to put them in the hands of those that may turn out to be dogs or swine, but it was always true, and is yet, that the “sheep in the midst of wolves” are not entrusted with the job of making the wolves over into sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Brickell’s work takes him to mines and sawmills far removed from the beaten track. Lodgings are obtained c a t c h-as-c ate h-c a n, sometimes in empty and abandoned houses, sometimes as the guest of honor in places of public entertainment. Meals are a luxury. If obtained at all, all O.K., but if not, it is all part of the witness work. A bicycle is the means of propulsion, but often that has to be left behind and miles are journeyed on foot, and not infrequently in the dark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Judge Rutherford’s radio lectures have permeated the entire country. Often the most remote are most ready for the truth. The Roman Hierarchy is as bent on capturing</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Australia as it is on capturing America. Everything is rapidly getting into the hands of the Jesuits, and, once in their hands, it is never released.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Anything to Get Publicity</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">It should be borne in mind that it is the ardent desire of the Hierarchy to get publicity, and sometimes it seems as though this desire to make the headlines would permeate even those double-seamed copper-riveted domes that had their last idea twenty years ago and still place</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">implicit faith in that efficient booster of things “as is”, The Associated Press. November 12, 1936, a dispatch from Vatican City told of Pope Pius posing for a battery of 25 newspapermen and cameramen, and the next day a dispatch went out telling of the great precautions which had been made to lock the Vatican gates to prevent the news of his death leaking out when, as expected, he might die shortly. The first dispatch pulled down 4J inches of free publicity, and the second one 3 J- inches; and that was all either was for. A dispatch from Vatican City nine days later said the pope has never been confined to his bed by illness for even one hour, that his step is energetic and almost military. That one got a three-column spread, with a picture, and 18| inches more; total, 26J inches of free advertising for the Roman Catholic Hierarchy's sales department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Washington </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font7"> contains a picture of a priest administering the last rites of the church to a man at Jamaica, N.Y., after his car hit a pole. How long the man lay in the blazing sun so that a good picture could be taken glorifying the Roman Catholic church once more was not stated, but it seems as if the decent thing would have been to rush him to a hospital without taking time to get a photographer on the job. However, the present motto of the Hierarchy seems to be, “Anything to get publicity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Associated Press has been running as “news” an alleged history of the papacy, starting with Peter, who never was a pope, and ending with Pius XI. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> always wishes to help out The Associated Press in a work of this kind—the farther out the better. Hence, this issue is devoted to consideration of some things likely to be overlooked in such a story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">St. Sophia’s Cathedral was built at Constantinople in A.D. 325 from material taken from heathen temples all over the Roman empire. It thus well represents the ramshackle “religion” of which Constantine was the sponsor and which still curses the world. The Roman Catholic “religion” is merely a composite patchwork of all the heathen “religions”, and no more represents true Christianity than a tub of dirty water represents the Atlantic ocean.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Crusade</span><span class="font6"> is from a verb meaning to mark oneself -with a cross. Under cover of plausible excuse to recover the Holy Land from the Turk, the pope strove to extend his empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Crusades form one of the maddest episodes of history. Christianity hurled itself at Mohammedanism in expedition after expedition for nearly three centuries until failure brought lassitude, and superstition itself was undermined by its own labors. Europe was drained of men and money, and threatened with social bankruptcy if not with annihilation. Millions perished in battle, hunger, or disease; and every atrocity the imagination can conceive disgraced the warriors of the cross.— Foote and Wheeler, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Crimes of Christianity,</span><span class="font3"> Vol. 1, page 172.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Crusades originated in the wild but uninstructed fanaticism of the age. The great impetus they conferred on the aspirations of the Boman See was speedily discovered. The ferocity stimulated against Saracens was easily directed with augmented fury against alleged heretics within Christendom. The prospect of unlimited plunder excited greed. The taking of the cross became a duty which every prince and peer, and every renegade, murderer, and vagabond also owed to church and country for the expiation of crime. A certain number of years of crusading became the recognized penalty for the most heinous offenses, and Palestine was formally constituted the Botany Bay of Europe. By a strange mixture and confusion of ideas the service of the cross was made a punishment for malefactors; and the hewing down of Saracens assumed the same recognized status as picking oakum, or rolling shot. The white cross worn on the loose robe was as much the outward sign of a condemned malefactor as striped pantaloons or a checkered coat in modem days.— B. II. Vickers, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">History of Bohemia,</span><span class="font3"> pages 195,196.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These enterprises were chiefly stimulated by the popes, who not only profited by the Crusades, but found them an admirable expedient to stifle the growing spirit of inquiry.—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Crimes of Christianity,</span><span class="font3"> page 207.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Crusades never varied as to pattern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the voice of their pastor, the robber, the incendiary, the homicide, arose by thousands to redeem their souls by repeating on the infidels the same deeds which they had exercised against their Christian brethren. . . . (Pope Urban said:) “His (Christ’s) cross is the symbol of your salvation; wear it, a red or bloody cross, as an external mark on your breasts or shoulders. ”—Edward Gibbons’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,</span><span class="font3"> Chapter 53.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In 1095 A.D. Popo Urban II instigated the most diabolical device for the degradation of the human race the world has ever known. Called a crusade to recover the Holy Land from the Turk, it has been operated openly and secretively ever since to satiate the popes’ lust for blood, money and power.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Peter the Hermit's men abandoned themselves to “every species of grossness and libertinism&quot;—Mills, I, page 67.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They committed crimes which made nature shudder.— Michaud, I, page 73.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The scenes of female violation need not be described.— Mills, II, page 192.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Typical of the fate of Crusaders and their victims was Godfrey of Bouillon's capture of Jerusalem, when the Jews were burned alive in their synagogues and 70,000 Moslems were slaughtered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Women with children at the breast, girls and boys, all were slaughtered. . . . The mutilated carcasses were hurried by the torrents of blood into the eouit; dissevered arms and hands floated into the current that carried them into contact with bodies to which they had not belonged.—Mills, I, page 253.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The vices and disorders of the Crusaders were so disgraceful that the authors of the old chronicles blush while they retrace the pictures of them.—Michaud, II, page 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With a superstition equally cruel and fierce, the Christians searched the carcasses of the murdered Turks for golden byzants, and converted the gall which was found in their dead bodies into medicine.—Sir J. Mackintosh’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">History of England, </span><span class="font3">I, page 194.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pope Innocent III had a twinge when he accuses the Pilgrims of respecting in their lust, neither age, nor sex, nor religious profession, and bitterly laments that the deeds of darkness, fornication, idolatry and incest, were perpetrated in open day, and tiiat noble matrons and holy nuns were polluted by the grooms and peasants of the Catholic camp.—Gibbons, Chap. 60.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The toll of life was tremendous for the Crusaders as well as the Turks. Thus 300,000 had perished, mostly at the hands of their fellow-Christians, before they had accomplished anything. . . . When they heard of the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre, Germany, Italy and France sent 400,000 more men into Asia Minor, where they quickly went down under sword, disease and starvation.—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A Short History of the Inquisition,</span><span class="font3"> pages 328,330.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By the time of the Third Crusade, the magic and wonder had gone out of these movements altogether. The common people had found them out. Men went out, but only kings and nobles straggled back.—H. G. Wells’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Outline of Histoiy, </span><span class="font3">page 645.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1212 occurred a dreadful thing, a Children’s Crusade. An excitement that could no longer affect sane adults was spread among the children in the south of France and in the Ehone valley. A crowd of many thousands of French boys marched to Marseilles. They were lured on board ships by slave tradeis, who sold them into slavery in Egypt. Pope Innocent III made great capital out of this strange business and sought to whip up enthusiasm for a Fifth Crusade.—H. G. Wells’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Outline of History,</span><span class="font3"> page 646.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Whenever the pope quarrelled with anyone now, he called for a Crusade, until the word ceased to mean anything but an attempt to give flavor to an unpleasant </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Civil War.—</span><span class="font3">H. G. Wells’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Outline of History,</span><span class="font3"> page 645.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And so Innocent VIII preached a crusade against the Waldenses. Samuel Moreland, English ambassador to Savoy, an eye witness, stated: “The head and breasts of the teachens were cut off, boiled and eaten; to the most tender parts of some fire was applied; women were cut open with flints; limbs were broken and exposed to fires; nails were pulled out with pineers; men half dead were tied to the tails of horses and dragged over the sharp rocks; young women were impaled by the most sensitive parts and carried about as standards; into the mouths of living men were thrust their dissevered parts; infants were snatched from cradles and torn in pieces; young girls were roasted alive and their breasts cut off and eaten before they were dead; other men were flayed alive; brains were beaten out, roasted and eaten. . . . Famine and pestilence shared honors with crime and depravity. At the capture of the town of Marra, provisions giving out, the Crusaders butchered the inhabitants and ate their flesh.—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Inquisition, </span><span class="font3">pages 285 and 329.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Hierarchy Advocates Murder</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Some who think of the Catholic Hierarchy as holy men will wonder how they could have been parties to the Crusades. The answer is that they are not holy men. They are evil men, with no regard whatever for the Word of God. Their attitude towards the Scriptures, and all that the Scriptures contain, is seen in the statement of John Hooper, bishop of Gloucester, burned at the stake by agents of “Bloody Mary”, Roman Catholic daughter of Henry VIII, king of England, in the year 1555, in which he bore testimony to the fact that of the 311 clergy in his diocese 31 did not know where the ten commandments came from and 40 could not recite the Lord’s prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you doubt that it is a settled policy of Roman Catholic theologians to dispose of those who differ with them by the gentle art of murder, read the following, taken from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Northwest Picvieiv:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Father Marianus de Luca is a learned and able Jesuit, who, according to Mr. Frank Hugh O’Donnell, M.A., holds the important chair of the Text of the Decretals in the Gregorian University at Rome. Mr. O’Donnell is the author of a learned work, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Ruin of Education in Ireland,</span><span class="font6"> and on pages 187-195 he gives these headings, which reveal the nature of De Luca’s teaching:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The Church of Christ Has the Right of Inflicting the Pain of Death”; “As a Perfect Society the Church Must Kill”; “Killing Heretics Conducive to Truth”; “The Church Better Entitled to Kill than the State”; “The State Bound to Kill When Ordered by the Church ”; “ Not the. Amendment of the Heretic, but His Death Necessary”; “Civil Government Refusing to Kill Heretics to Be Disposed and Confiscated”; etc. And the following is quoted by Mr. O’Donnell from the same volume of De Luca’s:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The church has the right and duty to kill heretics; because it is by fire and sword that heresy can be extirpated. Mere ex-</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Crusades Led to Inquisition</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The mass murders of the Crusades led directly to the Inquisition murders. It is not generally known that the Roman Catholic church, with the full endorsement and backing of its popes, has murdered thousands upon thousands of its </span><span class="font4">OWN CHILDREN. </span><span class="font7">Yet such is the case. Honest, sincere and unsuspecting Catholics have been the victims of a systematized scheme of murder, rape and robbery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By this satanic “law” the most wicked and depraved “supporters” of the “Church” were given power over other</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370407_files/g_E_19370407-13.png" alt="" style="width:231pt;height:254pt;">
<p><span class="font3">The Hierarchy's regard for its own people</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Catholics, more decent and more honest. Rome extended her hand to the murderers and thieves, the fornicators and adulterers, and encouraged them in their dirty work with bribes and honors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While the object of the Inquisition was supposed to be to stamp out heresy, it was actually used to further the schemes of selfish men and give them opportunity to satisfy their lust and greed. Innocent girls were accused of heresy and taken to the private quarters of inquisitors, never to be heard of again. Other persons, honest and industrious, who had met with a measure of financial success, were accused of heresy by envious men in order that their property might be seized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And, remember, these unfoftunate victims of the Hierarchy’s wickedness were not necessarily “Protestants” or “heretics”. Many were decent, consistent and even devout Catholics. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The ac</span><span class="font7">cuser did not have to prove his accusation. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">victim himself would be made to &quot;confess” by torture of the most excruciating kind. Thus the apostate church destroyed its noblest children, many of whom, though tortured to death, would maintain their integrity and refuse to confess to anything they had not done, even where confession would have brought speedy relief, or a quicker death.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">Sometimes some of its</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Nor was the Inquisition merely an accidental feature of the church’s history. It continued its nefarious work for five uninterrupted centuries, pillaging, destroying, blighting, wherever it carried on. its operations. All this was done, not only with the knowledge and permission of its popes, its “holy fathers”, but with their full approval, and more, under their express direction and command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Never has this “church”, this apostate and degraded system, expressed the least regret that its history should have been so marked with all that is unholy and wicked, defenders will weakly claim that the church was influenced by the conditions surrounding it, and cannot therefore be held responsible. This is a very poor excuse, surely, for a system that claims to be infallible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nor do such apologies express the mind of that organization. It would today, if it had the chance, do what it did during those five centuries of organized murder and robbery. In fact, where-ever its influence is not counteracted by the enlightened opinion of men who have a little more of the natural humane feeling that was given to men in their creation, it is to be noted that the same course of action, only slightly changed, is being followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But, in addition to what has already been noted, consider what history tells further of the methods and means employed to torture man</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">kind into </span><span class="font7">submission. Note the official attitude </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font7">Hierarchy and its head on this subject not only in the past, but today. Rome may change in other things, but its spirit never changes. It has, from its inception in the days of aspiring and worldly bishops, ever been the most potent earthly instrument of Satan. The proofs of her wickedness are endless. The following are examples:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pope Pius X congratulated a monk, Lepicier, and bestowed the apostolic benediction upon him for writing a book in which Lepicier declared that public heretics deserve not merely to be excommunicated, but to be killed; that the power to kill belongs both to the state and to the “Church”; that the “Church” has the right to murder even repentant heretics; that these teachings should be publicly declared; that King Ferdinand III of Castile was canonized because he permitted no heretics to dwell in his kingdom and with his own hands brought wood for their burning; and that the “Church” tolerates heretics now only because it is not prudent to kill them; and that the pope has the power to depose secular rulers and absolve subjects of such rulers from their allegiance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So much for Giuseppe Sarto, Pope Pius X.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sarto died August 20,1914. Were the encyclopedias to be rewritten some day, what a change would take place in the biographies of some of these demons in human form that have so dishonored God and so misled millions of their fellow men.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Pope Innocent III</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana</span><span class="font7"> has almost a column about Pope Innocent III and “his clemency and prudence”; but others did not think so highly of him in these respects. Judge of the “clemency” of a devil that would decree as he did, that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Heretics, along with those that shelter, defend and support them, we declare to be excommunicated. As soon as any of such—this is our strict decree—becomes thus publicly excommunicated, the penalty upon him if within a year he neglect to repair his fault, is this: he is under infamy; he cannot fill public office, or share in choosing public officials; he is not allowed to give testimony in a court of justice; he is incapable of making a will bequeathing property, or of coming into possession of a bequest to himself; he cannot exact information upon any matter from others, but he must give information when asked by others. If he is a judge, his sentence is null, and no cases should be brought before him for trial. If he is a lawyer, no one is permitted to hire him. If he is a notary, the public documents that he draws up are invalid, being vitiated in their source. Priests must refuse the sacraments to such pestilential wretches, deny them Christian burial, and scorn to take their alms and offerings. . . . Neither is this law of ours to shrink from despoiling the orthodox children [of heretical parents] on any pretext of mercy whatsoever ; for in many cases, some of them, divinely sanctioned, the children must suffer temporally for their father’s fault; and, according to canon law, punishment at times is visited, not only upon the authors of crime, but upon their posterity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pope Innocent III, Giovanni Lothario Conti, so the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia</span><span class="font7"> says, “was one of the greatest popes and rulers.” Why, sure! He was a regular Hitler ahead of time. “All Christendom acknowledged the Pope’s spiritual sovereignty.” They had to, or die. Innocent III died at Perugia, Italy, July 16, 1216. It is good to know that he is stone dead. The canon law of the Roman church still embodies his decrees disinheriting even Catholic children of heretical parents. The reason for that is that the Hierarchy loves money, and any excuse to lay hands on it is a good excuse.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Gregory IX, Another “Vicar of Christ”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Gregory IX, another leading light in the history of the Roman-Hierarchy, laid down the law that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If any of the aforesaid [“heretics”] refuse to perform condign penance after they have been apprehended, they are to be shut up in prison for life.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark62">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perhaps fearing that he had not made himself plain enough, this spokesman for the Hierarchy went on to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not fitting that the Apostolic See should withhold its hand from bloodshed, lest it fail in its guardianship of the people of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This direct incitement to murder is often quoted with approval by Catholic priests, and was so quoted by the Catholic priests Vacandard and Turmel in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Revue du Clerge Francois, </span><span class="font7">January 15, 1907.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In private life Gregory IX was Mr. Ugolino, count of Segni. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana </span><span class="font7">says of him that ‘“he canonized Saint Francis of Assisi, one of the glories of the Church”. Wonder, mildly, if “Saint” Francis went along with Ugolino’s ideas of imprisoning for life, or murdering, those that disagreed with him.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>“Saint” Thomas Aquinas</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">In </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana</span><span class="font7"> there are accounts of two persons called Saint Thomas. One of these, selected by the Lord Jesus Ohrist himself, and loved by all God’s people as a true witness of the Son of God, received a grand total of 50 lines of comment. But the other Saint Thomas, written up by William Turner, professor of philosophy in the Catholic University, received 420 lines, in this </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">so</span><span class="font7"> fair and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">so </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">American </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Turner thought, while he was writing up “Saint” Thomas Aquinas, the star theologian of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, he would better do a good job at it, and for fear some might overlook the idea that the writer of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Summa Theo-logica,</span><span class="font7"> standard and supreme textbook in every Catholic theological school in the world, was an A No. 1 saint, all wool and a yard wide, guaranteed not to rip, tear, ravel or run down at the side, he managed to call him “Saint Thomas” just 2G times in those 420 lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be sure, that is only once every sixteen lines, but as he neared the end of the story he realized that he was not batting as high as the publishers and their Jesuit friends would wish, and so he cramped it in 6 times in 22 lines. It took a shoehorn to do it, but why be a professor of philosophy if you can’t do a little job like that to save your bread ticket?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Coming back now to Mr. Aquinas (called Aquinas because he was born in Aquino, Italy): A part of the philosophy of this man (whose philosophy, by the way, is built entirely upon ideas of the Greek and heathen philosopher Aristotle, and not at all upon the words or the example of Jesus Christ), and which philosophy is and must be an integral part of the training of every well-educated Catholic priest, is, as far as those who have different opinions are concerned, merely that of any other ordinary murderer. The way he put it is thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the heretic is stubborn, the Church, despairing of his conversion, provides for the safety of others by cutting him off from the Church through sentence of excommunication, and finally by yielding him up to the secular power to be killed. (Page 25) Mr. Aquinas died March 7, 1274. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Te Deum laudamus.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Pope Nicholas IV</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The more one looks into this “Vicar” business, the more one sees that they were all murderers, as different from Christ as night is different from day. From the order to brand heretics in the face (A.D. 1157) there is a growing savagery in the decrees of the popes, marked by the years 1166, 1184, 1197, 1220, 1224, 1230, 1231, 1252, 1254, 1259, 1265, 1270, 1290,1335. It is not possible to examine all these. Just take one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Take the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ad Extirpanda,</span><span class="font7"> originally enacted by Pope Innocent IV, 1254, and repromulgated in 1259,1265, and 1290, by Alexander IV (Reinwald, count of Segni), Urban IV (Jacob Panta-leon), and Pope Nicholas IV (Gorolamo Masci). It is addressed to all the rulers of Italy and provides the following “Christ-like” treatment of those who disagreed with them:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Any one may seize a heretic, and despoil him of his property; every magistrate shall appoint an inquisitorial commission, whose salaries are to be paid by the State; no law may be passed interfering with these inquisitors; heretics who will not confess their heresy shall be tortured; the houses of heretics shall be demolished ; the confiscated property of heretics shall be divided, one-third to the inquisitors and the bishops, one-third to the city, and one-third to those who aided in the arrest and conviction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is best, in being churchy and “pious” to flavor the churchly act or the “pious” act with a chance to make a little something on the side. These popes all caught the drift of this chance to split something among the bishops, the city and the Judases, and thus popularize their murders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Gorolamo Masci checked out April 4, 1292. That's good; there is always something to be thankful for. One of his brilliant acts of “justice” was to proclaim that all obligations entered into by a person in captivity are null and void, even though oaths have been exchanged and hostages given for their performance. What a model for Hitler and subsequent “saints”!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>In the Days of the Inquisition</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The Inquisition proper began with Pope Innocent IV, Sinibaldo de’ Fieschi, of Genoa. An indulgence of three years was bestowed on informers, and as the indulgences cost nothing, any information obtained was pure 100-percent graft. The accused was at once arrested and thrown into prison. A Catholic priest then explains what happened to him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At first he was thrust into the common dungeon and there trained spies and specialists in delation (accusation by an informer) craftily beset him to beguile him into some direct or indirect acknowledgment of guilt. Should this prove insufficient, he was immured in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">durus career,</span><span class="font6"> the “cruel prison”, a foul hole in which, half starved and bound with chains, he might be expected to come to a better mind. Or if the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">career </span><span class="font6">and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">durus career</span><span class="font6"> were judged too slow, or in the event had proved inefficacious, there was left the torture-chamber of the holy monks. Into this room the victim—still legally an innocent man, be it remembered—was brought, and put to one or all of the varieties of anguish which the Inquisitors possessed abundant means of inflicting. The favorite arguments of this sort were three: greasing the victim’s feet and thrusting them into the fire; the triangular rack which dislocated the body stretched upon it; and the hoisting of the man to the ceiling by a rope about his hands, which were tied behind his back, and then letting him fall suddenly to within a few inches of the floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Though the inquisitors were forbidden to inflict torture more than once upon the same man for the extortion of a confession, the inquisitors got around that by inflicting each torture once; and when the man’s torture was continued over several days the inquisitors explained that it was not a new torture, but merely a continuation of the old. How like the Devil! how like the clergy! and how like Rome! Children were encouraged to denounce heresy in their fathers and, when they did so, were not deprived of their share in the property of the parent they thus helped to murder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One concession for women was that they were not tortured until forty days after childbirth. So much for the “Christianity” of those that have so much to say about the sacredness of motherhood, Virgin Mary, etc.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>Butcher’s Code Still in the Canon Law</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Don’t fool yourself that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has ever given up the idea of the Inquisition, or ever will. The Devil is the father of the whole Hierarchy brood of Dagon-mitered, long-robed, lace-beskirted, reverse-collared devil-worshipers from the bishops up. The Inquisition will die with them all at Armageddon, along with their crosses, beads, scapulars and images.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A standard up-to-date law book of the Roman Catholic Church is Ferrari’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliotheca thirls Canonici.</span><span class="font7"> There you will find such propositions as the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Civil authorities, though strictly forbidden to examine the records of Inquisitorial trials, must execute under pain of excommunication the Inquisition’s sentence. . . . Heretics must be denounced to the Inquisition under pain of excommunication. . . . Heretics suffer confiscation of their property from the day on which they fall into heresy. . . . Heretical fathers lose paternal authority over their children. . . . Impenitent heretics are to be burned; this is the common opinion of the learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As late as 1864 Pope Pius IX, whose real name was Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti, denied in the most emphatic manner that man is free to embrace and profess the religion which his reason tells him is true, and denied that it is wrong for the “Church” to inflict violence. That is why Jehovah’s people have no protection in cities, towns, states and countries where officials can be brought under the influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The Roman organization is a brotherhood of murderers, torturers and detainers of God’s holy name. It will be destroyed for ever at Armageddon by the act of Almighty God. And the earth will never be a fit place for anybody to live in until that happiest of earth’s events takes place. What concord hath Christ with Belial? None; not a trace, not a shadow.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It is, of course, only’ fitting and proper, an adjustment of un-nature, that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy should appoint itself censor of manners and morals, as in the day’s of the Roman Pontifex Maximus. Down through the ages, history' records that the Hierarchy' and its head, the pope—any pope—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">personalty investigated</span><span class="font6"> every’ crime in the calendar. This personal investigation was so thorough that a person might, conceivably, jump to the conclusion that the popes and Hierarchy’ agents </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">committed every one of them personally and repeatedly.</span><span class="font6"> But, ha, ha! that’s another story’! And so, because they have the first-hand knowledge of their own actions, and the recorded history for a thousand years of personal investigation at their finger tips, they are in every way qualified to ascertain the bad effects of certain phenomena, such as lust, rape, adultery, theft, murder, treachery, war, incest, sodomy, lying, oppression, disloyalty, blasphemy, etc. A beggarly few details of several phases of this investigating work follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Adultery. Pope Alexander Borgia thoroughly investigated “adultery”. His two children were criminals of the first water, despite the effort by the novelist Sabbatini (a “prince” in the church) to whitewash the whole business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Poisoning the wealthy to get their wealth. The </span><span class="font6">above pope also “investigated” this little matter to the number of oodles of rich cardinals and such. His own death cut short his labors, with his “investigations” uncompleted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Torture, burning at the stake. Torquemada, acting as the pope’s representative, “investigated” the theory that living human creatures are leery of torture by the rack, the last, the boot, the iron virgin, etc.; he also investigated the theory, promulgated by Nero, that these same hapless creatures make good torches. In examining this high crime, he burned countless innocent people at the stake. It is rumored that the Hierarchy is not satisfied with his conclusions and will investigate again soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Murder for filthy lucre. The Inquisition ‘ ‘ investigated ’ ’ this crime on a grand scale, and the rich fell like reeds before a hurricane. The inquisitors’ only objection to approving it was that they had to give a third of the deceased’s property to the king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jew-baiting. The Roman emperors started this, and, of course, to get the truth of the matter, the pope and the Hierarchy “investigated” on a large scale, persecuting and robbing the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Suppressing freedom </span><span class="font4">OF CONSCIENCE, SPEECH,</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370407_files/g_E_19370407-14.png" alt="" style="width:229pt;height:265pt;">
<p><span class="font3">The Vatican garden</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">etc. Since the Hierarchy came into existence they have “investigated” (practiced) this crime with rigor and without mercy. Their findings have not been made public by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Slaughter of innocent men, women and children. Peter the Hermit, leader of the first crusade, took a flier at this, and so did all the other crusaders. The popes repeatedly “investigated” this high crime by declaring crusades as often as the public would allow it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tolerance. This high crime has been exposed by all the popes from Pope Constipate I till now. Louis VII of France was rebuked by Pope Alexander III because he was lenient to the Jews and unbelievers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Persecution of true worshipers. Burned Bibles and burned heretics will testify to the zeal of the popes to “investigate” this crime. They are still zealously at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The present incumbent, Pope Ambrose Ratti, is a studious man and will not swallow just everything that history records—even the Vatican history. No, sir. He is nobody’s goat. To some he will seem bullheaded, even stubborn to excess, for not relying upon the findings of his predecessors. Not on your life, so-o-o-o-o he is “investigating” these things all over again. His consuming aim is to be an authority on crime, so his censoring will be respected. Just recently, with his “pard” Benito, he “investigated” the crime of muscling in on Ethiopia and murdering countless innocent men, women and children. In Germany he is “investigating” Jew-baiting and robbery, also suppression of freedom of speech and conscience. In Spain he is “investigating” with Moorish, Italian and German troops. In the United States he is also “investigating ” freedom of speech and conscience, and expects to get Judge Rutherford off the air any time now.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It is a well-known fact that the Roman Catholic church teaches that all heretics should be put to death, and according to their dogmas everybody who is not a Roman Catholic is a heretic. Perhaps it will be of interest to know that anybody who does not accept the doctrine of “Infallibility of the Pope” is a heretic and should be put to death. This includes Catholics as well as Protestants and nonbelievers; for any Catholic who denies this doctrine automatically becomes a member of a dissenting organization known as “Old Catholics”, and, curses of curses, a dissenter is regarded as more damnworthy than a heretic. The following is from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New School and Office Webster Dictionary,</span><span class="font7"> edited by Joseph Devlin, M.A., in 1929: </span><span class="font6">Old Catholic: A member of a religious body organized in 1870 by a party in the Roman Catholic Church who refused to accept the doctrine of papal infallibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ‘&quot;Reverend Father” Julius Arthur Nieuw-</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">land, </span><span class="font7">professor of chemistry at Notre Dame University, is the inventor of lewisite war gas, claimed to be the only poison gas worse than mustard gas. The “Reverend” is very proud of his invention—as one would expect. The Devil is also well pleased with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What a wonderful heaven that would be that would have in it the De Medicis, Liguori, Dutch Schultz, and the Negro in Kentucky who killed a 70-year-old woman and turned Catholic at the gallows. Surely anybody that could stay out of such a heaven -would regard it a pleasure to stay out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At hand, from St. Peter's Boy’s School, St. John, New Brunswick, an envelope intended for use by one of the 200 students. Each lad is supposed to give a nickel or more every week. The envelope, besides containing the name, grade and amount of contribution of the pupil as his “Sacrifice for the Holy Childhood This Week”, contains the explanation, ‘We have baptized and already sent to heaven 23,324,323 abandoned infants in China, India, Japan and Africa. Help us to save more.” Just a minute! Just a minute! By what route were they sent? Were they given “Christian” baptism, followed by “Christian” strangulation by some old nun and then buried in a “Christian” limepit, or how ?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>The Flogging Department</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Brutal floggings are quite the thing at Catholic institutions; so two letters in the same mail plainly show. One from North Carolina tells of a lad, his father a Protestant, his mother a Catholic, who was being “educated” at a parochial school. He was to have appeared in some theatricals, but when the night of the event came off it stormed so badly that his grandmother, at the moment in charge of him, declined to let him go with the “Sisters” when they came for him. It stormed hard the next day also, and he was kept at home. On the day following he was assaulted in the schoolroom by fellow pupils. The “Sisters” retired and let him fight it out alone. He came home black-and-blue all over, nearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a Michigan city one of Jehovah’s witnesses has a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font7"> sign in the window next door to a Catholic church and school. All the children were forbidden to enter the premises, but some of them did so, and two older girls who came and read and were convinced received most brutal floggings, one of them literally from her father, and the other was shunned by all her playmates on orders of the “Mother Superior”, and probably that hurt worse than the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lejac Indian School, Lejac, B.C., is a nice place for boys (?). Four little fellows, all under ten years of age, all of them without caps, and one of them with only one shoe, ran away on the night of January 1, 1937, to escape the beatings for which the school is famous. They tried to get back to their Indian parents. They got within -a mile and all died of exposure, and were found frozen to the ice where they fell, victims of a Catholic “civilization”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another nice orphanage is St. Francis Orphanage for Girls, Central Avenue and Seventeenth Street, Union City, N.J. At that place a 14-year-old girl tied two sheets and a bathrobe together to try to let herself down and fell 50 feet. Imagine what a nice place that must be where a 14-year-old girl would choose that method of trying to get downstairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Kelvedon Hall Convent, Ongar, Sussex, England, is a charming place to board. Last winter a Mrs. Galavin got away in a nightdress and coat. She called at the wrong house and they bundled her into a car and took her back to the convent. She claimed that at Kelvedon Hall her things had-been taken away from her and she was put on bread and water. A witness stated that she often cried and was anxious to go back to her husband. Eight months later she made another break for liberty, fell from a window, and was killed. On one occasion within a year a “Sister” was found drowned in a pond on the grounds. The verdict was “Accidental death”. Oh, yeah ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Harry A. Jagar, 26 years a principal in Providence (R.I.) schools, has lost his job. He was canned on a motion offered by Dr. John P. Cooney (guess Cooney’s “religion”). Here is why Jagar was fired. He told an audience of parents and teachers of a visit to Cornwall, England, where he stayed at a hotel which was formerly a convent; the owner of the hotel, in making changes, discovered an old tunnel leading to a near-by monastery. That is all. That is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all.</span><span class="font7"> Fired, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in America,</span><span class="font7"> for telling </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">that.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>The Arson Department</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">It seems that it is all right to burn houses in Papua, or at least it is exactly nine-tenths right. The offender was Anthony Cranssen, Roman Catholic priest. He induced members of his “flock” to burn down three houses of Lutherans, and they did the job. The court sentenced him to five years. When it got to the high court, one of the justices of which was Mr. McTiernan (guess his “religion”), the high court explained that the priest made a mistake in pleading guilty; that when he did it he had the idea that that would keep it out of the newspapers; and that, anyway, the houses were only flimsy houses. So the sentence was reduced from five years to six months, a nine-tenths reduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Incidentally, the same court that gave “Reverend Father” Cranssen five years for arson and contemplated murder—for he sent his men armed—gave two years to a young American Lutheran missionary for tying to a stake some natives who had robbed his converts. This young man has a young and delicate wife and three small children, one of them an infant. Is it not a strange world that puts a young father in prison two years for restraining a thief, and lets off with a six-month sentence an unmarried arsonist and would-be murderer?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Believe Bishop Gleeson or not, but at the Hibernian Australian Catholic Benefit Society, Newcastle, Australia, he stated with a straight face:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Roman Catholic Church, standing on the platform of truth, liberty, justice, brotherly love, and peace, is not allied with Fascism or any other system contrary to true democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He should have said this to Mussolini, Hitler, Von Schuschnigg, and Franco, and heard them laugh. Also, it would have been nice to say it to numerous Catholic dignitaries who in recent years, and with full papal approval, have declared the “church’s” right to put opposers of Catholic teachings to death by any means that will produce results desired. And he should have said it to Judge Rutherford and all the rest of Jehovah’s witnesses, who know all about it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>The Osh! Kosh! Department</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">They are getting worse in Oshkosh. Osch! Kosch! Why, at one “church” (guess the “church”) they took in $3,000 at one affair with “wheels, pin games and that sort of thing”. The sheriff says that he posi-G’ve-ly did not hunt up the machines for the “church”, and he did not know a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">thing</span><span class="font7"> about it until two days later, when, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of course,</span><span class="font7"> it was too late to take any action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The regular gamblers of the state claim that most machines are screwed down to yield 50 percent to the gamblers and 50 percent to the house; in select locations the gambler may even get 75 percent. But when the machines are rented to “churches” they are screwed down so that the “church” gets 90 percent and the “sucker” gets only 10 percent. This is too hard on the Catholic population. They are entitled to a run for their money, and it is no wonder some of the suckers squealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Verplank, N.Y., one priest walloped the easily walloped and cowardly Ku Klux Klan, which was planning to hold a convention in that city, and which had a perfect right to do it. Want to know how he did it? It was so simple. He followed the usual lines of Roman Catholic Hierarchy procedure. The priest, “Reverend” Francis X. Doyle, made demands on the town council that the meeting be prevented, and the town council, remembering previous disorders and Roman Catholic boycotts of merchants, did as it was told. It was just as easy as that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy realizes that it is now or never in its push to control the whole world. This is, in effect, the object of the great assembly held in Rome, June 24, 1936, at which 300 of the highest dignitaries of the church were present. All the proceedings of this meeting were in strictest secrecy. The assembly is said to be the greatest of its kind in 66 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A dispatch from Callander, Ontario, stated that Mrs. Dionne was “conferring with a priest” in preparation for the birth of another child. The dispatch went on to say that the saving of the quintuplets at their birth was merely incidental as far as Dr. Dafoe was concerned. The sender of the dispatch was so anxious that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy should get some newspaper glory out of the new arrival in the Dionne family that he forgot how very anxious the Hierarchy was previously that all glory should go to Dafoe because he is a Catholic. In other words, Dafoe now has too much glory and the church not enough, hence all the stress on “conferring with a priest”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Apart from a few relics which were taken for the Holy Father and for Lourdes, without disturbing the integrity of the body, we have been able to get only a few small pieces of the incorrupt flesh of the saint.

In due time she was “sainted”.</span></p>

A bell rang and then a guy came out, with about three nightgowns on, and a lot of gold braid. They then had a procession which was a combination of a circus parade on a small scale, with a goose-step motif. After this the guy officiating had a book on a stand, with two little boys in front. He bowed and bobbed and muttered for three-quarters of an hour. Every time he changed directions a bell rang. Finally two little boys came (also in nightgowns) with two silver goblets, and filled them with wine. The guy poured both into a gold one and drank the lot. Then another bell rang and he said “Amen” and every one scrammed for the door.</span></p>

Native Missouri Benedictine Asks Catholic Societies to Sponsor His Broadcasts on Radio Stations in Different Sections of Country. Bigot's Attacks Best Answered by Plain Statement of Church’s Position. Cites Far-Flung Anti-Catholic Activities of 'Jehovah’s Witnesses’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For simon-pure bigotry, cowardice and general cry-baby inability to take it on the chin the Roman Catholic editors of America are at the foot of the class of American manhood, and Casey, of the Irish </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Register,</span><span class="font7"> is at the tail-end of the line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Trying to induce Casey of the Irish </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Register</span><span class="font7"> to render any act of justice or truth would be like trying to cleanse a sewer with a toothbrush; but because he plays'up “Father Richard Felix”, and in so doing misrepresents Judge Rutherford and all of Jehovah’s witnesses (including this paper), and because priests are supposed to have some measure of common honesty and decency in their make-up (although it often happens that such is not the case), </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> wrote Mr. Felix the following, which will, no doubt, be of interest to some, and will explain to others the significance of the colossal lie that “Father Felix Meets Challenge . . . ”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">3-10-37 Mr. Richard Felix, Pilot Grove, Mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Register</span><span class="font6"> of January 21 appears an article entitled, “Father Richard Felix Meets Challenge of Rutherford.” While the heading creates a false impression, to the effect that here is a response to Judge Rutherford’s eminently fair proposal that certain debatable subjects be considered, the article itself dispels that impression entirely. As you know, the petition calling for a debate was signed by 2,630,000 persons, and the proposal was that this debate be held over a nation-wide hook-up of radio stations, some member of the Catholic Hierarchy being appointed to represent them. It is obvious that if you are “meeting the challenge” in any sense, the method is inadequate, slow, suspicious and unconvincing. If you are anxious for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Catholic</span><span class="font6"> Action”, why not urge the acceptance of the challenge for debate and have a nation-wide hook-up ? The fact that the Hierarchy will not eome out in the open necessarily makes honest people wonder why their hesitancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You state that Judge Rutherford is an “ex-convict”. This, as you know, is a lie. The Hierarchy, together with the other clergy, framed Judge Rutherford and caused his imprisonment, using the World War as a pretext, in 1918.The case was reversed and the government dismissed it. That leaves Judge Rutherford’s record as clear as that of anyone in America. The “framing” of Judge Rutherford has become a boomerang and the clergy are now howling, just as the prophet said they would do, in Jeremiah 25: 34, 35: “Howl ye shepherds and cry ... for the days of your slaughter .. . are accomplished; and ye shall fall . . . and . . . have no way to escape.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this article in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Register</span><span class="font6"> the writer calls in question the use of the title Judge by Judge Rutherford, enclosing it in quotes; but then goes on to admit that Judge Rutherford was a judge in Missouri.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The terms “bigot” and “bigotry” are freely used both by yourself and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Register.</span><span class="font6"> The Hierarchy’s refusal to discuss their false doctrines makes them bigots of the worst type. Honest people know just how to take such terms when used by the Hierarchy or its subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You are quoted as saying, “It is futile to try to rule men like Rutherford off the air.” You told the truth that time. It probably pained you to do so. And what is more, Mr. Felix, it is wmrse than futile to lie about him, as this article does. It enables us to see why Catholics themselves have no use for Catholic papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As you doubtless know, the Catholic Hierarchy would like to kill Judge Rutherford. That, however, is also futile, because Jehovah God is his protector. He also knows, and so does every one of Jehovah’s people the world over, that the work of righteousness will succeed and the liars, murderers, thieves and other ecclesiastical racketeers will have their portion “in the lake of fire”.—Revelation 21:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You have difficulty, it appeal’s, in appraising the extent and the significance of the work being done in the earth by Jehovah’s witnesses [visibly under the direction of Judge Rutherford], You misjudge the purpose baek of the work, and the motive prompting Judge Rutherford and all Jehovah’s witnesses. This “gospel of the Kingdom” must be preached. (Matthew 24:14) Neither you nor the Hierarch}^ grasp the significance of all this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is always difficult, if not wholly impossible, for liars to understand men who are simply truthful, or to judge of their actions. You consider the work of Jehovah’s witnesses commercial and express surprise that they are willing to pay for the use of radio time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">I refute the charge most emphatically that I misrepresent the Catholic teachings. I have no desire to misrepresent anyone. The truth is far more important than the teachings of any man or organization. Concerning “purgatory” I quote from admitted Catholic authority as follows. Under imprimatur of the archbishop of New York, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font7"> Volume XII, under subhead “Purgatory”, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I. Catholic Doctbine.—Purgatory (Lat., </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">purgare,</span><span class="font7"> to make clean, to purify) in accordance with Catholic teaching is a place or condition of temporary punishment for those who, departing this life in God’s grace, and not entirely free from venial faults, have not fully paid the satisfaction due to their transgressions. . . . The souls therein detained are helped by the suffrages of the faithful, but principally by the acceptable sacrifice of the altar.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">James Cardinal Gibbons, a well-known Catholic authority, in his book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Faith of Our Fathers,</span><span class="font7"> Chapter XVI, page 205, 78th edition, says: “The Catholic Church teaches that, besides a place of eternal torments for the wicked and of everlasting rest for the righteous, there exists in the next life a middle state of temporary punishment, allotted for those who have died in venial sin, or who have not satisfied the justice of God for sins already forgiven. She also teaches us that, although the souls consigned to this intermediate state, commonly called purgatory, cannot help themselves, they may be aided by the suffrages of the faithful on earth. The existence of purgatory naturally implies the correlative dogma—the utility of praying for the dead—for the souls consigned to this middle state have not reached the term of their journey. They are still exiles from heaven and fit subjects for Divine clemency.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In order to find that the doctrine concerning “purgatory” is true it must appear from the indisputable evidence (1) that every man has a soul separate and distinct from the creature which we see; (2) that there is no death of the soul or creature, and only the body dies and the soul continues to live; (3) that those w<sup>T</sup>ho have died are conscious; (4) that those in “purgatory” can be aided and benefited by money contributed by their earthly friends and applied towards prayers and masses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the doctrine of “purgatory” is false, then millions of persons have been deceived and have been held in bondage by fear and have been induced to wrongfully part with their money and property and have been misled concerning life everlasting. Whether you are a Catholic or a non-Catholic, being an honest person you sincerely desire to learn the truth. Jesus says: “The truth shall make you free.” (John 8:32) You ask, How may I determine what is the truth ? Can I rely upon the opinion of man ? No; because all men are imperfect and the opinion of imperfect man is worth nothing unless that opinion is supported by what is known to be true; and for that reason it is written in the Scriptures: “Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.” —Psalm 146: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible is the expressed Word of God. That Word of God is the truth. The Bible was written to be read and understood by all sincere persons on earth at the end of the world. (1 Corinthians 10:11) We are now at the end of the world. (Romans 15: 4) The Bible was not written for the benefit of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> few only who are called “the clergy”, but for all those persons who love and desire to serve God; as stated by the apostle (2 Timothy 3:16,17): “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.” No one needs to have some person interpret the Bible for him, because the Scriptures are not</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">of private interpretation. (2 Peter 1:20) We apply the physical facts (well known to be true) to the texts of the Scriptures, and thereby readily see whether or not the same agree; and if they agree, they are true. Let God’s Word, therefore, answer each of the propositions Ijerein considered.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A dispatch from Rome says that the pope thinks he may die, as he is nearing 80. Oh, well! Probably some of the Ethiopians whose faces were burned off with the Italian gas bombs will feel that they can stand it to hear about it. They described their war as a war between Christians and Catholics, and resented the fact that the pope helped finance the Italians, and his priests blessed the Italian troops and their weapons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pope seems sorry his men started the Spanish war. He says the war is “a tragedy unequaled in history”.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font7">wanted to do so, and many a bellyache he has had since because he failed to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On November 2 the pope had masses said for victims of the Spanish civil war, which would never have arisen had he kept out of it. Seems like quite an idea, starting a war to get more people into “purgatory”, and then starting a bribery scheme to get them out of “purgatory” into heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Pastoral letters from this bunch of bishops or that bunch are as thick these days as hair on a dog. Here is one from Munich which shows the estimate the Roman Hier</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Seems like it. Where else before did almost the entire clergy of a democratic country connive with the army to break their oaths of allegiance to the government and start in to murder their own countrymen? The pope says the world’s present economic distress is due to the “moral decline of man”. Seems like it. He could have stopped all this in the very beginning, if he had archy has of the average man’s mentality. The pope and his man Hitler agree on a certain course and carry it out, and here is how the bishops put it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was a remarkable coincidence. On the morning of September 14 the “Holy Father” appeared before the Spanish refugees to pass judgment on the Bolshevists. On the evening of the same day the German Reich’s Fuehrer made an address at the party congress in Nuremberg which was broadcast to the whole world and which likewise passed judgment on Bolshevism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Theoretically the so-called “Vicar of Christ” should be a man of peace, to represent the Prince of Peace. Actually, he is nothing of the sort. The Roman Catholic Bishop Monsignor Piquet at first endorsed the World Peace Congress at Brussels, but this did not at all suit the higher officials of the Roman Hierarchy, and his superior officer, Cardinal van Roey, archbishop of Malines, publicly denounced it and forbade all Catholics to attend. He well knows that the present aim of the Hierarchy is to conquer the world for Fascism (Catholic Action) by war.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>'Vanity! Vanity! All Is Vanity!’</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">subscriber for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font7"> once an employee at the Vatican, declares having heard Pacelli (not then a cardinal) say, about thirty years ago, that even at that early date they had so much gold on hand, so much ready money, that they did not know what to do with it. Seems like it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The costliest watch in the world is a jeweled timepiece owned by the pope Pius XI, said to be worth $300,000. At a dollar a Sunday it would take 969 Irish servant girls six years to pay for the watch, and they would never wake up to how badly they were being stung in so doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lightning struck the pope’s summer residence at Castel Gandolfo and did several hundred dollars’ damage. But that is not the real thing, not yet. Wait until Armageddon comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Setting aside the value of the death (not the sufferings) of Christ Jesus, Pope Pius XI, so it is said, decided to dedicate his illness and suffering to the Almighty for “the cause of the world’s needy and sick, and for sinners”. If any other man that ever lived upon the face of the earth ever showed the infinite conceit back of that proposition, will somebody supply the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">subscriber aware of the fact that all Catholics including the popes expect to go to “purgatory” for a time wants to know why the papers advert at length to Mr. Ratti’s statement, “Some day I too shall find sweet repose in this place” (i.e., the tombs of the popes). The answer is easy. The subscriber has confused the lard with the bacon. The theory is that the lard is in for a hot time while the bacon rests in peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Figuring on the results of his next campaign for establishing Fascism and destroying democracies, Pope Pius XI is said to prevision even “greater violence soon than the civil war which is bathing Spain in blood”. That is probably true. The Roman Hierarchy has no intention of stopping until the whole world lies prostrate at its feet.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Not Enough, Even Yet</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">At Castel Gandolfo, Italy, September 15,1936, the pope admitted that after fifteen centuries of guidance ami instruction by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy “the whole of humanity has never before been in such darkness”; and that of itself brings home the truth of the prophet Jeremiah’s inquiry, “Lo, they have rejected the word of the Lord; and what wisdom is in them?”—Jeremiah 8:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a radio address on the pope’s birthday Cardinal O’Connell admitted that, after some fifteen hundred years of the world’s being compelled to listen to the claims of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">•the world now is passing through one of the most dangerous periods in human history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That being the case, almost anybody would reason that what the world needs is new and better advice and guidance than it has been having all these centuries, but, No, the cardinal says, and possibly even thinks that what the world needs is even more of what it has already had too much of; for he goes on to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Distrust and hate and suspicion would vanish if the rulers of nations would listen to the pontiff who today sits upon the throne of the fisherman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When a new pope is crowned, the moment the so-called “cardinal penitentiary” places upon his head the insignia which theoretically makes him king of heaven, earth and hell, he says, in Latin:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Receive thou the tiara adorned with three crowns and know that thou art the father of princes and kings, the rector of the universe, the vicar of Our Savior Jesus Christ, to whom is honor and glory from century to century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Protestants who try to think of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy as fellow Christians may consider, if they will, the following statement which occurred in the pope’s Christmas radio speech:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Above all, we have called attention to those real remedies of truth and justice and brotherly love of ■which the Catholic Church is the sole depository and the divinely constituted teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Rachel K. McDowell, “Presbyterian” editor of the religious department of the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font7"> tells of her visit to the pope:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The supreme pontiff is coming my way. In less than a minute he will be standing over me and I will be looking up into his face and kissing his ring. And now he is over me. I kiss his ring. I touch his hand extended. I prolong the touch a second. I wish I might never have to wash my right hand again. It seemed to me the next most beautiful thing to seeing Jesus Christ himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Greatly indebted to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">News-Week</span><span class="font7"> for the information that Rachel K. McDowell is a “Presbyterian” ; also for her statement that “Presbyterianism seems just as much a part of me as my arms or my eyes or my ears”. Wonder, mildly, if </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">News-Week</span><span class="font7"> ever heard anything about female Jesuits.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Evashenski Writes the Pope</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Cyril R. Evashenski, of Michigan, thought that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> readers might be interested in a letter which he recently wrote to the pope, and they probably will. In spots it seems rather plain of speech, but that can be forgiven. It is not nearly as bad as another gentleman, Catholic husband of a Catholic wife, who wrote in saying that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> is “a damn good paper” [whatever that may mean], that his wife “doesn’t go to church as often now as she did” and he thinks that in a couple more months, as a result of reading the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.,</span><span class="font7"> his “wife will forget all about her church”. So hear Mr. Evashenski, anyway:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dear Papa Ambrose:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thanks very much for your most welcome-back-homc invitation extended to me through your </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Michigan Catholic</span><span class="font6"> of January 23, 1936; but I have sobered up from my drunk, and I can see perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You know, in your good “Home” when I was a little boy you taught me about how we must confess our sins to the priest, or else we would not be forgiven; that the priest was the only one able to grant absolution. I believe I went only twice. You know, I just was ashamed to go to a man; it did not seem just right. Still I believed your Roman Church was the true church, as you taught me. But, of course, I must confess to the priest or burn for ever and ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Well do I remember that when a little boy about six or so, I just could not understand that Jesus was so good, so kind, and yet His Father would burn us. You got that “hell-fire” and “purgatory” and confession so imprinted on my mind that you left a deep print, a terrible scar. But I found out by getting plenty of liquor or whisky into my system that I really could laugh, and even laugh at your outfit. Of eourse, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">would sober up now and then; and then I would be awfully depressed. Hell was always in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You did a good job. Even in school I never could study properly, because your hell was always in front of me. But to no priest would I confess. My own dear father used to shake his head, seeing his boy shirk most of the time. Little did he realize what was the real cause of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then the war came; and I went to fight for ‘ ‘ God and country”, as you also taught me. I was quite sick for a few months; and I would see hell in front of me. I used to sweat, or perspire, thinking that the next moment I would be in hell-fire. I prayed to the Lord, to the saints, to the virgin Mary; but hell was there always. I was almost crazy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Well do I remember when the doctor came just before a very serious operation, and wanted to know if I wanted a priest. I said, No! This man was an unbeliever. Yet he was kind to me and cheered me up. He told me I had the stuff; said I would pull through. He thought it was queer that I, a Catholic, would refuse to see a priest. So I did well. The army was hell; never knew when you would get knocked off, besides being half-sick most of the time. But the worst thing of all was your hell-fire, and you always had one of your chaplains at hand. Honestly, I just got so bad thinking about your hell that I would walk a mile to avoid a Reman priest. You even had pretty Catholic nurses to entice me to go to mass on the hospital ship.. You had one of your priests at hand who used to talk to me. But no confession for me! And I began to argue with him. I was getting mad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Well, I got back home. War was over. Statue of Liberty that I was told was a symbol of the home of the free and of the brave—saw that when coming into New York Harbor. I just did not care if I ever saw it America was different. Home was different. I felt like an outcast. The war was not over to me, because you had that terrible hell in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I forgot to tell you that I used to pray to the Lord. Oh, how I would pray, seeking help! And, do you know, I was home a little less than a year; and one day I heard the truth, a little, mind you. Then I got some books—the Watch Tower publications—and oh, then I found out that you had fooled me, you had lied to me. Then I found out that there was no hell-fire, that one did not have to confess to a priest, that God is love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">My fellow workers where I worked thought I had gone crazy; so did my folks and my neighbors. I could not sleep. I would read the Bible all night. I could not sleep. No hell! 0 Lord, how good! oh, how kind! Lord, I will serve you. I did not care if I ever got any sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was no hell-fire; and so I was released from the prison house of fear, by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So I took the message of the Kingdom to others, to have a little part in getting some more prisoners like myself away from your “Home”, or prison. I do not want to go back to your prison home; but I will stay in my Father’s house, and see you and your gang cry, “Peace and safety!” and then see you and your gang try to escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord rescued me from that terrible condition; but there will be no way of escape for you and your gang, because everlasting destruction awaits you—the Boman Catholic Hierarchy. And everyone will know that you and your papa, the Devil, was the best gang of deceivers the world ever had. Then no more masses for the dead. No more black crows, wolves in sheep’s clothing, to lie to the people. Then no more making little children salute the flag, you old fox! You told us to fight for the cause, to preserve liberty. But I can see, so can the rest of fair-minded men, that you were a plain liar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yours truly,</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>Pinnock's Papal Diary</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Harry Pinnock is a great admirer of the Roman organization—for what it is (guess what it is), and has favored </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font7"> with what seems to be a sort of calendar or diary of the Hierarchy’s movements for the past seventeen years. So here goes. If you see anything you don’t like, it’s Pinnock’s, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font7"> time:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">1920. Pope Benedict’s New Year message to the U.S.A, praised America as champions of the same principles (14 points and League of Nations) that have been proclaimed by both President Wilson and the “Holy See”, insuring to the world justice, peace and Christian love. In 1937 we are still skeptical that the Hierarchy operates along that line in Spain or anywhere else. President Wilson visited the pope, and returned home to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1920 the papal message informed a breathless world that it was “afflicted with five plagues—Negation of authority, Hatred among brothers, Thirst for pleasure, Disgust for work, Forgetfulness of the Supernatural”. As the head of the Hierarchy, he should know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1920 the pope put the bee on the Y.M.C.A. in Italy, and after Cardinal Merry del Vai let loose a blast of hot air against them the Fascists closed or wrecked all of the Y.M.C.A.’s in Italy. The Fascists did the job to oblige the pope, as they figured they could use the “church” for their own advantage and purpose later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1923 the Italian Fascists staged moral reforms, part of the eyewash campaign after bloody terrorism. They demanded and enforced long skirts for women, hoping to impress the Vatican. When rapprochement failed, the opposite policy was carried on without restraint, and the pope issued a statement that the Fascists </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">encouraged</span><span class="font6"> immorality.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>Jezebel’s Kalsomining Operations</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">In 1923, getting up to the window and powdering over the marks of centuries-old harlotry with the kings of the earth, Madame Hierarchy began to impress the world with her “virtue”. “Father” Francisco Marin Calasanez, Catholic “noble” of Madrid, placed in his church photographs of Queen Victoria of‘Spain and of other titled ladies of the Spanish court, and denounced their decollete dresses as “shockingly immoral”. The ladies displayed their ankles in the photos, and were not muffled to the ears like nuns. Everyone was disgusted with this piece of filthy political pantomime and indignant at the old duffer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“King” Alfonso was stampeded by the Hierarchy into attempting suppression of the photos and the newspaper editions carrying them, with the result that they received wide circulation in Spain, sick to death of the Hierarchy, and world-wide circulation wherever people are not under the Roman blight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">True brothers of the Italian and Spanish gang, clergymen representing fifteen denominations held an acid-faced powwow in Philadelphia and designed a “moral gown”, a Mother Hubbard that met with their conception of what was “nice”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1921 Emile Coue’s self-hypnotism of “Day by day in every way I grow better and better” repeated 30 times while fingering a knotted cord had millions of “Americans” laying a fine mechanical and nonmental foundation for the rosary ritual, even as the Madonna theme constantly reiterated in “Anthony Adverse”, best seller in 1935-36, cunningly persuaded “Protestants” that protest and opposition to the worship of images is bigotry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1922 Cardinal Ratti of Milan, becoming Pius XI, sent Americans the message, for as many as bothered to listen, that he “admired their youthful energy and aims. I hope they will soon learn to love me”. If real Americans, without allegiance to a foreign religious power, had dreamed of the fast-maturing plot to grab political America that was being hatched on Vatican hill they might have used some of that youthful energy in scotching its brazen invasion. It’s too late now, and they know and fear it.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>Protestants No Longer Protest</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">In 1919 Senator Sherman said he feared the Vatican would dominate the League of Nations. That year the Evangelical Protestant Society was formed to wage war on the Papacy—but we haven’t heard anything yet. Some years later the Methodists of the U.S.A, planned to build a church structure on Monte Mario, overtopping St. Peter’s in Rome, but the Fascists forced them to quit—and once more, we haven’t heard anything since of “protestant-ism”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1923 the Methodist Episcopal Church competed with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to get control of the 150 million Russian church members and so profit by the collapse and destruction of the Russian Orthodox church, but the attempt was a flop for both parties. The Russians were fed up to the gills with priestcraft, stuffed “saints” and all the rest of the voodooism, and they “weren’t having some”, as the saying is, and though Rome unctuously announced in the fall of the year that union or absorption was near, it turned out to be abortion instead.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The guest in the house of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ten kings.—Revelation 17: 16.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">In 1924 the pope’s “Xmas” message exhorted men in power to “make every effort to fight the grave danger and certain injuries coming from Socialism and Bolshevism”, The smoke screen for the false separation of the nations into Catholic and Red was beginning to be whipped up. Despite the howling of the papacy about “religious persecution” in Russia, Bishop Cannon returned from Russia in 1925 with the news that “religion still flourished without any sign of espionage, interference or fear ’ ’, with Catholic priests moving freely in the streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Apparently the papacy wanted to use the Allies to occupy Russia and thus give the Hierarchy protection while it absorbed the members of the wrecked Czarist church into the “Mother” church. (Revelation 17:5) The poor Russian peasants died by the thousands resisting the attacks of the invading White armies, and finally chased them into the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Returning to Italy: In 1924 Pope Pius was greatly disturbed by the cold-blooded murder of the brilliant young Italian statesman, Matteotti, leader of the opposition in the Chamber of Deputies. But his concern was because one of the accused Fascist agents in the crime, the undersecretary Fineze, was married to the nieee of Cardinal Vantelli—and that was bringing the blood too near to the doorstep. The Matteotti murder nearly wrecked Fascism, but Mussolini saved his face by turning on the ones he had used, including Rossi and exiled them. Rossi could never get over this bit of double-crossing.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>Liars Double-Cross Each Other</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Incidentally, one of the reasons why American businessmen have been induced to support Mussolini so handsomely (until they found out that the Fascist budget was a swindle) is that many of these otherwise sane and hardheaded businessmen are dominated by Catholic priests— often through the distaff side of the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Big Business, using the prostitute press, has “sold” Mussolini to the people as the ideal strong man to bring order out of post-war chaos. Industrial tycoons with Napoleonic complexes imagine themselves in Mussolini’s brutal shoes, and so the yellow press howls about the brutal treatment of Catholic priests in Russia but ignored the reign of terror when Mussolini and his gangsters harried and killed the liberals, intellectuals and true Italians all over the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A strumpet and her buyer often fall out; and so when the concordat was made between the Italian</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">State and the Vatican, the pope said, “IFe have given baek God to Italy and Italy to God” [italics ours], which was a lot of hokum to the Italian laborer starving in the lowest-paid industries of Europe, and devilish blasphemy to anyone who knows of Jehovah’s purposes and the Devil’s counterfeit kingdom. Mussolini thought it was hokum, too, and in a few weeks came back with ‘ ‘ We are Fascists and Catholics, but Fascists </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">first.</span><span class="font6"> The church is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font6"> sovereign in the State”. The old lady must have been pained, after all she had done for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In December, 1925, the Fascists killed a priest who refused to disband a Catholic boys’ organization, and the pope denounced Fascist rowdyism and the theory of the Fascist state—just another lovers’ quarrel.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>Wilson Under Jesuit Pressure</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">On the tenth anniversary of the United States’ entry into the World War, General Ludendorff, the brains of the German war command, stated that the American people did not declare war, but it was by Wilson’s acting under pressure from “Jews, Freemasons and Jesuits”! Which would make those three strange but not improbable bedfellows. Incidentally, Ludendorff is frankly atheistic, which in the writer’s opinion is far more hopeful for Ludendorff than for him to be a blaspheming religious fire-insurance thug in lace pants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the Versailles treaty was signed, President Wilson said that “a militaristic party, under the most influential leadership, was seeking to gain ascendancy in the councils of France”. Undoubtedly he was referring to the strong clique of Catholic military officers, that under Jesuit influence has intrigued since the days of Dreyfus, and, after the rescue of Catholicism in Spain, will be ready to attempt a military dictatorship in France to make </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font6"> safe for the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Returning to the New World, we find in February, 1926, that the old strumpet began to get the gate from a people whom she had sucked dry for centuries; the priests were ordered deported from Mexico. American Catholic leaders at the head of the racket joined with the oil interests in demanding military intervention by the United States in Mexico. The oil interests likewise feared they would lose their perpetual grab in Mexico.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>Unable to Get the Marines</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">It is bad enough when the marines are used as debtcollecting agencies, as Brigadier General Butler puts it, but for the Hierarchy to demand that American boys’ lives be spent to perpetuate the “purgatory” racket in a foreign country that is trying to kick it out is the ultimate in unadulterated gall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mexico mobilized troops to close Catholic churches and expel the keepers, and on November 16 of that year the undersecretary of state, Olds, obliged the Hierarchy by getting The Associated Press, ill-famed brass-eheck specialists, to flood the U.S. newspapers with reports of Mexican Bolsheviks moving on the Panama Canal! Again the squib was a dud, and the Navy and the Marines stayed home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The plan was for the U.S.A, to occupy Mexico, establish the American political (Farley brand of) power and commercial power and administer the country, and, of course, make the country safe for the Hierarchy. If this should startle you, gentle reader, it should also give you an inkling of why the Jesuits have been kicked out of a dozen countries a dozen times for ten thousand similar intrigues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">American labor and liberal opinion stopped the impending war to protect Catholic property, filched by the Hierarchy from the lifeblood of the natives for generations. The old strumpet had tried her wiles on a new lover for whom she has great plans, but he needed to be made over politically, stampeded into flag-saluting Fascism, doped with press-splurges showing the glory of the lace-pants boys parading to be seen of men, cajoled by sloppy sentiment put into Hollywood films under pressure or threat of boycott, and generally prepared to accept the noose, blinders and chains that she saddles her victims with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ever forward looking, she made Patrick Joseph Hayes a cardinal, in March, 1924.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>A Lather of “Morality”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Having taken it on the chin somewhat, she worked herself up into a lather of “morality”, and in 1927 the Hierarchy started its second crusade against “immoral” dress. Just some more blah, like a sodden prostitute loudly declaring her virtues when she is kicked out of a house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The obscene-minded Catholic-Fascist “morality” drive in Italy reached a new low in 1928 when two couples were arrested for kissing goodnight on the street by the light of the moon!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Speaking of dress, the Bible declares, at Deuteronomy 22:5, that for a man to wear a dress like a woman is an abomination to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment : for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the U.S.A., when a man is caught dressed like a woman he is loaded in the pie-wagon and sent to a psychopathic ward to be with all the other “queer” people. “Papa” in his dress reform should remember that charity begins at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1927 Count Della Torre, speaking for the papacy, declared the success of the morality drive, listing the longer skirts (so what?), different dancing manners (they change every month), Japanese control of prostitution (though why the Hierarchy pats itself on the back for the Japanese government’s controlling the business management of whoredom is vague to me). Then he cites stage censorship (Catholic) in the U.S.A, and England (meaning eliminating anything that would show the old harlot for what she is), and finally, the defeat of sane divorce and birth-control advocates in countries where the Hierarchy can dictate even the marital relationship of its dupes; not to mention the extramarital ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In June, 1929, the pope became temporal ruler of a state of the world. (2 Corinthians 4:4) After the preliminary courtship with the kings of the earth who are still dazed from the riot of the World War, she gracefully offers herself as the “mother of nations”. She thinks that she is pregnant with a man child that shall rule all nations with a rod of iron, and she is anxious for the union to be legalized.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Fascism Temporarily Halted</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">However, she still experiences trouble from an unwilling and self-respecting young nation; for in America in 1929 the Fascist organization that controls and terrorizes Italo-Americans, citizens or not, was dissolved, after exposure in the Senate by a few fearless men (who no doubt carefully tasted their tea ever after that). But this “dissolving” of the Fascist League of North America consisted of smacking a new label on it and calling it the “Federation of the Lictor”, with the same oath of allegiance to II Duce and Italy, and obviously the pope, as long as the love affair is kept up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To those of you out in the backwoods who think that “Lictor” has something to do with kissing the pope’s ring or licking his toe or other part of his anatomy, let us hasten to explain that a lictor was a Roman officer who acted as a strong-arm Molly Maguire for the magistrates of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1930, never able to mind her own business, and jealous of competition, the German Catholic wing of the strumpet attacked a rival peep-show, the Oberammergau Passion Players, accusing them of putting on stage effects to impress the audience. She likes to think that her remnant of medieval theater tableau, with robes, lights, incense, music, bells and mystery is the only good theater in its line. We’ve watched a few, and really prefer the show in Chinatown, New York city, where for a quarter you can see Hip Lee and Oo Long offer joss-sticks to an idol and know that this at least is not a counterfeit of the true sacrifice of the man Christ Jesus who gave His life once for mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In 1931 the pope, in an encyclical, said that Communism teaches merciless class war and abolition of private ownership. The long-suffering masses of Spain might now issue a statement charging the Catholic Hierarchy and its head with plunging Spain into bitter months of internecine strife in its revolt against constituted and constitutional government by Catholics under “The Butcher” Franco.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>Murderers Advise Permanent Peace</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">December 1930, and we find the old lady still mouthing platitude but hanging on to every nickel that she has squeezed from her prisoners. The pope’s message to the cardinals was concerning the difficulty in the way of permanent peace because of “selfishnessjealousy in the place of good will—ambitions of hegemony and domination in place of respect for the rights of the weak and small ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That last is really rich from the head of a racket that has gorged itself with the loot of the weak and small for centuries, and plans to establish its hegemony in the United States and is well along in its grab for power.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>Domestic Rows Mar Felicity</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The summer of 1931 brought another tiff between the lady and her running mate. Ambrose complained of Fascist! interference with the religious business, and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Osservatore Romano,</span><span class="font6"> Vatican sheet carrying his letter, was confiscated on the streets of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On May 28 Michele Schirru, a fruiterer, traveled from New York to Rome with the intention of presenting Benito Mussolini with a pineapple as an expression of regard; but the pineapple was combustible instead of edible, so he was executed for conspiracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mussolini dissolved the half million Catholics in the Azione Cattolica, charging it with plotting to establish Fr. Pizzardo, the undersecretary of the Vatican, as dictator in place of Benito. The old lady is always overreaching herself in her grab for power. Mussolini got real angry. Three hundred Catholic clubs were closed; also 1500 Catholic centers were closed by the prefects of the podestas or districts throughout Italy. Mussolini was going to show who wore the pants, and did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, relenting under the harlot’s reproaches, he later permitted Catholic Action in Italy as a diocesan organization, barred from political activity and “athletic” (military) training, and so for a time ended the dream of Catholic “reform” to supplant Mussolini and his gang of pirates with pappy and his gang of cutthroats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Mussolini made peace with the papacy in February, 1929, he had hoped by his concessions to gain woefully-needed prestige by the move, but no man gains respect by running with a prostitute that will hire herself to any megalomaniac in power to protect herself from the wrath of the masses whom she grinds under her feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The scarlet lady has had trouble also with her Nazi boy-frens in Germany, Von Schleicher, the head of Catholic Action in Germany, being slain in the monstrous “blood purge” of the Nazi party. This morning I read in the headlines that German Catholics cry “Pfui” at the Nazi heads for violating the concordat with the Vatican.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>Russia and Religion</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Returning home, we find that “American” Catholic Societies protested against the recognition of Russia by the U.S.A, upon Roosevelt’s taking office as president. The Hearst yellow press did its share of the yaving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this connection Sir Edmund Ovey, British ambassador to Russia, stated that “there is no religious persecution in Russia in the strict sense of the term ‘persecution’, and no case has been discovered of a priest or anyone being punished for the practice of religion ’ ’; which would seem to show that the Catholic Hierarchy has done a lot of powerful lying with its atrocity stories, trying to stir up the Allies to take over Russia while Catholic Action filled the deflated carcass of the Greek Orthodox church. Sir Edmund was right, “religion” is not interfered with, but the priests left in Russia still work to bar the carrying out of true Christianity, the worship of Jehovah and service of His incoming kingdom by His witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From 1933 to 1934 the pope decreed a “holy year”, “that men should turn their thoughts from earthly toward eternal celestial things,” meaning, of course, the brand of combined pink-dream and nightmare mixed with spiritism that the Hierarchy custodians dish out for a consideration. Everybody had a bad time during the “holy year”, and so papa wished another on them right after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The strumpet continued to have trouble with her lovers, and in February, 1933, Stegerwald, a Catholic leader in Germany, was beaten by the Nazi louts in the reign of terror. However, with Mr. Farley, the jobmaster general, extending and tightening the Hierarchy’s control in America, things began to pick up a little for her. Rapidly flag-saluting and anti-sedition bills and red-riders were slipped through the various legislative chambers despite the protests of real Americans who dared to be articulate against ruthless and punitive Catholic Action. These bills are mostly forgotten now, but not by the Hierarchy, and when the day of war-hysteria comes she will, she hopes, clamp those bills round the necks of all her enemies as she has done a thousand times in history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Her supreme effort to re-establish the unholy Roman Empire is now being made, and America is to be the backbone for it. Cardinal Patrick Hayes, made cardinal in 1924, is being groomed as successor to Pope Pius.<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark96">2</a></sup></span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>Catholic Action in Spain</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">During 1936 we have the spectacle of Catholic Action in Spain operating for weeks behind a smoke screen with the connivance of the lying press. When her cause seemed to be lost, in January 1937, we were treated to reams and reams of stuff about the agony of the pope in his illness, but after this had been worked to the limit the newspapers casually inform the world that tens of thousands of Italian and German soldiers are being hastened into Spain to help smash the Spanish government before a hands-off agreement goes into effect!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now cometh Catholic Action in the form of a Knight’s Crusade against all “isms” in the United States. The unmitigated gall of the Catholic Church in its plan to smash everything non-Catholic! The Knights of Columbus was started nominally as a benefit (guess whose) association in New Haven, Conn., and in 1933 numbered 496,128 members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has a Supreme Knight, Supreme Advocate, Supreme Physician, Supreme Chaplain, and, appropriately enough, a Supreme Warden. They are to fight “anti-Christian” groups; which means they are after groups that are anti-Catholie Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the instigation of the Hierarchy, and with their false separation of the nations into Catholic and nonCatholic, the political rulers try to crowd those devoted to Jehovah off the earth as being antisocial, in that they give testimony of another king and kingdom, Jehovah and Zion, and expose the mimic king, the Devil, and his kingdom, Babylon, with the Roman Hierarchy as the leading agents in the earth in Baal worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These base fellows, who presume to be the spiritual advisers of the nations, attempt to completely control what men shall hear from the Bible, if anything. They push aside God’s Word and witnesses in contempt, and substitute their own religious flubdubbery. They feed their population on husks, and then by propaganda, slyly put over in literature, films, theater and newspapers, attempt to impress all people with the desirability of having them as taskmasters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Devil no doubt thinks that all this is a great joke, at a time when the long-looked-for kingdom of God is even at the doors. Those duped by the “harlot” will tell you that now is the time for the Holy Roman Empire to control the world again, and that all opposition will be slain with the literal sword if necessary; that the “church” once killed all her enemies, and will do so again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of all the proud, arrogant, presumptuous and wicked ones on the face of the earth, it is those of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy that stand at the head of the goats. They are insolent and deal proudly, like lords. “Ye scornful men that rule this people . . . when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.”—Isaiah 28:14,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For a long time that devilish organization has operated falsely and blasphemously under the name of ‘God’s church’—“The” church—and has ruled and ridden many people and has schemed to control the government of the world.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>Fascism the New Brat</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The old harlot now thinks that she is pregnant with a man child that will put her in the saddle again. The brat’s name is Fascism, and by it she expects to put to the sword all that stand in the way of her wicked schemes. Power is now the great ambition, dream of world conquest, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font6"> kingdom which will keep out the kingdom that Jehovah’s witnesses proclaim at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Hierarchy, as the Devil’s chief agent on earth, is in for destruction at the hands of the Almighty God so swift and complete that it will astonish all men completely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The perusal of the calendar of a strumpet is not a pleasant job; so, to take the bad taste out of the mouth, read The Revelation, 17th chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Come hither; and I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters; with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her* fornication. . . . And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, . . . : and upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and ... I wondered . . . And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. . . . These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, . . . And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.’’</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It occasionally happens that some loudmouthed bigot spills the beans as to what are the real purposes of the Roman Hierarchy regarding the American Republic. Such is the case regarding the following letter published in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Fellowship Forum.</span><span class="font7"> It speaks for itself. “Father” O’Brien writes from Syracuse to an Italian Protestant pastor in Philadelphia:</span></p>

Roosevelt what we Catholics wanted he has most graciously invited our Cardinals, Prelates for personal talks and dinners with him at the White House, and in the interim when necessity required quick action Post Master Gen.

Coughlin. We knew Fr. Coughlin knew just what to do at the right moment and he also knew how to retire. Again our Church made itself very popular among the common people and Jews and Protestants helped to build a beautiful edifice at Royal Oak and Fr. Coughlin has gripped Protestantism 75 per cent.

<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>The Invisible Realm</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">J</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">EHOVAH’S WORD, </span><span class="font7">the Bible, calls attention to the fact that in addition to the visible </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">realm, </span><span class="font7">in which men find themselves and of which they are a part there is also an invisible realm composed of creatures which are not material, but spiritual. Not only so, but those who inhabit the spiritual or invisible realm are greatly interested in what is taking place on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The invisible realm is not composed of creatures who once lived upon earth, as many profess to believe. The Bible does not support the idea that when a human creature dies he becomes a spirit or angel. God’s Word informs men that He formed man to live upon the earth and that in due time the earth will be filled with perfect human creatures, possessed of everlasting-life.—Isaiah 45:18; Revelation 21: 3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When a human creature passes from the present life he lapses into unconsciousness, and does not continue to live in some other realm or condition. (Ecclesiastes 9:5,10) The future life, God’s Word advises, is made possible only by means of a resurrection of the dead. (1 Corinthians 15:13-18) There is to be an awakening of those who have gone into death. (John 5: 28, 29) Then those who profit by the judgments of the Lord shall be lifted up to human perfection. (Isaiah 26:9) Such will be equal unto the angels in that they will have everlasting life, but will not be other than human.—Luke 20: 35,36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The invisible realm, therefore, is not composed of the supposed “spirits of the dead’’; for the dead do not have conscious existence apart from their human organisms. Of what kind of creatures, then, does the spiritual realm consist? The invisible or spiritual realm is composed of creatures who were created for that place or condition. These the Scriptures refer to as “angels”, which include cherubim, seraphim, principalities, and powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Angels are spirit creatures, whom Jehovah God created perfect, pure and holy. They were created before man, and shouted for joy when Jehovah laid the foundations of the earth.—Job </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">38:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah himself is the supreme one in the spiritual realm. His beloved Son, called the Logos, the Word of God, -was the beginning of His creation, the first-born of every creature. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font7">was the instrument of Jehovah in the creation of all other creatures and of all things visible and invisible.—John 1:3; Colossians 1:15-17; Revelation 3:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Morning Stars</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among other names, the Son of God is called the Morning Star. (Revelation 22:16) Another mighty angel, a cherub, was also referred to as a Morning Star, or Lucifer. (Isaiah 14:12) Day Star is another designation for these mighty and exalted ones. See margin of Isaiah 14:12 and Luke 1:78; Numbers 24:17; 2 Peter 1:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Logos and Lucifer are apparently referred to in Job 38: 7 as the morning stars that sang together, while the rest of the invisible hosts are referred to as “all the sons of God” that “shouted for joy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While the names of two sons of the eternal God are thus prominently set forth in the Scriptures, the Logos was immeasurably greater than Lucifer, having by inheritance obtained a more excellent name and being the only begotten son and direct creation of the Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nevertheless, Lucifer was a glorious creature. His remarkable greatness and beauty are graphically described by two of the prophets, under figures that have to some extent obscured the full significance of the words until Jehovah’s due time to reveal the meaning.—Isaiah 14:4,12-17; Ezekiel 28:12-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will be observed that in the first of these illustrative descriptions there is an allusion to Lucifer as the king of Babylon, while in the second he is identified as the mystic “king of Tyrus”. Yet in each case it is evident that not a human king is referred to; for in the first case he is shown to have “fallen from heaven”, and in the second he is identified as “the anointed cherub that covereth” and that had “been in Eden the garden of God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The creation of man occasioned special delight among the sons of God, including the Logos and Lucifer, who “sang together” when the foundation of the earth was laid. The Logos, and in all probability Lucifer also, took part in the preparation of the earth to be the home of God’s earthly children.—John 1:2,3; Psalm 115:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Doubtless, too, all the angels watched with wonder and deep interest the development of the earth from a waste and void condition to a well-ordered and beautiful sphere. (Genesis 1: 2, 31) Then, when God said to the Logos, “Let us make man in our image,” it was to them a source of wonderment and delight to see a creature who was a material likeness of God. To men the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">thought of spirit creatures is unusual. To the angels a material creature possessed of intelligence and capable of loving and worshiping the Creator was a marvelous thing. Their perfect minds found happifying employment in considering the works of God, and they followed with lively interest the unfolding drama of earth.—Psalm 111: 2.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>The Covering Cherub</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">They wondered, no doubt, what God’s purpose with regard to man might be. They noted the appointment of Lucifer as the “covering cherub”, the supervisor of earth. Then when they heard of the instructions which God gave to Adam, it must have aroused still keener interest. They heard that Adam was told, 'Of all the trees of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.’—Genesis 2:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here, apparently, was an alternative to obedience, but with dire consequences. An alternative to obedience had not been placed before the angels. They had, as ministering spirits, and as messengers, considered it a privilege to carry out the bidding of the Almighty Jehovah. But God's dealings with man were different.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An element of uncertainty had somehow entered into the further development of the purposes of God. At least so it seemed. What if man disobeyed? What effect would it have upon the purposes of God? To what would it lead? The things which were taking place in earth were a spectacle unto the angels. It was as if they were watching a play which was being enacted before them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When Eve was formed the angels saw a further display of the manifold wisdom of God. How admirably God had timed the creation of woman from man! Adam was first permitted to feel his need of companionship. Then God gave him Eve. Here was a creature similar to and yet different from man. Surely the picture of this happy pair in their Edenic paradise must have delighted the angels.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>Temptation and Fall</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">For a time the happy pair enjoyed their Eden. The beauty of their surroundings and the occupation it furnished for their perfect minds, together with the enjoyment they found in the exercise of their powers of mind and organism, absorbed their interest. They had the privilege of precious communion with their Creator. They would hear the voice of the Lord, walking in the garden in the cool of day, perhaps toward evening, when the sun set and the darkness began to gather round. Unafraid they would listen for the voice of the Lord, when all nature seemed hushed in reverence at the presence of the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lucifer witnessed the daily occupations and joys of the innocent pair. He had much time for thought and undoubtedly his mind dwelt upon the things he had witnessed. He thought of the words 'multiply and fill the earth’ and the statement 'have dominion over all the earth’. Then he thought of the forbidden tree. What would be the result if man disobeyed—-and did not die? Lucifer himself had the power of death. (Hebrews 2:14) He was to act as executioner in the event of disobedience. He thought of this, and then of his own wisdom, power and beauty. His heart was lifted up and ambition began to find a place there. He said in his heart, “I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars [the angelic sons] of God. ... I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High !!”—Isaiah 14:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He visualized a world of perfect human creatures under his control and worshiping him. He purposed also to involve angels in his rebellion and make them his ministers and messengers. He planned to lead man to disobey God’s command and then save man’s life in spite of God’s decree that man must die. He claimed that eating of the tree would indeed make mankind “as gods” and hoped that they would acknowledge him as their benefactor and superior for leading them to increased knowledge and liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Putting his plan into effect, Lucifer presented the idea of disobedience first to Eve. He conveyed his suggestions through the instrumentality of the serpent. He intimated to Eve that she could disobey with impunity. 'You shall not surely die,’ he promised. He further suggested that Jehovah, in forbidding them to partake of the tree, had a selfish motive, fearing that they would become as wise as gods. The woman did not stop to consider that if God did thus “fear” He would not have given them the opportunity to gain this advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Falling under the temptation, Eve took of the fruit and ate. Then she took the fruit to Adam, who, realizing that Eve was guilty, and unwilling to live without her, also ate, that he might share the penalty. He forgot God and selfishly considered only himself.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>A Murderer from the Beginning</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">By the course of action taken by Lucifer he became a murderer; for he was responsible for the death not only of Adam and Eve, but of all their offspring. (John 8:44) He became Satan, the father of lies. He was the first to rise in rebellion against God. He violated the sacred trust reposed in him and betrayed the one who was his Creator and Benefactor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Adam and Eve did not escape the penalty that had been foretold. The sentence of death was passed upon Adam, the head of the race, and Eve shared in the penalty. So death passed upon all men.—Genesis 3:1-24; Romans 5:12,17-19; 1 Corinthians 15: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Certain angels joined Satan in his rebellion. These Satan organized in the same manner in which Jehovah's angelic ministers were organized.—Ephesians 1: 21; 6:12; Colossians 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan is called ‘‘Beelzebub<sup>-</sup>’, which means prince or chief of devils, thus showing that there are many spirits who are subject to him and who engage in wicked work in the carrying out of Satan’s schemes.—Matthew 10: 25; 12: 24; Mark 3: 22; Luke 11:15,18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan’s entire organization is working in direct opposition to Jehovah God, and has been doing so ever since the time of Eden. As with Pharaoh, so with Satan, final judgment and destruction are deferred to give opportunity for the declaration and manifestation of Jehovah’s power and the complete vindication of His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It came to pass [about 1,500 years after the rebellion in Eden], when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.” (Genesis 6:1,2) These sons of God were not the wicked angels that had joined Satan in his rebellion. The fact that they are called “sons of God” shows that they were at this time still in harmony with God; nor is it said that they were “wicked”. The sons of God had the power to materialize as men, and did so. They were induced by Satan to marry the daughters of men.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>After Ten Generations</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">From Adam to Noah there were ten generations. Since the time of Enos men had been calling themselves by the name of the Lord, but they manifestly did so insincerely and formal-istically, and thus only brought reproach upon Jehovah’s name. (Genesis 4: 26) With the intermarriage of angels and women, wickedness increased; and God determined to put an end to the unrighteous condition on earth, allowing 120 years for a final testimony and warning, during which time Noah built the ark and testified to the ungodly of the coming destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only did the sons of God materialize, but the fallen angels also materialized, as giants, who are designated “nephilim”, meaning “fallen ones”, thus identifying them as the fallen angels, the “sons of the Devil”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The children born to the materialized “sons of God” and their wives w<sup>T</sup>ere “men of renown<sup>-</sup>’ and “mighty men”, or “gibborim”, but are never called “nephilim”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Both the “nephilim” and the “sons of God” properly belonged to the spiritual realm. Intermarriage between spirit creatures and human creatures was contrary to God’s law.—Leviticus 19:19; 20:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The flood destroyed both the ungodly men and women and the offspring of the mixed marriages of angels and women, but did not destroy either the “sons of God” or the nephilim. Being spirit creatures, these dematerialized and escaped.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>“Spirits in Prison”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">Since the flood the “sons of God” have been “spirits in prison”. They had been disobedient, and Jehovah permitted them to be made captives by the wicked nephilim, just as in later years the Israelites were led away captive by Satan’s organization because of disobedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While the nephilim, or wicked angels, are themselves under restraint, they are not the same as the “spirits in prison”. These rebellious angels are referred to by Jude (verse 6) as “the angels which kept not their first estate [principality], but left their own habitation”. They are “reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness, unto the judgment of the great day”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostle Paul, in Ephesians 6:12, states that these wicked ones make war upon the saints. Obviously these could not be the ones to whom Jesus preached. Since the purpose of preaching is reformation, if possible, of those who hear, those to whom Jesus preached may be restored to God’s favor. These are the “sons of God” who were involved in the affairs of the world before the flood by intermarriage with the daughters of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The apostle Peter refers to these “sons of God” when he says, “For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened [in] the spirit: [in] which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.” —1 Peter 3:18-20; see </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus’ faithfulness to Jehovah God, His death and resurrection, constituted a powerful sermon. At the time of His consecration at Jordan Jesus was reckoned “dead” as far as the flesh was concerned, and his ‘quickening in the spirit’ there began. For three and one-half years He preached the Truth by word of mouth and by His consistent and constant devotion to God. His preaching to the spirits was by their observing His faithful course of action. His resurrection added great force to His preaching. It showed that faithfulness to God is not in vain.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>“He Went and Preached”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">It is entirely in harmony with the foregoing to conclude that Jesus also </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ivent</span><span class="font7"> (1 Peter 3:19) somewhere to preach to the spirits in prison. For three days He was dead, and could not, of course, go anywhere. But after His resurrection He was a divine spirit, and until His ascension there was a period of forty days, during which He could have gone, and probably did go, to preach to the spirits in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus’ preaching was not a message of hope to the nephilim. The judgment of God had long ago been entered against these wicked angels of the Devil. As Satan is to be completely destroyed (Ezekiel 28:19), the same fate awaits his angels. (Matthew 25:41) “God did not spare the angels who sinned, but having confined them in Tartarus with chains of thick darkness, delivered them over into custody for judgment.” (2 Peter 2:4, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font7"> The Common Version says they were “cast down to hell”; but the Greek does not refer to “hell”. The phrase “having confined them in Tartarus” is just one word in the Greek, and signifies degradation, deep abasement. Jude says they are “kept in perpetual </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">chains, under </span><span class="font7">thick darkness, for the judgment </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of the great </span><span class="font7">day”. (Vs. 6, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font7"> Having rebelled against </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font7">by leaving their own principality or habitation, they are confined [kept under surveillance] until the day of execution and judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There could be no hope held out to these wicked angels. Their course has been one of continued opposition to God and those who serve God. The Lord, through the apostle, warns the followers of Jesus to be on guard against the wiles of these wicked ones. “Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against wicked spirits in heavenly [exalted] places.”—Ephesians 6:10-12; see margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The wicked spirits also seek to entrap human creatures by means of mediums, necromancers and soothsayers, or by obsession. God’s people are warned to have nothing to do with these things.—Exodus 22:18; Deuteronomy 18:10; 1 Samuel 15: 23; Mark 1: 23-25,34; Matthew 8:29-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The wicked spirits seek by every means to destroy God’s faithful people, but the holy angels of God, under the supervision of His Son, are keeping the wicked ones under surveillance and hold them back from destroying the faithful. “The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.”— Psalm 34:7, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>Holy Angels</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7">The angels who remained faithful to God have been used to carry out the purposes of Jehovah. Angels appeared to Abraham and Lot, to the father and mother of Samson, and communicated with Daniel and other prophets. They guided the Israelites out of Egypt and gave them the law. They repeatedly preserved Israel from destruction, as in the case of the siege of Jerusalem by Sennacherib.—Genesis 18,19; Judges 13; Numbers 20:16; Acts 7:53; Galatians 3:19; Isaiah 63: 9; Daniel 10; 2 Kings 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ultimately all things in the spiritual realm and in the visible realm of God’s creation will be in complete harmony and will unitedly praise and serve the great Creator, Jehovah God. All things in heaven and in earth must recognize the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">great truth that </span><span class="font7">Jehovah is supreme and worthy both of angels and of men, will be destroyed, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of all </span><span class="font7">honor and praise, and must render Him and there will remain a clean universe to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">loving </span><span class="font7">and faithful obedience. All the wicked, glory of God the Father.</span></p>

You fail lo appreciate that such may be desirous of doing the fair and impartial thing. You admit that you use what influence you can to get time on the air free, and you know that the Hierarchy and its subjects have repeatedly used boycott and other unfair methods to get Judge Rutherford off the air. Unable to appreciate what fairness and honesty mean, you assume that all others are prompted by the same mean motives that actuate yourself and your fellow clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Occasionally a truthful and honest man gets mixed up in the system of the Hierarchy, and has a terrible time until he gets out, if he manages to get out alive. Priest Hogan was one that made his escape, and he said, something that is patent to every honest person, “I pronounce all Roman Catholic priests, bishops, popes, monks, friars and nuns to be the most deliberate</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">and willful set of liars that ever infested this or any other country, or disgraced the name of religion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">John 8:44, 45 explains it all fully; for what was true of those who sat in Moses’ seat then is true of those who claim to have authority in the church now: “Why,” said Jesus, “do you not know my speech? Because you cannot hear my word. You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof. But if I say the trulli, you believe me not.” We quote from the Catholic translation. You might look up the context, too. You doubtless have a copy of the Bible.</span></p>

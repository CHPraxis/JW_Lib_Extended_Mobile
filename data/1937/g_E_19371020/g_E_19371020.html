<p><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Turned on the Flashlight</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ At a spiritistic seance in The Grove, Blackheath, England, a young man 20 years of age turned on a flashlight when he suspected his mother was being imposed upon. The effect was to anger the demon, who was making use of the living cells of the body of the spirit medium, to execute his tricks. The woman was knocked to the ground, but her son swung about him with a chair and broke up the circus. A good time was had by all.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Grandma the Final Catchbasin</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ The New Y ork </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font4"> Magazine contains a comical picture of a young bride who returned to her father’s home, explaining to her father that she had quarreled with her hubby and so had come home to her mother. Her dad put his arm on her shoulder and said kindly, “I’m sorry, my dear, but she has just gone back to hers.” There was no statement as to where grandma went, so it is to be presumed that grandpa was dead.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Congratulations to Wichser</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ A dispatch from Rice Lake, Wisconsin, says that the Reverend C. F. Wichser, pastor of the Swiss Reformed church there, resigned to accept a position as cheese buyer for a Chicago firm. Congratulations, “Reverend.” It is probably a good thing for you, and the church too. Now if all the dominies could get jobs as cheese buyers, so that Jehovah’s witnesses could feed their flocks without hindrance, how nice it would be!</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Kansas Pastors Headed for the Plow</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ Kansas pastors are headed for the plow. Kansas itself adopted a sales tax and invented and made a metal token worth a fifth of a cent, to aid the operation. The tokens are about the size of a quarter, which they somewhat resemble. Result: One church alone gathered in deven in one day. And yet the 2-1/5 cents of real benefit may have been more than the dolors received. What have the pastors to tell them? Nothing useful, nothing true. .</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Scant Notice of Best Convention Ever Held</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">TT WOULD BE a pleasure to fill the -L magazine with adequate notice of the great convention of Jehovah’s people held at Columbus, Ohio, September 15-20, 1937, but the story has already been told in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio State Journal,</span><span class="font5"> five issues of which contained not less than one full page each, and one issue two pages, about this best of all conventions, and these went all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were 30,000 conventioncrs there, and these too went everywhere, telling the same story. It was the most orderly assembly of God’s people held within the memory of any now living. It had 3,000 people living in tents, trailers andhousc-cars. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation s</span><span class="font5"> artist depicts some of the scenes that caught his eye, in the stringers at the tops and bottoms of these pages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It could be reasonably said that several conventions were in progress at one and the same time. While the Englishspeaking lecturers were addressing the always-packed Coliseum (’which seats 8,500), other audiences were being addressed elsewhere on the Ohio State Fair Grounds, by speakers in German, Polish, Russian, Greek, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Italian, and Ukrainian, and there was a convention of Colored people as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were dowmtown meetings every' night at the Memorial Hall, twm miles away from the Fair Grounds, at which the “Exposed” series of lectures tvas reproduced by phonograph and questions were invited, and answered by the chairmen designated for the purpose. Model study and service meetings were held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The cafeteria arrangements were superb; the food was excellent, daintily served and low in price. Hospital, check room, nursery and parking arrangements were all that could be desired. Six hundred and sixty-six were immersed. Two-thirds of the conventioners were Jona-dabs; the “great multitude” has definitely arrived; they are glad to owm themselves the companions of Jehovah’s royal house, and to have a share in the work of the King. During the convention 107,254 books and booklets were placed with the people living within fifty miles of the Coliseum. An area of about 10,000 square miles was visited three times.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Judge Rutherford’s Addresses</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> is embarrassed because Judge Rutherford is such an industrious man! It would like to mention:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. The address &quot;Comfort”, given at Paris, August 28, a digest of which was published</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19371020_files/g_E_19371020-2.png" alt="" style="width:398pt;height:55pt;">

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio State Journal</span><span class="font4"> of September 15. The full text is available in the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society’s new booklet, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Safety, </span><span class="font4">distributed gratis at the Columbus convention.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">2. The opening address to the convention-■ers. This address dealt with the futility of human efforts and the adequacy of God’s kingdom under Christ, the protection of the holy angels and the unity that should be and is characteristic of God’s organization. An abridged text of this address appeared in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio State Journal</span><span class="font4"> of September 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. The address on Saturday, September 18, on Jeremiah 1:10. “See, I have this day set thee over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.” This address was a very important feature of the convention. A digest of its main points appeared on page 8 of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio State Journal </span><span class="font4">for September 20. Intended especially for Jehovah’s people, it was transmitted by telephone and by shortwave radio to thousands of eonventioners and other listeners in the four quarters of the earth. Cablegrams, radiograms and telegrams expressing appreciation of the thrilling message were received from representative groups in many lands.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark28">1</a></sup></span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. The public discourse on “Safety”, the high feature of the convention proper, appeared in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ohio State Journal</span><span class="font4"> of September 20, on page 9. This carefully phrased discourse, proving that religion is earth’s greatest racket, is in the hands of earth’s greatest liars, and is heading the world toward earth’s greatest cataclysm, was broadcast by 135 radio stations in the United States and by beam radio and shortwave was broadcast in Alaska, Cuba, Hawaiian Islands, Australia, Europe and other points. Reception of this address was enthusiastically acknowledged by appre-/<sup>1 </sup>eiative listeners in all parts of the earth, f</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5. The question and 'answer meeting on Monday afternoon, September 20, had to do principally with Jehovah’s organization and its work in the earth. This was greatly enjoyed by the eonventioners and will be of real assistance to them in serving Jehovah and His kingdom in an orderly and harmonious way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">6. The feature which was announced in Sunday’s address, that a week later, i.e., on September 26, Judge Rutherford would follow the “Safety” address by a very important message to the American people, broadcast ,over the same chain of radio stations, was fulfilled by the proclamation of the extraordinary</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">address which constitutes the principal article of this issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font4"> No one who thoughtfully reads this address can fail to appreciate its vast importance, or to realize what it means to declare so plainly, what all must know to be the truth, namely, that the United States government, in its legislative and executive capacities, has officially taken its stand on the side of the Devil and against Christ and His kingdom, and that now, the government having decided that the radio shall not with its consent or encouragement be used to proclaim the message of God’s kingdom, God’s organization in the earth has concluded to discontinue the use of the radio for hire and let those who prefer to remain on the side of the Devil do so to their hearts ’ content. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>&quot;Release unto Us Barabbas’*</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">It is interesting that the date, October 31, 1937, when thq Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Society officially withdraws from the radio field is the date when Michigan’s whirling dervish, “Father” Coughlin, goes back on the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The official representatives of the people of the United States have said, ‘ ‘ Release unto us Barabbas,” and they, as far as Jehovah’s witnesses are concerned, are echoing the cry of the Roman Hierarchy, “Away with them! Put them to death 1”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the convention, in connection with the address on Jeremiah, the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies </span><span class="font4">was released, containing the most recent revelations of present truth vouchsafed to His people by Jehovah through His organization. Ten thousand copies of the Author’s Edition were quickly distributed to the conventioners and eagerly accepted by them for examination and study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The convention program had given some indication of the surprise which the release of this book was to the conventioners. The</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19371020_files/g_E_19371020-6.png" alt="" style="width:401pt;height:56pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">letters J E on the program cover gave each </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font4"> an opportunity to guess what the surprise feature might be, and some were confident that it was a new book and that it had something to do with Jehovah’s enemies. Its announcement was greeted with delight and applause, none the less.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If any of the eonventioners, however, had any suspicion of still another surprise that was going to be sprung on them, they kept the matter quiet. Judge Rutherford’s announcement that the last issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> had appeared was met with a chorus of ah’s and oh’s of dismay and disappointment. When the speaker went on to say that a new magazine in a new dress would take its place, and would be available the next day on the conyention grounds, there was renewed applause. The information was real consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is difficult to say whether Judge Rutherford’s address on Jeremiah or his discourse on &quot;Safety” was the high point of the convention. But it is certain that the convention was climaxed in the address &quot;Worshiping God”, which announced the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society’s decision to withdraw from the radio field and to exert the full strength of its organization in the use of the phonograph from door to door. The reception of this information by Jehovah’s witnesses is very well set forth in the following telegram from New Haven, Connecticut, sent to the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society immediately after the broadcast:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Praise Jehovah for the stirring message on “Worshiping God”. Since the rulers of this laud, through the influence of the religionists, have spurned the opportunity of using the radio to bring the message of God's kingdom to the people, we as a company of Christians arc determined more than ever before to press the battle to the gate with the phonograph ns one of the instruments which the Lord has placed in our hands at this time in order to declare the vengeance of our God Jehovah and feed the people of good will.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Worshiping God</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3">Broadcast September 26, 1937, by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HERE is but one Almighty God, whose name alone is Jehovah. He is the Creator of heaven and earth, the Fountain of everlasting life, and the Giver of every good and perfect gift. His law is supreme, and all His ways are right. Every intelligent creature that knows and loves God worships Him in spirit and in truth. No others have His approval. He created the earth for man, and He made man for the earth, and those men who love, obey and worship God shall inhabit the earth for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To know and to worship God is of the greatest importance to men, because it is written in His Word that ‘this is life eternal, to know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent’. (John 17:3) Concerning those who shall live on the earth for ever it is written, at Psalm 66: 4: “All the earth shall worship thee.” Again it is written to those who live: “Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.”—Psalm 99: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To worship God means to be obedient to His commandments. The performance of ceremonies by men does not constitute worship of Almighty God, because such is contrary to His law. In order to worship God men must serve Him; as it is written, at Deuteronomy 6:13: “Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him.” ‘Thou shalt not bow down thyself to others.’—Exodus 20:3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The will of God is expressed in His commandments, and he who worships God is diligent to obey God’s will. Jesus Christ, the greatest one that ever , lived on the earth, said: ‘I delight to do thy will, O my God; thy law is written in my heart.’' (Psalm 40:8) When the Devil attempted to turn Jesus out of the way Jesus replied: “It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.”—Matthew 4:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus Christ marked out clearly the way of all true worshipers. He said: “I came . . . not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.” (John 6:38) AH true worshipers of Almighty God must therefore be joyfully obedient to the will of God, and concerning this it is written: “God is a spirit; and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” (John 4:24) Those who obey and serve the Almighty God shall live, and those who disobey by worshiping another shall die. Therefore it is written: “Man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live.”—Deuteronomy 8:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God commands all men who would live to worship Him by obeying Him, because He is the source of life. He commands men to worship Him in spirit and in truth; and that is not for God’s benefit, but solely for the benefit of man. God’s enemy and man’s worst foe is Satan the Devil. Long ago Satan boasted that he could cause all men to disobey and to curse God and thereby bring about man’s destruction. He declared that God could not put men on the earth who would maintain their integrity toward Him. His purpose was to bring about the destruction of mankind as a reproach upon God’s name. Therefore the opportunity is given to man to obey God and live, or to disobey and die, and those who do obey and live vindicate Jehovah’s name and His supremacy. The transgression of God’s law is sin, which results in death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first man that lived willfully violated God’s law and was sentenced to death before his children were conceived and born, and therefore by inheritance death came upon all the human race as the result of sin. (Romans 5:12) Then God sent Jesus, His beloved Son, to redeem man and to provide life through Jesus Christ and to give life to those who would believe on, obey and worship Him; and to this end it is written: &quot;For the wages of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.”—Romans 6:23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These words appear in the Scriptures: ‘ ‘ Therefore, as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift camo upon all men unto justification of life.” (Romans 5:18,19) The most important knowledge that man can gain is that concerning the true worship of the Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the vindication of His own great name, God has commanded that those who worship Him must bear testimony before others concerning ITis purpose, that others may know and learn the way to life everlasting. God has constituted Jesus Christ His great spokesman and has commanded all to obey Him; as it is written: ‘It shall come to pass that everyone who shall not obey that great Prophet shall be destroyed.<sup>1</sup> (Acts 3:23) In order that he may obey, man must have the opportunity to learn the truth of God’s Word, because, the truth is the light that guides men into the right way; as it is written: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” —Psalm 119:105.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Christ Jesus is the great Exponent of the’ truth of God, and it is such truth .that liberates man from the bondage of sin and death. When Christ Jesus was on the earth, He fully obeyed God’s commandment of truth and taught His hearers the truth, and thereby Christ Jesus established Christianity. Full obedience to God’s commandment is.uyhat constitutes one a Christian, because that is what Jesus always did and taught. Every true fol-, lower of Christ Jesus is a Christian, and upon, every Christian there is laid the obligation ta give testimony before the people of and con<sub>T</sub>. corning God’s purpose and His kingdom. .. ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What means has the Devil employed to turn the people away from God and into des: ruction? If the Scriptural answer to this question shocks you at first, I bid-yqu to bear with!’ me until I submit the proof,<sub>:</sub>It vmsshortly of Babylon to .worship a man instead of (he Almighty God. When God organized the Israelites as a people for himself every nation round about was practicing some kind of religion imposed upon them by the Devil, by which the people were turned away from the true God. It w<sup>r</sup>as then that God gave His law to Israel, in which He commanded that thq Israelites must worship Him only if they, would live; and that command extends to every human creature that shall live. (Exodus 20:2<sub>?</sub>5) The reason for the giving of God’s law to Israel is stated in the Scriptures in these words at Galatians 3:24: ‘The law was our schoolmaster to safeguard us until the coming of Christ Jesus.’ When Christ Jesus did come, the Jews had then fallen away from God’s law and had adopted a religion in the place and stead of God’s law. To those religious leaders who taught and led the people into the practice of religion Jesus said, as it is written at Matthew fifteen: ‘Why do ye transgress the commandments of God by your religious traditions? . . . Thus have ye made the commandments of God of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but .their heart is far from me.’ (Matthew 15:2-9) Even Saul, -who became. the apostle of Jesus Christ and was culled Faul, was once a practitioner of the Jews’ religion and a great persecutor of Christians,, and thus he continued until, the Lord opened, his eyes to the truth. (Acts 9:1-17; 26 : 1 22; Gala-:;:ns 1: 13-16) Thereafter Paul suffered .great persecution at the hands of religionists, <sub>:</sub> and that .persecution was because, he was a true follower of Christ Jesus. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It was the religionists that persecuted Jesus and brought about His death. It was the religionists that persecuted and killed the apostles of Jdsus. Thia the clear distinction' is only by and through Christ Jesus as a gift from Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As to whom the religionists have at all times represented, and now represent, there can be ‘ no doubt, because to them Jesus said: “Why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will ' do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. ’ ’—John 8:43,44.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Great Commandment</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">The first great commandment of Almighty God is this: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.” (Matthew 22:37) One can prove his love for God only by joyfully obeying God’s commandments. (John 14:15, 21; 1 John 5:3) Religionists have advanced the doctrine that the public officials of the nations are the higher powers, to whom all persons must be subject in regard to everything. Such claim is entirely untrue. God and Christ Jesus are the &quot;higher powers”, to whom all creatures should be obedient, and for that reason it is written in the Scriptures: “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.” (Romans 13:1) It is for this reason that the apostles of . Jesus Christ responded, when men commanded that they should not preach the gospel: “We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5:29) That rule must at all times be followed by everyone who is a true Christian. When God gives a commandment, it is not within the power of man to make and enforce a law contrary thereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptures abundantly prove that now Jehovah God, by His representative, Christ Jesus, is at His holy temple, and: this com-, mandment He gives to all the nations, as it is written at Habakkuk 2: 20: “The Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.” Why does Jehovah thus command? Because the end of Satan’s rule has come and the time of reckoning is at hand. At this time all men must signify their willingness to be on the side of Jehovah or on the side of Satan the Devil. Jehovah God has now enthroned Jesus Christ and commands all Christians in these words: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matthew 24:14) Every true Christian on the earth is now diligently making an effort to obey this commandment by telling others that Jehovah is God, that Christ is King, and that His kingdom is the only hope of the world. This commandment of the Lord must be and will be obeyed by every one who worships God in spirit and in truth. What is the purpose of obeying this commandment ? In order that the people may be informed and that they may take their stand on the side of God and His King and live, or remain on the side of the Devil and be destroyed. It is the time of judgment and testing upon the nations of the earth, which testing must immediately precede the battle of the great day of God Almighty, which battle will result in the destruction of all the wicked.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">Who must give the testimony in obedience to God’s commandment? The witnesses of Jehovah, to whom is committed that testimony. (Revelation 12:17) Who are Jehovah’s witnesses? Christ Jesus is the Great Witness of Jehovah, and one of His titles is “The Faithful and True Witness”. (Revelation 3:14) He is God’s spokesman and anointed King. The Roman governor asked Jesus: ’Are you a King?’ And in answer Jesus replied: ‘Thou sayest [You said it]; I am a King. To this end was I bom, and for this cause came I into 'the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.’ (John 18:37; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font4"> Therefore it follows that every true Christian must be a witness to the name and kingdom of God. It is such men and women, who are wholly devoted to God, that are going from house to house informing the people of and concerning God and His kingdom under Christ These are witnesses for Jehovah, and the testimony delivered by them is not given to satisfy the whims Of man, but is given in obedience to the commandment of Almighty God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah being supreme, His witnesses must obey His commandments regardless of what others may think or do. It is to be expected that the Devil would persecute and oppose such witnesses, and it is even so; and the Devil uses religionists to carry on this persecution against the witnesses of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was cruel persecution heaped upon honest men by religionists that induced the first settlers to flee from Europe and to set up in America a nation where they might worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For this reason the fundamental law of the American nation and of the states provides for the free and uninterrupted worship of Almighty God. The highest court of America has construed that law to mean that no one has a right to interfere with the people’s .worshiping Almighty God. But in recent years _ that fundamental law has been and is now being flagrantly violated by religionists. For centuries America has been known and designated “the land of the free” and as “a Chris-tion nation”, but if it ever was a Christian nation it is certain that the nation has forgotten God and has turned wholly against Him and His kingdom. What is God’s judgment concerning the nation that turns against Him? It is written, at Psalm 9:17, that all nations that forget God shall suffer destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The nation of Germany has defiantly rejected God and His King, Christ Jesus, and is now engaged in cruelly persecuting true Christians because they dare to obey God’s commandment and tell of His kingdom. The persecution of such Christians is so wicked that many have died violent deaths at the hands of religionists. Today thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses linger in dark prison cells in Germany for no offense whatsoever against man but because they have in obedience to God’s commandment met together to study His Word and to worship Him. In Greece, the very cradle of Christianity, true followers of Christ Jesus are cruelly punished and banished to penal islands because they meet together to study the Word of God and Jo worship Him. Italy, Austria and other nations have likewise declared themselves against God and His kingdom. Those are some of the nations that have forgotten God, although they claim to be Christian nations. Now I ask the people of America to bear with me a little, while I place before them some of the indisputable evidence that the American nation is against God and His kingdom and for that reason is facing destruction. This is a warning that must now be sounded to the people to the end that those people of good will toward God may flee to the only place of safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The radio is God’s product, which He has permitted men to harness and to use. God could infinediately prevent entirely the use of the radio if He so willed, but He has permitted men to show themselves against Him by the manner of using the radio. It is a well-known fact today that the radio is used chiefly to advertise things of commerce and to exalt religionists and party politics. For ten years, under adverse conditions, the radio has been used some to proclaim to the people God’s Word of truth. The proclamation of the message of God’s kingdom as He has commanded does not at all depend upon radio. When the Lord commands that this gospel must be preached from the housetops and from house to house He does not have reference to the radio. (Matthew 10:11-14,27) He has permitted the use of the radio, however, in proclaiming the gospel of His kingdom, and this manifestly for the purpose of putting a test upon the nations and the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are now in the time when the nations are before the Lord for judgment, which judgment of the Lord is dividing the people into two distinct groups. One of those groups the Lord designates as “goats”, because they are stubborn, unruly and against the kingdom of God and against His people. The other group is described as “sheep”, because their hope is centered in God’s kingdom and they show their love for Him by giving honor to His name, and by kindly ministering unto those who bear testimony concerning His kingdom. It is within God’s power, of course, if it be His will, to employ the radio exclusive</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ly for the use of proclaiming His kingdom, bitt manifestly that is not now His purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The test has been and is upon the owners' and operators of radio stations, and upon the officials of the government that have assumed control of radio, the most of whom have taken their stand firmly against the message of God and His kingdom and are therefore on the side of God’s enemy. Mark now, if you will, how this test has been applied and made manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1927 the facilities of the National Broadcasting Company were used to proclaim throughout the nation the message of God’s kingdom, and because the spokesman on that occasion used plain phrase in announcing the truth the facilities of that great corporation have ever since been closed to the gospel of the Kingdom, and this is just as the Lord foretold it would be. There has been no attempt whatsoever by religionists to show that the message then proclaimed concerning the Kingdom is wrong, but every effort has been put forth to prevent its further proclamation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Religion and religionists have always been opposed to God and His kingdom under Christ, and that opposition has been manifested from the days of Nimrod until the present hour. Religionists have influenced the great radio chains to deny their facilities to broadcast the message of Christianity, and such radio stations and religionists together have set up what they call “The Church of the Air”. Many noble-minded men who owri and operate independent radio stations, and who believe in the freedom of speech and freedom of worship, have made it possible for Jehovah’s witnesses to broadcast the message of God’s kingdom throughout the nation during the past ten years. At periods within that time more than 300 radio stations have regularly engaged in broadcasting such Kingdom message. Religionists have resorted to threats, and even to violence, to prevent the people from hearing by radio the truth of and concerning God’s kingdom. They have maliciously lied about the speaker and have misrepresented the speech delivered, and the only reason therefor is that the speech proclaims the truth of and concerning Jehovah’s purpose, which is </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 20, 1937 </span><span class="font4">now so vitally necessary for the people to hear. To be sure, all truth controverts that which is false, and it is those who follow a false course that oppose the proclamation of the truth, because they fear the truth to be heard by the people. Such religionists opposing the truth have induced many radio station owners and operators to conclude that nothing controversial shall be broadcast by them, and hence that is used as an excuse for not broadcasting the Kingdom message. But how could both sides of a great question be properly considered by the people if one side speaks out and the other is prevented from speaking? Could there be an honest endeavor to withhold the truth from the people? Certainly not; because nothing is of such great interest, convenience and necessity as the truth contained in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The political officials of the nation have taken their stand against God and His kingdom specifically, in this, that they have supported the religionists in their opposition to the proclamation of the message of God’s kingdom. Because of the violent and unjust opposition by religionists to the broadcasting of this gospel of the Kingdom at least three petitions, signed by millions of American citizens, have been presented to the public officials at Washington demanding that the people’s rights be protected. A petition signed by 2,416,141 was presented to the Congress in 1934, demanding that measures be taken to insure complete freedom of speech by radio and that religionists be restrained from interfering with the radiocasting of Bible programs. Congress made a pretense of investigating and then quickly abandoned the investigation, ignored the petition of millions of her citizens, and thereby, passively, at least, approved the wrongful methods of religionists. Political influence, wrongfully exercised by religionists, induced the Congress to spurn the Protest and Petition of the people. The great religious institution that leads in such opposition, although residing at Rome, shows an insatiable desire to rule America by the hand of a dictator, even as Germany is now ruled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Federal officials, cabinet officers, and even the president of the United States, have</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">H</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">turned a deaf ear to the appeals 6f millions of citizens that they might have the privilege of hearing by radio the message written in the Bible concerning Jehovah God and His kingdom under Christ; Three petitions were presented, all of which have been ignored, and no honest attempt has been made to grant redress and relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the official elements of the nation, by the course of action taken, have said in effect: “We are against God and His kingdom and have no desire to hear about it.” Freedom of worship, guaranteed by the fundamental law of the land, and which, above all, is commanded by the supreme Authority, the Almighty God, is now greatly hindered by the government; and thus the test has been placed by the Lord upon the nations, and the nation of America has put itself in the category of opposers to God and His kingdom under Christ. This nation, therefore, has forgotten God, but there are millions of persons within the nation who are firm on the side of God and His kingdom and who are anxious to hear the testimony concerning the Kingdom and to participate in its publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a matter of information to the people I state that during the past,ten years we have freely given to the public programs by radio which are of the most vital public interest, convenience and necessity, and we have done this in the face of great opposition, which opposition at all times has been from the religionists and their political and commercial allies. Although we have offered to pay the full commercial rate for the use of the National Broadcasting Company’s chain facilities, we have been denied that privilege because the message contained in God’s Word, the Bible, has been and is offensive to the clergy. We have, therefore, on numerous occasions employed private and independent radio stations, forming these into a network, and used them for national and international broadcasting. In this manner we have on several occasions taken the lead in transmitting simultaneously the message throughout America and to almost all the countries of the earth. We have used regularly more than 300 privately controlled radio stations to broadcast the Kingdom message. All that broadcasting has been financed and paid for at commercial rates by men and women who love God and who insist on obeying His commandments. In that period of time we have spent for broadcasting the Kingdom message upward of two million dollars and have never received one cent of pecuniary profit therefor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Religionists have for years claimed that they are trying to convert the world and make it better, but the facts are that the world has grow worse and even the people have learned , that big religious organizations have been and are operating a great racket by which the name of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are reproached and by which the people are misled and robbed of their money and of their peace of mind and joy. Religionists have taught that God tortures men in “purgatory” and in hell, and thus they have frightened many persons into their organizations and thereby extracted from them much money. Such teaching is entirely false, ffehovali’s witnesses have tried to place the truth of God’s Word before the people that the good people might have some consolation. God is not a fiend, but the God of mercy and comfort to all who obey Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our purpose in broadcasting has not been to hold up to ridicule any person, nor is it our purpose to attempt to convert the world. The Lord alone can do that. The specific com- _ mand of Almighty God, and which applies to this time, is that His truth shall be preached as a witness and as a warning to the nations and to the people. This has been done by radio ' as well as by other means. The proclamation of God’s message has been a severe test to religionists, and almost all of them, under that test have fallen entirely away from God and have taken their stand firmly against Him and His kingdom, even denying the value of the blood of Christ Jesus shed for the redemption of man. The test has been particularly severe Upon the Catholic Hierarchy. Their newspapers, as well as their leading men, have vigorously prosecuted an unjust campaign to drive the message of God’s kingdom from the air. In this they have failed. I have numerous letters, written by Catholic priests to inde-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">pendent radio station owners, demanding that they cease broadcasting anything Jehovah’s witnesses have to say. Those same priests have threatened my life and have published state-thents in the Press to the effect that I should fe'impaled on hot iron spikes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In many instances clergymen have led mobs of radical persons against Jehovah’s witnesses because those witnesses distributed to the people notices of radio programs. The same class of religionists have induced police and judicial officers to wrongfully arrest, ill-treat and punish men and women and children because they had to do with advertising such public broadcast. In such places as Lagrange, Georgia, and many towns of New Jersey, and other places, Jehovah’s witnesses, the true followers of Christ Jesus, have been severely punished and imprisoned, and for no 'reason whatsoever, except that of obeying the commandment of God to worship Him in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am not complaining of these things, but I am calling attention of the people thereto to show that freedom of worship, although guaranteed by the fundamental law of the land, js no longer possible in America,, which is conclusive proof of what is shortly to fall upon the nation; and concerning this tlje people must be warned. I am pointing out these facts to show that such are in fulfillment of the prophecy uttered by Jesus, who stated to His followers as recorded at John fifteen: (‘Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.” (Verse 20) And again, He said: “But take heed to yourselves; for they shall deliver you up to [courts] ; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten; and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them, ’ ’—Mark 13:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those very unrighteous things enumerated in-that scripture the religionists have been committing against Jehovah’s witnesses during the past ten years. Then Jesus informed followers as to the time when these persecutions would take place,‘which is, to wit, whem Christ Jesus appears for judgment and has. the nations before Him for testing.. (Mat-</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">LOC.TG&amp;£R^O, 1937 </span><span class="font4">thew 25:31-33) The facts show that the present is that time. At Matthew twenty-five Jesus points out the persecutors who have ill-treated His faithful followers, and those persecutors He calls “goats” because of their cruel conduct. To them Jesus said: ‘Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of my brethren ye have done it unto me. ’ The persecution of the followers of Christ He counts as persecution of himself. The Lord’s final judgment against such religious persecutors and opponents is pronounced in these words addressed to them: “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The broadcasting of the Kingdom message has been a great test to the religionists, and under that test they have put on their garments of opposition and thus identify themselves as against God and His kingdom and against the free worship of the Almighty. The radio, therefore, has accomplished God’s purpose, putting a test upon them. Likewise the radio has been a test to the government officials and judicial officers of the nation, who have allied themselves with ultrareligionists and who have wrongfully construed and applied commercial laws to Jehovah’s witnesses. Judge then for yourselves as to whom these religionists serve, and base your judgment upon these words written in the Scriptures: “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of siii unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?”—Romans 6:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The religious press charges that Jehovah’s witnesses .are trying to destroy all religions. Such charge is not true. The sole mission and purpose of Jehovah’s witnesses is this: To proclaim God’s Word of truth as He has commanded, in order that the people may be informed of God’s .purpose to destroy, at Armageddon everything that is in opposition to His kingdom under Christ; and that destruction will include all religions and all religionists. The Devil’s purpose is to keep the people in ignorance of . God’s purpose, and therefore to keep the people in ignorance that the people may suffer destruction,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The religious clergy, including Catholics, Protestants and Jewish rabbis, are in a conspiracy to prevent the people from hearing the message of and concerning Jehovah God and His kingdom under Christ Jesus. Abundant proof thereof appears from the mass of evidence now on file with the Federal Communications Commission at Washington, D.C. At a conference of Catholics, Protestants and Jew religionists, held this month, an ex-cabinet officer presiding said: ‘ ‘ The Conference seeks to moderate and finally to eliminate a system of prejudice which we have in part inherited and which disfigures and distorts our business, social and political relations.” This is proof conclusive that such religious clergymen are not the servants of God and Christ but are servants of God’s enemy. Such opponents have used all their political influence to induce opposition to and persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. I am giving the public this information in order that the people may see that there is no hope for them by giving support to the religionists. Their only hope and only place of safety is to seek God and Christ Jesus, serve the Lord the King, and worship Him in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On October 31 next we will cancel all contracts for broadcasting in which we are required to pay money. Thereafter such broadcasting will cease, but any radio station that desires to broadcast the Watch Towes programs of the message of God’s kingdom for the benefit of the people, we will gladly provide such programs without cost. We will cease the general broadcasting at that time, not because we have no money. All the money and all the wealth of the earth belong to Jehovah, and He can provide all that is necessary, and will do so according to His will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are not being driven from the air, but are notifying the people in advance in order that they may be prepared to receive the message of truth in another manner by which it will be brought to them. We are not ceasing broadcasting for fear of opposers, because the true followers of Christ Jesus fear neither man nor devil. The Christian fears God. We are not quitting because we cannot go on- We could continue to broadcast, if it seemed to be the Lord’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are quitting because the radio as we see it has accomplished God’s purpose. His test has been applied and after a long and fair trial has caused the religionists and allies, including political and commercial strong men, owners and controllers of many radio stations, and others, to firmly take their stand against God and against His King and kingdom. In the days of King Ahab the religionists of Israel who ruled the nation were put to a similar test. They took their stand against God, and He destroyed them by the hand of Jehu His executioner, and that foreshadowed,what Christ will do to religionists.-2 Kings 10 .-1-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today the religionists depend largely upon the radio to carry on their propaganda work and to advertise their goods, wares, and merchandise. But even with all the radio equipment and stations that could be used, religion will not survive. God has written its doom! The preaching of God’s message of warning and salvation does not depend upon radio. All the power resides in His hand, and He will accomplish His purpose in His own good way. More than ten years ago, before the Federal Radio Commission, I stated that radio should be free to broadcast this gospel of the kingdom of God under Christ because such is of the greatest public interest, convenience and necessity. I warned the Commission against ignoring or opposing the broadcasting of God’s message. That warning was not heeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Furthermore, the radio programs generally today are devoted almost exclusively to things commercial, and it is the people who have means to buy and who want to purchase that provide themselves with receiving sets. The masses of the people who have little or nothing with which to buy are unable to provide themselves with receiving sets. The great mass of the people of good will, Catholic and Protestant and nonreligionists, are of such poorer class. It is such people that will give heed to God’s Word now and to His kingdom because they seek comfort of mind and hope for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God has commanded that such persons have an opportunity to hear this gospel of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">■ Kingdom, and He has provided the means by which they' may hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostles of Jesus Christ, and others,' visited the people in their homes and there preached to them. The personal meeting of God’s witnesses with the people of good will God has always blessed and will continue to bless. His command to those who worship Him is: ‘Go to the people and tell them.’ Jesus and His apostles did that very thing, visiting the people from house to house. The personal visit to the people and the testifying to them is now a real test upon Jehovah’s wit* nesses because of opposition. All who really love God and worship Him will do their very best to obey His commandments by going personally to the people with this gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not ail of Jehovah’s witnesses can speak plainly. To meet this disability God has provided His people with thousands of sound machines by which recorded speech is reproduced. From henceforth, instead of spending millions for radio, those who love God and who are financially able to do so will use their money to provide more sound equipment and send more witnesses to the poor people of good will and thus give them an opportunity to hear the truth of and concerning Jehovah God’s gracious provision for their salvation. Two hundred fifty million books, printed in seventy different languages, are in the hands of the people, which books contain the message of God’s kingdom under Christ. Those books, together with thousands of sound machines and many witnesses calling upon the people, will enable millions of people who are of good will to learn of God’s gracious provision for them. Let all persons of good will toward God look up and rejoice because the day of deliv-. erance is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course, ultrareligionists will continue to vigorously and bitterly oppose the Kingdom message. They will cause to be enacted and wrongfully enforced many ordinances to prevent the people from hearing the truth. Many of the witnesses of the Lord will be persecuted, arrested and imprisoned for preaching this gospel of the Kingdom. But that will not deter </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER SO, 1937 </span><span class="font4">them or others in their efforts to worship and serve Jehovah God by obeying His commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Nazis and the Hierarchy now control many countries in Europe and are putting forth strenuous efforts to gain control of Switzerland, France, Great Britain, and America and other countries, and they may for a short time succeed in ruling all these countries as Germany is now misruled. The Hierarchy are impressed with the fact that they must control the world. But the witness work to the name of Jehovah God and His kingdom will go on until it is finished, and then it will stop. The religionists will then conclude that they have stopped the witness work of Jehovah, and in the language of the Scriptures will say: ‘Peace and safety is now with us’; and ‘then sudden destruction shall come upon them, and they shall not escape’. (1 Thessalonians 5:3) What shall then come to pass? At Matthew twenty-four Jesus answers: “Then shall the end come, . . . For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” (Matthew 24:14,21) That great tribulation is Armageddon, the battle of the great day of God Almighty, in which the Lord will completely destroy every nation and every person and every thing that is in opposition to His kingdom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before the flood God gave warning to the people by the mouth of His witnesses. That warning was not heeded, and the whole world was destroyed in the deluge. Before the fall of Jerusalem God sent His witnesses to the Jews and gave warning to the religionists and rulers and to the people. That warning was not heeded, and Israel was destroyed as a nation and will never be restored. The Jewish nation, as the Scriptures declare, was a type of the nations now called “Christendom”, and now, just preceding Armageddon, God sends His witnesses forth and commands that they give warning to the governments and to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That warning will not be heeded by any except those of good will toward God, and then will quickly follow the complete destruc-lion of everything in opposition to the Kingdom. That will be the final tribulation upon the earth. Only those who take their stand on the side of God and Hlb kingdom will be saved and live through that' great tribulation. Again the Earning is given to the people of good will to flee to the kingdom of God under Christ and live; for that is their only means of escape and safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every honest man should rejoice and will rejoice over the setting up of God’s kingdom under Christ. It will mean that His kingdom shall rule the world in righteousness and the people in equity. Thore will then be neither poor nor rich, but all who obey God will stand equal before Him. The Lord’s kingdom will mean the end of all war, because He has declared that never again shall the people go to war. (Isaiah 2:2-4) His kingdom will mean the end of all famine and pestilence, because the Lord in His kingdom will provide an abundance for all who love and serve Him. (Isaiah 25: 6-8) It will mark the end of rackets and racketeers, false teachers and deceivers, because God declares that nothing will offend or do injury in that kingdom. (Isaiah 11: 9) It will mean the end of sickness and death, because God has declared that Christ’s reign will result in the destruction of all of man’s enemies, including death, and then ‘there shall be no more death, neither pain, sorrow nor crying’. (1 Corinthians 15:25,26; Revelation 21:4) It will mean a period of endless prosperity, joy and happiness to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Who could knowingly be in opposition to such a glorious and blessed kingdom as that ? Only the Devil, who seeks to destroy man. To accomplish his wicked challenge the Devil has ever tried to deceive the people and turn them ay/ay from God. He has deceived many and has chiefly used religion to accomplish that purpose. But the time of his end is here, and amidst the greatest tribulation of all times his rule shall pass away for ever. Those who take their stand now on the side of God and remain firm shall live in peace and plenty, health and happiness for ever on the earth. Once more I appeal to the people to remember that religion is their great enemy and that they must dis* regard the. opinipns of selfish men and give full heed to this Word of God, which declares His* kingdom under Christ is the only htipe and is the sure'hope of all who worship Him in spirit and in truth, (Matthew 12:17-21) Looking forward to that glorious and blestod kingdom under Christ, Jehovah’a ; prophet' kt Psalm 150, addressing the people, says: “Praise ye Jehovah. . . . Let everything that hath breath praise Jehovah [God],A.fil.F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In voluntarily leaving the broadcasting field I take occasion to express the appreciation of myself and of all of Jehovah’s witnesses: to the managers and owners of many independent radio stations that have co-operated wnth us in getting the Kingdom message to the people of the nation. The Lord will not forget them for such kindness and eo-operation in this behalf. They may expect some favors from the Lord by reason of their eo-operation with'His servants. God never fails to reward those who obey or serve Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I repeat the wOrds of Jehovah God’s prophecy uttered by Jeremiah, which words of warning now specifically apply to the people of the nations, to wit; “Thus saith the Lord, Hearken not to the words of your [preachers] that prophesy unto you, . , . for they prophesy a lie unto you. Hearken not unto them; serve the king of [Jehovah], and live: wherefore should this [nation] be laid waste?” (Jeremiah 27:16,17) Stated in other phrase, the only place of safety is to serve the Lord Jesus 'Christ, whom God has appointed and anointed as the King of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I call upon every one who loves God and His kingdom and who desires to see righteousness prevail in the earth to lend all possible aid now to carry to the hungry people the only message of consolation for them, to wit; That Jehovah God’s kingdom under Christ is at hand, and is the only means of salvation and is for those that flee to that kingdom and remain firm. Those who thus do, standing firmly for God and Christ, shall receive the blessings of everlasting life and will thereby participate in the vindication of the great and holy name of the Most High.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Enemies</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A new recording by Judge Rutherford </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE </span><span class="font4">PUBLISHERS now exhibit to the people the book entitled &quot;Enemies”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">..The purpose is to enable all persons who love peace and righteousness to learn how they may find protection and safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fear and dread now afflict almost all persons. There is a real reason. To know the reason and to learn how one may gain peace and joy are of very great importance. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The perfect Word of God is the authority upon which the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> is based. Therein is found the proof that the greatest enemy of man is invisible to human eyes, and which is Satan the Deceiver. His purpose is to entrap men and lead them into destruction, A host of wicked angels operate with him, and he also uses selfish and ambitious men to accomplish his wicked purpose. He has deceived and overreached the rulers, made them unjust and cruel, and for centuries the result to the people has been much suffering and distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most seductive and subtle instrument employed to deceive man is religion, because religion has the appearance of doing good, whereas it brings upon the people great evil. There are many difi'erent religions, all of which are deceptive, are the instruments of the enemy Satan, and all work to the injury of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This book submits the conclusive proof that for more than 1500 years a great religious system, operating out of Rome, has by means of f^aud and deception brought untold sorrow and suffering upon the people. It operates the greatest racket ever employed amongst men and robs the people of their money and destroys their peace of mind and freedom of action. That religious system is vigorously pushing its political schemes amongst all the nations of earth with the avowed purpose of seizing control of the nations and ruling the people by cruel dictators. Some of the nations have fallen under that wicked power, and all nations are now greatly endangered. Because of the increasing power of the enemy the liberties of the people are rapidly passing away </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">bGTOBER 20, 1937</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and all nations are rushing into infidelity and into ultimate destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All thoughtful persons realize that the people now face &quot;the greatest crisis yet knowm. Enemies of man are everywhere and no uninformed man feels safe and secure. Where and how can the people find protection from such enemies? Some power far greater than that of Satan and his allies must intervene in behalf of the people if they find and receive protection from their enemies. There is no human power that can protect man, and this all thoughtful persons must admit. The matter is of too great importance to pass it by without consideration. The Almighty God in His goodness has made it possible for every person to now get the greatly needed information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> submits for your instruction the correct answer to the questions and the complete proof in support thereof, and which proof is indisputable and will satisfy every reasonable mind. It discloses who are the real friends of honest men and what men must do to find security and life. For the protection of yourself and your children a knowledge and understanding of the contents of that book is absolutely necessary. It is now being carried to the people by those who love God and who have the interest of honest persons fully at heart. The publishers are not selling the book, but they do receive a small contribution for each book, which will be used for printing more books to aid the people. Persons who arc too poor to contribute will receive the book free upon condition that they study it carefully. To learn the contents of this book will greatly benefit you and enable you to do good to others, and to honor your Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> makes known the truth, you will find that the clergymen of all religious organizations will oppose it and try to prevent you from learning its contents. Such opposers are your enemies. Ignore them and keep in mind the Word of Almighty God wherein it is written: &quot;Study to shew thyself approved unto God.” (2 Timothy 2:15) A knowledge of His Word is your shield. :</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Internationa] Association for Incitement to Crime</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font4">HE TRADE NAME of the International</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Association for Incitement ^o Crime is the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. That devilish institution is founded on lies. Little that it says on any subject would be believed under oath by any person with real knowledge of its history. It is capable of turning any law-abiding, peaceful community into a living “hell”. It supplies,by far the greater number of the world’s cririiinals, and the worst of such criminals, and for a money consideration condones any crime. The world will be a fit place for decent people to live only when Jehovah God has risen up and done His “strange act”, obliterating from the universe for ever the institution which, of all, has done most to dishonor His holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With this understated rather than overstated preamble there is herewith presented to the reader (with the parochial-school spelling and punctuation unchanged) two articles, going the rounds of the Catholic press, both of them as full of lies as they can be packed. The plain intent of these lying articles is to inflame the vicious, parochial-school-educated underworld to the commission of crimes against Jehovah’s witnesses when these come to them, in kindness and in love, with the priceless good news that Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ is here, and that they have the opportunity to take their stand on God’s side and live, or be destroyed with all the institutions of the Devil in the Armageddon impending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is noteworthy, too, that at the very time when the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is publishing and circulating such devilish lies, and with such malicious intent, it is also claiming the full, sole and only right to determine what information on any subject whatever shall go to the common people. For sheer, unmitigated, unadulterated, hierarchic, superb gall and conceit, see the claim of Cardinal Villeneuve that he only, in Canada, may tell the Canadian people what they may read. This appears in the third citation which follows. That’s rich. The Hierarchy may incite to murder, and then censor any attempt what-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ever on the part of the law-abiding to narrate the facts. The three articles of incitement to crime are now presented to the intelligent reader: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah'* Witnexea, An Unchecked Evil In America</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">[The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catholic Observer,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Pittsburgh, Pa., August 20, 193T]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Less than a year prior to the trial and conviction of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society’s representatives at Bern, Switzerland, an article appeared;, in ‘The Golden Age,’ (semi-monthly magazine of the society in America, published in Brooklyn), reporting in gloating fashion the successes of the convention of the “Kingdom Publishers,or Jehovah’s Witnesses, at Lucerne. According to the account, it was “the most impressive convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses ever held in Central Europe.” Special mention is made of the fact that Lucerne, “populated chiefly by Catholics,” was the city chosen for the gathering. Throughout a note of jubilation over a successful convention prevails, the rejoicing occasioned by the fact that the delegates had taken full advantage of the opportunities provided to attack the Catholic Church, and more especially the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All meetings were arranged by the home office in the United States, One resolution, adopted unanimously, contains the following curious passage, in complete disagreement with facts, apparently motivated by a fanatical desire to discredit anything pertaining to Catholicism; “The Hitler government, aided and incited by the Jesuits of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, has inflicted all manner of cruel punishment upon true Christians, even as Christ Jesus and His Apostles were persecuted for their righteousness.” This vicious falsehood is intended to fasten on the accused the suppression of the ‘Watch Tower’ movement by the Nazi Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The distribution of over 10,000 copies of one of Rutherford’s booklets to the people in the neighborhood of Lucerne on this occasion within an hour, is characteristic of the Witnesses’ propaganda methods. In vain did civic authorities attempt to stop this indiscriminate scattering of unwholesome printed matter; and their effort to prevent Rutherford’s'attaek on the Hierarchy, to be held the evening of the same day, was equally unavailing. Since both attempts were unsuccess</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ful, the Witnesses made the best of the opportunity to claim they were again being “persecuted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here in America “Judge” Rutherford has operated for a number of years, unmolested for the most part. Not long ago the “Judge” published a booklet, “uncovered,” purporting to show the “Roman Catholic Hierarchy is an organization put forward by the Devil for the purpose of turning people away from Jehovah God.” However, not all of his venom is directed against the Catholic Church. Many of Rutherford's writings, based on his preposterous “interpretations” of Holy Scripture, are directed against the very country protecting him. For example, he maintains that saluting the flag of the United States, or of any country for that matter, was invented by the Devil to turn creatures away from God.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19371020_files/g_E_19371020-8.png" alt="" style="width:197pt;height:107pt;">
<p><span class="font3">(It ia a noteworthy fact that the Boman Catholic Hierarchy dares not publicly discuss over the radio the doctrines which it professes to believe, but which nobody believes, least of all the Devil that invented them. Its only answer is threat of physical, financial or legal violence to those that apply the truth, with the cry of “CommunistI Communist!” to cover its own shame at inability to answer.)</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">But this is also true: the “Judge” and his disciples are as busy as beavers, and his followers must be liberal with money. To date nearly 230 million copies of various ‘Watch Tower’ publications have come from the press. The estimated cost of this literature—books, pamphlets, etc. —is $700,000 annually. The pernicious efforts the Witnesses engage in are carried on also by means of the radio. Electrically transcribed records carry Rutherford’s voice to countless millions of people every week. No less than 138 stations broadcast these programs I The ultimate purpose of this farflung propaganda is glorification of Jehovah’s Witnesses through the distraction of the Catholic Hierarchy and Church. So far attempts to curb the activities of the ‘Tower* have been ineffectual, because Rutherford has on every occasion claimed the right of free speech, and many Catholies are supinely tolerant of this explanation. However, the right of free speech and freedom of conscience is one thing, but abuse of the right is quite another matter. The president of the International Bible Students Association claims immunity for his propaganda from the very flag he is insulting. Unfortunately, many persons are inclined to regard him as a harmless imposter. That Rutherford is an imposter has been demonstrated frequently; to attempt to prove him harmless is to fly in the face of all evidence to the contrary. Any man able to develop such a well-knit, fanatical organizations, so hopelessly illogical, though none the less effective ; who can successfully vitiate the thoughts and actions of millions of people throughout the world; who cleverly takes advantage of the indifference of those about him to his subtle, though dangerous, program, can scarcely be considered harmless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The issues are clear-cut. On one side we find the disseminator of insidious propaganda, out to destroy the religion professed by more than half of the people in the United States.* On the other are those who have hitherto regarded Rutherford and his associates as innoxious fanatics. The facts at hand prove that the Christian world is once more face to face with a sect, the presence of which in a greatly disturbed society should be considered a danger signal and treated accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">[*It is noteworthy that in this article, for the first time, the Homan Catholic Hierarchy claims the full numerical and moral support of Jews, Protestants and the “evil servant ’' class, but lied, of course, even at that. On July 1,1926, the population of the United States, estimated by U.S. Census Bureau, was 116,531,963. One-half of that would be 58,265,982, yet in 1926 the total “church” membership in the United States, including Jews, “Spiritualists,” Mormons, Universalists, ringed, streaked and speckled, in prison and red-light districts and out, was only 54,576,346, That leaves 61,955,617 Americana that never ewallowed any of the bait.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">St. Hyacinthe, Que., July 22—Urging a close study of the present social order, Cardinal Rodrigue Villeneuve told French-Canadian delegates to La Scmaine Sociale that “liberty of the press” in modern society “grants newspapermen the opportunity to poison as well as falsify public opinion without any hindrance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Speaking at the closing session of the social study group’s four-day conference, the Cardinal declared last night that “absolute liberty of the press, as sanctioned to-day, accords the license to teach all error,, gossip all calumny and provide revolutionaries with a means to sing the benefits of revolution.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The situation presented a “grave aspect,” he said, “in that our people seize upon these preached principles, foreign to us, and without reflection and in imitation of the popular trend, hasten to spread to the four winds the most daring assertions, resulting in great confusion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Journals, which the'Cardinal sajd failed to realize the consequences, published “tales of socially irresponsible doctrines under which any comer, without molestation, could dynamite the foundations of our social organization, blast away our institutions for law and order and destroy our fine traditions,” the Quebec archbishop declared.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font4">UCKED away in that foreign area called “Hudson County” is a Lilliputian borough called “East Newark”. It is only a few blocks square and contains a couple of thousand people. It may be only a flea bite as to size, but cuts quite a swath as to general cussedness. Its environment may have something to do with that. The Stygian darkness, gloom and murkiness of Hoboken cannot help but affect it, and the noxious effluvia of Secaucus is contagious. But, though small in area, East Newark is now showing that it can descend to putriddepths unequaled by other P options of th e county.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">It is truly a medieval city. The Bill of Rights doesn’t have any standing. The Constitution is unknown. Freedom of worship and freedom of speech are heard of only in the school books. It is ruled from Rome by a papistical quartet with ruthless disregard for American principles of liberty and freedom.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>Auld Clootie’s Quadruplets</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">Canada may have its quintuplets and Siam its twins, but permit us to present to you the pontifical quadruplets of East Newark; the managers, directors, and operators of the Hierarch al Inquisition of the community. They are at war against Christianity, against Christian people, against freedom of worship, against truth and righteousness, and against Almighty God. They resort to injustice, torture, malice and wickedness to carry on an unholy conspiracy. In the interests of truth and justice </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> takes pleasure in exposing some of the wicked acts of this canonical foursome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">John A. Reynolds is officially the mayor of the borough. A. better title would be Inquisitor General. John opened the way for the acts of this Inquisition. He issued a decree, in writ ing, on October 14, 1936, forbidding Christians in the persons of Jehovah’s witnesses to come into the town, or exhibit any books, t papers or even a sound machine therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This popish bull has been repeated verbally by “his honor” a number of times, and his fellow conspirators have been well instructed to keep Jehovah’s witnesses out of town. Of course Mayor Reynolds took an oath of office to support the Constitution of the state and of the nation, but why bother about a little thing like that? The canons</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of the Catholic Church require obedience to the Hierarchy regardless of constitutional rights; and when the Hierarchy wants dirty work done, every good subject must be on the job, regardless of oaths of office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Timothy Scannell is chief of police of this municipal sliver. He is now knighted Chief Pontifical Inquisitor, and has well earned the title. In ancient days pontifical inquisitors were sent out by the Hierarchy to hunt out the “heretics” and throw them into the dungeons. That’s Timothy's job. When word comes in that Jehovah’s witnesses are in town he sends out his blue-coated, lesser inquisitors and throws them into the jug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Chief Pontifical Inquisitor also believes in torture methods; of course not with racks and thumbscrews, but he believes in making it as uncomfortable for Christians in his calaboose as he can without getting himself'into jeopardy. There are two steel cages in the East Newark jail. Each cage has a bench with a-pail under it, said pail being for sanitary??? purposes. The cells are within full view of each other, and it appears to be a pleasure to this chief to torture the sensibilities of refined Christian men and women by putting men and women in the two cells within full view of-each other, leaving them indefinitely; also by putting a man and a woman in the same cell and leaving them there.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Food for prisoners ? They don’t need it. Starve them, and they’ll keep out of town. That appears to be the philosophy of the Chief Pontifical freeze, too. Never mind about furnishing heat for th era. And let there be plenty of filth in the cells. Thus Timothy Scannell carrieth forward his portion of the Inquisition and caus-: eth the putrescence of East Newark, .to exceed even that of, Secaucus and Hoboken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Number 3.of this dingy four is Sadie Carey, the borough clerk, otherwise designated ‘ye Scribe of Satanas’. Sadie ,is custodian of tne borough law book. The Inquisition- Council (leereed that Jehovah’s witnesses were not to be given information concerning laws and ordinances that would a^fget their.work. The idea appears to he to keep them in ignorance of the law and then jail them for violating it. Page Adolph Hitler, please. He can learn things from Auld Clootie’s quadruplets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Jehovah’s witnesses called for information concerning sound ordinances they were informed there was. a good law on it but they couldn’t see it, because the mayor and the council had decreed they should keep out of town anyway. One day a distinguished-looking, gray-haired gentleman called on Sadie the Scribe and inquired concerning sound ordinances. Sadie said, “No, you can’t see it.” Then she inquired why he wanted the information. “I’m in the laundry business and am considering doing some advertising work in the community.” “Oh, that’s different,” says Sadie, “I thought you was one of those Jehovah’s. We won’t let them have the ordinance.” And with smiles, apologies and great courtesy she gave all the information needed to this one of Jehovah’s witnesses, who was also in the laundry business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It’s all right to go into East Newark for the purpose of laundering the shirts and pants .of the inhabitants, but the ruling powers just aren’t going to have any cleansing from unrighteousness going .on in the burg.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">When the Pharisees and scribes had Jesus murdered they went to the Roman tribunal to furnish the legal front for the crime. So likewise, when East Newark punishes Christians at the behest of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy it has Sarah Dunn, the borough recorder, furnish the judicial trimmings.and accessories. There is no valid law for this Inquisition Tribunal to apply to Jehovah’s witnesses, but that doesn’t trouble . this female judicator. She mounts the bench; denies the defendants the right of counsel; denies them the right of defense; denies them the right to make any motions; and “finds them guilty” regardless of law or evidence. She advises counsel to “keep these damned rats and worms out of here”, and embellishes the proceedings with language and terms not supposed to be used in Sunday school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such draggletailed proceedings constitute what New Jersey calls “courts of justice”.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>The Sat anas Song of Hate</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">Thus do Auld Clootie’s quadruplets in the borough of East Newark, in these United States of America, sing their song of hate. Instigated, inspired and directed by that great racketeering system, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, they have filled the community with hatred of truth, hatred of Christians and of Christianity, hatred of decency, honesty and liberty. They have turned back the clocks of time and are trying to reproduce the barbarities and cruelties of the Dark Ages. They are opposing Jehovah of Hosts in their wicked acts; and just as sure as Sodom and Gomorrah went up in smoke, so will these willful opposers of Almighty God receive their reward in the day of wrath now near at hand.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">For the public interest, convenience and necessity radio station WBBR broadcast to the public some of the facts concerning this East Newark Inquisition, Apparently it hit the editor of the Kearny </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Observer</span><span class="font4"> in a tender spot, and he broke out with this editorial effulgence;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">INTOLERANCE AT ITS HEIGHT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The vindictiveness and intolerance displayed by a religious group Sunday in a vicious attack on East Newark public officials should bar the door of every home in West Hudson to a sect which preaches a creed of hate and slander.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Properly constituted law and order apparently have no place in the minds of Jehovah Witnesses, a self-styled group of “disciples” who insist upon bringing their message to the doors of West Hudson residents by personal contact though ordinances strictly forbid canvassing from door to door without first obtaining a police permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">West Hudsonites generally are tolerant of another’s religious belief and open intolerant attacks on the creeds of others have been few and far between. The Kin Kiux Klan at the height of its bigotry never was as repulsive in its defamation of Catholic, Jew and Negro as that which emanated from Radio Station WBBR at the instance of Jehovah Witnesses Sunday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Incensed at the refusal of East Newark officials to ignore an ordinance that members of the cult might eanvass the borough after residents had complained of the practice, leaders of the sect, under the direction of the frequently repudiated Judge Rutherford, staged their radio performance Sunday with the plot predicated on the asinine assumption that borough officials were tools of the Papal hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite many warnings that permits must be obtained before canvassing from door io door, and particularly on Sundays, would be allowed, members of the sect insisted they were immune from civil laws and persisted in the practice of ringing door bells and forcing their message on borough residents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When warnings failed to impress the “disciples”, arrests followed. Those taken into custody apparently sought martyrdom as no effort was made to obtain bail and they remained in a police cell until the following morning when they were arraigned in Recorder’s Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recorder Dunn twice suspended sentence after finding them guilty and advised them to obey the law or jail sentences would follow. The Jehovah Witnesses made their last appearance in East Newark police court in July and their radio “dramatization” was plotted on that episode when again suspended sentences were imposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The E*st Newark episodes are similar to those enacted in other North Jersey municipalities, particularly in Nutley and Irvington. In the latter case, jail sentences were imposed and upheld by Common Pleas Judge Van Riper and Chancery Court, both holding the ordinance governing canvassing was applicable to the Jehovah Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When religious fervor, be it real or simulated, is based on hatred and intolerance of the creed of others, there can be no justification for its existence. Hence we reiterate, every door in West Hudson should be barred, if necessary, by ordinance, to this type of zealot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It impresses this magazine that that editor’s views on “law and order” are worthy of attention. He thinks that Jehovah’s witnesses are woefully lacking in said law and order, but Caiaphas, where do you suppose he stands? He gives the East Newark quadruplets a clean bill of health and therefore puts his stamp of approval on unlawful arrests, convictions without trial, suppression of right of counsel, suppression of right of defense, inhuman and outrageous jail conditions, suppression of freedom of worship, of freedom qf speech, and of freedom of conscience. In fact, it appears that this magazine has made a mistake. He is entitled, by virtue of his valiant defense, to a place with “Auld Clootie’a Quadruplets”. Moved, and carried unanimously, that “Auld Clootie’s Quadruplets’* be dissolved, set aside, and declared null and void, and its place taken by “Auld Clootie’s Quintuplets”, with Editor McClinehie holding an honored place therein.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">But there is no lack of useful and beautiful work to be done, and no lack of eager toilers to whom free and fruitful labor would be the gladness of life. Millions of fields are waiting for plow and seed, and water from the hills, that they may sing to the ill-fed and overworked millions with harvests of bread and joy. Millions more of valley and hillside acres are ready to blossom with cotton and the wool of sheep, that they may clothe the millions of ill-clad children and their miserable mothers. Millions of ore and fuel, in the hearts of mountains and the depths of earth, promise to come forth for the wealth and warmth of the millions asking to fulfill the promise by the labor of their hands. Millions of homes are needed for the millions who die in the moral and physical wretchedness of tenements, because they must buy from the lords or rent a place wherein to lay their heads on the earth God gave them; and millions of builders are waiting to clothe with homes of love and beauty an earth set free from owners and tribute-takers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lack of work, while the millions are starved and dwarfed and blighted for want of the things and opportunities that make life whole and sweet, loving and lovely and worth while?</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Yes, after all, amidst these boundless resources for countless billions of the children of God, offering ten thousand times ten thousand kinds of noble and useful and happy things to do, with myriad hearts and hands and brains asking nothing but freedom to do them, there is lack of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But wherefore comes this lack! Do you not see! It comes from the lords of industry and land, who have shut up the resources which God gave all the people, and who have made laws to keep what they took by force, and have made judges to keep the laws, so that the people may not use their own, nor earn their bread and rejoice, nor even live upon the earth the Lord God gave them, except they toil for the gain of the industrial lords, to whom they must sell their labor power for the right to exist; whose wage slaves they must become, or else stand all day idle, and starve in the market place at night. And thus it is that the majority of human [creatures] drag out impoverished lives of unsupplied physical and spiritual need amidst' overflowing abundance, to have even their need destroyed at last by the everlasting lack.—-Geo.

<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font4">HE air was crisp and el^ar as Jane and .Sally trudged through the late autumn woods. Now they exclaimed over the beauty of a gold and crimson maple, and again they stood under a flaming oak searching for acorns. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Far ahead they could hear Buddy kicking at the dry leaves as he followed a rabbit, or little Bunny calling to him when she chanced to lose sight of him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A colony of crows fluttered angrily in the treetops and scolded the intruders. A gray squirrel scampered along the limb of a hickory tree, spied the girls, and “froze”, remaining entirely motionless for at least two minutes before he slipped to the other side of the limb and scuttled away, drawing his great bushy tail after him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jane sighed. “It’s all so sweet and beautiful it makes me hurt inside.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sally murmured, “Dad was right. He said the woods would be lovely after last night’s frost. ’ *</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Why, Sally?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Because the frost would turn the leaves. ' Aren’t they simply gorgeous?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Wasn’t last night’s frost the first this season ? ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Yes, I guess it was.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I was here three days ago, Sally, and the trees were all in color then.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“They couldn’t have been. It takes the frost to turn them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“But they were. Which simply means that it doesn’t take the frost to color the leaves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“What does do it, then?” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The leaves take on their beautiful hues because they are dying. A lot of food has gone into the making of these leaves. If it should all fall to the ground with the leaves, the tree would greatly suffer. ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“But how can it help falling?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’‘The Creator provided for that, in a Way which makes us marvel. The green coloring matter contains one of these important foods ■ so the tree gradually draws this food back</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">into the twigs and then into&quot; the branches, ' where it is stored. ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“But what has that to do with the colors?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Some of the colors we see are a result of the breaking up of food particles. Others of the colors Were simply concealed by the green chlorophyll.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Wonderful!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“That is npt all of the story. Even before this began taking place, other provisions were being made. Wood-like cells began forming across the inside of the leaf stem where it joined the twig. Gradually they cut the stem, so that by the time all the useful material was gone from the leaf it was completely cut off from the tree.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Why does that happen? There must he </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">reason.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">'' There is; a very good reason. If the hundreds of leaves on a tree were to fall otherwise, each leaf would leave behind it an open wound. From each the lifeblood of the tree would ooze, and, in addition, harmful insects could easily attack the tree at these points.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jane reached up and pulled a branch of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">beech tree toward her. Gently touching one of the heavy yellow leaves, which promptly fluttered to the ground, she pointed to the place where it had been attached to the twig. “See, Sally—scarcely a mark. Just a delicate scar. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font4">sudden wild scream proclaimed that Buddy was teasing Bunny. A moment later the two children came into view, Bunny running frantically and Buddy pursuing. In his hand the boy carried a “thousand-legger”, as he called it. From this Bunny fled in terror.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Jane! He said he would! He said he’d put it on me, and he’s going to! Make him stop!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Buddy, stop teasing your little sister,” called Jane as she held out her arms to the frightened little girl.. Then taking the squirming mass of legs from Buddy’s hand, she put the insect on the ground. “ It won’t hurt you, Bunny. Come now, we must be going home.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Baddy chuckled gleefully as Bunny trotted </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">off,</span><span class="font4"> holding close to J Une. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: -</span></p>

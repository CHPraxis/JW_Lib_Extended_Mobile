<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Why the Interest System Is Deathly Sick</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE interest system, forbidden in the Scriptures (Psalm 15:5), contains within itself the seeds of its own destruction. Anyone with paper and pencil can prove for himself, in a few minutes, that any civilization built upon the interest system must perish. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">See Golden Age </span><span class="font8">No. 277, pages 499-501.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Conservative banking is the loaning of money at 6 percent, on 60-day notes. Compounding thus, $1 becomes $2 in 150 months and ever thereafter in 142 months (or less) the entire amount doubles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Suppose, on the accession of PopeLeo III,</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Explaining a little further, 1136 years from the accession of Pope Leo III brings one only to December 25, 1931, and that is more than five years in the past,<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark41">1</a></sup> so the funds would be ample, even at the new price for gold. But the price of gold in the United States remained at $20.67 per Troy ounce for over 100 years, and was only recently changed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The real reason why the change was made was that those responsible saw plainly that the only way they could possibly keep the stream of interest coming was to almost</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">$25 per Troy ounce for 291661 ounces $l,020,833J </span><span class="font8">double the price of gold. At the old price, 21 globes of solid gold could have been bought with the $1 invested at 6 percent compound interest on the day Leo III ascended the throne, and each globe would have been of the weight of that on</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From 1837 to 1934 the United States was operated for the benefit of, say one John D. Morgan Mellon Sinclair Astor Vanderbilt, Jr., and a half dozen or more friends. The dozen men, acting together, have it in their power to put on a full high-pow'ered panic any time they please, and each time they put on one they get closer and closer to taking all there is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On this last occasion it came pretty near getting away from them, and in fright they decided that something must be done. Hence the real pleasure with which all the big banks in the country are loading up to the muzzle with government bonds. The bonds pay interest, don’t they ? Well, that explains it. And it explains the NRA, AAA, and all the rest of the New Deal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The time has gone by when there is anything much to be gained by taking away another man’s business, because business in all lines is overmanned and overdone, but if interest on money cannot be made in the good old way of dividends, then let the government have it. The interest may be smaller, but all the property in the country is back of it, and Big Money runs the show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As an evidence that the multimillionaires are taking it away from the smaller ones, take note of the fact that mailing lists of 19,039 millionaires were obtainable in New York in 1929; the same lists now have but 14,603 names in them. The list of those worth $50,000 or more dropped from 620,000 to 495,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When the Bankers Get Them All</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Home Owners Loan Corporation made 850,000 loans, and is beginning to make foreclosures, as was inevitable. Some are wondering when the same bankers that repeatedly show they are stronger than the governments get control of all the property of the people just what they will do with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Maybe conditions will be like those on a certain street in a high-class American city where in seventeen elegant homes in a single block every tenant explained that he had lost everything, including his furniture, but was allowed to remain in the house, because the banks had found the properties were thus kept in better condition than if allcwed to remain empty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Said Congressman Sadowski, of Michigan:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font7">would like to sec the interest-paying game taken away from private bankers. I cannot understand why bankers, who do not own the money they lend, have a right to charge interest or toll on the use of money. It is this interest, or toll, that robs the manufacturer </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">merchant of their profit and the laborer of his wage. It is like the rake-off or the percentage in a crap game. When the game is played long enough the house has it all. There is no reason why the money masters, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">private bankers, who produce nothing, are overloaded with wealth and power, while the good American citizen who produces everything is reduced to beggary. Take away their banking privilege, take away their right to charge toll on the producers of this country, exterminate that parasite called interest; then we will have solved our troubles. Then, and only then, will you have honest distribution of wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 1929 the immense sum of $8,639,000,003 was reinvested in new productive enterprises in the United States; in 1934 the investment was only about $178,000,000, or around two percent of that only five years before. The people who have the big money see no way to assure themselves that if they invest their money they will get the interest on it. For the present they are content to put their surplus into government bonds, in the hope that for a little while longer the interest can be squeezed out of the people by taxes in some form; but it is a vain hope. The interest system has been given the final punch; it is staggering to its final fall; and the referee has begun to count tick, tock, tick, tock, the few remaining seconds before it will be in its death agonies, and the people will be for ever free from its bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 1934, when the people needed money worse than ever before in history, the banks had so much of it that they did not know what to do with it. A correspondent sent in the balance sheet of a prominent midwest bank, marking the first item “Cash on hand and in banks, $50,305,842.50”, and added, in pencil, “And no place to go,” and struck it about right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Guaranty of Bank Deposits</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Guaranty of bank deposits seems to work well, thus far. During the past two years only five National banks gave up the ghost, and as a result of the guaranty the depositors lost nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) is that corporation entrusted with seeing that no more banks shall fail. The banks are all supposed to be in the corporation and to stand by one another, so that in effect it is a bankers’ insurance company, with quasi-govern-mental approval back of it. Numerous banks after getting into the FDIC made application to withdraw; probably, their business having picked up, they did not wish to act as guarantors for others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The investing public were recently robbed of $3,600,000,000 by “guaranteed” bonds most of which were not worth the paper they were written on. The big leaders in the racket, S. W. Straus &amp;&nbsp;Co., American Bond and Mortgage Co., Greenbaum Sons, etc., picked committees of investors whose business it was to protect the bondhouses and let the small investors lose all. This job was so well done that the old crowd came out richer and stronger than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The S. W. Straus Company sold $313,435,000 of securities to 80,000 investors and then went bankrupt. Hordes of crooked lawyers swooped down upon the carcass and by one means or another succeeded in raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars that really belonged to the victims of the smash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So much of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad’s earnings were siphoned away to the Wall Street </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">gang</span><span class="font8"> that in one year recently this once prosperous road, no longer able to buy new rails, had as many as twenty-five rail breaks in twenty-three hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Uncle Sam’s huge pile of gold, $11,250,000,000, is the largest ever accumulated in the world. It is being located in Denver, Colo., and at Fort Knox, Ky., 31 miles south of Louisville, where it will be protected by every known device.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Money ever seeks to hide where it is safe. The United States was strictly neutral in the Italo-Ethiopian conflict, but raw material used for -war purposes went to Italy in a perfect stream. In California Alan Hoover, backed by his father, Herbert Hoover, bought farm lands on a huge scale. Herbert remembers that in the World War the people had to eat, and times were good for farmers. And, besides, money invested in a farm is safe, even if profits are small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Small Loan Plan in Massachusetts</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Most of the states of the United States are infested with loan sharks whose charges run from 17 percent to 1,000 percent or more, and who are doing much, very much, to ruin the country. Massachusetts is favored with a small loan plan which aims to give the common people a chance, and has their approval. In the year 1931, in that state, there were 300,000 borrowers; they borrowed $36,000,000; there was no loss to the lenders; they made a net profit of 7 percent on their invested capital. No bank may own or control one of these small loan agencies; they are under control of a state supervisor. The rules are few and the charges humane; foreclosures are very few; the people are satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A dispatch from New York printed in the London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span><span class="font8"> reports 300 witnesses peeping through holes in a screen and thus identifying usury racketeers that loaned money at as high as 1,040 percent a year interest, and then employed gangsters to assault the borrowers when they finally reached a place where they could not pay. Gambling machines are in general use all over Greater New York. The usury racket is hoary with antiquity and still going strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Would you believe it possible that a man would pay another $1,100 interest on a $30 loan? It happened in Brooklyn. A man loaned that small sum to a fellow worker with the understanding that $36 was to be repaid in six weeks at the rate of $6 per week, but if a week was skipped it would be another $6 payment, and so on. The poor laborer paid $1,100 in this manner before he went to the police for advice and protection. The result was that the usurer, Joseph Fero, was arrested, and when in the toils of the law it was found that though he sported a fine car he was actually receiving $38.50 a month relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Social Credit in Alberta</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first place in the world to try the Douglas Social Credit plan, for doing away with the iniquitous interest system, is Alberta. There fifty-nine Social Credit Leaguers won in sixty-three contested districts. The Douglas plan seems entirely reasonable, but newspapers, bankers and all whose interests are involved have done all possible to impede and obstruct the use of the “hot money” issued, A citizen refusing to work when employment is obtainable is suspended from the dividend privileges of $25 per month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Everywhere, in spite of their newspaper and other antagonists, the people are stirring in their own behalf, and forced to do so. Acting under powers conferred by the New Zealand legislature the New Zealand Industrial Commission fixed a base rate of $18 for men and $8 for women, as the least that may be paid for a forty-hour week. The five-day week is now the rule over most of New Zealand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News,</span><span class="font8"> having made an investigation of its own, reports that less than 4 percent of the people of the United States are getting 38| percent of the national income and these already own and control more than 87 percent of the national wealth. The biggest fellows are not Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In justice to the Jews, it is claimed that between 1925 and 1928 the one firm of J. P. Morgan &amp;&nbsp;Company floated larger loans than all Jewish bankers combined, that there is not a single magazine of national circulation owned and controlled by Jews, not a single newspaper chain, and a survey show’s that 769 of the highest-paid officials in the motion-picture industry are non-Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Counting on the bankers to get the United States into the next world war, the same as they did in the last w’ar, Sir Malcolm Campbell, speed driver of autos, thinks another world war certain, and also that the United States will be dragged in. If so, and connections could be proved, the results for the bankers might be far different from in 1917. The American people are extremely patient and gullible, but the business has been overdone, and present misfortunes and sufferings are too keen to be ignored or forgotten. For winning the World War for the Allies America received nothing but abuse. Morgan’s men, Sharp and Bacon, who promised the French foreign minister that they would put the United States into the war on the side of the Allies, should have told Hanotaux that there is a limit to American patience and gullibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two headlines in the newspapers tell an eloquent story. They read as follow’s: (1) “Fifteen States to Be Cut off Relief November 15.” (2) “Wall Street Booms on Breathing Spell Message from Secretary Roper.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Capitalism Is Done”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Hollywood, California, former Congressman F. H. Shoemaker, of Minnesota, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Capitalism is done. Production for use must and can supplant the present system. Society has been the slave of the machine, and the only solution now is to make the machine the slave of society. The capitalist is helpless in a fight against production for use. His own system has licked him. He is over-capitalized to the point w’here he must liquidate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Everybody knows that Mr. Shoemaker told the absolute truth, yet if he had dared make the same remarks a few’ years ago he w’ould have been denounced most savagely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Edward A. Filene, one of America’s foremost thinkers, and Boston’s most famous merchant, rated as an unofficial adviser of President Roosevelt, in an address at the American Chamber of Commerce, London, made the statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Business cannot remain as it is. It must make some move, must organize some kind of business government or submit to some government which will govern business in view of its failure to govern itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Returning to America Mr. Filene resigned from the United States Chamber of Commerce, having become convinced of its unprogressiveness, and stated further:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There can never again be lasting nation-wide prosperity until American business in general is organized to pay such higher wages that the masses of wageearners will be able to buy enough of our industrial products to give our industries an adequate market, and thus keep them in profitable operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">About 1,000 businessmen, delegates from 48 countries, met in Paris and issued a statement in which they said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For five years business all over the world has suffered from unparalleled depression. In spite of some signs of natural recovery here and there conditions continue unsatisfactory. Confidence is lacking, monetary instability prevails, debts remain unpaid, taxation increases and international trade is held up, hampered by mounting restrictions and barriers. Business enterprise is heavily burdened and handicapped on all sides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The railroads ruined their own business by putting passenger travel rates up to a point w’here the people could not pay them, and either stayed home or traveled by cheaper conveyances. As soon as they reduced the rates to a point w’here the people could afford to pay them, business picked up right away. Have you ever noticed the W’ay the people flock to the ten-cent stores? They have the same idea. They like to get something for their money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The City of Too Much Gold</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">La Paz, capital of Bolivia, is the city of too much gold. With the advent of hard times the natives began reworking the gold stream, on the banks of which the city stands. So much gravel was removed that the city began to crumble and the authorities w’ere compelled to forbid further gold mining w’ithin the city limits. When one thinks of it, that is not such a bad picture of why this present civilization is falling in ruins. It has been interested only in digging gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now that the w’ar is over and the Paraguayans have won the Gran Chaco oil fields, Bolivia turns its attention to something constructive and worth while. On the western boundary of the country, between Bolivia and Peru, lies Lake Titicaca, 130 miles long and 43 miles wide. This lake, at an elevation of 12,635 feet, is the highest navigable lake in the world. Though it now empties into a smaller lake to the south, and is eventually lost in the Salinas Grandes, it once was a feeder to the Amazon skirting Mount Sorata (one of the most magnificent mountains in the world) on its way to the lower levels at its base. Lake Titicaca will now be turned into its old bed, which in a few miles descends 6,100 feet. The power obtained from this project will be used to run all the railroads and other machinery in Bolivia, and the surplus waters will be used to irrigate the rich neighboring agricultural valley. The project will take five years to carry out and will cost $25,000,000.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“God brought it”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Bolivia handed down a decree that all men between the ages of 18 and 60 must be occupied. A census is being taken and the unemployed will be placed in mines, factories, commercial houses and other establishments willy-nilly. The government has issued orders requiring every man and woman in the country to join either the syndicate of employers or that of employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Anything to Keep Profits Coming</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A single large Pittsburgh dairy admitted that it dumps 1,500 to 2,000 gallons of skimmed milk into the city’s sewers daily, and stated that at least one other large dairy follows the same practice. Taxpayers will feel that this milk could at least have been offered to the various relief agencies in Pittsburgh, and maybe, if they did not want it all, they might have let some of it go to the relief administration without being skimmed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pre-fabricated houses are now on sale by American Houses, Inc., and National Houses, Inc. A four-room unit by the former concern costs $3,800 complete; occupancy guaranteed in two weeks at any point within 100 miles of New York. There is no cellar. The steel frame is erected on a concrete foundation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The walls are in panels 4 feet by 10 feet and 2| inches thick, of alternate layers of cement, asbestos and burnt cork. The outside is a light gray and needs no paint. Extra rooms can be added from time to time by unbuttoning one outside wall. The walls are papered in parchment that can be washed with soap and water. An electric clock is set in the wall, over a radio. All rooms are air-conditioned. Down one side of the kitchen runs a monel-topped counter in which are set the stove, refrigerator and sink. Next to the kitchen, neatly embedded in a thick column, are the furnace, plumbing inlets and outlets and air-conditioner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These houses, cheap, durable, attractive, made by machinery, spell the doom of the building trades and mean that, hard as times have been for carpenters, plasterers, plumbers, roofers and painters, they are bound to be harder still in the near future. National Houses, Inc., announces that it expects to have 10,000 pre-fabricated houses to sell during the next twelve months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God Didn’t Bring the Paves</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That was a great discovery by the 100%-Profit Americans that God did not bring the paves but did bring everything that had any money in it. In the case of sewers, and more particularly in the case of paves, it is a case of everything going out. And so no group of patriots ever got together behind frosted glass to consider how these could be taken over and operated by them to the public advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But when it came to services of water, gas, steam, oil, electric lights, electric power, telephones, telegraphs, radio, what a desperate effort the patriots put up to keep these services in their own hands and to impress upon the public that they will be morally and otherwise ruined and destroyed if they try to handle them themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For years the Power Trust had college professors running around the country hollering their heads off against public ownership of public utilities. Some of these professors did this entirely as a labor of love, plus a little rake-off of $5,000 a year. Bankers did the same. Editors did the same. And probably the preachers did the same. And the politicians. It was great while it lasted, but it didn’t last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The argument put up by the Power Trust people that they hadn’t a man, not one, who could or would manage a public-ownership plant in the interest of the people was so convincing that here and there an honest mayor decided to try it out, especially in those communities where the electric rates were well known to be in the neighborhood of fifteen times the cost of producing the current, which cost is around | of 1c per kilowatt-hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Profitable Public Utilities</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Birmingham, England, in 1934 and 1935, the net profits from the public-owned and public-operated electric, gas, water, railway and omnibus utilities were $10,487,815. Birmingham was the first city in the world to discover that it is all right for the people as a whole to operate their own utilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It helps one to understand why those of the Power Trust are so eager to teach the American people the terrors and dangers of public ownership of anything that has an income attached to it, when one learns that in the last 32 years the city of Toronto, Canada, saved $278,000,000 because of the public ownership of power in Ontario. Think what a boon that money would have been to the bankers that own the Power Trust!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The city of Cleveland has owned and operated its municipal plant for over twenty years. During that time it has maintained a maximum rate of substantially 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, and an average rate among the very lowest in the country. At these astonishingly low rates the city has accumulated an equity in the plant over and above all costs of operation, capital charges, etc., of over $15,000,000. The saving to the citizens of Cleveland resulting from the municipal plant during the last twenty years, is $40,000,000. The 3c rate, which w<sup>r</sup>as at first declared to be impossible and was ridiculed by its opponents, has been proved to be an overcharge.”—Edward J. Kenealy, Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Woodsfield, Ohio, if memory serves aright, a few years ago had a bonehead for chief of police, but’ in other respects it is an up-to-date community. Three years ago it purchased its own Diesel engine electric light plant at a cost of $28,000. Since that time it has paid for the plant, loaned the village $4,500, given free electric service for two months, reduced the current from 9c to 5e, and supplied free current to the municipality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Vineland (N.J.) municipal light plant paid the borough $100,000 profit every year for six years; lowered the tax rate from $5.61, six years ago, to $3.99, in 1935; furnished $42,000 worth of municipal and street lighting per year, free of charge to the taxpayers; helped to pay the bill for hard-surfacing 14 miles of streets and improving 30 miles more; piled up a cash balance in the bank of $250,000. What a crime against Big Business!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Other Wide-awake Communities</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With electric light rates down to rock bottom, the Martin’s Ferry (Ohio) municipal power plant made so much money that all patrons received a dividend of a month’s free electricity. When you hear of some of the privately owned public utilities’ doing something of the kind, you will know that this earth is no longer a fit place for you, and that the little feathers on your shoulders are the first faint signs of your coming wings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The city of Painesville, Ohio, received its November. 1936, municipal light plant bills marked “Paid”. Now, in some of the big cities, where the newspapers, owned by the big toads, fight against municipal ownership of everything that makes money, the people are looking for some free bills, and they will get them when they are nailed up, and not before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The municipal electric light plant of Poplar Bluff (Mo.) gave one month’s free service to every customer in 1936. The reason why none of the privately owned utilities can do anything like that is that it would cut into the reserve funds needed to bribe legislators, college professors and others who object to public ownership of public utilities—for a consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pennsylvania’s only tax-free town is Mifflinburg. The revenues from the municipally owned water and electric plants were more than enough to pay all expenses. Sad, isn’t it?—for the utility holding companies and such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The little city of Munroe, N.H., has two huge power plants, one assessed as worth $9,000,000. These plants pay 95 percent of the taxes, with the result that the city now has $15,000 on hand for which it has no use. Just a timid suggestion: Turn it over to the Power Trust and let them use it for propaganda against public ownership of any </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">profitable</span><span class="font8"> public utility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rate Reductions by Municipal Plants</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Public Oivnership</span><span class="font8"> magazine is a list of cities showing the maximum rates per kilowatthour before municipal ownership and afterwards. Roughly, the average rates at first were about 12c; now they are less than 4c. Details are as follows: Pasadena, Calif., .15 and .045; Jamestown, N.Y., .10 and .035; Webster City, Iowa, .10 and .063; Virginia City, Minn., .113 and .02; Winnipeg, Man., .20 and .025; Ft. Wayne, Ind., .10 and .07; Lincoln, Nebr., .13 and .0475; Holyoke, Mass., .16 and .04; Washington, Ind., .10 and .07; Eugene, Oreg., .15 and .04; Toronto, Ont., .08 and .015; London, Ont., .09 and .013; Ottawa, Ont., .07 and .009.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Canadian cities that have electric light and power rates of less than 1/c per kilowatthour are Hamilton, London, Niagara Falls, Port Arthur, St. Thomas, Toronto, and Weston. Those that have 11c per kilowatt-hour and up to (but not more than) 2c per kilowatt-hour are Acton, Barrie, Brampton, Brantford, Brock-ville, Chatham, Collingwood, Dundas, Galt, Georgetown, Guelph, Ingersoll, Kitchener, Lis-towel, Midland, Mimico, New Toronto, Norwich, Owen Sound, Picton, Paris, Prescott, Preston, Sarnia, Stratford, Strathroy, Tavistock, Tilson-burg, Waterford, Waterloo, Welland, and Windsor. The Canadian city that has the lowest rate of all is Ottawa, which is but 9/10 of 1c per kilowatt-hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Compare these rates with the rates, service charges, reconnection charges, fines and other amenities on this side of the line, and you will know why the bankers and college professors and politicians and newspapers over here are such rooters for private ownership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pointing out that the United States Government sells electric power for four-tenths of a cent per kilowatt-hour, the city of Pawtucket refused to pay its bill at rates up to 9 cents per kilowatt-hour, and filed a bill with the Legislature seeking permission to build its own power plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Who Gets the Big Money?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With the worst depression in the history of the world still on, the Associated Gas and Electric System made a profit of 300 percent above the cost to the corporation for engineering services rendered to its subsidiaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Persons who have cut their eyeteeth will be mildly amused at the statement that the 38,000 employees of the Consolidated Gas System have combined to fight municipal ownership of New York city’s gas and electric systems, and that their activities will be supported by “voluntary contributions”. Wonder if the gang that paid millions to send bogus telegrams to Washington to head off the utility holding company legislation will join and help forward these voluntary contributions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the investigation of Power T.rust crookedness at Washington it came out that 2,000 telegrams were sent from York, Pa., and all but 14 of the messages had forged signatures. The Western National Bank of York, Pa., respected (?) caretakers (?) of the people’s funds, paid for 157 of these messages, and the rest were paid for by the Associated Gas and Electric Company, whose Mr. Ursal E. Beach (another product of our wonderful twentieth-century civilization) ordered the subsidiaries in 26 states to get rid of all written evidence pertaining to their Holding Company Bill resistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The modern hold-up man takes no chances. He has a lawyer by his side every step of the way and knows just when to strike, how to strike, and when to collect the loot. One of the modern stars is Ellis L. Phillips, who, starting with $50,000 in 1913, and understanding how to work public utilities to a finish, rolled up profits of $5,080,000 over a twenty-year period in which he took the Long Island Lighting Company for a ride. One transaction was when Phillips sold to the lighting company for $66,000 equipment which it valued at $1,200. In 1927 the Phillips Company charged $1 an hour for the use of a truck that had a book value of $1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Telephone Rates Down a Little</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Telephone rates are down a little, and it is high time they were. In Washington there have been congressmen, not a few, who have boldly expressed the opinion that the Telephone Trust is stronger than the Government itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Influence Network of the American. Telephone and Telegraph Company contains 4,911 banks in which the company has deposited funds, and at times the influence of these banks stands the company in good stead, but 17 of its officials are also heads of 197 other corporations having combined assets of nearly $40,000,000,000. A wise distribution of advertising keeps most of the press silent of criticisms of the great trust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are more than 34,000,000 telephone users in the world, slightly more than half of them in the United States. New York city has 1,506,100. The entire world is now linked together, so that if one has the price he may pick up his instrument and telephone all over some 73 countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Walter Gifford, president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, was selected by President Hoover as head of his unemployed relief organization. Here is what then happened: In 1929 the company of which he is head had 364,000 employees; last year it had 244,000, but the dividends of the company stayed at 9 percent all through the depression. The 120,000 American Telephone and Telegraph Company employees that went on relief relieved the company of taking care of them, and, besides that, most of those that received the dividends had nothing to do at any time, being unemployed because they did not have to work. This system of relieving the unemployed has many supporters. Over 50 percent of A.T.&amp;T. stock is held by 5 percent of the stockholders. Fifty-seven percent of the stockholders own less than 10 percent of the stock. The president of the A.T.&amp;T. draws a salary of $206,000 annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The gambling business at Evansville, Ind., seems to be in good shape. When an A.T.&amp;T. race-wire machine was grabbed at that city an A.T.&amp;T. lawyer made it clear to the city fathers that the company wanted no part in any gambling enterprise. Then to the Ministerial Association the same clever lawyer gave assurance that the A.T.&amp;T. would do all in its power to prevent the use of its scientific devices for ignoble ends, and then to the gambling client the same clever lawyer gave assurance that he had nothing to worry about. The Youngstown </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Telegram</span><span class="font8"> offers the foregoing information and follows it with the succinct summary, “No runs, no hits, no errors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">American homes contain many comforts. 21,455,000 contain radios, 21,430,000 have passenger cars to drive, 20,890,000 are wired for electricity, and 10,660,000 have residence telephones. The homes having telephones could be doubled, but it is the policy of the Telephone Trust to make the charges high and so discourage further telephone extensions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">New York city will take over the Brooklyn Manhattan Transit lines for $192,500,000 and the Interborough lines for $238,251,000, operating, all together, 237 miles of subway and elevated lines at a uniform fare of 5c. The combined lines represent the largest and most comprehensive rapid transit system in the world. The proposition has been advanced that the city should run these transportation lines free, the same as elevators in a great building, and thus distribute the population more widely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Best-Paying Corporations</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The United States corporations that pay their executives wages from $100,000 to $250,000 a year are General Motors Corporation, Jones &amp;&nbsp;Laughlin Steel Company, Bethlehem Steel Corporation, American Telephone and Telegraph Company, McKeesport Tin Plate Company, Standard Brands Incorporated, McCall Corporation, Republic Steel Company, United States Rubber Company, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, Standard Oil Company of Indiana, Air Reduction Company, United States Industrial Alcohol, National Dairy Products Corporation, Consolidated Gas Company of New York, Kennecott Copper Subsidiaries, Coca-Cola Company, Montgomery Ward &amp;&nbsp;Company, American Smelting and Refining Company, Diamond Match Company, Lambert Company, Owens-Illinois Glass Company, Saturday Evening Post, Continental Oil Company, Atlantic Refining Company, United Gas Improvement Company. Besides the foregoing, 29 other concerns pay their presidents or other officials larger salaries than that paid to the president of the United States. There are 110 film stars who receive higher salaries than the president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The National Pants Company made 100,000 pairs of pants for the CCC and just as soon as the Supreme Court declared the NRA unconstitutional the firm notified all employees that it would make deductions from their wages until the firm had got back all the “excess” paid under the NRA. Of course, the firm got unusually high prices for the pants because it was working under the NRA code. In other words, the National Pants Company tells the Government, the people in general, and their employees, to go right straight to the end of the dock and jump off.</span></p>

There are numerous detective agencies in all the large cities fully equipped to do work of this kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Use of Violence by Big Business</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Methodist Federation for Social Service seems to think that violence is out of place when practiced by the principals of the flock against the common people, and is quite right. It says, in its report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At least seventy-three workers, share-croppers, Negroes, were killed in economic struggles and lynchings during the year; no employers. . . . The condoning by the authorities of violence against radicals by lawless bands, their participation in it, was an accompaniment of the rise to power of Fascism in Italy, in Germany and Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Building a tunnel in West Virginia, two thousand workers were denied dust masks and wet drills. So 476 of the workers are dead, 169 of them buried in one ditch, without coffins or other marks of identification ; 1,500 more are expected to die. By depriving the men of the safety devices the company building the tunnel saved at least a dollar for each man killed. West Virginia newspapers refused to print any news of the tragedy caused by the silicate dust, into which the workmen were driven by foremen armed with clubs. Relief officials refuse aid to families suing or desiring to sue for compensation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When a stockholder</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation offered a resolution, at the thirtieth annual meeting of the stockholders of the company, that the combined salaries of the officers be limited to 20 percent of the profits in 1934, Schwab, Grace and other big stockholders and officials beat the motion by a vote of 2,370,000 to 355. They have shrinking modesty, to be sure, but not financial shrinking —not that you could notice it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“We must tell the American farmer that the chains destroy the vegetable price in southern California and in the Bay district; how they shipped lettuce in and dumped it on the market in the Bay district to break the price the farmers were receiving—tell the farmers the story of eleven bunches of vegetables for a dime and seven dozen oranges for a quarter, destroying the farmers’ ability to purchase manufactured goods such as tractors, trucks, plows and cultivation machinery which must be sold to the farmer if the laboring man in the great manufacturing centers of the east is to have a chance for a job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“We want to ask the local insurance broker and salesman did he ever sell a policy to a chain store, and the answer will be he never did; for the chains do not buy from local agents. Ask the local attorney if he ever performed a service for a chain store, and again the answer is no. 387,000 traveling salesmen driven off the road in one year by food mergers alone, adding to the great army of the unemployed; another half million people who cannot buy the products of the soil and factory. What do our hotel men think of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“We want to tell the independent merchant the story of the contract between the Goodyear Rubber Company and Sears-Roebuck as it was exposed by the Federal Trade Commission wherein they showed that Goodyear had given Sears, Roebuck &amp;&nbsp;Co. a price discount on tires of $41,000,000, and, as though that were not enough, they gave Sears-Roebuck 18,000 shares of Goodyear Rubber Company stock, and as a consideration for the signing of a secret agreement, gave them$800,000 in cash with which to purchase an additional 32,000 shares of Goodyear stock.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“Does any man or woman believe one can compete with that kind of competition? The chains in their propaganda will tell you that the independent merchant can compete with the chain store if he had the courage, the stamina, the stick-to-it-iveness that was necessary. And they tell the story of an ex-chain store manager who went into business for himself and who at the end of the sixth year was making $360,000 a year and then tell you there is nothing to it if you have the courage and the stick-to-it-iveness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“My answer to them is that you may have all of the grit and the courage and the red blood and stick-to-it-iveness that you want, but you cannot overcome a price differential of $41,000,000 on tires or $144,000 on a five-cent yeast cake or $84,000 on a package of chewing gum. My answer is that the ruthlessness, the unscrupulousness, the cunning manipulation of the chain store corporations, can be overcome only by legislation which corrects by curbing the expansion of the chain store in this state.”—By Senator Chris N. Jesper sen, Calif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Simon &amp;&nbsp;Schuster, New York publishers, made a list of the 200 most powerful men in the world, according to their judgment. The eleventh man on the list is J. P. Morgan, concerning whom the statement is made that his firm controls over one-quarter of America’s organized wealth. The governor of the Bank of England was given first place on the list, the pope the second place, Franklin D. Roosevelt the sixth place, and John D. Rockefeller, Jr., the fifteenth place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Murder—the Most Respectable Racket of All</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In getting up a little story about the efforts of those who have money to keep the stream of interest flowing, the oldest, most respectable business in the world should not be overlooked —the war business. It never pays to write on a subject that somebody else has written up better than you could do it yourself. The following is from </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The American Guardian;</span><span class="font8"> it is of special interest just now, for the reason that Europe is expecting war. This is evidenced by the fact that the world’s store of gold is being salted away down in Kentucky, so that when the fun begins the men that control the pile can draw upon it to buy the munitions that will be needed, and to purchase the newspaper and radio propaganda to squeeze the United States into the conflict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the noble Romans were short of hoe hands on their plantations, they sent their legions into Gaul, Germany and Brittany to fetch more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When a king of yore felt an itching for the real estate of a neighbor, he called bis retainers together and went after it with halbert, spiked club, and butcher knife. If luck was with him, he made away with the vanquished acres, improvements and livestock, such as oxen, horses, goats, and serfs. If luck went against him, it was just too bad, but there can be no profit without risk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For many centuries, war was the business of specialists called knights. The reason why they called themselves noble is that they worked only on horseback, where they were hard to reach, and if reached, were so covered by sheet iron that the worst that could happen was a dent in their fenders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When two knights had maltreated each other's hardware until one of them ran out of wind, the winded one was declared vanquished and held for ransom by the victor. Thereupon, word would be sent to his friends and relatives to bail him out or know the reason why. Killing knights was poor business, which explains that after centuries of knightly warfare, descendants of these noble warriors are still littering up the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">War in those good old days was good honest business. Your opponent had something you wanted, and when you got your man, you got what he had. There was no talk about national prestige, insult to flag, or making the world safe for democracy, etc. This was so because the count who owned the country, or the king who owned the country, owned the people, too, so there was no need of fooling people who had nothing to say nohow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Well, the kings, knights, store raiders, and robber barons no longer own, and consequently rule, the earth. Their place has been taken by so-called “capitalists”, who are just like you and me. Now, all men are equal before the law. The capitalists select the people who make the law and enforce the law, while you and I obey the law. Outside of this and the minor fact that these people own all the things without which the rest of us must die or croak, there is no difference between the citizens of democracies, such as ours, for instance. In other words, there are no ruling classes in democracies. There are only folks who own all and command, and folks who own nothing and obey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But as there is nothing perfect in this imperfect world, democracy created new problems. One of them is how to make people who own nothing fight for something they haven’t got and won’t get if they win, and that’s where patriotism comes in. Patriotism is the art of inducing people who own nothing at home to fight for the other fellow^s interests abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For illustration, let’s say a party whom you have never met, and wouldn’t get a chance to chum with on a bet, owns a string of oil gushers in Mexico. The only interest you have in oil is when you buy it by the gallon, using a potato for a stopper. When times are good, meaning when the kind of folks who own strings of oil gushers in Mexico let you work, you burn the oil and throw the potato away. When times are bad, you eat the potato and do without the oil. From this it may be reasoned that those oil gushers in Mexico are none of your concern. But wait a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cruel, hard-boiled and unscrupulous government of Mexico proceeds to tax the oil gushing from the string of gushers owned by the gentleman you never met, and what was “his’n” but yesterday is ours today. Our interests are menaced in Mexico. Our country must not tolerate interference with American rights in Mexico. Our prestige is at stake. Our flag is insulted. “We,” “us,” and “ours” gushes from every newspaper, billboard and four-minute speaker. Funny. Yesterday there was nothing of me, us, and ours about these oil gushers in Mexico. They were the safe, sacred and exclusive private property of the gentleman we never met.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For some reason the gentleman will not fight for his oil gushers in Mexico. Neither will he go down in his jeans and hire a private army to defend his property. The property is his. The profit is his. Up to yesterday it was all I, me, and mine. Now it is all we, us, and ours, and woe unto the oilcan plus potato stopper toter who is not willing to lay his life down for our country’s interests, glory, prestige, and foreign investments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our country, my eye. The bulk of us don’t own enough of our country to be buried standing up in it. We work when its owners let us; quit when they tell us; give our lives in return for wooden crosses, peglegs, and pewter medals while its real owners stay at home and make hay while it rains blood, gore, and broken stove lids.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We saved our country in the Civil War, but if anybody ever saw a Rockefeller, Carnegie, Morgan, Gould, or Vanderbilt in a G.A.R. parade, let him speak up, or forever hold his peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We saved it again during the World War, and doing so made 40,000 new millionaires, but if there was a millionaire’s son among the killed, wounded, or missing, we missed his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The International Murderers of 1771</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Don’t get the idea that the International Murderers are something new. It is one of the most ancient and one of the most honorable rackets of earth. In 1771 Boswell's hero, Johnson, wrote of the gentry who now dominate every peace conference:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These are the men who, without virtue, labor or hazard, are growing rich as their country is impoverished; they rejoice when obstinacy or ambition adds another year to slaughter and devastation, and laugh from their desks at bravery and science while they are adding figure to figure, and cipher to cipher, hoping for a new contract from a new armament, and computing the profits of a siege or tempest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The reason why the World War of 1914-1918 went on four and one-half years instead of six months is that the French army did not penetrate eight miles into Lorraine and recapture munition plants and blast furnaces seized from the French by the Germans in the first days of the war. This the Germans now admit, and the French admit that in order to protect those private interests the French commanders were instructed not to bombard the plants. It thus appears that the death of some 50,000,000 people and the ruin of mankind was due to anxiety to spare losses to the rich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the Sunrise Conference of April, 1916, President Wilson, in the presence of Claude Kitchin and Champ Clark, pounded the table and said that if the country declared war at once hostilities would be over in four months. Seven months from the time of the conference he was re-elected because “he kept us out of the war’’—into which, during all the campaign, he was determined to plunge the country as soon as he could after re-election.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What it cost to make the world safe for the two billion dollars of loans and credits advanced to the Allies by the American bankers were 350,000 Americans killed or wounded, 25 billion dollars spent by the U.S.A, for armaments, 12 billion more loaned to the allies, and defaulted, 55 billion more for pensions, and the pushing of the whole world into the arms of Fascism— Catholic Action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Explaining why he and other United States marines were sent to China, supposedly to protect the lives of Americans, General Smedley D. Butler, in an address at Newburyport Mass., said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the past </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">100</span><span class="font7"> years there haven’t been as many Americans killed in China as are killed in Chicago every day. What we really went to China for was to protect $20,000,000 worth of Standard Oil property at a cost to the American people of $12,000,000. It cost the people that much to protect a private investment that doesn’t pay a cent in taxes to the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">International Murderers Backed Hitler</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Senator Nye, of North Dakota, in an address at Tacoma, Washington, charged that Eugene Schneider, French munitions maker, was one of the chief financial means by which Adolph Hitler climbed into power and thus destroyed Germany. He further declared that the submarines, airplane motors and poison gases that now threaten the safety of humanity are manufactured under American patents. The conspiracy of the International Murderers is world-wide, to foment strife and disorder. It means money in their pockets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All Europe is taking the boys and girls and turning them into prospective soldiers. Of these boys and girls the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> says, truthfully :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For those who remember the fresh freedom of the morning hours, there is no sadder sight today than the lengthening regiments who march on without knowing that their parades are the funeral march of their youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">International Murderers have been warned by General William H. Tschappat, United States army ordnance chief, to get ready for their war mission. Part of that mission, as history shows, is the bribery of army officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Government is alleged to have noticed that when it asks for quotations from the members of the steel combine it seems to get identical prices from all competitors. If the Government should suddenly decide to enforce the Sherman Act it might be necessary for these big munition makers to start another war to keep out of trouble ; and that they would do that in order to save their profits, there is not the least question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Do you really wish to get ahead in the world, or are you content to lag behind? If you want to get ahead, you must give yourself wholly to the Devil; for it is true, just as Scott Nearing said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who accept, advocate and support war find themselves functioning at the center of civilized society. Let anyone seriously work for peace, and he is regarded as a renegade, an outcast, an enemy of civilization. . . . Those who refused to participate in the work of organized destruction and mass murder were branded by the French, German and American ruling class interests alike as enemies of civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sir Basil Zaharoff, the greatest arms salesman of all time, and therefore the greatest potential murderer of all time, died at 86 years of age at his mansion thirty miles out of Paris, accounted the richest man in Europe. Because his life was a curse to his fellow men he was knighted and decorated by England, France, Russia, Italy, and other countries. In his last few weeks he saw no one, read no letters, and received no parcels, because he was afraid somebody would blow him up with a bomb. The poorest beggar, dying destitute of food, clothing and shelter, dies enviously rich compared with the merciless wretch who finally came to his end. What are his hopes </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">now?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Racket of International Murderers</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Referring to the racket of the International munition makers, Senator Homer T. Bone, of Washington, in an address at Denver, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The rackets of men like Al Capone are socially dangerous and should be suppressed because they endanger society, and for exactly the same reason the racket of men who desire to plunge us into the insanity of war by their greed should be suppressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Skoda, Central Europe’s largest armament firm, increased its net profits in the year 1935 over 1934 fabulously. They rose from 11,200,000 to 39,600,000 crowns, all made out of the sorrows and anxieties of men that wish to live in peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Labor</span><span class="font8"> sets forth that 75 percent of Germany’s steel is from France: an average of 60 iron ore trains left France for Germany every day during the past three years. If war were to come, two-thirds of the shells fired by the Germans at the French would represent a profit to the French steel trust, the Comite des Forges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 1933 the nations of the earth expended $7,436,000,000 for armament; in 1934 they expended $8,281,000,000; and in 1935 they expended $9,295,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">According to the London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle,</span><span class="font8"> the armament bill for 1936 was almost five times that for 1913. The respective bills for arms of the seven dangers of the world are given in pounds sterling as follows (the figure for Italy includes the cost of the Ethiopian campaign):</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">According to the League of Nations Armament Yearbook Germany’s best customer for war materials during the past year was Great Britain. Germany was also a good customer for British arms. Both countries are afraid of the other’s arms program. That makes the business of the International Murderers excellent in both countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For the year 1935 Britain led the world in arms exporting; Czechoslovakia came second; France, third. To show how crooked are the nations reporting through the League of Nations, it is known that the total arms exports for that year were not less than $42,000,000, yet the importing nations admitted receiving only $23,-000,000 worth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prosperity Riding on a Soap Bubble</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Whatever its faults, the League of Nations has sufficient perspicacity to discern and mention that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The economic revival which is provoked by mass production of new weapons of warfare is illusory and precarious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Score one for the League. Now if they can just get the pope not to encourage any more wars like the Ethiopian massacre or the Spanish Republic overthrow, mankind will be getting somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">George Lansbury, M.P., has the faculty of saying things in such a way that they may be understood. In an address at Wigan he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Dwellers in Cuckooland are those who, from 1914 to 1918, drove the youth of the world to the madness of uncivilized slaughter and at the end gave the new generation a heritage of hatred and despair. These same men now invite the youth of the world to enlist, this time under the sign of the skull and crossbones, to make the world safe for barbarism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Great is the joy among International Murderers, Preferred and Common. It is claimed that germ cultures will sell for $300 a pound, while the cost of production is only $6 per pound. The germs mixed with food paste and ground silicon dioxide are blown out behind a plane through the exhaust. The silicon cuts through the clothing and causes wounds within the lungs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">According to the aviation magazine </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Contact, </span><span class="font8">three places for the production of these germs are already in operation, one in the North sea, one in the Mediterranean, and one on an island in the New World. Spores of grain and fruit diseases are being cultured, so that neither crops nor cattle will be immune. Probably the plants have been already “blessed” by some legate. All the elite of International Murderers are in on the new system of mass murder.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">By virtue of his office, the “holy father” is acknowledged to be, and is, “a friend of the world,” under the explicit guidance and direction of “the prince of this world”, and is continuously offering service to “the god of this world”, that Rebel, the Devil.—Romans 6:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The world,” as used in the above scriptures, is correctly defined by Judge Rutherford as “the organization of men into forms of government under the supervision of an invisible overlord”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By virtue of his training, as well as his office, every member of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, including every pope, recognizes and must recognize as “higher powers” (Romans 13:1) those which maintain their supremacy over Italians, Ethiopians, Germans, Austrians, Spaniards (and prospectively Americans) by means of battleships, torpedo boats, submarines, Big Berthas, machine guns, bombs, flame throwers, poison gas, and disease germs of typhus and yellow fever, and make “concordats” with them and exchange ambassadors with them. Every member’ of the Hierarchy stands ready in the name of the “Prince of Peace”, to “bless” any Franco, Hitler or Mussolini.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is, oh, so sad a thing for a man eighty years of age, decked in the finest laces, velvets and ermines, resplendent in gold, silver and precious stones, to die under the care of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">twenty</span><span class="font8"> physicians. For months the newspapers have carried stories of his sufferings, his recoveries, his broadcasts, and the fact that his last hours were spent in listening to his secretary reading the lives of the popes. He also “offered his sufferings to God”—the god mentioned at the head of this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The newspapers have published, in the aggregate, thousands of pages of such “news” in the last few months, as things went bad for the Hierarchy in its war in Spain. It was all very sad, and intended so to be. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Really</span><span class="font7"> sad was the fate of the half million men, women and children of the Spanish Republic, unattended by physicians (some of them in the bull ring, and to music), done to death by the one whom Cardinal Illundain and the pope so gladly recognize as representing their god in the Spanish peninsula—General Franco, commonly known as “the butcher”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The adjacent half-column, prepared for the Associated Press anticipating the pope’s death, is what newspapermen call a “sob story”, intended to make- the American people and the people of the world overlook the murders in Badajoz churchyards, Toledo hospitals and Madrid streets. Weep copiously for the wearer of the triple crown, who, in death, must be neither in heaven, hell-fire nor purgatory, but stone dead in his grave, along with the half million Spaniards he sent there before him. There is a hope for them in the resurrection; it is not so sure about papa; for how can hypocrites escape the damnation of Gehenna ?—Matthew 23:33, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is alleged that papa recently stated that he aimed at ' ‘ being completely worthy of divine adoration”. Now wouldn’t that bust your rosary? The head of the biggest racket on earth thinks he should be made a saint. For pure effrontery, unbounded nerve and unmitigated audacity, that takes the beads. The other boys in lace skirts will do their best for him. There will be incantations, offertories, processionals, sprinklings of holy water, and unctions. There will be high mass, low mass, and dry mass. But e ’en though there be seven sacraments and seventy times seven sacraments it will not bring Ambrose anything but a Hierarchy saintship, which is no saintship at all. The Lord knoweth the hypocrites, and will reward them according to their works.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Pope Regretted Keenly That Concordat Not Concluded</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Vatican City.—W—Pope Pius XI regretted keenly that diplomatic relations with the United States were not established during his reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">His holiness, whose pontificate was characterized by many concordats concluded with nations in. both hemispheres, had hoped the United States, the only large Christian nation not to have diplomatic relations with the holy see, would gladden his declining years by sending him an ambassador or minister and perhaps permitting him to send a papal nuncio to Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PaeelU Discussed Issue</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Eugenio Cardinal Facelli, papal secretary of state, went to the United States in October, 1936, he was reported reliably to have discussed the possibility with leaders of the Catholic church in America and with civil authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pope Pius, it is said, was willing to make a big concession in order to have American diplomatic representation at the Vatican. He would have agreed to accept an American diplomat without receiving the reciprocal privilege of sending a nuncio to Washington, and would have continued to have merely an apostolic delegate their without diplomatic rank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was pointed out it would be Impossible for the government 4n Washington to permit a nuncio there, since the nuncio becomes dean of the dioloraatic corps, and a Roman Catholic archbishop as head of that body was not to be thought of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pontiff therefore agreed that the same arrangement be followed with the United States as is followed with England. Britain, has a minister accredited to the Vatican, but the Vatican does not have a huticio accredited to London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Liked Roosevelt</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pope Phis had a great personal liking far President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He believed Roosevelt was fundamentally sympathetic toward the holy see. He thought their combined efforts would be sufficient to open, diplomatic relations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The United States had diplomatic relations with the Vatican when it was an independent nation—then, of course, much larger than now—previous to its absorption into Italy. From 1852 to 1858 the United States was represented at the Vatican either by a minister or a charge d’affaires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1852, when Louis Cass was the American minister to the Vatican, it also was thought a papal nuncio might be sent to Washington. When, however, Archbishop Bedini was sent there to study the situation, much opposition was raised and the idea was dropped*</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Wickedness: Why Permitted</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font8">INCE it appears from the Bible that the Devil has brought all sorrow, woe and wickedness into the world, why has the righteous God permitted the Devil to do so? The Devil began the trouble when perfect man was in Eden. To be sure, God could have then killed the Devil; but he had a good reason for not so doing. The Devil challenged God to put a man on earth who would under the crucial test remain faithful to God, the Devil boasting that he could cause all men to curse God. Had God killed the Devil then without giving him the opportunity to prove his challenge the question would never have been settled in the minds of other creatures. To be sure, God knew that His own power is supreme, that He could permit the Devil to put forth his efforts to make good his challenge, knowing that the Devil would fail, thus proving the Devil to be a liar and God to be true, and this would vindicate Jehovah’s word and name. At the same time, by permitting the Devil to attempt to carry out his boastful challenge the opportunity would be afforded to men to make a choice between wickedness and righteousness, and those who choose righteousness and remain in harmony with God shall live and be a vindication of Jehovah’s name. There was no other way to give all a fair show and to prove the supremacy of Jehovah God. Imperfect and dictatorial men try to compel others to do what they desire, and this they do under the Devil’s influence. God does not compel, but permits men to intelligently choose which way they will take. For this reason God said to the Devil, as appears in the record at Exodus 9:16 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser): </span><span class="font8">“For this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At various times during the centuries past God has shown His supreme power against the Devil. A striking example of this is concerning Jesus. The Devil and his agents persecuted Jesus continuously for more than three years and then caused Him to be wrongfully convicted of the charge of sedition and cruelly put to death. When dying Jesus cried out: “My God, why hast thou forsaken me?” God had not forsaken Jesus, but He was permitting the Devil to go his limit in his persecution against the perfect and holy One. Jesus died and was buried, and on the third day thereafter God exhibited His supreme power by raising Jesus out of death and then exalted Him to the highest place in the universe. Jesus had spent more than three years giving testimony to the truth, and for that reason He is given the title “The Faithful and True Witness”. Therefore the prophecy recorded by Moses in Exodus nine was primarily fulfilled by the testimony given by Jesus, and by the exhibition of God’s supreme power in raising Him out of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At all times there have been some men who have steadfastly resisted the Devil and stood firm for God. The time limit to prove his boastful challenge is now up, the end of which time is marked by the coming of the Lord in power and glory. Now the Lord has commanded that a wide witness shall be given by those on earth who are faithful to Him before God finally exhibits His supreme power against Satan. That is the reason why the Lord now sends men and women about the land to bear testimony to the truth of and concerning His name and His kingdom. Necessarily those men and women are the objects of Satan’s wicked persecution even as Jesus was persecuted, which is exactly as Jesus foretold. (John 15:20) All of those witnesses must remain true and faithful to God regardless of the wicked persecution heaped upon them, and by this means they maintain their integrity and participate in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. This they can do only by being put to the severe test. When the name of Jehovah has been fully declared by His witnesses in the earth, then, the Lord declares, His supreme power will be fully shown by the complete destruction of the Devil and all of his agents; and that will for ever prove to all intelligent creatures that live that Jehovah is true and that Satan is false and man’s worst enemy. For this reason God says that all the wicked shall be destroyed ahd the righteous will live.—Psalm 145: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God is not at all to be blamed for the suffering of humanity. All such wickedness and suffering is properly charged to the Devil, as stated in Revelation 12:12. Jehovah has permitted the Devil to carry on his wickedness for the purpose of affording a full opportunity for intelligent creatures to choose the way to life, as it is written, at 2 Peter 3:9: “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness ; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.” He is now affording the people opportunity to learn the truth, that they may believe on and serve Him and His kingdom and live. No others now on earth will survive. The understanding of the prophecy of God’s Word is now of the greatest importance to all persons of good will. It is your privilege to know the truth, and you should be diligent to do so. The books that are brought to you will enable you to understand the truth.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>With the Kingdom Message in the East Indies</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8">S IT is about three months since I last wrote you, it seems that a few lines might be acceptable.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">My last letter was from Penang; since then we have spent about three months on the east coast of Sumatra, the principal center being the city of Medan, while there are numerous sizable towns in the district most of which have now received a thorough witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The trip across from Penang was slow, as we are dependent upon wind at sea, the motor being too costly to run except for short periods, and the winds in these waters are very uncertain and light except when “Sumatras” are experienced; these are short storms generally lasting only up to a few hours, but they, can be very severe and dangerous if small sailing vessels are taken unawares. We experienced three of these during the four nights we were at sea, and it certainly seemed that the Devil tried hard to prevent us from reaching Sumatra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, the Lord sent His angel before us, it is sure, and we were very well and hospitably received in Belawan by the port authorities, the local yacht club, and by the people generally, being invited to the most convenient berth we have thus far had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our experience is that the Dutch colonists are far more hospitable and friendly than their English neighbors, while, even if not inclined to receive the Truth gladly, they yet appear tolerant and at least courteous, which attributes of ordinary good citizens are often noticeably absent in many of the latter. It is the attitude of priggishness and narrow insularity that antagonizes so many people who happen to belong to lesser nations and that has earned for them such titles as “pommies” in Australia, etc. The manifestation of Jehovah’s wrath against the “false prophet” will certainly hit these proud ones harder than any others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We had an interesting and pleasant stay in the Medan district, and the good news fell on many a welcoming ear amongst all sections of the community while we placed about 3,000 pieces of the Society’s publications in the locality, including here in Asahan where we have now brought the good ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We are at present overhauling the motor and doing other work on the boat, which all takes up some of our time, which we often begrudge as causing delay in the witness work, but which, of course, is necessary, and we expect to call at about three more places on this coast before returning to Singapore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before the slump this was probably one of the wealthiest districts in the world; but the industries are now restricted to only a fraction of their output of rubber, tea, tobacco, copra, palm and mineral oil, etc. The general impression is that there will be no material improvement, as far as anyone can see; in which, of course, they are quite right: these have yet to learn how Jehovah purposes to bless all of mankind who will prove their worthiness to inherit the Kingdom; at present comparatively few have their eyes opened to the only way in which true riches may be obtained—and retained. After a short stay in Singapore to refit in certain ways, we expect to sail for further territory, in the East Indies probably, and which would thus receive the witness for the first time, as instanced by Borneo, Celebes, the Moluccas, etc.; and this would indeed be a great privilege, as we are certain to have some wonderful experiences in Jehovah's service in such places. There is a big field in the East here for those suited to this part of the vineyard ; numbers whom we have met and who welcome Jehovah's government are now taking- up the shout and are inviting “whosoever will” to ‘come and take of the waters of life freely’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Straits Settlements are almost saturated with the influence of Rome’s hierarchy, with its action so foreign to everything that the British flag claims for those under it, and one wonders just how long the other elements of the government will take to wake up to the fact that these barnacles are only really a hindrance to their ship of state and then ‘burn the old whore with fire’; but surely, as the Lord now reveals through His watchtower, that time is very close. Here in Sumatra the influence of that abomination is not so strongly felt, but we have had ample evidence of its presence, while its “Protestant” allies also continue to manifest their enmity toward Jehovah and His witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A natural feature of this country which is worthy of mention in particular is Lake Toba. I understand that until about sixty years ago no European knew of its presence, and even now it is hardly used except where two or three holiday resorts are established; but there is a big native community on its shores and on the island of Samosir in its center. The lake is about 60 miles long and 4,000 feet above sea level and is surrounded by mountains about 2,000 to 3,000 feet higher still. The climate is ideal; invigorating and healthy all the year round; while the setting is truly beautiful. The water is perfectly fresh and contains nothing more dangerous than goldfish, while the deepest point of the lake extends almost to sea level. There is now a good tarred road to a few points on its shores, the road being trans-insular. Surely this is one of the wonderful works of the Creator which will reflect His glory as regenerate ones enjoy life amidst such beautiful surroundings. Four of Jehovah’s witnesses have been invited to spend a day at Sioehan Hotel by its hospitable and kindly Swiss proprietor. The hotel is in a delightful environment overlooking the lake; all they would be asked to pay for would be champagne! The invitation may be gladly accepted as pioneers pass that way in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We had the pleasure of listening to Judge Rutherford from EAQ Madrid whilst at this anchorage, in (approximately) latitude 3° N. and longitude 100° E. Our set is an indifferent one, and such reception is unusual, but superheterodynes should pick these lectures up regularly; which fact should prove a great blessing to friends here in the East; and thus Jehovah’s message goes to the ends of the earth. It is now even hoped that the Kingdom gospel may, in the near future, if the Lord chooses to so provide, be broadcast by radio from this vessel devoted to His service. At the moment, our 20-watt transcription machine is entertaining and educating a festive crowd on the river here who are celebrating the birthday of the queen of the Netherlands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hope to write you at least once more one of these days, if only to tell you how the “Philistines” are forced to drink the cup Jehovah has prepared for those particular children of the Devil.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>The Works of Abraham</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">(A free sermon distributed in Weehawken, N.J., by Jehovah’s witnesses)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE Bible tells of a man named Abraham, who loved God, and served Him. His works were works of righteousness, and his descendants formed a nation that received God’s special favor for many centuries. Abraham is spoken of as “the father of the faithful”, and today many people are glad to claim that they are his descendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This brief sermon, handed to you by one of Jehovah’s witnesses, tells of the works of another man by the name of Abraham, who probably claims descent from the Biblical character Abraham. The parents of this man had respect for the righteous works of the faithful man of old, and gave his name to their son. His name is Abraham Lieberman, and he holds the distinguished position of recorder of the town of Weehawken. It is his duty’ to administer justice among the people; to uphold the right and condemn the wrong. If he were a worthy descendant of the ancient patriarch he would be glad to “keep mercy and judgment and wait on . . . God continually”.—Hosea 12: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses serve the God of Abraham, “whose name alone is JEHOVAH.” (Psalm 83:18) A Roman Catholic Inquisition operating in New Jersey has caused many of them to be arrested, confined in filthy prison cells, convicted without evidence; heavily fined and imprisoned for long terms without just cause or excuse. It is evident that Abraham of Weehawken looked with approval upon such lawlessness and determined that if given the opportunity he would crack down on them with such impetus, power, force and might that they would fade away and be as though they had not been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In due time his opportunity came. On October 18 five of Jehovah’s witnesses were arrested in Weehawken. They were calling on the people at their homes to tell them of the purposes of Jehovah God to bring blessings to the people. They were brought before Recorder Lieberman, and thus he had opportunity to show what great things he would do in behalf of the religionists who desire to suppress the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Abraham rose to the occasion. He aided in bringing new and unusual charges against Jehovah’s witnesses, and when court convened these five Christian people found themselves before a hostile judge and charged with “wandering abroad and begging or soliciting charity under the pretense of preaching the gospel”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There was no evidence that they wandered abroad, or pretended to preach the gospel, or solicited or begged alms for charity. There was conclusive evidence that they were preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom, in printed form. But lack of evidence had no effect on this modern Pharaoh. He sentenced each to thirty days in the county jail. Thirty days behind prison bars for preaching the gospel in Weehawken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On December 14 Thomas Racina, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, called from house to house in Weehawken. He carried with him a portable phonograph and offered to the people opportunity to hear a free program of Biblical lectures and sacred music. In the course of the day he called on one Daniel Lathrop, who lived at 11 Columbia Terrace. Lathrop immediately rushed Racina off the porch and had him arrested, charging him with “loitering on his premises and using loud and indecent language”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And so Judge Abraham again had opportunity to pass judgment on one of Jehovah’s witnesses. There was no evidence of loitering; no evidence of loud and indecent language; no evidence of any wrongful act. But Racina was one of Jehovah’s witnesses and had called on one of the residents of Weehawken. Therefore in defiance of law, righteousness and common decency this unjust judge sentenced Thomas Racina to sixty days in the county penitentiary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And some people imagine freedom of worship still exists in Weehawken.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>A Symposium on Herbs</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">H</span><span class="font8">ERBAL remedies are undoubtedly of Jehovah’s provision. Inorganic medicines are poor substitutes for herbs in the cure of disease, inasmuch as inorganic substances, while they may set up a reaction in the system, act as irritants rather than as stimulants and cleansers, and must be eliminated, because the human organism cannot assimilate them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Articles On the subject of herbal remedies, particularly those contributed by Dr. E. F. Powell, of England, and Mr. Jos. E. Meyer, of the Indiana Botanical Gardens, Hammond, Ind., have been much appreciated by </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age </span><span class="font8">readers. A reprinting has been urged. As the articles have much in common, the outstanding points are given herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Important Points</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Powell emphasizes the importance of right living, clean thinking and proper eating. He stresses the necessity of eating natural foods, and favors the elimination from the diet of most if not all flesh foods. Beans, potatoes, tubers, such as turnips, parsnips, etc., make substantial substitutes for meats. Massage and spinal adjustment (chiropractic) are also considered of value in certain cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Health is in large measure dependent upon proper eating; and since it is easy to err in the matter of diet, occasional or chronic illness is the rule rather than the exception. Herbal remedies are not a substitute for proper eating and right living, but they will aid the individual to pass through certain sieges of illness and disease. It is safe to say that under present imperfect conditions, and until the beneficent provisions of Jehovah’s kingdom of righteousness are made available to all men, few escape an occasional spell of sickness. The best that most people can expect is a reasonable degree of health and strength. Some are born with less vitality and innate health than others, and such find it necessary to exercise particular care and to take something now and then to give them a lift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is where herbal remedies come in, helping us out when through ignorance, carelessness or misfortune we have become ill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Herbal remedies lose their strength with age and should therefore be used as fresh as possible. No doubt last year’s stock is better than none at all, but this year’s gathering is better. Drugstores often carry old stock or sell tinctures, which have only part of the strength of the fresh herb. It is advisable to keep the herbs in airtight containers. Some lose their strength more quickly than others. Reliable herbalists are found in many of the larger cities, and one can be reasonably sure of getting this year’s stock from them. Of course, if one is familiar with herbs, and lives where he can do so, he can gather and dry them himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As some herbs are very bitter, licorice root, honey or molasses may be used for sweetening. Dr. Powell specifies old-fashioned black molasses (treacle). All these sweeteners are harmless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Some Simple Remedies</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anemia. This trouble is due to lack of iron in the blood. Ordinary iron tonics are made of inorganic iron and upset the stomach, cause constipation and discolor the teeth. Yellow dock root is a good herbal medicine. It may be combined with bogbean and comfrey leaves. An ounce each of the three ingredients simmered in a quart of water, cooled, strained and bottled, will make enough for several days. Take a wineglassful every four hours, or twenty minutes before breakfast, dinner and supper, and shortly before retiring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Appendicitis. Take one ounce each of elder blossom, peppermint and yarrow and simmer in three pints of water for twenty minutes. Sweeten with old-fashioned black treacle (molasses), and take a wineglassful every fifteen minutes until relieved. It must be taken hot every time, and must be continued, sometimes for twenty-four hours. Do not be afraid of the perspiration caused, or if you vomit. You will be better off with an empty stomach. Use the leaves left over from each infusion to make a hot compress to cover the abdomen. Nothing should be eaten until a cure is brought about, which is usually certain, even in severe cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Appetite. For loss of appetite the root of the blue or American gentian is of value, to which the same amount of licorice root is added for sweetening. Place a teaspoonful of the herb in a cup of boiling water and drink when cool, a large mouthful at a time. Two ounces of the gentian placed in a gallon of any sweet wine make an excellent tonic. Gentian bitters are made by adding two to four ounces to a gallon of wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Asthma. For this Dr. Powell prescribes vervain, horehound and elecampane, an ounce each, prepared and taken in the following manner: Simmer the herbs in three pints of boiling water for twenty minutes. Take a wineglassful every four hours. Reduce sugars and starchy foods in the diet. The same remedy is good for bronchitis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. Meyer recommends wild plum bark, a heaping teaspoonful in a cup of boiling water. Drink cool,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">during the day, a large mouthful at a time. The inner bark is used, cut into small pieces. It is gathered just before the flowers open. The yellow dock root, made into a tea, is also beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bladder Tbouble. Horsetail grass, or scouring rush, rich in organic minerals, especially lime, is useful for kidney and bladder troubles, especially in cases of gravel. Steep a teaspoonful of the plant in a cup of boiling water and drink one or two cupfuls in the course of the day, cold, a large mouthful at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cancer. Vegetarians do not have cancer. It is rare among the Jews, whose flesh foods are carefully inspected. A natural diet has been known to cure cancer. A remedy that has cured many severe cases is made of violet leaves, yellow dock and red clover tops. Simmer one ounce of each in three pints of water for twenty minutes. Strain and take a wineglassful every four hours. For external sores made a poultice of the used herbs and apply fresh night and morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Catarrh. Cut down the use of sugar and starch foods, and include an abundance of green, leafy vegetables in the diet. Dissolve a teaspoonful of salt in a tumblerful of warm water. Add ten to twenty drops of compound tincture of myrrh, and sniff up the nose until the solution returns through the mouth. Do this morning and evening or oftener. Pleurisy root is another remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Colds and Chills. A tea made of elder blossom, peppermint, yarrow and ginger is an effective remedy. Drink as much as you comfortably can, upon going to bed, and put a. hot water bottle to the feet and sweat the cause of the trouble away. Repeat within a few hours, if necessary. Don’t feed a cold; if you do you will soon have to starve a fever. Pleurisy root, taken as a tea, also promotes perspiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Constipation. Watch the diet. Eat more fruit and avoid white bread, condiments and sloppy puddings. Eat natural food that requires thorough chewing. A tea made of equal parts of senna leaves and mountain flax may be used as a remedy. Vary the quantity to suit the need, and reduce gradually. Butternut bark is a fine laxative for older folks. The inner bark of the root is used, which becomes brown upon exposure to air. It does not gripe. Equal parts of Rocky Mountain grape root, licorice and senna may be added. The directions for making this or any tea are the same: One or two heaping teaspoonfuls in a cup of boiling water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Consumption. Fresh air and fresh fruits and vegetables in abundance are important. Do not take more than three eggs per week. Use no vinegar or condiments. Eat as much watercress as possible. A marvelous herbal medicine is composed of one-half ounce each of marshmallow root, golden seal and pleurisy root, and an ounce each of linseed, Iceland moss and licorice root; simmer thirty minutes in five pints of water, stirring continually. Strain and add a pound of best </span><span class="font7">black treacle (molasses). Let cool and take a wineglassful every two hours in severe cases, less frequently in milder cases. This remedy is also good for coughs and for debility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Diarrhea. Raspberry leaves and bayberry bark, half an ounce each, simmered in one and a half pints of water for twenty minutes, and taken cold, is helpful. Add cinnamon if desired. Take a wineglassful every two or three hours. An infusion of slippery elm, a heaping teaspoonful in a cup of boiling water, is also a wonderful help in cases of diarrhea, as well as in dysentery and bronchitis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Diphtheria. Simmer one ounce of red sage in one and a half pints of water for twenty minutes. Take a wineglassful as frequently as the case demands. The patient should drink plenty of diluted lemon juice, and touch no food until well on the road to recovery. Gargle with the sage tea occasionally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dropsy. A tea made from the bark of the wahoo bush root is useful for the treatment of dropsy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dysentery. See under Diarrhea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dyspepsia. Keep to natural food, and chew it well. Find out what agrees with you, and stick to that. Avoid eating more than two kinds of food at a meal. A short fast has been known to cure certain cases, or an exclusive diet of whole-meal biscuit for a week or two. Wahoo bark tea is highly recommended for dyspepsia. It is an excellent tonic, laxative and alterative. The bark of the root is used, steeped in hot water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Epilepsy. Eat no meat, but plenty of vegetables and fruits, and especially onions. Instead of eating supper, take a cup of bran tea. The following remedy is beneficial: One ounce each of valerian root, vervain, wood betony and skullcap, simmered in four pints of water, twenty minutes. Take a wincglassful every four hours. This remedy, particularly the blue vervain, is also good for fits and falling sickness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Female Complaints. A tea made of equal parts of horehound and raspberry leaves will remove obstructions and tend to produce the normal. This remedy is harmless, and may be taken freely. It is especially beneficial in cases of pregnancy, and promotes easy birth in most cases, if taken freely (about a pint a day) in wineglassful doses for three or four months preceding the event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Goiter. Irish moss has been used extensively for goiter, as this ailment is due to a deficiency of iodine. Irish moss contains organic iodine in a form that is easily assimilated. It is harmless. Its taste is its only objection. About the best way to use it is to place a teaspoonful in a plate of soup, broth or milk. Boil the drinking water and watch the diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Headaches. Treat as for epilepsy, if the cause is in the nerves. If the trouble is due to stomach derangements, take the remedy suggested for liver trouble and watch your diet. (See Dyspepsia.) Worry is responsible for headaches in many cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Heart Trouble. The stomach is often responsible for what appears to be heart trouble. Motherwort, gentian root and skullcap, one ounce each, simmered twenty minutes in three pints of water and strained, may be taken, a wineglassful every four hours. If you eat meat it should be boiled; flesh with the blood in it is bad for the heart, as well as being objectionable in other ways. Jehovah instructed the Israelites to eat no meat with the blood in it. The blood left in the veins of a dead animal is full of uric acid and other toxins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Plenty of fresh air is important. Chiropractic or osteopathy is of benefit in many cases. Walking and light exercises are valuable, but not to the point of fatigue. Leave off at the first signs of fatigue or palpitation. Do not smoke, and use no alcoholic drinks. Do not drink with your meals or too soon thereafter. Wait about half an hour and then drink moderately. Be careful in sex matters, as excesses are often the cause of heart trouble. Many cases can be cured or greatly improved by following these simple instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Incontinence of Urine (Bedwetting). Yarrow is used for this trouble. Parents should never punish children for inability to hold their urine, at night or during the day. The tea is prepared by steeping a teaspoonful of the herb, cut small or granulated, in a cup of boiling water. Drink the cupful, cold, during the day, a large mouthful at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Inflammations. For inflammation in any part of the body the remedy is elder blossom, peppermint, yarrow and ginger tea. (See Appendicitis.) This wonderful remedy will save life at the eleventh hour, says Dr. Powell. And it is absolutely harmless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Influenza. The same as for colds and chills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kidney Trouble. Pay attention to diet; take plenty of exercise; drink plenty of diluted lemon juice. An ounce each of buchu leaves, parsley and juniper berries, simmered in three pints of water for twenty minutes, should be pressed and strained and taken in wineglassful doses every four hours, or more frequently if necessary. Osteopathic treatments are sometimes advisable. Cold water packs applied nightly over the small of the back are helpful; also.steam baths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sluggish Liver. Diet as for dyspepsia, and take a wineglassful of the following remedy every four hours, or, in severe cases, every hour: Half an ounce each of horehound, agrimony, crushed ginger, gentian, simmered in two and a half-pints of water for twenty minutes. Cold or tepid friction baths each morning are good. Steam baths are beneficial in severe cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another remedy is mandrake root, black root, colic root and sacred bark. Mix an ounce of each, and boil a teaspoonful of the mixture in a cup of water for one minute. Strain, cool, and take from cup or wineglass as in other eases. One or two days’ treatment is usually sufficient. The remedy is bitter, and may be sweetened as suggested in the introduction to this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lumbago. Queen of the meadow root is the thing for lumbago. Prepare in the usual way, and take in wineglassful doses or large mouthfuls, using about a cupful in the course of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lungs. Coltsfoot tea is most beneficial, and is widely used in eases of bronchitis, asthma, coughs, colds, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nerves. Pay attention to your diet. (See under Dyspepsia.) Use medicine mentioned under Epilepsy. A cheerful mind is important. (See Proverbs 17: 22.) Sexual excesses must be avoided. A cold friction bath every morning is strongly recommended. Pure olive oil is also very good; take a tablespoonful each morning, or dress your salads with it. Onions are also of value, and should be used freely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Kola nuts are a fine nervine and tonic. They may be taken in the powdered form, a teaspoonful or two before breakfast, salted to taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Black cohosh is also good for the nervous person. A tea made of equal parts of black cohosh, sacred bark and Canada snakeroot is used for nervous headaches or nervous prostration and many other nervous afflictions of the female organism. A teaspoonful of the root to a cup of boiling water, taken during the course of the day, is the average dose. If the tea is made too strong it may bring on a headache, but it is harmless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Neuralgia. For this affliction black cohosh is recommended. (See under Nerves.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Obesity. Sea wrack has been used for ages by fat people who wanted to reduce. It is also called gulf wrack and bladder wrack. The average dose is one teaspoonful three times a day, taken in coffee or as it is. While sea wrack is the most harmless and best remedy for obesity, it will not affect everyone in the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Piles. Treat as for constipation. A good herbal ointment will be helpful, but the cure must come through a correction of the cause. Improve the bowel action and the blood by proper dieting, and the trouble will disappear. Tea made of white oak bark and fennel seed in equal parts is another remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pimples and Eruptions. The leaves and twigs of sweet fern brewed into a strong tea, used both as a drink and as an external wash, will clear up an unsightly and pimply skin. Drink a cupful a day in large mouthfuls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pneumonia. The same as for colds and chills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rheumatism. Adopt a vegetarian diet and eat plenty of greens. Avoid tea, coffee, cocoa and condiments. Use bran tea and unsweetened lemonade instead. Simmer the following in two quarts of water: One ounce each of bogbean, centaury, yarrow and yellow dock, and a dozen cayenne pods. Rub compound tincture of myrrh into the painful parts morning and evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Virginia snakeroot is another remedy for this affliction. Place a teaspoonful of the granulated or powdered root in a glass container, pour in boiling water, allow to stand until cool, strain, and drink a cupful a day, a mouthful at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Black cohosh, prickly ash, burdock and pokeroot, is also used for rheumatism, prepared in the following way: Mix equal parts of these herbs, and place a teaspoonful in a cup of boiling water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rickets. Plenty of orange juice and grapes should be given to children having this trouble. As they grow older include plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables in the diet. Onions are excellent, as well as whole-wheat bread and fresh dairy butter. Very young children may be given vegetable juices or liquids drained from eooked vegetables, particularly if orange juice cannot be obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A good medicine is made by simmering half an ounce each of wild tansy and agrimony in a pint of water for fifteen minutes. Strain and sweeten with molasses or honey, or with licorice root. Give young children a tablespoonful four times a day; older children more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sleeplessness. Blue skullcap, catnip and peppermint mixed together and used, one or two heaping teaspoonfuls to a cup of boiling water, make a good nervine and sedative. Drink a cupful warm just before you go to bed and you will not be bothered with wakefulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another remedy is made of valerian root, vervain, wood betony and skullcap, one ounce each simmered in four pints of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stomach Trouble. Juniper-berry oil is an excellent stomach tonic. A handful of the berries themselves placed in a gallon of any kind of wine makes a fine stomach tonic. (See also under Dyspepsia.) Eliminate the cause of the trouble by eating properly. In cases of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sour stomach</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">gas,</span><span class="font7"> sweet flag is very beneficial. Two ounces of sweet flag root, one ounce black cohosh, one ounce sassafras bark; mix together and place a heaping teaspoonful of the mixture in a cup of water, bring to boiling point, and drink cool, a large mouthful at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tonic. Mix equal parts of Rocky Mountain grape root, butternut bark and marshmallow root and place a heaping teaspoonful of the mixture in a cup of boiling water. Strain, cool, and drink a cupful, a little at a time, during the day. This drink is slightly laxative and quite harmless. It may be given to children, but is of special value to older people who have poor circulation and take cold easily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Worms. Camomile tea is used to expel worms. It is made like ordinary household tea: Simply steep a large teaspoonful of the flowers in a cup of boiling water for a half hour. Strain and drink a half cupful, hot or cold, before going to bed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wounds. A dressing of lemon juice, water, and a few drops of compound tincture of myrrh is ideal for all wounds and sores. In nearly all cases this is all that is necessary. There are many good herbal ointments that can be supplied by any reliable herbalist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another wash for wounds and ulcers is a tea made from horsetail grass. Just steep a teaspoonful of the dried plant in a cup of boiling water, and use when cool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In conclusion, the following from the pen of Dr. Otto Raubenhauer, Ph. G., Phar.D., Ph.M., is of interest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Herbs are the oldest form of medicine. Hippocrates (460-370 B. C.), the father of medicine, was an herbalist. Botanical medicine is the oldest branch of medicine. . . . Herbs contain the vital elements (vitamins and organic minerals) which are deficient in the diseased body. . . . Herbs also promote the elimination of waste matter and poisons from the system by simple natural means. Herbs, when correctly used, assist nature in its fight against disease. Herbs are consequently better suited for the treatment of disease than chemicals and other substances foreign to the human body. Therefore use herbs!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>America,</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HIS little book, 212 pages, by Oscar Brum-back, copyrighted by Voters’ Guide Publishing Company, Washington, D.C. (50c), contains plenty of material for thought. Its writer, thoughtful, patriotic, believes he sees what is wrong with America, and how it can be saved. But it cannot be saved. Jehovah’s people will be interested by the fact that over two pages are devoted to a quotation from Judge .Rutherford’s lecture “Can the American Government Endure?” Some of the facts cited are well known to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> readers; others they have not seen before; but there is no objection to repeat-</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Awake !</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">ing many times any truth that is important for the people to know. Thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Approximately $17,000,000,000 -worth of government bonds, bearing interest at approximately 4 percent, are in the possession of the twelve privately owned regional Federal Reserve Banks and member banks; this stupendous sum, collecting an annual tribute in the way of interest of approximately $680,000,000 from the taxpayers of the United States, was acquired by the twelve regional banks merely by a bookkeeping entry and without paying one penny to the United States government in exchange therefor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Furthermore, do our people know that against these bonds, upon which they are continuing to pay interest, the United States Bureau of Engraving and Printing prints for these twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, and member banks, currency for the mere cost of engraving—an average of about thirty cents per thousand dollars? While the twelve regional banks get government bonds for nothing, they use the bonds as the base against which to print currency, which, therefore, they get for nothing, except the mere cost of printing the money!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Big Steal</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The foregoing fact constitutes what Mr. Bruinback designates “The Big Steal”. Every honest writer on finance gets to know that fact sooner or later, and to marvel at it, but the common people, even when they see the figures and the affidavits, cannot and will not bring themselves to see that bankers can get the use of money for a cost of 30c per $1,000, while other citizens often cannot get it at all, and when they do get it they have to pay usury (interest) by which, in the long run, they are ruined. Here is what happened to the savings of the people in the boom year of 1928-1929:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">219,000 families saved $8,000,000,000 out of the $8,250,000,000,’ and 16,200,000 families saved the balance, $250,000,000; while the remaining 13,845,000 American families were not able to save even so much as a nickel in the “prosperity year” of 1929! The 219,000 families saved thirty-two times as much in that year as all the other 29,685,000 families together. Or, to put it another way, we find that the 219,000 families in America at the top of the heap saved on an average of $36,529.68 per family, while 16,200,000 families who were able to save something averaged about $15.43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All the big fellows are in banking, directly or indirectly, and the earnings of the country fall into their possession by the trainload. Thus, when you go to Pittsburgh, you soon learn that Andrew Mellon is the biggest banker in the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Mellon fortune, in 1932, aggregated not less than $10,000,000,000, and everybody knows that the Mellon fortune does not compare with the Rockefeller fortune, or with the fortune of J. P. Morgan, who through his more than 2,242 corporations is said to own or control approximately $62,000,000,000; more than one-fifth of our estimated national wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Huey Long Is Dead</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Huey Long is dead, but he is very much alive in Mr. Brumback’s great collection of startling facts gathered together by the Louisiana statesmen and others who have the real welfare of the American citizen at heart. He quotes Mr. Long as having said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has said that after analyzing the bank accounts in the United States it has found that one one-hundred-and-fiftieth—get that!—one one-hundred-and-fiftieth part of the bank depositors own two-thirds of the money that is in the banks. Not one one-hundred-and-fiftieth part of all the people, but one one-hundred-and-fiftieth part of the people who have money to put in banks own two-thirds of the money that is on deposit in the banks. Do senators want to know where we are headed ? We are headed just as straight to hell as any bullet ever went to its mark.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That was pretty plain talk from even Huey Long, but how is this from Federal Judge John C. Knox, of Pennsylvania, in 1935, speaking to the Harvard Alumni Club and addressing Big Business thus?—</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You’ve stolen just about everything there is to steal in this country. The people are desperate. Mend your ways, or you will be compelled to suffer the consequences from the men and women you have ruined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Creation of a Depression</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The common people are kidded and deluded into thinking that periodical depressions are inevitable in a land where there is too much of everything, all of which is the pure, unadulterated bunk. Hon. Alan Goldsborough, of Maryland, authority on the money question, and a member of the House Banking and Currency Committee, tells how the depressions are deliberately created.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After a period of depression, the banks gradually begin to lend; book credits created by bank loans become bank deposits; bank deposits passing by check increase the circulating medium of the country. Business expands on borrowed money. Increased circulation raises prices. In other words, we are in a so-called “period of prosperity”. The more credit is given by the banks, the greater the volume of our circulating medium becomes; prices mount; the higher prices justify more bank credits; and the boom is on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One day the master minds meet and decide that the time has come to gather in the accumulated property of the people. Rumors are started that conditions are unsound. Frightened city and community bankers begin to curtail their loans. Rediscount rates are raised in Federal Reserve banks, thus requiring further curtailment. Repayment of loans to the banks causes a fall of deposits, the credit currency is contracted, falling prices close factories and put workmen on the streets, and the price of basic products—corn, wheat, cattle, hogs—takes an immediate drop. We become a nation of debtors unable to pay our debts, and the accumulation of years of self-denial is swept away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Carlisle Knew About This</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nobody in the United States ever knew any more about money than John G. Carlisle, many times speaker of the House of Representatives, secretary of the treasury in President Cleveland’s cabinet. March 1, 1881, he told the national House of Representatives:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The banks have it in their power to contract the currency and produce financial distress, involving every interest in the country and embarrassing the operations of the government itself, whenever they may think it will promote their special interests to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The selections from Judge Rutherford’s address “Can the American Government Endure ?” are to be found on pages 83-85, and can be obtained in full by addressing the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, Brooklyn, N. Y., and sending 5c for postage for the booklet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Reverting again and again to this ridiculous swindle by which the great bankers get perfectly good money for the mere cost of printing it, Mr. Brumback, under the heading “Chaotic Results of Depression to Spring of 1936”, gives several pages of how banks, industries, labor, agriculture, homes, schools, crime, etc., were affected. A single paragraph reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Homes. Homes and fams, many of them refinanced through the Government, are being sold out by the thousands every day through mortgage foreclosures and for taxes. All this staggers humanity, especially when one knows that hundreds of millions of dollars annually are collected by the Government to pay interest (tribute) to international bankers who hold billions of dollars’ worth of Government bonds which they get for nothing and against which the Government prints for them money for the mere cost of the printing—about 30 cents per thousand dollars—while continuing to pay these bankers interest on the bonds at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Shall Be Done About It?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Brumback thinks that something should be done about the big steal, and has carefully selected planks from the platforms of various political parties which, if enacted into legislation, would correct matters. This is just to say, in all kindness, that no such legislation will be enacted. The only deliverance that will come is at the hands of God. The money plank which Mr. Brumback advocates is as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">(a) We advocate a Constitutional amendment giving Congress the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">exclusive, authority</span><span class="font7"> to coin and regulate the value of money.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(b) We demand that the United States Treasury shall be the only agency authorized by Congress to issue United States Money.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">(e) We demand the repeal of the law passed in 1873 demonetizing silver. That law was passed by fraud and at the bidding of foreign international bankers. Not having been able to subjugate this country either during or since the Revolutionary War, they sought to attain the same ends through the demonetization of silver, well knowing that this would seriously impair American trade with four-fifths of the civilized world which uses silver as its sole medium of exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(d) We demand that the government not only remonetize both silver and gold as a standard of money but also that these two metals be nationalized and at all times deposited in United States Treasury vaults wholly within the continental limits of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Among the manifestly just and reasonable planks embodied in the proposed program is the following, which will appeal to every thoughtful person:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We demand that in the event of war for the defense of our nation and its liberties, there shall be a con. scription of wealth as well as a conscription of men. We demand, furthermore, that henceforth all American War Profits shall be taxed one hundred percent by the Federal Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Our Foreign Policy”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From the chapter entitled “Our Foreign Policy” the following paragraphs are selected, which tell their own story:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a matter of record, as Colonel House, Woodrow Wilson’s chief adviser, in his memoirs admits, that despite our professions of fighting “to make the world safe for democracy”, President Wilson, five months before America entered the World War, had not decided on which side we should fight, stating to Colonel House that we had as many grievances against one side as we had against the other! This was during Wilson’s second presidential campaign with its famous slogan, “He kept us out of war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In connection with the investigations made by the Senate Munitions Committee, there was disclosed a cablegram to Woodrow Wilson, dated March 5, 1917, thirty days before America entered the war, from Walter Hines Page, the American ambassador to Great Britain, which states in effect that if we were to protect our business interests, we must join the war as soon as possible on the side of the Allies; that the Allies had lost the war; that it had become extremely unlikely that the United States would become involved ; and that J. P. Morgan &amp;&nbsp;Co. and other international bankers had wagered on a losing horse and made loans to the Allies which would be lost. Ambassador Page urged, therefore, that the United States declare war to save and guarantee Allied credits. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Within thirty days the United States, with as many grievances against one side as the other, entered the Great War which cost us hundreds of thousands of lives, a billion dollars in interest annually ever since on non-productive bonds required to fight it; a war in which there were 22,000 new American millionaires created out of war profits alone in a conflict which necessitated our appropriating $42,000,000,000 to fight and win it; a war from which we asked nothing and got nothing in return—not even the island of Yap as a cable station to help us protect ourselves in the Far East. That war, from first to last, will cost the taxpayers of the United States $150,000,000,000 in sweat and toil, with thousands widowed, orphaned and bereaved, and countless thousands maimed and broken for life. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We can recall that, not only did the French Government require America to pay a duty on all food and war supplies shipped into France, but that when the war was over, the French Government sought to impose a duty on the balance of these same supplies before allowing America to take them out of France. As a result, the United States Government “sold” to the French Government these $2,000,000,000 worth of supplies for $407,000,000, which sum never has been paid; and yet France, after keeping what she wanted, sold more than enough of the balance of these supplies to pay for the whole lot. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lest our children or our children’s children may become involved in the quarrels of foreign nations, let them ... be told that the United States paid France damages even for the ground over which American armies fought and for the damage done to French property by American shells used in driving the German armies out of France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nor is that all. When the United States armies went into France, they dredged her harbors, and rebuilt her docks, in addition to erecting more than a thousand miles of telephone and telegraph lines. It was found necessary to build hundreds of miles of railroads, since American cars and locomotives shipped to France were too Idrge to run over French railroads. Today all these contributions to French industrial improvement and development are still in France, being used by the people of France, the first and last cost having been borne by the American people. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Nor must it ever be forgotten that during the Great War England borrowed money from Japan and the Japanese got their money back, paid with money borrowed by England from the United States. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before those Allied nations were through, we loaned England $4,715,000,000; France over $5,000,000,000; Italy $3,150,000,000. Twelve nations owe the United States over $13,000,000,000—the principal of which war debts we cancelled—and those nations then refused to pay us even the interest on the money they “borrowed” for rehabilitation purposes after the war. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the “Merry-Go-Round”, a daily column in the Washington </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Herald,</span><span class="font7"> of January 28, 1936, we read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Later, when the United States entered the war, the two loans—$294,000,000 to the British and $200,000,000 to the French—were passed on to the Treasury by Morgan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Morgan admitted to the Munitions Committee that the Treasury was entitled to this collateral, but since his testimony the committee has unearthed the fact that the Treasury never got it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Our Banking System”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In conclusion a few excerpts are made from the section on banking as carried on in these United States under the government “of the people, by the people, and for the people”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It has been a state secret that under the Federal Reserve Banking Act passed in 1913 the superbanks can get all the money from the Government they want to buy government bonds and to loan the people through the small banks, merely by paying the actual cost of printing the money—an average of thirty cents a thousand dollars—believe it or not!!!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such are the methods actually employed by our money masters who plotted and planned and carried out this depression which is greater than all our previous depressions combined. And every one of these maneuvers employed by these financial racketeers is legalized under the Federal Reserve Banking system. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Air. E. W. Alason, for many years a great student of banking . . . reports:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The United States Government lends $1,000 to a farmer for $45 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The United States Government lends $1,000 to a home-owner for $60 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The United States Government lends $1,000 to a Federal Reserve Bank for only 30c a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“ ??Wiiy isn’t a farmer or home-owner as good </span><span class="font4">AS A BANKER??</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It is an eye-opener. It fills with rage the farmer who borrowed $3,000 from the Farm Loan and pays $135 a year for it to learn that the private Federal Reserve Bank receives a like amount from the same Government for 90 cents and the 90 cents is for the life of the paper the bills are printed on, which runs an average of two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Then when he learns that the . . . Government that loans for 90 cents borrows the same'package of $3,000 back and pays $120 a year for what costs the bank 90 cents he can justly say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“ ‘Am I seeing things? Is the President and the whole Administration crazy ? Or is the Administration just robbing the farmers and laborers and giving to the bankers?’ ”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Coming Back from Hell</span></h4>
<div>
<p><span class="font15">M</span><span class="font8">ANY are coming back from hell! Of course, this does not refer to Dante’s hell, over the portals of which were written the words, “All ye who enter here leave hope behind.” No one ever came back from Dante’s hell, for the simple reason that no one ever went there. Dante’s hell was simply a figment of the imagination and has no foundation in fact or in Scripture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible hell is something different. “Ah,” you say, “the lake of fire and brimstone!” No, not at all. The lake of fire and brimstone is not the same as hell, as will be clearly shown. It has for a long time been popular to define “hell” as a place of torment and suffering of various kinds, and this idea has been so commonly accepted that many people are entirely unaware that this is not at all what the Bible teaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God’s Word, the Bible, states that people are coming back from hell: “Death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them.” (Revelation 20:13) That at once disposes of the “eternal” feature of the subject of “eternal torment”, and naturally raises the question of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font8"> they are coming back from hell. Does it seem reasonable to suppose that these unfortunate ones have been suffering in hell as a punishment for sins, some for years, others for centuries, and still others for millenniums? If such were the case some evidently suffer a much shorter period of time than others. Yet ecclesiastics teach that those in hell are there because of their sins and are suffering torment eternal in duration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Scriptures present an altogether different view. It is both reasonable and true. The Bible hell is a condition of unconsciousness, where there could be no suffering. The word “hell” in what is usually called the “Old Testament” is a translation from the Hebrew word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">sheol.</span><span class="font8"> This same word is repeatedly translated “grave”. Surely the same word could not have such opposite meanings as the words “hell” and “grave” convey to the mind at the present time. An examination of all the places in which the word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font8"> appears in the Hebrew shows at once that it does not at any time refer to a place of suffering, but has reference to the condition of death. Whatever the word means in one place, it must have a similar meaning in another. It certainly could not mean a place of darkness and silence in one case and a place of fire, brimstone, and suffering anguish in another. “There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">[s/ieo?].” (Ecclesiastes 9:10) This shows at once that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">sheol,</span><span class="font8"> from which the English word “hell” is translated, does not mean a place of consciousness, but a condition of inactivity and unconsciousness, in short, the death </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">condition. </span><span class="font8">In fact, the word is translated “grave” just as often as it is translated “hell”: 31 times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To further prove that in the Bible “hell” does not mean a place of suffering or a condition of torment, it should be noted that Jacob, who had the Lord’s approval, fully expected to go there, and the faithful Job prayed that he might be hidden there, saying, “Oh, that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol!”—Job 14:13, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.;</span><span class="font8"> Genesis 42:38; 44:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Job also said, ‘There the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.’—Job 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In that portion of the Bible written (in the Greek language) after the time of Christ, the word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">hades</span><span class="font8"> is used to convey the same thought as the word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font8"> does in the Hebrew Scriptures. In the Common Version of the Bible </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">hades</span><span class="font8"> is translated both “hell” and “grave”, but in the Revised Version it is left untranslated. It means, like </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">sheol,</span><span class="font8"> the death condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Dead Are Asleep</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fact that the Bible refers to the dead as </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">asleep</span><span class="font8"> agrees perfectly with this proper understanding of the words </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">hades.</span><span class="font8"> All who die, both good and bad, go to hell, and they remain there until they are called forth in the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some, and particularly ecclesiastics, will say, “That is true of the body, but not of the soul.” Such claim that the soul lives on. If that were true it would not be proper to say, as the Bible does, that “the dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence”.—Psalm 115:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is the soul, the individual, and not merely his body, that dies. “The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">soul</span><span class="font8"> that sinneth, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">it </span><span class="font8">shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) Speaking of the Egyptians, the Scriptures state that God spared not </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">their souls</span><span class="font8"> from death. (Psalm 78: 50) The following question emphasizes the same truth: “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">his soul</span><span class="font8"> from the [power] of the grave </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">[sheol]</span><span class="font8"> ?”—Psalm 89:48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Only by understanding what “hell” is can one appreciate what it means to say that people are coming back from hell. They are unconscious in the Bible hell, and are coming forth—unto resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">316</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Is there, then, no future life? Is there no hope for the dead? Yes, indeed. That is exactly what the expression “Coming back from hell” means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The assurance that they are coming back from hell speaks of hope and release. Hear the word of the Lord: “I will ransom them from the power of [hell]; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; 0 [hell] I will be thy destruction; repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.” (Hosea 13:14; see </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font8"> This show's that although everyone has been and is passing into “hell”, the death condition, it is Jehovah’s purpose to deliver them. He will ransom them; which means that a price will be paid for their release. Human creatures are dying because “by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men”. (Romans 5:12) It is Jesus’ sacrificed life that constitutes the ransom price for the release of Adam and his descendants. Since every human creature was condemned in one, they can all be released (as many as will) by one, namely, Jesus. Christ gave His life for us. He tasted death for every man. (Hebrews 2:9) “The wages of sin is death [not eternal torment]; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.”—Romans 6: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus, by His death, secured the right to release those who had gone to the Bible hell. He was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, being made a partaker of the divine life. God highly exalted Him, giving Him a name that is above every name, that He might be the agent of Jehovah in carrying out His divine purpose. This is shown in Revelation (1:18): “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” Jesus has the power not only to save people from death, but also the power to bring back from the death condition those who are already there. The words of Revelation 20:13 shall have fulfillment: “Death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Why Bring Them Back?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What will happen to the people after they return from hell? Remember that God redeemed them from hell, ransomed them, that is, provided the price, the precious life of His Son, for their release. That being the case, He undoubtedly has a good purpose respecting them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘The ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.’ (Isaiah 35:10; 51:11) This referred, partially, to the return of Israel from Babylon, nearly 2500 years ago. It refers, further, to the return of those who have been in captivity to mystic Babylon and who now, as witnesses to the praise of Jehovah, are rejoicing in their restoration to His favor. But, in order to have everlasting joy and gladness one must have everlasting life, and in due time this will be the portion of the people of good will now “returning” to Zion and also the millions that are “coming back from hell”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All this is corroborated by Revelation 21:1-4, where the new government of righteousness is represented as coming into power. “God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But what is the meaning of the words, in Revelation 20:13,14, to the effect that ‘after death and hell gave up the dead that were in them they were judged every man according to their works’ ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If this refers to past works, it would undoubtedly mean that all would be ‘cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death’. If such were God’s purpose one might reasonably inquire why the dead are awakened at all? It would seem to serve no good or reasonable end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The only way to come to a consistent, reasonable and Scriptural conclusion is to seek information from other parts of the Bible bearing on the same subject, comparing scripture with scripture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“When thy [Jehovah’s] judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness,” says the prophet. (Isaiah 2G: 9) “Jesus Christ . . . shall judge the quick [living] and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom.” (2 Timothy 4:1) These scriptures show that the purpose of the judgment work is that during the Kingdom the people may learn righteousness. That shows they had not previously learned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the kingdom of Christ (represented figuratively by a mountain) wonderful blessings will come to “all peoples”, a veritable feast of good things, and in this kingdom Jehovah will destroy “the vail that is spread over all nations”. The veil of ignorance, superstition and misinformation will be removed. Death will be ‘swallowed up in victory’ and thus ‘all tears will be wiped from off all faces’.—Isaiah 25: 6-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the return of the dead from “the land of the enemy” great joy will fill the hearts of all the people of good will. (Compare Jeremiah 31:16 with Matthew 2:18.) The dead shall come back from hell and have a real opportunity to know and serve God, and on the basis of their response to that opportunity will be their judgment. They will be judged ‘out of the things written in the books’, not on the basis of their past acts, but on what their works shall be. The opening of the book of life signifies that entries are to be made therein of those who are ultimately accounted worthy of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Present Responsibility</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By the foregoing it is not intended to suggest that no one has any responsibility under the present reign of sin. Everyone has responsibility according to the knowledge he has obtained or that which he has sought to evade. A great responsibility rests upon those lands that have enjoyed special opportunity to know the truth of God’s Word. But it must be remembered that even in professedly Christian lands great numbers of people live in gross ignorance, as in Spain, for instance, where they are prevented from knowing the way of salvation, by those who should be their teachers and who profit by keeping the people in ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A great responsibility rests upon these religious teachers. Jesus said of a similar class in His day, ‘How can you escape the judgment of hell </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">[Gehenna] T</span><span class="font8"> (Matthew 23: 33) In this verse the word “hell” has been used to translate a Greek word which does not refer merely to the death condition. It has reference to a valley outside of Jerusalem into which the garbage and refuse of the city were cast, and where carcasses of animals (and sometimes of criminals) were destroyed by worms and fire. It was the valley where the fire was not quenched and there were worms continuously, and where complete destruction took place. The idea of torment and suffering did not enter into the picture. Only carcasses were cast there. See Isaiah 66:24; Mark 9:44,46,48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The lake of fire, mentioned in The Revelation, corresponds to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gehenna,</span><span class="font8"> the valley of fire. Both picture the utter destruction of the finally incorrigible. “The wicked shall not be.” (Psalm 37:10) This would not be a true statement if the wicked were suffering eternal torments in some far corner of God’s fair universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All the nations that forget God shall be turned back (or returned) to “hell”, death. (Psalm 9:17) This could not refer to those who had never known God; and note also that the word “returned” indicates that they had once been in “hell”, had come back from hell, and then, forgetting God, had been sentenced to death again, thus dying “the second death”.—Revelation 20:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God will by no means clear the guilty. While He has no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that they turn from their wickedness and live, yet if they refuse His grace they will be everlastingly destroyed from “the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power”.— 2 Thessalonians 1:9; Ezekiel 18: 23, 32; 33:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Glorious Prospect</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How glorious will be that eternity upon which those of good will shall enter when the wicked shall vanish away for ever, like smoke! The righteous shall be abundantly satisfied with the luxury of Jehovah’s house and shall drink of the river of His pleasures. (Psalm 36:8; 115:16) The entire universe is God’s, but the earth has He given to the children of men for their particular portion. The earth abideth for ever. God created it not in vain, but formed it in order that it might be inhabited and be filled with His glory. (Ecclesiastes 1:4; Isaiah 45:18; Numbers 14:21) In beautiful symbolism the prophet portrays the perfection of the earth made new.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands. Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to [Jehovah] for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.—Isaiah 55:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf, and the young lion, and the falling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall cat straw like the ox. . . . They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain [kingdom] ; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of [Jehovah], as the waters cover the sea. (11:6,9) For behold, I create new heavens [Christ and His kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">heirs] and a new earth [regenerated mankind] : and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind. And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; . . . plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat.—65:17, 21, 22; see </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These words could have only a very limited application to the return of Israel from Babylon, nor did they have their real fulfillment then. They are prophetic statements relating to the glorious kingdom of peace and blessing, now due, wherein the “ransomed of the Lord shall return” from the land of the enemy, from mystic Babylon now and, later, from the Bible hell.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">D</span><span class="font8">IRECT responsibility for the many thousands murdered in the civil war in Spain is claimed by Major Hugh B. C. Pollard, British Roman Catholic authority on firearms. Admittedly deceiving the British and Spanish governments as to his purpose, he delivered a plane to General Franco at Las Palmas, Canary Islands. By “devious channels” (guess the channels) he got word to Franco that the plane was there and at his service. Franco arrived, flew the plane to Tetuan, capital of Spanish Morocco, where he knew other disloyal Spanish officers were ready to betray their country, and the present murders followed as a matter of course.</span></p>

Further, also, is the interesting fact that, according to the British war office, air attacks from a height may be delivered at such a distance that the aircraft concerned can be neither seen nor heard.

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark51"></a>The Inquisition at Lagrange, Georgia</span></h3>
<p><span class="font22">D</span><span class="font15">ID Bishop G. P. O’Hara of Savannah, Georgia, initiate the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses at Lagrange, Georgia? Has the Roman Hierarchy, through this high prelate or its Jesuit agents, reached out into this Protestant area and pulled off an inquisition equal to that of the Dark Ages ?</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370811_files/g_E_19370811-2.png" alt="" style="width:230pt;height:265pt;">
<p><span class="font13">“Smoke of the incense”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand.—Revelation 8: 4</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">Whatever may be the answer to these questions, the damning evidence shows that the intolerant spirit of Roman Catholicism is busily at work in this supposedly Protestant city, and the name of Lagrange has become a byword among decent and respectable people because of the unbelievable treatment it has accorded Christian men and women. And this treatment is directly chargeable to the clergy, both Catholic and Protestant, who not only have refrained from objecting to this intolerance but have been the chief instigators of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The story that follows will fill with indignation the heart of fair-minded Americans. Hearts will be wrung with pain when notice is taken of the viciousness of the tools of clerical bigotry toward innocent men and women in the now besmirched “Empire State of the South”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">There were 56 of Jehovah’s witnesses involved ; sworn statements are at hand from 30; they agree, to the minutest detail. The most comprehensive statement is that of H. L. Rogers. It is in three installments, sent out from the dunghill on June 12,13 and 21. For convenience these three are merged into a single account. Where statements of others supply addi-t i o n a 1 information, reference is made to such; but where they are only corroborative they are not published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To Whom</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It May Concern:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the case the City of Lagrange vs. Jehovah’s witnesses. Jehovah’s witnesses have been accused of being Reds, sedition-ists, Communists and anarchists bent on tearing down law and order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Refuting that charge with facts, the following is submitted as evidence that the officials of Lagrange are un-American, trampling over the rights of citizens, viciously ignoring Constitutional barriers, punishing those who adhere to their legal rights, and by their actions have proved themselves to be lawless and truly tearing down duly constituted law and order:</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Lagrange Officials Are Anarchists</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">1. Seventy-six prisoners were transferred from the city of Lagrange to the Troup County stockade without commitment papers as provided by law.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">2. In transport of prisoners, officers drove through the city at the speed of sixty-five miles per hour for no cause whatsoever.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">3. The ordinance under which we were held is clearly illegal and any jackleg lawyer knows that it is wholly unconstitutional in its application to our work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">4. Lagrange officials permit all other persons to violate this ordinance, excepting Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">5. A permit to solicit orders for hosiery was granted by the chief on condition that this Jehovah’s witness distribute no Bible literature. As soon as he started work he was arrested and fined for doing the very thing they gave him a permit to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">6. At the time of signing some legal documents for Jehovah’s witnesses, the judge of the Superior Court of the county w’as so intoxicated that it was with great difficulty he was aroused to affix his signature. Other drunks are sent to jail and fined.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">7. The county judge on a writ of habeas corpus ordered Chief Matthews to produce each and every one of the fifty-six prisoners before his court. Only one was produced. All the others were worked on the streets. This plain case of contempt of court was passed unnoticed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Despisers of the Law</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">8. The law requires that city clerk approve bond on appeal by certiorari. Thomason, the official anarchist of the city, ordered the city clerk not to sign this bond as required by law. This illegal trick caused us the loss of our appeal rights.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">9. Officers arrested and locked up persons who were circulating lawful petitions for the redress of grievances, which right is expressly guaranteed in the United States Constitution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">10. The city attorney, Mr. Thomason, led a mob which forcibly compelled all petitioners to leave city, with dire threats of personal injury in case of return.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">11. The same Thomason personally attacked G. C. Powell, who only escaped by raising car window and starting car before this mob could interfere. Powell earned bruises and scratches as mute evidence of this vicious attack. Thomason again personally assaulted W. P. Hilldring, beating him in the face and on the head, causing severe bruises.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">12. Powell swore out a warrant for the arrest of Thomason on a charge of assault and battery; no official either in Lagrange or in Troup County would make the arrest.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>The City’s Official Perjurer</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">13. Powell then took the matter before the grand jury, seeking an indictment. At this hearing Thomason stated under oath that he had not attacked Powell, but that Powell had attacked him. This lie passed and no indictment was made.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">14. Plain-clothes inexperienced deputies, without badges and riding in taxicabs, arrested Jehovah’s witnesses and manhandled them when they asked for proof that they were officers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">15. Chief Matthews stated that if Jehovah’s witnesses ever returned to the city again he would leave town after turning them over to a mob, thus encouraging mob violence and denying Jehovah’s witnesses police protection.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">16. City officials took $25 security from T. J. Morris, violating their agreement with him, paid his fine with it against his will, and dismissed his case.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">17. Dr. Jas. A. Edwards, who pleaded “not guilty”, was sentenced before his trial was completed and was rushed off to join other prisoners;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">18. Most of the 76 “convictions” were entirely without evidence or even identification by officers. Being a Jehovah’s witaess was sufficient cause for arrest, and being arrested was sufficient cause for conviction.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Early History of the Case</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On May 17,1936, the writerand companions, following the example of Jesus and the early apostles, visited the city of Lagrange for the purpose of calling the attention of the people to God’s kingdom as taught in the Bible, to present to them the many evidences that the time has arrived for Jehovah, the true God and Creator, to establish this kingdom on earth, and that this kingdom is the only hope for the relief and blessing of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This work was systematically arranged so that every house would be visited and opportunity offered to secure literature dealing with the subject. This literature was placed with the people on small contributions insufficient to cover cost of printing, but taken as a token of interest in the subject and an evidence of good will. In case of poverty the literature was left free. The expense of this work was borne by ourselves personally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To prevent any interruption of our work a committee called upon the Police Department, giving them full information as to the Christian work in which we were engaged, explaining that it violated no law or ordinance pertaining to commercial work, that we preached the Gospel in this way just as Jesus did, for no selfish motive, but for the welfare of the people, and asked their co-operation. A list of the names and addresses of the workers in our party was furnished them for proper identification and to assure them of our good intentions and responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">No sooner had we started work than the police started arresting our people and carrying them off to jail. We found that an ordinance had been framed for the very purpose of preventing our message’s reaching the citizens of Lagrange. This ordinance seeks to prevent the distribution of all printed matter, no matter of what nature. As applied to us, the handing of a Bible free to a citizen would be an offense subject to arrest and fine. Presenting a social calling card or business card to another would violate this ordinance.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Law-Breaking Deliberately Ignored</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We found, however, that in practice it is applied only to our work. Citizens have testified that all other printed matter is freely distributed in Lagrange without hindrance. While working on the streets we have seen such literature distributed from door to door and the city officials all know it. In this we are denied the equal protection of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Disregarding the arrests because we knew we were doing injury to no one and were fully protected in such work by the fundamental law of the land which guarantees to all the right of freedom of worship and practice of Christian beliefs, we continued our work. The city officials were lawless in framing such an ordinance, as it has no constitutional right to exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A colored woman warned the writer of the arrests being made and invited him in so she could hide him from the police. She said, “Dese here podce am bad. Lagrange is de dirtiest hole in de whole United States.” We have learned by experience that this is true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">One hundred seventy-six workers were arrested and imprisoned for several hours, male and female together (which is forbidden by law), and confined for several hours in a small courtroom in-</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370811_files/g_E_19370811-3.png" alt="" style="width:229pt;height:265pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">sufficiently ventilated, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13">“Expressing</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">without toilet facilities</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">and where the heat became oppressive. Most of these arrests were made without the slightest proof of any law violation. The writer was arrested with a party of four others as they were getting into a car.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The police had no evidence that anyone in our party had called at any door or had offered literature to anyone. Yet in the so-called “trial” we were all “found guilty” and sentenced to $25 fine or thirty days at hard labor. In this all principles of justice or legal procedure were violated by city officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The following day the women were ordered out of jail and released. Troup County officials refused to accept women at the Stockade; hence their release. The men, seventy-six in number, were loaded in cars and trucks like cattle and hauled to the Troup County Prison and Stockade, four miles from the city. The turning of these city prisoners over to the county without commitment was another illegal act of Lagrange officials.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">This Troup County prison is nationally known as the worst prison in the worst county in the worst state of the United States, and was made famous as the prison from‘which the escape was made dramatized in the motion picture “I’m a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We were turned loose in the “Bull Pen” enclosed by a very high wire fence and containing possibly an acre of ground. The prison stands in the center of this enclosure. All regular prisoners are worked at hard labor on the roads from sun-up until sundown. Even in the longest days these poor prisoners must rise and eat breakfast before daylight and load up in trucks to go to their work before sunrise. They return at dusk, after which they eat supper, take a bath and go to bed. That continued treatment breaks the health of the best men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the dining room we saw the “stocks”, one of the most brutal methods of punishment ever invented. Just outside we saw bundles of hickory switches, each of them large enough to kill a man in the hands of a brutal</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">a preference” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font14">guard. These are used to</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">discipline prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Near by are the kennels of bloodhounds, kept for the purpose of running down escaped prisoners; and escapes are common, due to brutal treatment. Prisoners prefer escape and possible death to such a life of torture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Pistol shots are heard from time to time, day or night, and empty pistol shells are to be found on the ground in the “Bull Pen”. Probably most of this is to impress upon the prisoners the fact that these guns will shoot. A prisoner escaped the morning following our arrival. Soon sirens were going, men were running with rifles, the bloodhounds were loosed, ears were racing on the roads and the pursuit was in full swing. The prisoner was not found until months afterward.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>No Provision for Rest</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We found we could have our choice of beds, either on the ground, on the dining-room benches or tables, under the trees or in the trucks. Some preferred the tables. There was enough sticky syrup left on them to hold one from falling off in case he dropped to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Some had no coats and no protection whatever from the chilly nights, which made sleep almost impossible. After several nights of this exposure, fifty-nine single blankets were issued to seventy-six men. No provisions for beds were ever made during the ten nights spent in the stockade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At the end of this period we were brought back to the city. Shirts and overalls were issued to us and we were put to work on the streets and public works of the city. After five days’ work we were released on bond with agreement that one case would be appealed, letting that one ease stand for all the others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Inefficiency on the part of our attorneys so muddled our case legally that after a year of legal procedure and expense it was necessary that we all return on the 28th day of Slay, 1937, to complete our sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">During the first five days of our labor on the streets in 1936 six of our brethren were so broken in health that they were released and sent home. Sickness on the part of others made the payment of fine necessary, the city refusing to accept written statements from hospital and physicians as proof of illness. Fifty-seven returned to complete sentence and they were again returned to work on the streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At that time the city attorney, Mr. Thomason, was asked that we be released again on the same bond until a fair hearing of our case could be had in the courts. He flatly refused and made the bond conditions impossible. The venom and hatred of this man is beyond comparison. His keen mind is wholly devoted to our oppression and violent persecution. He gives all evidence of being controlled by demons.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>Thomason Reflects on His Parents</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Six days after our return a writ of habeas corpus was heard in the Superior Court of Troup County and denied by Judge Wyatt. An appeal was taken and an effort made to have prisoners released on bond pending decision of higher court. Thomason again flatly refused bond and stated that he was leaving the city on a fishing trip. On this occasion he became enraged and stated, “I'll work every one of the damned sons of b----s to the full end of their time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">You may ask why we were compelled to serve this time if in the right and after a year of legal procedure. We answer, our Constitutional rights and the validity of the Lagrange ordinance had never been heard in the courts prior to the last hearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">AH court action prior to that time was concerning a technical point involving our right of appeal. In tIris we were the victims of legal jockeying by crooked lawyers, lienee we must bear the full measure of our punishment before the courts decide whether we have committed a wrongful act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The details of the cruel, unjust and unusual treatment inflicted on us is explained more in detail in the accompanying sworn statement of facts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On June 1, 1936, the day after our release on bond, we again visited the city of Lagrange with a petition addressed to the city council of Lagrange, setting forth the facts in the case and asking that they so amend their ordinance as to clearly exempt Christian educational work on behalf of the citizens of Lagrange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This work was a proper petition, courteously and politely worded and done under the Constitutional provision that the right of peaceable assembly and the right of petition for the redress of grievances shall not be denied any citizen of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We had a grievance and we chose the lawful way of seeking relief. But constitutional law seems to be a thing unknown in Lagrange. At our first attempt to present this petition to the residents of Lagrange for their approval or disapproval, a mob already organized, and led by Thomason, fell upon us and forcibly drove us from the city with dire threats in ease we should return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Those who dared question the authority were assaulted and beaten. The police department aided this mob in their lawlessness and made several arrests. Seeing that not a shadow of a charge could be lodged against them, these prisoners were finally released.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>The Boast of the Anarchist</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On this occasion Chief Matthews stated that if Jehovah’s witnesses ever returned to the city, “I’ll turn you over to a mob and leave the city.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Our work has been done in Lagrange without trouble for years. No opposition was ever encountered until a few weeks after Bishop 0 ’Hara, of Savannah, came to Lagrange and dedicated a Catholic church. Then this ordinance was framed and our arrests began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Not a minister of Lagrange ever lifted his voice in protest against this lawlessness toward us. One minister appeared as a witness against us and was caught in a false statement on the witness stand, as the record of the testimony will show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Citizens report that other ministers were active in causing our arrests. What excuse can they offer before the great bar of Divine Justice for such persecution of Christians who tell the people the truths of the Bible, upon which truths they themselves are strangely silent ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jehovah will see that all these unlawful actions of Lagrange officials are dragged out into the open and exposed to the view of all persons of good will. The clergy undertook in a violent, underhanded and illegal way to hide themselves from public view by keeping from the citizens of Lagrange our literature which exposes all hypocrisy in this day of judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As in the ease of Jesus, these religionists and politicians concluded that it would be better that a few of Jehovah’s witnesses be made to suffer rather than that their racket be dragged out into the open and exposed to public view. They overlooked the fact that it is God’s Word making the exposure. They have miserably failed in their attempt to suppress the Truth.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Good Citizens Learning the Truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The citizens of Lagrange are learning the truth. Many good people here are indignant at the treatment accorded Jehovah’s witnesses. They ask for literature and are getting it. Even our guards are kindly toward us. Some police officials have shown their good will toward us. We get much frontpage publicity in the public press, space which could not be bought with money [but which these faithful men have obtained by their blood and sweat of face.-Ed.]. Thus our message and work are being brought before the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We sought to get the message of the Lord’s kingdom as taught in the Bible before the people of Lagrange. In this we have succeeded far beyond our expectations. Our enemies have helped us do it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The public press quoted the chief as saying that “the literature of</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370811_files/g_E_19370811-4.png" alt="" style="width:231pt;height:265pt;">

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">Jehovah’s witnesses borders on the rankest kind of Communism”. [What “church” is ranting about Communism?] Later our Brother Morris called his bluff on this statement and offered to post $25 to be paid to him if he could produce one single legal proof of that statement. The chief hung his head and has not yet produced any evidence. The offer still holds good to him or anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The fabulous lies which have been circulated about us, that we are anarchists, Reds, Communists and seditionists, all originate with the Catholic Hierarchy and are passed on to the people by their agents, allies and dupes for the sole purpose of frightening the people and preventing them from getting the simple Bible truths which we bring to them for their welfare and protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When the final chapter in the history of Lagrange is written, it will not be written by Thomason and his cohorts. Time will expose them in their true light, and their memory will be held in contempt by all honest persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And, be it remembered, that only honest persons will be found living in God’s kingdom of righteousness which is now being established. All others will come to a bad end.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Violated Own Health Ordinance</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Enclosed is a copy of poster published by the city of Lagrange forbidding cowpens (or pigpens) within 100 yards of any private residence. Yet the city quarters 56 of Jehovah’s witnesses in a small lot with a cow, mules, chickens and a horse for a close neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Mattresses upon which these men had to sleep were so close to the cowpen that urine splashed on their mattresses, and even on the men lying upon them. Drainage from this cowpen passed down a ditch between the mattresses, not more than three feet away on either side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">That we were so quartered is freely acknowledged by officials and postal authorities, as is shown by the delivery of a letter to the writer addressed to him at the “City Stock Yards”. The address on this letter is enclosed. It was mailed at Atlanta, Georgia, June 15, 1937, 11: 30 p.m., addressed “Mr. H. L. Rogers, Jehovah’s witness, City Stock Yards, c/o City Hall, Lagrange, Georgia”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Manure from these animals was piled in a huge pile at the opposite end of our “barracks” and not over ten feet from our mattresses. This unsanitary and filthy condition was reported to the State authorities, and on June 18 a State inspector investigated our quarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">He stated that such conditions were a gross violation of State laws, and promised action against the city. • However, if any action is taken it will be too late, for</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">* Details of this action immediately follow Mr. Rogers ’ explicit readable and valuable contribution to the history of America’s wallowing at the feet of Rome’s official inquisitors in Lagrange, Georgia, in 1937. </span><span class="font14">we are to be released today, after having endured this condition for twenty-five days.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>A Rome-Controlled City</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">About June 14 we were offered a parole by the chief of police, Mr. Matthews, provided we would agree not to return to the city again soon. When made known to the brethren by a brother whom the chief had asked to convey the offer to us, it was unanimously agreed that the offer would not even be dignified by an answer, and it was ignored. Innocent people do not accept paroles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">About June 16 we were informed through guards that we were to be released at noon on Saturday, June 19. The chief was asked to confirm the report, as many wished to make arrangements with friends outside for their transportation home. He replied that he was planning for our release on that date. Later, our attorney confirmed this statement from the chief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Cars came from far-distant points on Saturday, but at noon Saturday the chief announced that we were to be held until Monday evening, June 21. We explain this reversal of orders as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We prepared a letter to the mayor and city councilmen, and this was mailed, the original to the mayor, R. S. O’Neal, on June 16, and copies to the councilmen on June 18. This letter was courteous, clearly stating our position, the reason for our imprisonment, the filthy conditions under which we were quartered, and laid the responsibility clearly in their laps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It seems certain that this letter angered Mr. 0 ’Neal, and that is the reason why our release on Saturday was canceled, for O’Neal was overheard to say that we must be held until Monday. Mr. Thomason, the city attorney, had agreed with the chief for our release on Saturday. This shows that O’Neal wields the supreme power here against us.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>O'Hara’s Place in the Shame</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When Bishop G. P. 0 ’Hara, of Savannah, dedicated the new Catholic church here in Lagrange, a few months before arrests started here, Mayor 0 ’Neal had a prominent part in the dedication. This connects O’Neal with the Hierarchy, and reveals the source of our persecution. Thus the serpent’s trail leads to Vatican City—as usual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Our letter to O’Neal got the immediate response of increased persecution; hence this letter made a bull ’s-eye hit. It revealed the head inquisitor, 0 ’Neal, as the tool of the Hierarchy. We were lacking that proof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The chief said we were held because we had ridiculed his parole offer: if we would show no co-operation we would get none in return. That statement could not be true; for he knew we were not accepting his parole offer when he assured us of our release on Saturday.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark80">1</a></sup> He made that statement to cover the fact that his boss had made the change and he had to protect his boss or lose his job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Unless the “cat” chooses to further play with the “mouse” we shall be released this evening. The brethren have shown a fine spirit here, and, so far as we know, everyone leaves here more determined than ever to remain steadfast until the end, and to continue the warfare against our common enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We hope the little harships here will more fully prepare us to meet the hardships of Armageddon and that which must precede that great battle. Praise to Jehovah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Official Dunghill</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">What is to be thought of the administration of a city that in this supposedly (but not actually) enlightened and civilized era imprisons Christian men in a dunghill, and does it because they </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">are.</span><span class="font15"> Christians? Let the following communication, issued from the midst of Lagrange’s official dunghill, speak for itself:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">(Copy to each member of Council; the Lagrange </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">News; </span><span class="font14">Fuller E. Callaway, Jr., and the Atlanta </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Georgian)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">City Stables, Lagrange, Ga., June 16, 1937.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To the Hon. R. S. 0 ’Neal, Mayor,</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">and to the City Council of Lagrange, Georgia:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We, the undersigned, a committee, representing the fifty-six witnesses of Jehovah God, now incarcerated in the city stables of your city, present this statement of facts, not in the hope of any relief, but that you may be truthfully informed in regard to the cause of our presence here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">First, we came to Lagrange to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom as commanded by the Lord. In answer to the question as to when Satan’s world would end (Matthew 24:3), Jesus said, among other things, that ‘<sup>1</sup> this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">witness</span><span class="font14"> unto all nations: and then shall the end come”. (Matthew 24:14) Those who do this are therefore God’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Our method of preaching is by the printed page, which is the quickest and most effective way of reaching the people. The books and booklets we distribute and place with the people on a small contribution of far less than the cost of manufacture and distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When we came to your city for the above-stated purpose, on May 17, 1936, we were arrested and charged with violating an anti-soliciting ordinance, which could not possibly apply to our work of preaching from door to door as Jesus and the apostles did. (Matthew 10th chapter; Acts 20:20) Many were arrested for driving along the streets or for sitting in a cold-drink stand, yet each of us was convicted regardless of the testimony in the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To all this injustice we willingly submitted because the Lord has forewarned us through the Scriptures. Read Mark 13:1-9. We were willing to suffer the persecution because the Lord said it would come and we wanted to carry the matter before the courts to test the constitutionality of the ordinance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Each of you should know, and, no doubt, does know, that the Constitution of Georgia and of the United States gives a man the right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience. Our conscience dictates to us that we must carry this message to the people even at the cost of our lives.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT HEREAFTER A STRICT ENFORCEMENT TO THE SANITARY LAWS OF THE CITY WILL BE ENFORCED REGARDING THE KEEPING OF HOGS AND COWS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The folloving City Ordinance does apply to Cow-Pens, in so far as being kept in a Sanitary and Clean Manner:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">See. 339. Hog Pen* vithin 100 yards of nay private resident in the City,* or the confinement by stake or otherwise of hogs vithin 100 yards of any resident are declared a nuisance and un-lawful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Where hogs are confined beyond 100 yards of a private resident of the City, the pen shall contain not less than 500 square feet and be kept dry and clean, and free from odor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Your co-operation will aid us, and will be greatly appecriated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">CITY OF LAGRANGE,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">F. W. WHITE,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Sanitary Officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Lagrange officials willfully violated this ordinance</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">But we failed to get the matter before the higher courts, for the reason that your city attorney tricked us and our lawyers did not find it out in time. When we made bonds on May 31, it was necessary that the city clerk approve said bonds and the eity attorney told the city clerk not to sign them. This act invalidated our bonds as far as appeal was concerned, and after a test of the validity of those bonds, we were notified to return, which we did on May 28, 1937.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On this date we filed a habeas corpus before Judge Wyatt and got an adverse ruling and then offered to appeal on the merits of the case and post bond and go our way, but your Honorable City Attorney positively refused to accept the bond offered, which was the identical security that returned us here on May 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Then we elected to serve out our sentence on the streets, and are here at this writing (June 16) sleeping on old, dirty, secondhand mattresses placed on boards under the barn shed, among the flies, fleas and filth. Jesus laid down the rule that what is done to one of His disciples is done unto Him. (Matthew 25th chapter)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">And let it be known unto you that we have been falsely charged through the public press and otherwise as being anarchists and of circulating literature that is Communistic. These charges we most emphatically deny, and challenge any man to prove the same. Such charges are malicious in that they not only are untrue, but are calculated to becloud the issue before the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Be it further known unto you that the time for the Kingdom of God to be set up in full power is now at hand and all who refuse to obey that message shall be destroyed shortly in the battle of the great day of God Almighty. (Acts 3:23; Revelation 16:11-13) For these reasons we most solemnly admonish every person of good will and honest heart to seek the favor of the great Jehovah God, that they may be hid in the day of God’s anger which is near at hand.— Zephaniah 2:3; Matthew 24: 21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Respectfully submitted,</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>Scathing Denunciation from the State</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The foregoing complaint in due time reached the State Department of Public Welfare. An investigation was made and a report was issued, copies of which were sent to the city council, police, mayor, jailer, and commissioner of the board of health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Mr. Cleveland then pointed out the mule bam where the fifty men were living. The barn is about forty-five yards northeast of the rear of the jail. The visitor walked down to the bam, through it, and observed the situation before talking with the spokesman of the group. The conditions were so obviously unsanitary, unhealthy and deplorable to such a community that there was little need for the spokesman to point out the difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The men were sleeping on mattresses which were strewn about on an improvised flooring on the outside of the bam. There was slight protection from rain and sun in the form of a slanting roof which ran the length of the bam and ran out about twenty feet to the side of the barn. The flooring was of about the same width. Just beyond one end of the flooring was a cowpen with a cow enclosed. About ten feet from the other end of the flooring where the men slept was a huge pile of manure. No human [creature], regardless of race, creed or sex, should be allowed or forced to live under such conditions. The lavatories which the Negro men, working for the city, use, was the lavatory used by the white men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There is very little that could be done at such a late date, as the group was to be released at noon the following day, However, if it should be necessary to confine again more prisoners than the jail will accommodate, other arrangements should be made for housing the prisoners.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>Shameless Injustice</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Mrs. Boatner and Mrs. De Berry, fined for preaching the gospel in Lagrange, from house to house, as Jesus and the apostles did, testify:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">While we were waiting in the courtroom for trial, a man was tried and fined but $2.50 for reckless driving and endangering the lives of the people. Another man was tried for peddling without a license and was fined but $5.00. Our case was heard next and we were fined $25 or thirty days in jail for “distributing literature and circulars”—which same is carried on regularly without hindrance by the merchants of Lagrange, but was not done by us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Mike Caryk, imprisoned for preaching the gospel in Lagrange, testified:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">While working on the chain gang with the cemetery crew, my physical condition and resistance became weaker each day. Finally, on the fourth day, I became so weak and feeble it was impossible for me to continue to work. For the first four nights I had to sleep in my clothes, without a blanket. One blanket was then given for two of us. At night it was cold, and when it rained the roof leaked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I became ill from the diet of beans, com bread and wormy cabbage, and the police got me a doctor. He told the city officials my food must be changed to rice, milk and other soft foods, but after twelve days no change was made. He prescribed liquid medicine and pills: I got the liquid, but not the pills. After two and a half days I was sent back to work.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>Conditions Similar to Cesspool Germany</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Spencer Coleman’s statement is exceedingly readable. Summarizing it briefly it appears that the stockade keepers in Lagrange are on the same low moral and intellectual level as in Germany, the cesspool of the world. When asked for bedding these Hitler-aping creatures responded in true Nazi style, “Let Jehovah warm you with the light of the stars.” Here, in his statement, Coleman quoted Psalm 22:7,8, </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A.R.V.,</span><span class="font15"> and it is right to the point:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, Commit thyself unto Jehovah; let him deliver him: let him rescue him, seeing he delighteth in him. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Some smart Alecks in this world have never yet learned the great lesson that the last laugh is always the best: the way to obliteration, eternal extinction, is paved with those that thought it a huge joke that anybody should really love God or try to honor His name. They won’t be so gay when the Lord takes vengeance on them.— 2 Thessalonians 1: 6-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Coleman discloses that, besides the sprinkling of prisoners with cow urine while they were trying to sleep on indescribably filthy mattresses in close proximity to the city’s official manure pile, there -were other features worthy of notice:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The garbage trucks, with bits of rubbish and decayed food clinging to them, present still another menace to our health. We are allowed the use of only two toilets, which before our arrival were used only by colored convicts, and which are in an unimaginable state of filthiness: something not to be described, but seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The tools furnished us were very much in need of repairs and of sharpening, and no means of sharpening them was provided for several days, during which time our work was much harder than necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">One crew had no water furnished at first, and only on protest was this done. The others have water, but it is unpleasantly warm, and we all have to buy our own ice if we have cool water. On the job, we have no toilet facilities of any kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We were forced to work on Saturday afternoon, the first instance in the history of Georgia on which convicts worked on Saturday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We were fed only on wormy peas for several days, until so many of us complained about them that they substituted butterbeans. Much of the food is cooked in aluminum, causing several to be on the sick list every day from dysentery, vomiting and other reactions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We are aroused at four-thirty, breakfast is at five-thirty, and by six-thirty we are on the streets for our day of toil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On some days it was necessary to get up at 3:30 or earlier and walk around to keep warm. After almost a week one blanket was furnished for each two men.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>“Not Where to Lay His Head”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">H. L. Connor bears witness that on several occasions, like his Master, he had not where to lay his head, and one night, after a hard day’s labor in the burning sun, he had no mattress and crawled into an automobile to get what rest was possible in that way. Afterwards, for several nights, he slept in the hay in the barn, without mattress or blanket, working every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Robert L. Dawson testifies that when the chief of police was notified that the cowpeas had many worms in them, his heartless, devilish reply was: “You have to have meat with your peas, for seasoning.” Asked for clean clothes at the end of a very hard week shoveling dirt in the streets, he told the men to wash their clothes over Sunday and put them back on.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">W. B. Crabb, so it happens, was standing beside his car at the time he was arrested, but on the perjured testimony of a lying police officer he got the same treatment as the other victims, though an invalid. He says that the flies and the eats were terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Robert Derrickson is a diabetic, and though he pleaded for his medicine, it was denied him. His first day toiling in the streets brought him to a state of collapse, but the Lord strengthened him so that he was able to hold out for the full term along with the rest. The food caused him much suffering.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">Taunting this sick man, the inexpressibly evil city attorney refused to allow him to be tried by his own attorney, because he wanted to go fishing, and in the judicial chambers said to him, “I would like to have you alone in a room for ten minutes: I’ll bet you would stop this work.” These are the words of one who has the spirit of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Dr. James A. Edwards adds an item about the city’s official dung pile where the Lord’s people were allowed to sleep in the open, on dirty mattresses laid on planks, when, mentioning the cow, he says that “just on the inside, in the end of the barn, are two very congenial mules”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Dr. Edwards had the rare distinction of first being tried and justly pronounced innocent, as he was originally arrested for coming to the police headquarters to inquire as to the fate of others of his brethren. But, on second thought he was tried again, or, at any rate, “found guilty” without a trial, and given thirty days in the chain gang for the same identical “offense”. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I might mention that about 15 of us were placed on a hard street with picks and shovels and had to pick up dirt almost as hard as brick. They evidently thought this would bring forth the cash. The guard suggested that we did not have to do it: we could pay off and leave. After they saw that none of us would pay off, they brought in machinery and tore up the hard dirt so we could shovel it with more ease. Fifty-six of us remain faithful and rejoice, even in the filth and under the hot rays of the sun. Many people of the neighborhood where we work come by and tell ns they are for us, and if they could have their way we would not be there.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">Mattie G lass, color ed, was required to rise at 3:00 each morning and to work in the kitchen until 7: 00 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">John Galfas relates that some days the squad of 24 in which he worked had to walk six miles to work and six miles back; that chickens had the rim of the official dung pile where he was allowed to sleep; that his feet became so sore from inability to give them proper rest and care that, on the physician’s orders, he served out his time barefoot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Walter F. Hilldring, with many others of the prisoners, refers to the “ever increasing fly population” of what will doubtless be known in history as the “City of Dung”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Hilldring goes on to explain the meanness that required men whose only fault is that they love God to destroy their own good shoes, hats and underwear in hard labor on the streets, to which, of course, none were accustomed. After sixteen days only one pair of city shoes had been furnished to the 56 men: the city would not even repair the good shoes of their owners, scuffed, cut and worn by gravel, roots, stumps, tools and glass. It was necessary for the men also to buy their own working gloves and straw hats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">G. C. Leoles, of Atlanta, who lost his business because of the cowardly un-American tactics of the nightshirt patriots commonly known as the “Ku Klux Klan”, was put at work loading sand, which work made him ill, as his whole life has been spent in indoor work. He tells of the Atlanta </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Constitution</span><span class="font15"> descending to sending down a reporter, trying to get his picture, hoping to add to his sorrows. The reporter was urged to take a picture of Lagrange’s official dunghill and sleeping quarters in the “Stock Yards”, which was done, but the paper lacked the moral courage to publish it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Official Trickery</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T. J. Morris, when arrested, posted a $50 personal check as cash bond. Contrary to his wishes, and without consulting him, Lagrange’s high-minded city officials cashed his check, sent him the balance of $25, and wrote him that his case had been settled. His protest over this trickery was in vain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Throwing Christiana to the lions in Lagrange</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">S. J. Richardson has the following to say of one of the meanest men that ever disgraced God’s footstool:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Brother Clay, of Macon, Georgia, was released on bond, and his case appealed. When the city attorney found that the rest of the friends had decided to work out the few days that remained rather than to go to the expense and trouble that the city attorney was seeking to put them to, he went up in the air and said, “I will work hell out of these sons of b—s.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">C. E. Sillaway reports 16 cases of sickness in which the prisoners were unable to work. One of the witnesses had to be carried from his work. The poor quality of the prison fare led to much hardship. Many, unused to the hard labor, the impossible sleeping accommodations and the wretched food, actually went to work in the morning with nothing in their stomachs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Peter Stribling, colored, was told to keep away from Lagrange, because, if Jehovah’s witnesses ever come there again, “it is going to be hell for them, as they are going to put chains on their legs.” This is to be expected in a Rome-controlled town.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>Wormy Food Finally Given to Chickens</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Robert Tyson, referring to the wretched food, which was also mentioned by nearly every one who made a statement, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I have never had to eat as sorry food in my whole life as the city of Lagrange gives us. One day the peas were found to be cooked with worms. When reported to the foreman of the job by several, he came and inspected the food; he said it was only the pops in the peas, and not worms, but the next day a barrel of peas was carried out of the kitchen to be used for chicken feed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Victor Valss says, as do others, “At times we have been pushed hard by our bosses while we are at work. This was evidently done to force us to pay fines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Albion B. Wright gives a pen picture of the conditions provided for those who dare preach the truth in Rome-controlled Lagrange. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On the east side was a big pile of wood with oil pumps, and parked trucks. On the north was a cowpen with it stinking everyone out. On the west was a mule stable, and up against this were put our beds. On the south is a dung heap, and the wind blows from the south most of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The following is a brief summary from the pen of Richard Arrington, arrested six times in the state of Georgia for preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom, the one and only hope of the world:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jehovah’s witnesses in Lagrange have been subjected to wicked persecution. Their sleeping quarters are hardly fit for animals, let alone human creatures. Mattresses laid on old planks on the bare ground under an old shed built to a horse stable is where they rest at night. Mules, cows and horses are in their stalls behind them, and, June weather, you can imagine how it would be to breathe this foul air all night, not to mention the flies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In their ranks are college professors and doctors, picking and shoveling in the streets with the temperature above 90 degrees. All are joyous for the privilege of suffering for Christ’s sake. Their diet consists mostly of starches, such as corn bread, and peas cooked with fat salt pork; this, of course, made some of them sick. The “coffee” is cooked in aluminum, and hence is as poisonous as it is unpalatable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Lagrange is in a pitiable condition. There are some well-disposed people in the city, but obviously none among the clergy, not one. Had there been they could not have remained silent while anyone, not to mention honest Christians, was being treated as were Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>

($12.50) a week he cannot be a Christian, because he is too worried about how he will get on in this life, and that if a man has more than £1,000 ($5,000) a year he is in danger of being too rich to enter the kingdom of Christ. As his own income is £3,000 a year, with a fine episcopal palace thrown into the bargain, he admits that he is out of luck. At least, this is logically admitted for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The bishop has his good points. He said, among other things:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Instead of our civilization and education turning the world into a paradise, we are rapidly making it into a hell.

<p><span class="font22" style="font-variant:small-caps;">L</span><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a Follette’s Senate sub-committee on education and labor made a partial report on its investigation of the Pinkerton Detective Agency’s zeal in spending $240,000 of employers’ money in the first seven months of 1936 for corrupting men to sell out their fellow workers. That’s quite a nice business to be in. Lovely! The committee describes one of the shining examples of the type of men selected for such work. It is quite touching, and makes a real American feel, oh, so proud of such a national institution as Pinkerton’s:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Drawn from the underworld, a large number of strikebreakers have criminal records. An interesting example is Sam Cohen, alias Sam Goldberg, alias Chowderhead Cohen, alias Charles Harris, who testified before the committee. His preparatory work in industrial relations included a term in Atlanta for conspiracy, four years in State’s prison and four years in Sing Sing for burglaries, and detention as material witness in a notorious murder case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Out of thirteen strikebreakers furnished by Railway Audit and Inspection (another strikebreaking outfit) for the General Motors strike in St. Louis in 1932, seven were wanted by the police of other cities on charges including burglary, forgery, larceny, inciting to riot, and assault.</span></p>

That seems to be the drift of testimony of Robert C. Travis before the La Follette Civil Liberties Committee in Washington. According to Travis’ story the Chevrolet people, in Plant No. 8, made 2,000 blackjacks out of rubber hose, with a weight in the end. The advantage of this kind of head-buster is that it will crack a skull without breaking the skin. Pretty good management, eh? what? The head-busters patrol the grounds for an hour when the shift changes, get time and a half for that hour, and $15 a month premium. The plan works well. In two years the union membership dropped from 26,000 to 123, according to Travis. No matter how much the men want better conditions, they show a certain shrinking or hesitancy from having their cranial cavities telescoped.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22" style="font-variant:small-caps;">S</span><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">heriff Robert A. Lee, of Etowah county, Alabama, is quite a sheriff of the new Fascist (Catholic Action) type, according to testimony given in Washington before the La Follette subcommittee investigating labor espionage. It seems that when rubber union labor officials at Gadsden, Alabama, anticipated that they were about to be slugged by B. L. Crowe, and other Goodyear employees in training for promotion in the Goodyear organization, they telephoned six times in the course of an hour to the Gadsden police headquarters, a block away, but to no avail, and when they tried to get the sheriff’s office on the telephone they could not get any answer, because the sheriff himself was in the mob. Sheriff Lee is not the only man that distinguished himself in the testimony. Thus a Goodyear lady employee was warned by H. S. Craigmile, personnel manager of the Goodyear Company, that she must not associate with union labor, and was advised not to return to work, for that reason. Under the circumstances she resigned and left Craigmile with the kingdom, the power and the glory.</span></p>

One strikebreaker admitted that sometimes strikebreakers playfully shoot at each other, not seriously, but to make it seem that they really have something to sell. It helps to create a market for their peculiar line.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font22">I</span><span class="font15">T IS wholly unreasonable to conclude that the commission given to Peter (Matthew 16:19) meant that Peter was to have a perpetual successor and that whatsoever that successor might bind or loose on earth, whether good or bad or indifferent, would be confirmed by the Lord. Here is disclosed another fraudulent scheme of the Devil to induce sincere people to believe that Peter had an unlimited commission and power and that he has successors who likewise have unlimited commission and power. By this fraudulent scheme Satan has caused men to give homage and devotion and honor to imperfect man, which is contrary to the Word of Almighty God. No occasion ever arose for Peter to have a successor. There is no evidence that he ever had a successor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The other text cited in support of the supremacy of Peter and his alleged successors is found at John 21:15-17. At the time of the crucifixion Peter had denied the Lord, and thus he had stumbled by reason of Satan’s influence. (John 18:15-27; Luke 22: 31,32) Jesus had given him warning and said to Peter: “And when thou art converted [turned into the right course], strengthen thy brethren” (Luke 22: 32); almost the identical language Jesus employed in speaking to Peter at John 21:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">After His resurrection and appearance to Peter Jesus propounded to Peter this question: “Lovest thou me?” To love means to be wholly and unselfishly devoted to the Lord in obedience to His commandments, as Jesus had previously stated. (John 14:15; 15:10) Asking the same question three times proves that Jesus was fully impressing upon Peter the importance of love or unselfish obedience. Peter declared his love for the Lord, and then Jesus replied: “Feed my sheep”; that is, prove your love by going and telling your fellow man the truth as it has been revealed to you. Every follower of Christ Jesus is commissioned and admonished to do the same thing. (Isaiah 61:1,2; 43:10-12) Instead of this text’s proving supreme authority in Peter and others following, it proves exactly the contrary. The church is God’s organization, and over that God is supreme. Christ Jesus is the Head of the church, and God and Christ are the teachers and rulers, and they alone constitute “the higher powers”.—Romans 13:1-3; 1 Corinthians 12:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The Catholic doctrine claims that the Catholic church is the true church and was built upon Peter, and that the pope is the head of the church, is the successor of Peter, is infallible, and the only one authorized to interpret the Scriptures. On this point Cardinal Gibbons says: “The true Church must be Apostolical. Hence in the Creed framed in the first Ecumenical Council of Nicaea, in the year 325, we find these words: ‘I believe in the One, Holy, Catholic and </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Apostolic</span><span class="font15"> Church.’ ” “The Catholic Church . . . can easily vindicate the title of Apostolic, because she derives her origin from the Apostles.” </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">{The Faith of Our Fathers,</span><span class="font15"> pages 38,48) Such doctrines of the Roman Catholic church are at variance with the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The church is Jehovah God’s organization, as it is written: “The church of the living God.” (1 Timothy 3:15) Christ Jesus is the Head, Chief Corner Stone, Foundation and Ruler of the church. ‘God hath raised up Christ Jesus from the dead and made Christ Jesus the Head over the church.’ (Ephesians 1: 20-22) “For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.” (Ephesians 5:23) “And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the pre-eminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.” (Colossians 1:18,19) “But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.”—1 Corinthians 12:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The names of those who are members of the church are written in heaven, and not on some worldly book. (Hebrews 12:23) Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are the teachers of the church. (Isaiah 30:20; 54:13) The prophets of old wrote the prophecies as they were moved upon by the spirit of Jehovah. (2 Peter 1:21) The apostles wrote instruction to the church at the dictation and inspiration from God through Christ Jesus. The prophecies and the teachings</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">of the apostles are the means employed by the Lord to teach those who are of the church; therefore the apostle Paul wrote that Christ Jesus is the Chief Corner Stone of the church, the temple of God, constructed upon Christ by and through the teachings which God furnishes through the holy prophets and the apostles.— Ephesians 2:18-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Beans </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">By May Howard (England)</span></p>
<p><span class="font22">T</span><span class="font15">HE following incident may in itself have been trivial; but apropos of Mr. Salter’s venomous slanders, and in the sense that a straw shows the way of the wind, I recount it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">When visiting at the Bible house, Berne, last September, a sister, one of the seventy-odd steady, happy-eyed workers there, casually mentioned that Judge Rutherford had been in the kitchen and in his free and easy way had lifted the lids of the pans on the stove to see what they were all going to have for dinner, and he saw some beans. “Ah, beans,” he said. “Dish me up some bacon and beans, but plenty of beans!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Beans! What self-indulgent extravagance! Beans! A never-satisfied little Oliver Twist might unreasonably “ask for more”; for Hebrew slaves in Egypt illogically look for straw to make their bricks. But great expectations by our mutual friend! For the man who is holding the most important job in the earth to ask for beans and bacon for his dinner! And doubtless those beans were 'paid for out of the Society’s funds’!! What “high living’ for one who is divinely appointed by the great Creator of all good things, to give a lead to and help (under the Lord the King) the remnant of the royal house of God and their inseparable friends! Beans ! What excessive “hire” to expect by one so highly appointed! And he very often does a mere fifteen-hour-day’s work!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">All I can say is there are beans of another nature in store for those to whom it is as a dainty morsel on the lips to make utterances intended to destroy the work of the Lord and His anointed on the earth today. Beans! And they won’t be able to “save their bacon” either! ■—Proverbs 12:12-22.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Today, after four centuries, the mass of the Peruvian people are ignorant or uneducated, subject to disease and death, vilely exploited; they live in unsanitary, miserable homes; their economic lot is worse than it was under the Inca emperors before the coming of the Spaniards. The Church has filled the land with beautiful edifices, but it has not taught the Indians and mestizos, who comprise 85 percent of the population, how to build decent homes or how to keep their bodies clean. The priest in Peru has catered to native superstition and ignorance, and it is doubtful, given the situation in which the masses live, that he has contributed anything to their spiritual welfare. One is forced to the reluctant conclusion that the church as an institution is organized for the purpose of mass exploitation and that it is a partner of all the economic classes which foster such exploitation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">A</span><span class="font15"> LETTER from southern Illinois says that recently in that neighborhood a man came to the home of an old lady who had recently lost her husband and was living alone. Calling her by name he introduced himself as James Boyd. As Boyd was a prominent name in that place, and she could not see well to recognize him, she invited him in. He claimed to represent a monument company at the county seat, and offered to set a monument for someone who could not afford to purchase one, and use it as a demonstration. He asked $8 for transportation and labor. When she explained that she did not have even $8 he asked if she had any nice quilts or fancy work she could use for money. She brought out her nicest quilt, made of white and blue poplin, when her eyesight was better. She highly prized this quilt but was willing to let it go for $10. The man agreed to pay the difference in LVo weeks, when he would call and take her to the cemetery to see the monument. He never came back, and has worked the same racket elsewhere. The widow is 80 years of age.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">195 Summit Avenue Canonsburg, Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">May 16, 1937</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Honorable Harry G. Brownfield Chairman of Committee on Education House of Representatives</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Sir :</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In support of Bill No. 1867, shortly to come before the legislature, and as a teacher who has had firsthand experience with the matter in question, I am taking this opportunity of calling to your attention some instances attendant upon the issue recently made of compulsory flag-saluting in the public schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On Thursday, November 7, 1935, as the climax to a period of unbelievable cruelty and injustice, seven children were expelled from the public schools of Canonsburg, in Washington county, for refusal, on religious grounds, to salute the American flag. Four of these children, Pauline and Anna Prinos, and Timothy and Ruth George, had been badly beaten by their teachers and principal—rather pathetic representatives of American educators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pathetic American &quot;Educators&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">These children were held up to ridicule before the other pupils, denied toilet privileges, mocked and abused—and all because they had the moral courage to stand by their convictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Anna and Timothy were so badly beaten they had to be taken to a doctor. Canonsburg doctors, in league with the school board, refused to treat the children and they were taken to a Pittsburgh doctor who, shocked at their condition, made out a written report of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The principal, Earl S. Davidson, was later commended by the board and told he would receive their support and backing in anything he did. It must have taken a great deal of courage for that group of men to face so bravely those little defenseless children. That might more worthily liave been a product of the Dark Ages than of American ideals and traditions.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">Two others of the children, Charles and Miriam Estep, both seniors in Canonsburg High School, were well liked by teachers and fellow students. Miriam was in line for the valedictory speech in her class, and Charles was an acknowledged leader among the boys. Both students had received all their education in the Canonsburg schools. The flag-saluting ceremony was unadmittedly introduced into the high school, where they had not had it previously, for the express purpose of “getting” these two students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The seventh pupil, Murray Estep, in eighth grade, was also well liked, and as a rule led his class in scholastic ability. No complaint had ever been found with either his school work or his conduct. No finer, cleaner, more thoroughly American boy could be found any place.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark213"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark214"></a>A Sample Nazi Board of &quot;Education”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Not content with expelling these children, the board and Superintendent F. W. McVay maliciously attempted to have the five who were under sixteen committed to a reformatory—the judge did not, however, permit this further disgrace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What fit subjects with which to fill our remedial institutions!—children who, because of their faithfulness to God, who has commanded that homage shall be paid to Him alone (Exodus 20:3-5), and their firm determination not to violate their consciences, have been denied the right to an education, which denial in itself is defeating the fundamental purpose of education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Since what time have our schools become no place for clean, courageous Americans ? And of what value is the influence of our much-vaunted American home, if little children, innocent of wrong-doing, can be torn from their parents and placed among the potential criminals of half a decade hence?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At about the same time, similar disgraceful proceedings were besmirching our schools in other communities. At Nemacolin, in Greene county, five children were sent home from school because they refused to take the oath and salute the flag. Some of them had been badly beaten. Their parents sent them back to school the next day, and again they were sent home, and told not to come back. But when at the command of the school authorities, they remained out of school, the parents were arrested for parental delinquency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At New Salem, Royal, German township, and Gates, all in Fayette county, pupils were expelled for the same reason. All together there were forty-six pupils in the districts mentioned who were without a school to attend, with their hopes for the future blasted so far as plans dependent upon higher education were concerned, with their reputations more or less ruined, and with the threat of reformatories hanging over them and jail sentences imminent for their parents. Not exactly an American set-up!</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark215"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark216"></a>Hypocrisy by Compulsion—Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I wonder, had the authorities, through coercion, finally compelled these children to salute the flag, what they would have gained, how much love of country and respect for themselves they would have instilled in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The dictatorial methods employed by the self-appointed guardians of the national patriotism were not confined to the pupils, but swung even more readily to the other side of the desk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In September of 1931, I began teaching grade two in the public schools of Canonsburg—in the very building, in fact the very room, where I had been a second year pupil some years before. I made of my teaching a success and was loved by pupils and parents alike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On Monday, October 14, 1935, my name and picture were suddenly blazed across the front pages of the newspapers, and my destruction as a public school teacher had begun. From then on for several weeks I was publicly branded unpatriotic, un-American, Communistic, and unfit as a teacher of little children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I should have been hanged, should have been tarred and feathered, should have been run out of town, should have been sent back to the country I came from (this would have been difficult, as my ancestors were in this country before the Revolution and fought with the others to make it a land of freedom)—all this because I believe what the Bible teaches: that the Christian’s allegiance, the Christian’s homage, the Christian’s obeisance, is to be given to Jehovah alone, because He is Supreme. This does not make of him a poorer citizen; on the contrary, it should make of him a better one.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark217"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark218"></a>Making Way for the Monks and Nuns</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On October 3, at the suggestion of the principal I began having the flag salute in my room, although up until this time I had not been having, had not been asked to have, and, in fact, had not thought of having the salute. Inasmuch as pupils are taught from first grade on to take charge of exercises independent of the teacher, my lack of participation in this would have been entirely unnoticed under ordinary circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Never during the four years and two months of my teaching in the public schools had there been one complaint from the parents. In fact, at the beginning of the term in which I lost my job, a mother had gone to the principal and asked that her child, at that child’s request, should be demoted from 3-B to 2-A so that she might be in my room. Not once was I accused of demoralizing the children or of instilling in them even the faintest grain of un-Americanism or poor citizenship. I </span><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">could</span><span class="font14"> cite many instances to the exact contrary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There was nothing in the code to compel me to have the flag salute in my room or to take part in it if I should. Section 629 of the Pennsylvania School Code states that a flag shall be displayed upon or near each public school building, and also that a flag shall be displayed within each room. The Code provided also that school boards had the right to make any “reasonable” rules to fit their own particular communities. But anything which demands that a Christian violate his loyalty to God is not reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Not satisfied with the fact that my pupils were giving the pledge and saluting the flag every morning, and that there had been not one complaint from the parents, the school board, on Monday, October 21, passed a resolution requiring that all teachers teach the pledge and lead in the salute at least once a week. The personal aspect was apparent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Mushroom Reign of &quot;Patriotic” Terror</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It was also quite apparent then, as it has been since, that the welfare of the pupils was not the primary consideration. The driving, compelling, all-consuming urge behind this mushroom reign of terror was the malicious determination to destroy. Those who attempted to instill in children and teachers loyalty to country and love of freedom could not have adopted more Fascist methods in doing so. Rather ludicrous, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On November 6, I was given a “hearing” before the board. In other words, I had a chance to give a speech which they chose to ignore as completely as if I had not spoken. I was informed that there was no complaint about my teaching but that I had chosen to disregard the board’s orders. No group of “gentlemen” could have acted in a more ungentlemanly manner. They were like a pack of snarling dogs, and even began snapping at each other in their eagerness to bemean and destroy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">November 7 was my last day of teaching. My pupils showered me with gifts, they cried over my leaving, the parents came to tell me good-bye. I had prized my teaching privilege above almost everything else, loved it and gave my best to it; so this day, when I stood before a classroom for the last time in my life probably, was one of the hardest I’ve ever endured. Besides leaving our family of eight without its main support, it left me with my career as a public school teacher completely and permanently blasted, and my reputation to all intents and purposes ruined.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark219"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark220"></a>&quot;Patriotic” Hate Toward 46 American Children</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">With the storm clouds of patriotic indignation still lowering and fairly crackling with “American” hatred, it was necessary to provide shelter for the forty-six little children who were the center of their deleterious tempest. Therefore, on December 3, 1935, a school was started in Gates so that these children might be protected from a delinquency charge. I had the privilege of being the teacher of this first Kingdom School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Still bent on their cowardly campaign and filled with dictatorial venom, these loud-mouthed patriots attempted to have our school padlocked, with the charge that ours was a Communistic institution. I imagine it was a very grave disappointment to the caustic knights when they found that we were studying from the same books as used in their own schools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Now we have a fine, modem building of our own wherein the expelled pupils from first grade through ninth are working industriously to get the education denied them in the public schools. Not a pupil of ours has been taken from the public schools—every one of them was expelled, and most of them under conditions which should make any thorough-blooded American cringe and blush in shame for our “land of the free, and home of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-variant:small-caps;">brave”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In reviewing the scenes of this ignominious reign of terrorism, you will notice that in every instance it occurred in a small community where the people are narrow and in-grown; where a two-penny seat in a little office is interpreted to carry with it the scepter of absolute civic power, the immense burden of the national welfare, the endowment of an inalterable and unconditional authority to be always right in spite of “heaven or hell” or the Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Our country, as a democracy, free of monarchs or dictators, cannot exist unless the principles upon which it was founded are jealously guarded. One inroad into those rights and principles is merely a breeding place, a wedge by which other violations may enter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">One of these rights is that of freedom of worship. Thomas Jefferson and many of his contemporaries spoke and wrote vigorously concerning this greatest of all human rights, warning against infraction of it, and declaring that no one has a right to say what is and what is not another’s duty toward his God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Those men lived during the time when it was seditious to belong to or declare one’s self in sympathy with any church save that of the king. They wrote compellingly, from the depths of their hearts, on a subject of which they knew much through personal experience. And they drafted into the Constitution, as a safeguard for all time, this bitterly won freedom. They never intended that the flag of their nation should rise superior to the God of their faith.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">T</span><span class="font15">HE boys and girls of today are the men and women of tomorrow; hence the great fight to gain control of the youth of every land. If it was right for the Roman Hierarchy to have child slaves in Spain, as they did have, in the old days before the Spanish Republic, it is right to have them now’. And if it is right to have them in Spain it is right to have them in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The Hierarchy views all boys and girls as material out of which money can be made, if they can be worked long hours on low </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">wages, or</span><span class="font15"> without any w’ag-es at all, as in the hellholes called “Houses of the Good Shepherd”; hence, it follows, as a matter of course, that the Hierarchy is the open enemy of all efforts to restrict the hours that minors may work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">It is well know’n that the child labor amendment to the Constitution would have been adopted years ago but for the Hierarchy. Cardinal Hayes killed it in New York state by lining up all Catholic organizations against it.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19370811_files/g_E_19370811-19.png" alt="" style="width:231pt;height:260pt;">
<p><span class="font13">The Hierarchy’s attitude on child labor</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">Representatives of 246 Roman Catholic societies met in Brooklyn and the more than 1,000 delegates present voted unanimously against ratifying the child labor amendment in New York state, on the ground that it might mean the end of parochial schools. Can you figure this one out? What do the children do in parochial schools, anyway?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Craw’fishing before Cardinal Hayes 150 alleged civic and religious leaders in the state of New’ York weakly and meekly criticized the cardinal’s domination of the New York state legislature on the subject of child labor. They called the cardinal’s attention to the fact that 83 percent of the citizens of the state, according to a poll, are in favor of the child labor amendment, and then said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">We are certain that the cardinal did not mean to exercise this influence upon such legislators in Albany, for he is well aware that the members of the Assembly are elected to the legislature as the representatives of the people and therefore are responsible, as legislators, not to any religious organizations, but to the citizens of the state. If they were to act otherwise, they would be violating their very oath of office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The poor nincompoops. They are trying to tell the cardinal that he did not mean to do the very thing that he meant to do, and that he </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">did</span><span class="font15"> do. It is like saying to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, “Now’, Mr. Roosevelt, we are very sure you have no idea of packing the Supreme Court, so that it will do your will and you can become, in very deed and in very truth, a dictator.” Both the cardinal and the president would have a good laugh and step on the gas. They don’t even stop at the red lights, let alone the yellow ones.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark234"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark235"></a>Wrecking America’s Public Schools</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Under the management of Mayor Kelly, President McCahey, and a school board that is almost solidly Roman Catholic, Chicago is getting along quite well in its wrecking of the public-school system in that city. Twenty-eight junior high schools were closed, a two-year public college was closed, the kindergarten system was drastically cut, and a capable teacher, male or female, can hardly obtain or retain employment unless an admirer of the toe-kissing religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Without the knowledge or consent of any other denomination, the Reverend John W. Curran and the Reverend James O’Mara bluffed the board of school trustees of Haverstraw, New York, into unanimously agreeing to allow “each recognized denomination” [Do you get that, Georgiana ? They must be “recognized”.] to use the new $1,000,000 school building one afternoon a week “to inculcate moral precepts in the minds of the youth of Haverstraw”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">In other words, to all intents and purposes, although St. Peter’s Roman Catholic church of Haverstraw is at all times available, and is, in fact, twice as big as it needs to be, for the purpose, yet the Catholics grabbed the town’s new school building for their own sectarian purposes. The Protestant preachers of Haverstraw are now clinging to the top wires of their cages and wondering how long they can continue to hang on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Although knowing that the New York State constitution forbids the use of State money, credit or property in aid of any religious denomination or tenet, McConnell introduced a bill in the Assembly for registering the religion of children in public schools, McLaughlin a bill authorizing “religious teachers” to teach in such schools, and Fitzpatrick a bill to enable “religious schools” to obtain State funds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The work of merging parochial schools with public schools, begun in Ohio and Indiana, has been carried into Michigan, where three parochial schools at Lake Linden have been taken into the public school system. Nuns remain the teachers but crucifixes and statues of Roman Catholic “saints” were taken out of the schoolrooms. However, Catholic pictures of the usual type remain on the walls. Catechism takes place for a half hour each morning. New readers were supplied. The school board of the town consists of three Catholics and two Protestants.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark236"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark237"></a>Injecting Religion into Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">At Toledo, Ohio, Prof. Clarence La Rue had it all figured out to have twelve priests invade the rooms of the school of which he is principal, and in the heart of the afternoon (from 2: 30 to 3:00) they were to teach the Roman Catholic catechism. The superintendent of public schools of Toledo, Ralph E. Dugdale, had the good sense to cancel the arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Iowa’s attorney general, Edward L. O’Connor, himself a Catholic, ruled that no one may be denied the right to teach in the public schools because of religious belief, but must not wear the garb of any order while on duty and must not transfer their salary to any such order. In his opinion he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The supreme court of New York squarely held that it was improper for any person wearing any religious garb to teach in the public schools, for the reason that the wearing of the garb constituted the injection of ecclesiastical sectarianism into the public school system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Reverend Father” Thomas V. Cassidy, seeking to Polonize the public schools of Rhode Island, advanced the usual arguments about “religious education” and “character building” which are being used in every state in the Union by the church or sect which provides 15 percent of the population of the United States and over half of its criminals. Though, as usual, he had the Protestant preachers and Jewish rabbis dangling at the tail of his kite, at least one rabbi had misgivings. Speaking of his personal experiences in Poland itself Rabbi Goldman said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">I was brought up in Poland and have this recollection of my boyhood days. One day a week the Jewish boys went to one room, the Greek Orthodox to another and the Roman Catholics to still another for special religious instruction. It was the most hateful day in the week for me. What a joy it was when I entered an American school! Here I was an American boy with the rest. I was not separated from anybody else in that public building. That represents a very valuable practice in our American education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Merely to have it in the record: The man responsible for expulsion of Carleton B. Nichols from the public schools of Lynn, Massachusetts, for refusal to participate in the new flag-salutin’ religion, one Pashby, does not permit his own children to attend the public schools, but has them educated at a parochial school in the same city.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark238"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark239"></a>Teachers Unafraid of Romanism</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Teachers unafraid of Romanism are not many, but they are the cream of the teaching profession. President Angell, of Yale University, did not mention Romanism by name, but he was cheered to the echo when, referring to certain politicians, he said in an address at Cambridge, Massachusetts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Teachers who will not prostitute their knowledge and convictions to the often ignorant bias of these worthies must find other jobs. Sometimes the results desired are sought through the imposition of teachers’ oaths, sometimes by more direct methods, but the outcome is always the same—the assignment to busybodies, often moronic in mentality, of the power to terrorize able and honest teachers, with the ultimate ruin of the morale of the teaching force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Grace Estep, a liberty-loving teacher, was fired from her position of teacher in the Canonsburg schools by the co-operation of the Canonsburg </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Notes</span><span class="font15"> with the moronic school board which insisted that flag-saluting should be forced upon everyone in the schools regardless of conscientious scruples against “saluting any likeness of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath”.

<p><span class="font14">It is indeed a sad state of affairs when religious organizations charged with the moral training of our youth are forced to resort to such means for their financial support. However, it now appears that these very groups who favored and secured passage of [state] anti-gambling laws in former years are the worst offenders today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Education” in all fields is being gathered more and more into Catholic Hierarchy hands, and protestants, who prided themselves on their success in getting anti-gambling legislation enacted are now watching the Hierarchy undo their work on every hand without so much as a peep of protest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">The Hierarchy is agitating for “religious education” in American public schools wherever they cannot get Catholics to support the Hierarchy-controlled parochial schools. Religious and other education in Germany has made great forward strides, and, noting the progress, one wonders why Americans should hesitate to turn everything over to the Hierarchy in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Reverend Father” Rudolf Fuhr, Catholic chaplain at Coblenz, was sent up for 2| years on a charge of immoral conduct with girls under 14 years of age to whom he had been giving religious instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Disturbed by the news from Germany that one-thirteenth of the membership of the Roman Catholic brotherhoods are in prison for sexual immoralities, District Attorney Wm. F. X. Geoghan, despite testimony of teachers to the contrary, declared unsound moral conditions prevail in Brook</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">lyn high schools, and with true parochial school enthusiasm “investigated” the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Just a suggestion: How about bringing those Roman Catholic brothers over from Germany and let them take the place of American teachers? They certainly could teach “character development” ; they know all about it; that is their business. Also, it would be a good thing for the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">And there is precedent. The nuns that were caught smuggling were dismissed from prison and sent over to America. They will be useful in the campaign to teach “religion” in the public schools which the Roman Whorearchy is now so busy taking over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">There are in Germany 13,895 Catholic monks and lay brothers, members of the country’s 661 monastic foundations. The fact that over a thousand of these men were arrested and jailed, charged with immorality of the most abhorrent character, gives some idea of the kind of “holiness” practiced in what the Hitler press describes as “sinks of vice” and “breeding places of homosexuality”, mere “brothels”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">German papers are inquiring, in view of the revelations already made, “Will the Catholic church still contend that the education of youth should remain a church affair?” In America the Catholic church is exerting every power at its command to gain control of the “religious” education of American youths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Preparing for the priesthood at Heiligen-stadt, Germany, the moral conditions among the youthful inmates became so wretched that the Nazi police closed the doors of the seminary.

<p><span class="font15">“Brother” Eugen, of the monastery of Charitable Brothers, Coblenz, Germany, must be a nice brother. He was convicted of horse-whipping one of his charges and immersing him in a tank of cold water. “Brother” Ignatius, 76<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark244">2</a></sup> years of age, was sentenced to eighteen months’ imprisonment for gross immorality. “Brother” Desiderius got two and a half years for the same reason.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark245"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark246"></a>&quot;The Sole Source of Truth”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">At the Knights of Columbus Club, Brooklyn, March 8,1937, the “Very Reverend” Edward J. Walsh made the common-sense statement that “there would not be any religion in the larger sense today if it were not for the Catholic church”. In other words, there would be no hypocrisy left in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">He also made the cockeyed statement that the Roman Catholic Church is the sole source for truth on all public questions. Would you believe it, that in the twentieth century anybody would make such a palpably idiotic statement? And, further, this comes from one of Catholicism’s leading lights, the president of one of its universities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">Catholicism claims infinite wisdom, and yet is licked to a finish before it starts; for even the man who made this foolish statement knows full well that he would not dare discuss Catholic doctrines over the radio with Judge Rutherford. “Sole source”? Humph!</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">The pope expects people to forget too much and in too short a space of time. The Manchester </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font15"> April 16, 1937, published a report from the British church delegation of Protestants who visited Spain. They reported that, particularly in the Basque provinces, where all the people are Roman Catholics, “all the churches were open and crowded.” Only 23 days later, May 9, 1937, the pope put out one more encyclical, and in it, speaking about conditions in Spain, he said untruthfully:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Not only this or that church or isolated monastery was sacked, but as far as possible every church and every monastery was destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A new encyclical is issued by the pope every few days. The last one at hand modestly calls himself “this Apostolic See, the teacher of truth”. If he will pardon a correction: he is neither one. He is not in the remotest sense apostolic, not being a successor of any apostle (for the twelve apostles had no successors), but writing and acting much more like the Devil than like an apostle of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And as for teaching “truth”— pfui! In reading “Catholic truth” you have to burn a rag to keep down the odor of the Inquisition. The pope says, “All hierarchy, all authority is nullified.” If so, the Hierarchy has only itself to blame.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark247"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark248"></a>A Comparison or Two</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">As a result of the determination of the Mexican people to rise above the level permitted during the 400 years of domination by the Roman Hierarchy, the last quarter of a century has seen the illiteracy of the people reduced from 85 percent to less than 60 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">It is well known that the Catholic population of the United States is shown in the census returns as only 14| percent of the total, or 18,605,003 out of a total of 128,429,000. Extreme estimates add another 2,004,299 to the Government figures, making the Catholic percentage 16 percent. Take a look now at Washington, D.C. For the fiscal year 1937 the District of Columbia appropriation for the relief of undernourished school children in the public schools amounts to $66,553. Gentle reader, you figure it out for yourself and decide what amount should go to parochial schools for the undernourished children therein. After a few minutes, because you are generous, you say 16 percent of $66,553 is the amount the parochial schools should get; and that amounts to $10,648.48. Wrong; they get $82,719. And if you don’t know why, under Mr. Farley’s reign, they get eight times what they should, then you are too dumb to read </span><span class="font15" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font15"> and get anything out of it.</span></p>

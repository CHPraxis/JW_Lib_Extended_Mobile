<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>HIS “WORK” AND HIS “ACT”</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">“As </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I have </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">done to Shiloh.”—Jer. 7:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH used Nebuchadnezzar as his “servant”, that is, Jehovah caused the heathen king to play a part in the great dramatic prophecy, and in the part he played Nebuchadnezzar pictured Christ Jesus, God’s 'elect servant’, the King of the world. Satan is the mimic god, whose purpose is to mock and discredit the Almighty God. At Salan’s command the people were led to build the tower of Bal/el, which name to those natives meant “the gate of god”. A “gate” means a way of entrance, and it is reasonable to conclude that the old Deceiver, the Serpent, Satan, the Devil, induced the people to believe that the way for them to reach heaven was through the tower of Babel, built by their own efforts; and that, of course, would be a mockery of Jehovah. Nimrod, whose name means ‘rebellious one that rules’, was therefore a fit person to represent the arch rebel, Satan, the mimic god, in that work of mockery. It is reasonable to conclude that the name Bab'cl, as used by the Devil and his representatives, is used in mockery or ridicule when in fact the name does mean “gate of god”. The name “Ba'bcl” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Hebrew)</span><span class="font5"> means “confusion”, because God there confused the multitudes. (Gen. 11:9) Babylon, the name of Satan’s organization, would be appropriated or adopted by Satan for the purpose of bringing reproach upon Jehovah’s name, since that is the course that Satan takes in everything. By his decree Jehovah has ordered the destruction of Babylon, Satan’s organization, and which decree would be executed in due time by Jehovah’s elect servant. In the meantime Jehovah uses Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, to play a part picturing the rightful king of the world, Christ Jesus. It may therefore properly be said that when the name Babylon is used as applied to the work done by Jehovah, it means the gate or way to God. Christ Jesus is the only way unto God. (John 14: 6) The name Babylon, as used by Satan and which therefore is used for the purpose of mockery and reproach, applies to that which shall be destroyed by Jehovah. The course taken by Satan is one of suicide. (Ezek. 28:18) He builds up an organization and names it in mockery of Jehovah, and within that organization of the Devil destruction starts as an internal-combustion consuming fire. It seems quite appropriate, therefore, that Jehovah would cause the king of Babylon to act as the executioner of the rebellious people of Judah and Jerusalem, the destruction of which foreshadows the destruction of “Christendom ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> The typical people of God had become unfaithful, and Jehovah directed his prophet Jeremiah to tell them that he had committed all things into the hand of his servant, the king of Babylon: “And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the boasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.’’ (Jer. 27:6) In the year 1914 Jehovah, in fulfillment of this part of the prophetic drama, gave all the world to Christ Jesus, the Conqueror and rightful King, whom Nebuchadnezzar pictured in the prophetic drama. (Ps. 2:6-9) Jehovah had appointed Christ Jesus to that high position when he raised him out of death, but Jesus must wait until God’s due time for him to begin his reign. (Ps. 110:1, 2) Now Christ Jesus is overlord of the earth, sent forth to displace the unfaithful Lucifer, who became Satan, the Devil, by reason of his rebellion. Thus Jehovah establishes his great “tree”, Christ Jesus, under which tree all of earth’s creatures who live shall dwell in safety.— Ezek. 17:22-24; see </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font5"> Book One, page 232.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> Referring now to the prophetic picture or type: Nebuchadnezzar was a great warrior, conquering the nations, and in this he pictured Christ Jesus, the Conqueror of the whole world. “And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the very time of his land come; and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.” (Jer. 27:7) In the type Nebuchadneizir made a conquest of the nations. Jerusalem was destroyed by the king of Babylon, and the Babylonish empire came into undisputed control over all nations round about. Babylon, under Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, became the world power of that time. It was provided in Jehovah’s decree that all nations were to serve not only Nebuchadnezzar, but his son and his grandson. Thus the empire foreshadowed by the rule of Nebuchadnezzar is shown</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">to have complete mastery of the whole world, and that no rebellion could ever overthrow that rule. Since the beginning of the reign of Christ Jesus, in 1914, the people of good will, learning that fact, seek the Lord; and this is illustrated by the people of Gibeon seeking out Joshua and asking his protection. (Josh. 9:1-15) So now the people of good will gladly submit without resistance, and they come from all nations of the earth to place themselves under the protection and rule of Christ Jesus, whom Nebuchadnezzar foreshadowed. But all the other people of the nations, which hold to Satan’s organization, are angry at Christ Jesus, the rightful Ruler, and oppose his reign, and they will be compelled to be submissive to the Lord, and to this end they are completely debased and will be destroyed. The Lord Jesus Christ compels them to serve and be submissive, even to destruction, for the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘The name “Sheshaeh” applies to the Devil himself and to his organization and means the same thing as “Babylon” when that name is applied to Satan’s organization. (Jer. 51:41) The prophecy therefore reads: “Shall serve him . . . until the very time of his land [Sheshaeh] come.” The words “very time”, used in this prophecy, show the time of change of the application of the name Babylon. Two generations after Nebuchadnezzar’s death “the very time” mentioned in the prophecy came; hence at this point the picture changes and applies to Satan’s system, which is called Babylon. The latter part of Jeremiah’s prophecy conclusively proves this point. Nebuchadnezzar in person never lost his world-power rule, nor did he ever see “the very time of his land”, for the reason that he died before that time and hence was out of the picture; but'the king Nebuchadnezzar up to this time showed another very important part of what should come to pass. Christ Jesus lives for ever and will never see any ending of his world ;&gt;ower. Christ will reign gloriously to the end of the thousand years assigned for that purpose, and will then turn the kingdom over to Jehovah God, his Father. —Kev. 20: 4-6; 1 Cor. 15: 24-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘In the complete fulfillment of this part of the prophetic drama “the very time of his land [Sbe-shach] ” will come with the end of Armageddon, that is, following God’s “strange act”. It comes when Christ Jesus, the great Vindicator, destroys the political, commercial and military forces of Satan’s visible organization, and all the invisible forces, including Gog and Satan hi. zclf; as it is written: “And the king of Sheshaeh [Babylon, of which the Devil is the head and king] shall drink after them.” (Jer. 25:26) Satan’s organization is religious, and that includes the political, commercial, military and all other parts thereof. What, then, shall follow after the destruction of that wicked system? “Then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him,” says the prophet of Jehovah. (Jer. 27:7) The “great kings” here mentioned are “the kings of the east”, pictured or foreshadowed by Darius the Mede and by Cyrus the Persian, that is, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. (Sec </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> 1934, page 347.) Darius and Cyrus came from the cast, leading their armies of Medes and Persians and of many allied nations against Babylon, which was then ruled bj' Belshazzar, the Devil’s visible representative.—Isa. 21:2; 22:6; Dan. 5:28,30,31; 6:28; Rev. 16:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘Those who are allied with Jehovah and Christ Jesus or are in Jehovah’s organization, include all ‘the armies which are in heaven’ (Rev. 19:14), and these “serve themselves” of Satan, the king of Babylon, pictured by Belshazzar, by the complete destruction thereof to the glorious vindication of Jehovah’s name. For just such “service” Jehovah has permitted Satan and his Babylon to remain and opeiale for these six thousand years, in order that Jehovah might give the Devil full opportunity and that then lie might cause his own great name to be testified to, and then completely sweep away the Devil’s organization by Jehovah’s “strange act”. Before that “strange act” of Jehovah he does his “strange work”, to wit, the world-wide proclamation against Satan’s religious system and his organization in general, and this is in fulfillment of his declaration long previously made: “That my name may be declared throughout all the earth.”—Ex. 9:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’Jehovah compels all nations, peoples and tongues to come under the rule of Christ Jesus, and those who refuse to do so shall be destroyed. This is foretold by the message God required Jeremiah to deliver: “And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the Lord, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.”—Jer. 27: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’Jehovah knew the end from Ihc beginning, and therefore lie has abided his own good time to take action against the rebellious ones. He foreknew that none of the nations, not even “Christendom”, would willingly bow the neck to and consent to be governed by Christ, the rightful Ruler of the world. (Isa. 8:14; 1 Pet. 2:8) But he gives the nations warning that they must submit themselves to Christ or be destroyed, and this is done that they may hate no excuse to plead ignorance. The religionists who practice the so-called “Christian religion” have rejected Christ Jesus the King, and have consorted with the other elements of Satan’s organization to set up a rule of the earth according to their own ideas. (Ps. 2:6-12) All the nations, including all of “Christendom”, are against God and his kingdom under Christ; but “Christendom” is the worst because posing as Christian, thereby deceiving many people and bringing great reproach upon God’s holy name. In ancient times Jehovah used Nebuchadnezzar to punish the Israelites, who wero pledged to obey him. Now Jehovah will use the One whom Nebuchadnezzar foreshadowed, to wit, Christ Jesus, to bring punishment upon the nations, and particularly upon “Christendom”, who are in an implied covenant to obey the Lord. In what manner will he punish them? The prophet says, ‘with the sword, famine, and pestilence,' all of which are symbolic of destruction. This shows that Jehovah lays siege to the enemy’s stronghold by his great servant, Christ, who sees to it that none shall escape. (Jcr. 25:35) The Lord has his enemy surrounded, and at Armageddon lie will fight and give no quarter. None can break through his battle lines, and all will be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“God’s message of warning was first to the Israelites and then to the heathen, as appears in verse three of this chapter. The leaders, amongst both the Jews and the nations round about, had induced the people to follow their advice. When God sent a warning by Jeremiah, be told the people that they were not to give heed to the self-constituted wise ones amongst them.- “Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Yc shall not serve the king of Babylon.” (Jer. 27:9) Jehoiakim, and after him Zedekiah, and their Jewish supporters and religious leaders, were leaning on Egypt for help. They did not think it possible that Egypt would back down before Babylon, and therefore they did not expect themselves, the Jews, to ever have to wear the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar. These religious and political leaders so informed the people, because, as they told them and the people believed, they could apply to Egypt for help and be assured of getting it and therefore Jerusalem could successfully resist the king of Babylon. The people, being induced to believe what these self-constituted wise men and prophetsand preachers said, would conclude that the message Jeremiah was bringing them was a very strange one and that his work was a strange work. To the leaders of the heathen nations, and to the people round about Jerusalem, Jeremiah and his work would also sound very strange. It would seem very unusual that the Jewish nation should be warned to put themselves under the rule of Babylon. These leaders, some among them at least, claimed to be prophets, and they prophesied or announced their prognostications before the Jews, and the heathen clergy preachers or prophets did likewise, haranguing the people and telling them that there was no danger from Babylon and therefore the people should give no heed to Jeremiah’s ‘fanciful prediction’. The people were credulous and were led by the self-constituted prophets and wise men.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Exactly the same conditions exist today. The clergy of “Christendom” and other chief ones of the religionists do not hesitate to say that their organization shall stand for ever. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy<sup>7</sup> in particular boastfully claims that nothing shall prevail against that organization, not even hell itself, and the credulous “Catholic population” in general believe what these self-constituted prophets say. In modern times politicians have also turned to be prophets. They say: “History shows that every one that has opposed the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has eventually lost out and that every political ruler that now opposes the Hierarchy will fail to survive. ” Mussolini was at first opposed to the Hierarchy<sup>7</sup>, but now he switches about and makes peace with “papa”. The Congress of the United States, and other public officials, manifestly are afraid of the Roman Catholic. Hierarchy and are afraid to have anything even said about that devilish organization; and so they submit to the prognostications of the Hierarchy. The so-called “Protestants” cannot help but sec that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is working with the political dictators, but those so-called “Christian religionists” have no faith in the Bible and do not believe what the Bible says about Satan’s organization. On January 18, 1937, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune</span><span class="font5"> (New York) published a statement issued by the Methodist Federation to the effect that the Vatican is backing Mussolini, Hitler and Franco, adding, however, that only the political policies of the Vatican are assailed. Even those Methodists have not the faith and courage to oppose the Vatican’s devilish doctrines that are deceiving and turning the people away from God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> has published time and again the fact that Mussolini and Hitler are acting under the direction of the Vatican, and also has shown the Scriptural reason therefor and what shall be the result. If the aforementioned Methodists had faith in God and in his Word they would boldly say what the </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font5"> publications have said, to wit: That the h’oinan Catholic Hierarchy relies upon false doctrines, and hoodwinks the common people, while working with the other elements of Satan’s organization to gain control of the nations of the earth and to rule them by dictator’s, and that for this reason they have openly repudiated Jehovah God’s Word and rejected his King, Christ Jesus, and that now they<sup>7</sup> shall suffer destruction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other clergy<sup>7 </sup>scornfully push away from them any literature that publishes the truth of God’s Word concerning his kingdom. They order their parishioners not to read it, and to destroy<sup>7</sup> what comes into their possession. Other religionists, together with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, seoff at the idea that the great system that now rules the earth, religious, political, financial, military and social, shall ever suffer destruction. To them the message brought by<sup>7</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses at llis command, concerning God’s name and his purpose to destroy Satan’s organization, is foolishness and they<sup>7</sup> denounce it as unbelievable. The prophecy of God’s Word, showing his purpose to destroy all nations at Armageddon, and which prophecy is delivered to the people by Jehovah’s witnesses, seems very “strange” to all those who support the religious organization, and they turn away from it and dismiss it with the mere words, “We are not interested.” Only those persons of good will give heed to the message of the Lord, and only these will be protected. Jehovah commanded Jeremiah to say to the people that they should not hearken unto their prophets, soothsayers or sorcerers. Likewise today Jehovah, through his Word which is delivered by his witnesses, informs the people that they should not believe the clergy, the preachers, or the politicians, who tell them that there is no possible danger of Armageddon’s eoming. The clergy are therefore the more reprehensible; for the reason that they not only decline to ally themselves with God’s kingdom under Christ, but prevent many other people from doing so. —Matt. 23:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Why did Jehovah tell the people to refuse to give heed to the clergymen and other prognosticators? Why does he now tell the people not to listen to the priests of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy clergymen and other so-called “prophets”? “For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.” (Jcr. 27:10) In view of the punishment that had been inflicted upon other prophets of Jehovah it took real faith in God, and therefore genuine eourage, for Jeremiah to deliver the message that he did deliver. Having full faith in Jehovah, Jeremiah courageously called a lie a lie, regardless of what might be said of him as using rough talk. No doubt the clergymen of that time said that “the sj&gt;cech of this man Jeremiah shocks our religious susceptibilities of our time-honored organization”. Jeremiah was speaking the truth because God had commanded it; and even though the truth docs shock the religious susceptibilities of the clergy, it is doing them a good turn, and also the people in general a good turn, to publish the truth; and therefore the message of God is of the greatest public interest, convenience and necessity. The message was from the Lord and was a warning for the people of Jerusalem; and likewise the message delivered today is a warning to the people of “Christendom” and is for their good, if only they would so regard it. It is far more important that the people should know the truth, that they may learn and take the right way and find protection, than for Jehovah’s witnesses to put on the soft pedal in order to avoid shocking the religious susceptibilities of pious clergymen. The people in general must have an opportunity to hear the message, and for this reason God commands that it shall be delivered.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“Jehovah’s message having been declared by Jeremiah in the presence and hearing of the supporters </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">religionists of that time, those supporters could not plead ignorance and shift the responsibility on God. Likewise today, the message of truth being declared in the presence and hearing of the people who support “Christendom” puts the responsibility upon them to act, and they will not be permitted to plead ignorance. The purpose of the Devil, as shown by the foregoing text of the prophecy, is to drive the people away from God that they might perish; and Jeremiah so told them. The same thing is true today. Even those who do not support the religionists must have an opportunity to hear. The godless ones may conclude that after the destruction of the religious systems, which operate in the name of God, then they, the godless, will have a larger freedom and license for wickedness and that therefore they can entirely ignore Jehovah. They will find, however, that the destruction of the religious systems does not mean that there is no Jehovah God nor Christ Jesus; rather the prophecy shows that they will learn that the overthrow of the religionists means that the non-rcligionists arc next in line to be dealt with by the Lord and thereby wiped out in disgrace. Ungodliness is no more justified than hypocritical religionists. The judgment day of Jehovah is here and is so exacting and searching that scarcely the righteous shall escape.—1 Pet. 4:17, IS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Jehovah’s time is at hand when his name and his kingdom must be declared to the nations as a witness, and this must be done before Armageddon begins. This was clearly foretold by the message delivered by Jeremiah to the non-Jews as well as to the Jews. Jehovah informs the nations, in advance of approaching Armageddon, of the great ills that will come to them by refusing to bow themselves willingly to the rule of his servant, Christ Jesus, and this is done in order that they may not have an excuse for ignorance. God will permit to survive and live only those who willingly put them selves under the rule of Christ Jesus, who, in the prophetic drama spoken and enacted by Jeremiah, was pictured by the king of Babylon. The prophet therefore says: “But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the Lord; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.”—Jer. 27:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Jehovah’s King will extend his rule over all the earth, and no power can successfully resist him. Those who will benefit by his rule will prove to be, not the nations as a whole, but the individuals of those nations who arc of good will toward God, who learn the truth and who willingly and gladly submit themselves to God’s King, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> The message delivered by Jeremiah to the nations was a prophecy illustrated with a wooden yoke or bent pole put on the neck. The Devil’s crowd thought to counteract God’s message, and therefore the false prophet, IlananiaL, broke the yoke that was on Jeremiah’s neck: “Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and brake it. And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">two </span><span class="font5">full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.” (Jer. 28:10,11) Thus the false prophet was endeavoring to induce the people to believe that Jeremiah’s prophecy was false and that they should within a short time be entirely free from the Babylonish king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>ir</sup> The Roman Catholic clergy take exactly the same course today. They tell the people that the message </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of Jehovah </span><span class="font5">God, which he sends by his witnesses telling </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the people </span><span class="font5">that Armageddon is near, and that he </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font5">destroy the godless as well as “Christendom”, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">wholly false, and these clergymen use all the power and influence that they possess to destroy in the mind of the people, the effect of the message of truth. The false prophets of the present day, to wit, the Hierarchy clergymen and their supporters, tell the people that the nations will stand for ever and that the Roman Catholic organization is the rightful representative </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">God on earth, and that that organization shall rule </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5">ever and stand for ever. These clergymen, therefore, stand in the same position that Hananiah occupied, in their efforts to destroy faith in God’s message that is brought to them. That the Devil and his agents cannot thwart Jehovah is illustrated by what followed the breaking of that wooden yoke by the false prophet; “Then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the proph</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">et </span><span class="font5">had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Go and tell Hananiah, say</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ing, </span><span class="font5">Thus saith the Lord, Thou bast broken the yokes </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span class="font5">thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Babylon; and they shall serve him ; and I have given </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">him </span><span class="font5">the beasts of 1 he field also.”—Jer. 28:12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” Likewise Jehovah tells the people, through his Word, that not only arc the false prophets or clergymen, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their supporters, uttering lies by their words, but all their efforts to thwart God’s purpose will fail, and that only those who will give heed to God’s Word and put themselves under Christ Jesus shall ever live. The nations cannot escape by following the instruct ion given them by false prophets. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy will succeed for a time, but within a short time thereafter it will be completely destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>w</sup> Jeremiah spoke to Zedekiah, king of Judah, and informed him that only those who would wear the yoke of the king of Babylon should live. Antitypieally this means that only those who voluntarily serve Christ Jesus shall live. Furthermore Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, and, no doubt, in the heaving of the people: “Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the Lord bath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ? ’ ’—Jer. 27:13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Zedekiah and bis supporters pictured the presentday ruling elements, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the supporters of that devilish religious system, and which is generally known as “Chris-tendom”and is falsely called the “Christian religion”. “Christendom” thinks she is different from the heathen nations and does not need to change her course of action and submit to God and his King, Christ Jesus. “Christendom,” meaning the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and her supporters, thinks to rule heaven and earth, but the prophecy of God shows exactly to the contrary. “Christendom,” and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, has greatly exalted herself, and now she must, according to the decree of Jehovah, be brought low and wallow in the dust of the earth. God says to the people, as he says to their rulers now: ‘Why will you die? Why not serve the King, Christ Jesus, and live?’ (Jer. 27:13) Those who refuse will certainly die.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> As Jeremiah, the servant of God, warned the rulers and the people to give no heed to the false prophets, such as Hananiah, even so today Jehovah, by sending his witnesses with his message of warning to the rulers and to the people of “Christendom”, tells them to give no heed to the false prophets, such as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other clergymen, and their supporters. Jehovah’s witnesses must carry this message to the people. This they have been doing and are still doing, by God’s grace. The people must be warned, as Jeremiah warned Jerusalem, saying: “Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets [preachers or clergymen] that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.”—Jer, 27:14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup>In Jeremiah’s day those false prophets did not trust in God, but they trusted in Egypt for help. Likewise today the false prophets, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other clergymen, do not trust in God, but they trust in worldly power, their own power, to accomplish their own selfish desires. As the people of Jerusalem did not have an appreciation of the sin that made it necessary for Jehovah Io execute his-judgment upon that city, even so now the people who support organized religion do not have an appreciation of the sins of “Christendom”, and that it is God’s will that all who live must willingly come under the rule of Christ Jesus. Hananiah prophesied falsely and gained the support of the people, and they tell under his seductive words; and likewise today the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other clergymen prophesy falsely before the people in order to keep the people in ignorance of God’s purpose. It means, therefore, a fight against these false prophets for Jehovah’s witnesses to continue to carry the message to the people that they may have an opportunity to be informed. The clergy, although hearing the message, are too proud to repent, and th 'refore they will not tell the truth to the people, and hence attempt to prevent the people from hearing it in any manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">*’ Jeremiah told the people that such men as Hana-niah prophesied a lie; and likewise today Jehovah’s witnesses, informing the people of the truth, thereby show to them that those clergymen who prophesy contrary to God’s Word are deliberately lying. These clergymen represent the Devil, and they do the will of their father the Devil. (John 8:44) Hananiah had not been sent forth by Jehovah to prophesy in His name. Neither had God sent any of these other false prophets, and therefore he commanded Jeremiah to say to the people: “For I have not sent them, saith the Lord, yet they prophesy a lie in my name, that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, yc, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.’’—Jcr. 27:15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> Corresponding thereto, Jehovah God has not commissioned the men of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy or any other clergymen to prophesy in his name to the people, and when those men go to the people and prophesy, they prophesy falsehoods, and hence they deliberately lie. Not only do they lie, but they persecute Jehovah’s witnesses for telling the people the truth as commanded by Jehovah. By the ungodly religious ceremonies that they practice and by the doctrines that they teach, and by the prognostications that they make, the clergymen keep the people in ignorance of God and his purpose, and turn them away from God. What Jeremiah said to Hananiah, the false prophet who opposed God’s message, now applies with stronger force to the present-day clergymen, who prophesy lies before the people. To the false prophet God’s messenger said: “Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Ilear now, Hana-niah, The Lord hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou sbalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the Lord. So Hananiah the prophet died the same year, in the seventh month.” —Jer. 28:15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> Such is the written judgment of Jehovah against </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">false prophecies that arc uttered by the leaders </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">“Christendom”. His Word, therefore, clearly shows that Jehovah’s witnesses must declare the truth today as commanded, even though it shocks the religious susceptibilities of the clergy. It is not the judgment of men, but is the judgment of Al might y God, written against those who resist him and his King, and who falsely prophesy and mislead the people. His decree is that such shall be cast out and die. This message must be delivered because God has so commanded it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses are not fighting any man or company of men, even as Jeremiah the prophet was not fighting against men, but was merely obeying God’s commandments: “Also I spake to the priests, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">to all this people [as well as the king], saying, Thus saith the Lord, Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the Lord’s house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.”—Jcr. 27:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses, in obedience to God’s commandments, have declared to the nations, the clergy, the politicians, and the commercial and military men, God’s announced judgment and purpose of destroying Satan’s organization at Armageddon. They must continue to carry this message to the common people in order that all “Christendom” may be warned, and that those who arc of good will toward God may give heed to his Word and find the way to life. Their work, therefore, is not a fight against men, but a proclamation of the truth, which is a fight against wicked systems organized and carried on by the Devil. In the face of and contrary to the message of God delivered by Jeremiah, Hananiah the false prophet defiantly challenged the message of the Lord and falsely said to the people: “Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon: within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the Lord’s house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon; and I will bring again to this place Jcconiah the son of Jehoia-kim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the Lord: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. ” (Jer. 28: 2-4) Hananiah must have known that he was lying. Likewise today the Roman Catholic Hierarchy must know that they are lying. God foretells that they even say they have hidden themselves behind lies; which refuge he will destroy.—Isa. 28:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Judah and Jerusalem were very much disturbed by the prophecy delivered by Jeremiah. Likewise today “organized religion”, and particularly its leaders, experience a severe shock of their susceptibilities by reason of the message of God delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses, and this of itself shows that the clergy arc false vessels or instruments which bear religious fodder to the people and from which the people receive no nourishment or benefit whatsoever. The proclamation of the truth by Jehovah’s witnesses is like unto the invasion of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. The Lord Jesus Christ, the Greater-than-Nebuchad-nezzar, leads this assault now upon the religionists, and those false prophets and their organization are being jarred to the very foundations. The clergymen have been so shocked by the truth that they put forth every effort to destroy the message. A Catholic newspaper recently issued against Jehovah's witnesses says: “Some action will have to be taken sooner or later, and it is better taken now before the damage is greater than it already is.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(The Catholic Standard, </span><span class="font5">Tasmania, October 29, 1936) This is in line with Cardinal Dougherty’s declaration to the effect that “he will take . . . more drastic action” unless the publication of the kingdom message ceases. Those roosters arrogate to themselves a tremendous power and influence. Their day of disappointment is near. In their attempt at the present time to keep up their courage and the courage of their supporters the Roman Catholic Hierarchy say: “We will, within a short time, gain all that was lost </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">times past, and this we will do at the expense of Jehovah’s witnesses.” In other words, their purpose is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">destroy all the witnesses of Jehovah and their work in order that the Hierarchy may ride high and easy </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">without opposition. That organization now looks </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to its </span><span class="font5">ally, “Egypt,” that is, the political and financial supporters, for help.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>22</sup> The </span><span class="font5">religious leaders of the Jews said, and likewise the religious leaders of “Christendom” say to the people: “The message brought to you by Jehovah’s witnesses is too strange for belief. Therefore give no heed to that message. Look to us for advice. We are sure that our organization </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font5">stand for ever.” But, directly contrary to the s[&gt;cech of such false prophets, Jehovah’s true prophet Jeremiah says concerning those religionists: “Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">city </span><span class="font5">be laid waste?”—Jcr. 27 :</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> No doubt there are yet within the religious organizations those persons of good will who arc prisoners. (Isa. 49: 9) They must be given the opportunity to hear and to hearken unto the Lord. There are those outside of the religious organizations that desire righteousness and hence are of good will toward God. These must have the opportunity to hear the kingdom message and be told that the only way of escape and the only place of safety is by serving the Lord Jesus Christ, the King whom Nebuchadnezzar foreshadowed in this prophetic picture. The goodness of Jehovah God is manifested toward the people by sending them the message of warning. He therefore makes it an imperative obligation upon Jehovah’s witnesses that they must deliver this message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> Jeremiah suggested a test which would determine </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">whether </span><span class="font5">those prognosticators such </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">Hananiah were true or false prophets. Likewise a test is open to the clergymen at the present time. If they were honest, true and faithful representatives </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the Lord, they would tell the truth to the people. Also Jehovah God would give heed to their prayers, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font5">he does not hear the prayers of false and fraudulent preachers. Therefore at God’s command Jeremiah announced the test in these words: “But if they be prophets, and if the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the Lord be with them, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">let </span><span class="font5">them now make intercession to the Lord of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the Lord, and in the house </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon. ’ ’—Jcr. 27:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> If the opposers of Jeremiah had been sincere and honest and possessed faith in God, they would show this by making such intercession as Jeremiah suggested. Had they done so, that would have shown that they had fear of the warning from God which had been announced to them by the mouth of Jeremiah. It would show that they desired to have some part in the service of God. The same is today true of the clergymen of “Christendom”. If they were really the representatives of God and they were sincere and honest, they would give heed to what is written in the Scriptures and would tell the people the truth as it is written therein, instead of withholding from the people the truth of the Bible. On the contrary, the clergy today, particularly the Hierarchy, instruct the people to not even read the Bible but to believe only what the priests tell them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> Some of the vessels of the Lord had not at the time of Jeremiah been taken away by Nebuchadnezzar, and concerning the same the Lord directed Jeremiah to say: “For thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jcconiah, the son of Jchoiakim king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; yea, thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the Lord, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem; They shall be carried [away].”—Jcr. 27:19-22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> Jehovah was giving warning that the remaining vessels would be taken away to Babylon. This part of the prophecy finds a fulfillment in modern times, in this, to wit: The Elisha work, which Jehovah’s witnesses now by His grace are doing, will not wreck the religious organizations or organized religions. Elisha’s witness work now exposes to view the crookedness of “Christendom” and is used to the pulling down of strongholds of “Christendom”, in the minds of honest and sincere people. The honor of wrecking the systems or religious organizations is given to Christ Jesus. As Samson inflicted punishment upon the Philistines and left the finishing work to David, even so now the finishing touches upon the enemies of God will be put on by the Greater David, the Lord Jesus Christ. The work now being done by the faithful followers of Christ Jesus in declaring the judgments of Jehovah against “Christendom” is very exasperating and humiliating to the religionists; but there is far more to follow, not of work by the witnesses, but the destructive work by Christ Jesus. When the uncovering of religious frauds is completed and the witness work done, then will follow the execution of Jehovah’s judgment, that is, “his act, his strange act.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> “They shall be carried [away] to Babylon, and there shall they be.” (Verse 22) How long? “Until the day that I visit them, saith the Lord.” (Vs. 22) Those vessels in the temple were carried away, and remained for seventy years. That part of the prophecy meant nothing less than the total destruction of the city of Jerusalem and everything in it. Likewise it foretells that Jehovah’s “strange act” will mean </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">complete destruction of “Christendom” and everything pertaining thereto. The remaining words of Jeremiah 27:22, to wit, “then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place,” manifestly refer to the remnant, that is, God’s faithful witnesses on earth. As </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">remnant was saved out of Israel, so there </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">is a </span><span class="font5">remnant unto God that has come out of “Christendom”, and which remnant maintain their integrity toward God. The returning must take place seventy years after the destruction of Jerusalem, and therefore could not refer to unfaithful Jerusalem, but to the faithful remnant of the Israelites who rebuilt </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">city. This promise, therefore, docs not apply to wicked “Christendom” nor have any reference to the restoration of “Christendom” at any time. It docs apply antitypically to God’s faithful remnant on the earth from and after 1918 who then became a part of the New Jerusalem. After these faithful ones had undergone punishment they were fully restored to God’s favor and his anger was entirely removed from them. —Isa. 12:1-3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;TO ALL THE PEOPLE”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ The events set forth in the preceding part of Jeremiah’s prophecy, and considered heretofore in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> find full agreement in what follows and which is set out in the 25th chapter of Jeremiah's prophecy. That chapter should be carefully read and prayerfully considered, together with what follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">*’ “The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jchoia-kim, the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.” (Jer. 25:1) Jeremiah had been commanded to take his stand in the court of the Lord’s house and to there proclaim the message of the Lord, fie there pictured Jehovah’s witnesses who take their stand after 1919 and who remain on God’s side fearlessly declaring his message. It was about that time that God’s consecrated people on the earth began to sec that the prophet Elijah and his work pictured a certain part of Jehovah’s work, and that Elisha the prophet and his work pictured a work of Jehovah’s servants that must be performed without fear of man or devil. For the benefit of those who have later come to a knowledge of the truth mention Is here made that it was in 1919, at the first Cedar Point (Ohio) convention, that the Lord made known to his people the distinction between the Elijah and the Elisha work of the church. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> August 1 and 15, 1919.) Jehovah foreknew and graciously foretold that his servants would be entrusted with a service to be performed that would require absolute and complete faith in him and they would trust him implicitly for protection and salvation, and that therefore they must do their work without fear of what man might do unto them. Elijah showed fear, and well pictured what occurred prior to 1919. Elisha showed no fear of creatures, and pictured w’hat must take place after 1919. The experiences through which the faithful servants of Jehovah have passed furnish an abundance of proof that the fear of man and of the Devil and his agents must not be permitted to deter them in their work or interfere with their maintaining their integrity toward God. They must fear God and be blind to everything save that of doing his will. As servants they must steadfastly go forward, relying upon Jehovah and Christ Jesus, their Head and Lord. The faithful witnesses have now come to appreciate the great truth that the joy of the Lord is their strength. They likewise appreciate the fact that the fear of man leads them into a snare and that they must fear God only and make him their sanctuary.—Isa. 8:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WARNING THE REMNANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’<sup>8</sup> Now we come to the examination of that part of the prophecy littered by Jeremiah at God’s commandment and which shows beyond all question of doubt that Jehovah’s witnesses must henceforth maintain their integrity toward God under the most trying conditions. The faithful will have in mind that to be forewarned of difficulties just ahead means to be forearmed and to meet them in tho strength of the Lord and in the power of his might. The hypocritical crowd of religionists are increasing in power amongst the nations, and will continue to exercise their power until they have readied that point when they will boastfully declare, “Peace and safety,” and, “Now we shall rule the world without interference.” When they reach that point, as this prophecy shows, and which is supported by other prophecies, God’s wrath will fall upon them, and none of Satan’s organization will find any way of escape. To strengthen his people, and to give them comfort and hope, the Lord Jehovah now graciously unfolds to his people his prophes ies. Those who really love God and trust him implicitly will not be dismayed or even disturbed by what the Lord reveals to them and which shall shortly fall upon the nations of the earth, nor will they be deterred in the performance of assigned duty. The faithful will continue to feed upon “the meat in due season” which the Lord provides for them. They will diligently and prayerfully study w’hat God makes known to them. They will dwell together in peace with each other and show their love one for another by wntehing carefully for the interest of each other and endeavoring to render help to their brethren, including the Jona-dabs. (Jer. 35:G-19) This docs not mean finan-ial help, but the help that enables one to stand firmly, to get an understanding and appreciation of God’s provision for those that love him, and to diligently engage in his service. Let all the faithful therefore stand in the strength of the Lord and remember that God’s people must stand shoulder to shoulder against the entrenched enemy. The admonition of the apostle Paul is peculiarly appropriate now: ‘Be alert; stand firm in the faith; acquit yourselves like men; be strong. Let all that you do be done from love.’ (1 Cor. 16:13, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth)</span><span class="font5"> 'Only let the lives you live be worthy of the gospel of the Christ, in order that, whether I come and see you or, being absent, only hear of you, I may know that you are standing fast in one spirit and with one mind, fighting shoulder to shoulder for the faith of the gospel. Never for a moment quail before your antagonists. Your fearlessness will be to them a sure token of impending destruction, but to you it will be a sure token of your salvation—a token coming from God. For you have had the privilege granted you on behalf of Christ—not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer on His behalf; maintaining, as you do, the same kind of conflict that you once saw in me and which you still hear that I am engaged in.’ (Phil. 1:27-30, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Weym.)</span><span class="font5"> ‘Therefore put on the complete armour of God, so that you may be able to stand your ground in the evil day, and, having fought to the end, to remain victors on the field.’ (Eph. 6:13, Weym.) It seems certain that the climax is rapidly approaching. Have you clothed yourself with the full armor of the Lord? Are you determined, by his grace, to firmly and immovably stand for the Lord and his kingdom, relying wholly upon God and Christ Jesus? Only in the strength of the Lord can any of his people now stand the test that is before them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;Jeremiah was commanded to speak to all the people of Judah and the city of Jerusalem. The Judeans pictured the ones now on earth and to whom God’s act will be a “strange act” because, although unfaithful to God, they will unworthily lay claim to the promises of God. They do not consider that such promises are of no value to them because of their unfaithfulness. Following their leaders that have had a form of worship, which they call “godliness”, they have likewise performed ceremonies, but they have no love for God and his kingdom. The time is fixed by the prophecy mentioned, and manifestly fixes the time of its fulfillment, which is in these last days.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> Jehovah had suffered Pharaoh to put Jchoiakiin on the doomed throne of Jerusalem, and he had continued there for four years. That was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who here plays the part picturing Christ Jesus, whose first year at the temple was in 1918. That was the first year of his (Christ Jesus’) being laid in Zion as the Chief Corner Stone. (Isa. 28:16) Therefore the prophecy recorded at the 25th chapter of Jeremiah appears to have its antitypical proclamation beginning after 1918, and its actual fulfillment also thereafter.—See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication, </span><span class="font5">Book One, pages 248,253.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> It was in the beginning of 1918 that “Christendom” rejected “The Stone laid in Zion”, that is, the rightful King of the world, and set its hopes on the League of Nations. (Isa. 8:9-15) In other words, “Christendom” looked to its own power, the pow<sup>r</sup>cr of men, to rule in man’s appointed way, even though claiming the League of Nations to be “the expression of God’s kingdom on earth”. It was following that time that Jehovah began his “strange work” by having Christ Jesus to use the temple company, the remnant on the earth, which Jeremiah pictured, to proclaim the most strange and unusual message throughout “Christendom” that had ever been heard by “Christendom”, and such message has so greatly “shocked the religious susceptibilities” of the clergymen and has appeared so very strange to those dupes who support and bear up the Devil’s organization that they called it a “strange work”. Jehovah had caused Isaiah to prophesy that his “strange work”, which is the proclamation of God’s message, would follow the laying of the Chief Corner Stone in Zion. (Isa. 28:16-21) All the facts show the fulfillment of that prophecy is now in progress and is nearing the end.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> When Nebuchadnezzar ascended the throne of Babylon that proved that the end of Judah was near, because Nebuchadnezzar was Jehovah’s chosen executioner. Likewise when Christ Jesus was enthroned and came to the temple for judgment, that proved that the end of “Christendom” was near, because he is the great Judge before whom all the nations must appear and receive the execution of Jehovah’s judgment. The facts fully support this conclusion. Thus the prophecy fixes the time of the proclamation by Jeremiah and the time of the fulfillment. At God’s commandment Jeremiah spoke: “The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying.” (Jer. 25:2) The people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem were relying upon their religious leaders, the clergy, and the chief men among them, and hence were loath to believe the message that Jeremiah spoke. At that time Egypt still show’cd herself a power to be reckoned with and had, only four years previous to that time, made Judah a tributary of, or dependent on, Egypt, by placing Jehoiakim upon the throne, who was compelled to do the bidding of Egypt. (2 Ki. 23: 28-35) Doubtless the people reasoned that Egypt would be ready to deliver and defend its tributary nation, Judah, against all encroachments bj' Babylon. Judah was a buffer state for Egypt against Babylon. For that same reason here the prophet Jeremiah prophesied contrary to what Egypt might expect to accomplish. Likewise today the peoples arc relying upon the religious organization that rules “Christendom”, and the proclamation of the truth is exactly contrary to what they expect worldly institutions can accomplish.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> Jeremiah had been preaching to the people for twenty-three veal's, and still eighteen years more were to pass before the fall of Jerusalem. He reminded the people of Jerusalem of this fact: “From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the Lord hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.” (Jer. 25:3) In all that period of time Jeremiah was active </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">diligent. He did not lead a lazy life, such as that which is led by the ‘‘dumb dog” class, the clergy of “Christendom”; he did not work a few hours in the day </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">then take it easy the remainder of the time. lie arose early in the cool and fresh part of the day, when the business people were up and about their affairs. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font5">went to them and told them about Jehovah’s purpose. But they did not take his speech seriously. The faithful preaching of Jeremiah for that period of time had brought to Judah a definite crisis, and he told the jieople in plain and emphatic language what God purposed to do to that land. Although diligently working for twenty-three years Jeremiah was not old and worn out. By the grace of God he continued faithfully' to perform his work. That is the privilege of everyone in God’s service today, to continue to work as long as he possesses any strength. Jeremiah’s faithfulness and devotion may well lx? compared with the long and faithful service of some of Jehovah’s witnesses who had part in the Elijah work and who have, since the ending thereof, continued faithful, diligent and zealous in the service of the Elisha period of God’s work. Let those who do have full faith in and love for God take courage now. The difficulties will grow </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font5">less until the “strange work” comes to an end. The fight is on. The old “harlot” and her paramours are more determined than ever to crush Jehovah’s witnesses, and are daily becoming more arrogant, scornful and cruel. Those enemies of God and his people are moving forward with confidence to the destruction </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">everything that exposes the crookedness of their organization. Let all who have taken a stand on the side of Jehovah and who are therefore relying upon the strength of the Lord be mindful of the truth that he who is for us is far greater than all that can be against us. The message which Jeremiah was commanded by the Lord to deliver, as set forth in the 25th chapter of that prophecy, foretells what Jehovah’s witnesses must now do, and what they may be expected to experience in faithfully performing their duty' unto the Lord.</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>INSPECTORS AND EXECUTIONERS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">W</span><span class="font5">HEN, in 1918, Christ Jesus came to inspect the professed people of God and to set up God’s temple of ‘living stones’, Jehovah’s “spiritual house”, he looked with indignation upon the desolation of the earthly part of God’s organization, the covenant people of the Most Itieh, the visible part of the New Jerusalem. More than two thousand years ago Jehovah caused his prophet Zechariah to have a symbolic vision of this and to write about it: “Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Darius [king of Medo-Pcrsia], came the word </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font5">Lord unto Zechariah, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">son </span><span class="font5">of Berechiah, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">son of Iddo the prophet, saying, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">saw by night, and behold a man [Jehovah’s inspector general] riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font5">were in the bottom [east of Jerusalem]: and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">behind </span><span class="font5">him were there red horses, speckled, and white.” —Zech. 1: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Zechariah inquired of the Lord the meaning of these men on horses, and the angel talking with him explained it to him. “Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.” (1:9) This question is propounded for the benefit of those faith</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ful ones </span><span class="font5">of the remnant now on earth, and the angel </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font5">Lord brings to them the needed information in answer to their questions. (Bev. 1:1) This is proof </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font5">the interpretation of prophecy docs not proceed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font5">man, but that the Lord Jesus, the chief one </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">Jehovah’s organization, sends the necessary information to his people by and through his holy angels. “And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These arc they whom the Lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.” (1: 10) In the vision these represent Jehovah’s host that he uses to express his wrath against the enemy. (Bev. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">14:20) </span><span class="font5">With this host Jehovah’s witnesses on earth </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">arc </span><span class="font5">duly associated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan and his wicked agents stalk through the earth </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">spy out and to maliciously act against God’s faith</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ful </span><span class="font5">people; and these horsemen in Zechariah’s vision </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">act as </span><span class="font5">observers of what concerns Jehovah’s organization and to carry out his purposes. The Lord now has his face or attention turned to consideration </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">things on the earth, and he ins|&gt;ects both the enemy organization and the organization of Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5">eyes of the Lord are observing everything on the earth. (Zeeh. 4:10; Bev. 5:6) The horsemen were as the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">eyes of </span><span class="font5">the Lord.—Num. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">10: 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5">undcrinspcctors report </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">their chief: “And </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font5">answered the angel of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> that stood among </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.” (1:11) The substance of their report is that they have found the entire organization </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Satan self-centered, in a state of self-complacency </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">giving no regard or concern to the kingdom </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">God under Christ. This report must have been made following the end of the World War, in 1918, and when Satan’s agencies were seeking means and remedies to bring peace on the war-torn earth. They gave </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font5">heed to God’s kingdom, but so far as it is concerned they sat still and rested and relied upon the League </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Nations, the World Court, peace treaties, and like </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">things, </span><span class="font5">to keep Satan’s organization in possession of the world. Of course, they gave no assistance to God’s people to proclaim the truth, but treated them with contempt. Such describes the attitude of the various parts of Satan’s organization on earth from 1918 to 1922. But God’s remnant got on their feet and began to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">At </span><span class="font5">the conclusion of the report by these underinspectors, “then the angel of the Lord answered and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">said, 0 </span><span class="font5">Lord of hosts, how long wilt thou not have </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">mercy </span><span class="font5">on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years [during which Jerusalem and the land of Judah lay desolate while its former inhabitants were captive in Babylon] ?” (1:12) This corresponds </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to the </span><span class="font5">condition amongst God’s people from 1918 to 1922, probably before the general convention of Jehovah’s witnesses [n the latter year at Cedar Point, Ohio. It was when the Lord’s covenant people at that convention saw that Christ the Great Inspector General had come to the temple that they cried out: “Save now, I beseech thee, 0 Lord: O Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.” (Ps. 118:25) It was in 1922 that God’s covenant people became aware of their own negligence in connection with the building of the antitypical temple of God. It was then that the Lon] spoke words of comfort to them and they rejoiced, seeing that Jehovah’s anger had turned away from them. (Isa. 12:1-4; 61:1-3) “And the Lord answered the angel that talked with me with good words, and comfortable words.”—1:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Zechariah, having received the good and comfortable words from the Lord, was commanded to make a proclamation : “So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.” (1:14) This proclamation or message must be both of God’s vengeance against the enemy and of comfort to his own people. Jehovah had put his name on his consecrated people who represented his true interest and whom he would give a part in the work of vindicating his name. Hence he manifests his jealousy (his zeal) by returning unto Zion his great favor. (Zech. 8:1-3; Ps. 102:16) For that very reason Jehovah provided for the release and delivery of his people from bondage in the year 1919. During the World War Satan’s agencies, partic.ulaily the Anglo-American empire system, had ill-treated God’s faithful people much to the displeasure of Jehovah; hence he caused his prophet to say: “And 1 am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease [careless; proud </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham,</span><span class="font5"> margin) ] ; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the afilic-tion.” (1:15) It was “Christendom”, this Anglo-American empire system, that not only became indifferent to God’s kingdom and rested in case in their own strength to lift up the nations, but helped forward the affliction of God’s people in particular. The Lord also says, “I was but a little displeased,” that is, with his own people, and for this reason he permitted them to be (alien into custody by the enemy. (Jer. 12:7) Instead of “Christendom’s” exercising mercy towards those who preached the gospel of God’s kingdom (at that time this very preaching was with fear and trembling), “Christendom” took delight in punishing Jehovah’s covenant people and ‘helped forward their affliction’. Since then the same agents of Satan continue to make war against God’s anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In making preparation for the punishment of the enemy organization Jehovah sends his “Messenger of the covenant” Christ Jesus, to gather together his people, build up the temple class, and make them fit for participating in his work. (Mal. 3:1-3) “Therefore thus saith the Lord, I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it, saith the Lord of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.” (1:16) Seeing this, Jehovah’s remnant should be very zealous and not slack their hands in the work because of opposition put forth by the enemy. The Lord declares that his temple shall be built up, and it is built up, “even in troublous times.” (Dan. 9:25) The “line . . . stretched forth upon Jerusalem” is to measure the progressive work which Jehovah has done in the building up of his organization on earth since 1922. He expresses his purpose to comfort and strengthen his people: “Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad [my cities (shall) overflow with blessing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)]</span><span class="font5">; and the Lord shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.”—1:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has prospered his organization by committing to the remnant the testimony of .Jesus Christ, the kingdom interests on earth, and the duty of carrying on the work foreshadowed by the prophet Elisha, and by pouring out his spirit upon them, and bringing them into his organization, and permitting them to drink the fruit of the vine new with the Lord Jesus Christ in bis organization.—Luke 22:18; Matt. 26:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having consoled his own people of Zion, Jehovah now tells her of the enemies that will come against her. Zechariah (1:18) says: “Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold, four horns.” Homs symbolize means of pushing or inflicting punishment upon another. (Ezek. 34:21; Dcut. 33:17) Up to the time of the prophecy of Zechariah four devilish world powers had existed and inflicted punishment upon men who served Jehovah God. The prophecy here means that four more world powers, to wit, Greece, Rome, the Anglo-American empire system, which is “Christendom”, and the combination of the League of Nations, which is the eighth world power, would further oppose God’s anointed people. (Rev. 17:11) The angel of the Lord tells Zechariah that these horns are the powers that scatter God’s people. (1:19) The “four horns” would also fitly represent the complete power of Satan’s organization, which docs violence to God’s people and which reaches its climax of wickedness in the seventh world power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptural use of “four” is symbolic of completeness, such as foursquare. “And the Lord shewed me four carpenters [craftsmen </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.); </span><span class="font5">smiths (A.R.V.)].” (1:20) Generally the word here used for “carpenters” means artificers or ones who do constructive work. The “four” is here used as symbolical of the complete army of the Lord which hammers the horns off the bull heads of Satan’s organization, and crushes them. Since the prophet inquires concerning the four constructors or artificers, the angel of the Lord said: “Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These [horns] arc the horns which have scattered Judah [God’s faithful people], so that no man did lift up his head [in 1918 and 1919]: but these [artificers or carpenters or constructors] arc come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.” (1:21) These arc God’s provided means to discomfit the enemy, as Gideon did in his time. (Judg. 8:12; Isa. 19:16; Ezek. 30:9) This wicked crowd of Satan rises up to scatter and to destroy those who praise Jehovah God, pictured by Judah, and the Lord Jehovah God purposes the destruction of these assailants and makes preparation to that end. If Jehovah’s witnesses were left without instruction or spiritual food they would be discouraged and cast down, and the enemy would put them to flight. Now Jehovah instructs his faithful people and gives them comfort and encouragement that they may have hope of complete victory through Christ Jesus, and thus he prepares them for their part in the work of vindication of his great and holy name.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE NATIONS IN THE WINEPRESS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font5">ODAY the nations of earth, particularly those forming the League of Nations, call themselves “Christendom” or “Christian”, therefore they “call themselves by the name of the Lord”. Addressing himself to all the nations forming the visible part of Satan’s organization, and specifically pointing out “organized Christianity”, or “Christendom”, so called, Jehovah, through his prophet says: “For. Io T begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the Lord of hosts. Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind [war] shall be raised up from the coasts of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">earth.”—</span><span class="font5">Jer. 25:29-32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Having pronounced his specific judgment against the Devil’s organization assembled in the valley of decision, Jehovah begins the battle. lie commands, and his mighty executive oflicer, Christ Jesus, leads the assault. As the Psalm (107:25-27) in figurative language describes it: “For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths; their soul is melted because of trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end.” A stormy wind or whirlwind is a symbol of a great war. The great battle of God Almighty is on and proceeds to a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophets of Jehovah described the progr’ess of the war, and the result. Knowing that these prophets arc proved to be true prophets, we know that their testimony here given imports absolute verity. Jehovah is the right-hand support of his beloved Son who leads the fight, and concerning which the prophet says: ‘‘The Lord [Jehovah] at thy right hand shall strike through [or, shatter] kings in the day of his wrath, lie shall judge among the heathen [nations], he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries”; or, as another translation </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(liolh.)</span><span class="font5"> reads: “he hath shattered the head” over many countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah will give such a demonstration of his power that all may sec and know that he alone is the Almighty God. The time having conic to settle the issue, it shall be settled. The prophet (Nah. 1:6-S) says: ‘‘Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him. The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.” ‘‘And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, liecause they have sinned against the Lord; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung. Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord’s wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of bis jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.” —Zeph. 1:17, IS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus Christ, the great Prophet, declared that the battle of God Almighty will be the worst trouble that ever has been or ever will be visited upon the world. (Matt. 24:21) That it will completely uncover and destroy the Devil’s organization and all the works and workers of iniquity, the prophet makes clear when he says: ‘‘And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.”—Jer. 25:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That it will be a day of despair and vain howling of the shepherds, the prophet also plainly states, saying: ‘‘Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock [the church congregations of these religious shepherds]; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.” (Jer. 25: 34) When a pleasant vessel falls and is destroyed, those who possessed it arc in distress. The illustration is an apt one, that the shepherds who have deceived the people shall so fall, as the prophet states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Further describing the calamity befalling the organization, the prophet says: ‘‘And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture. And the peaceable habitations arc cut down, because of the fierce anger of the Lord. He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion; for their land is desolate, because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.”—Jer. 25: 35-38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil’s organization, represented by ancient Babylon, shall fall and become desolate, as it is written by the prophet, who says: ‘‘Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.” (Rev. 18:2) From the very beginning Babylon was the Devil’s organization and was associated with unclean spirits. This text in no wise disproves that conclusion. On the contrary, the prophecy here quoted describes the condition of desolation that comes upon Babylon after her fall. The words are those of description, showing her condition after God has broken her down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good men and women have long been held in Babylon by the sophistry and deception of Satan and his agencies. After her fall, no more shall men or women dwell in her, but she becomes the habitation of hateful birds and beasts. She will be shunned by every man and woman. Another prophet of Jehovah supports this conclusion, saying: ‘‘And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees’ excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. But wild beasts of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">desert shall lie there; and their houses shall </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">there, and </span><span class="font5">satyrs shall dance there. And the wild beasts </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font5">islands shall cry in their desolate houses, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">dragons in their pleasant palaces.” (Isa. 13:19-22) “And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplaee for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing without </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font5">inhabitant.” (Jer. 51:37) The destruction of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Devil’s organization will therefore be complete, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">will demonstrate to all creation that Jehovah is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Almighty God, besides whom there is none.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah uses apt illustrations to make plain </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font5">purposes. In the sixty-third chapter of Isaiah his prophet sets out one of such illustrations. What is there recorded follows shortly upon the coming </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of the great </span><span class="font5">witness that God commands to be </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">given </span><span class="font5">(and which is now being given), as detailed by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">same prophet in the preceding chapter (Isa. 62:10). </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5">prophet has </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">vision of one returning from </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">slaughter of the land of Edom and the city of Bozrah, and whose raiment is sprinkled with blood. Undoubtedly the one seen in such apparel is the same one </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font5">scribed in another prophecy, which says: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“And he </span><span class="font5">was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; and his name is called The Word of God.”—Rev. 19:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is helpful to an understanding of a prophecy </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">first explain the meaning of some of the words </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">whieh </span><span class="font5">appear therein and in connection therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5">name “Edom” represents that which is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">op</span><span class="font5">posed to the Lord. (Obad. 1) It has the same meaning </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">the name “Esau”, and therefore refers to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or</span><span class="font5">ganization of Satan, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">most reprehensible </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">element </span><span class="font5">of which is the religious clement. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Idumea</span><span class="font5"> has the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">same </span><span class="font5">meaning as “Edom”, and really is Edom. (Isa. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">34:5) </span><span class="font5">The wrath of God is especially against Idumea.— Ezek. 35:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bozrah was the chief city of Edom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Therefore </span><span class="font5">Bozrah would represent that which is the center </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font5">most important part of modern Edom, to wit, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">ruling factors thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">wine-press</span><span class="font5"> is the instrument, or organization, employed by Jehovah to crush or break up the fruit of the evil one. “The vine of the earth,” or that evil vine (Rev. 14:18,19), produces the grapes or fruit of the earth. The earth represents the Devil’s organization visible to man. The vine of the earth is the very opposite of the “true vine”, and is therefore the official part of the Devil’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The American Revised Version</span><span class="font5"> gives a better rendering of the text, and therefore the quotation is from that version. The prophecy begins with a colloquy or conversation. The first speaker is the prophet, and the second speaker is Christ Jesus, the mighty executive officer of Jehovah God who assaults the stronghold of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first speaker propounds the question: “Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, marching in the greatness of his strength?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The second speaker replies: “I [Christ, the great Executive Officer and Prophet of Jehovah] that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.” (lie is the mighty Savior and Deliverer of oppressed humanity.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The first speaker now asks: “Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winevat [or trough] ?”—Isa. 63:1-6, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To this the second speaker answers: “I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no man with me: yea, I trod them in mine auser, and trampled them in my wrath; and their lifeblood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my raiment. For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is eome. And I looked, and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my wrath, it upheld me. And </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">trod down the peoples in mine anger, and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In such forceful terms the Lord shows how he will crush into nonexistence the great and mighty organization which has antagonized him and his purposes and has made life unbearable for the peoples of earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">COMPANY SERVANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Proclamation of the kingdom message is all-important now. It is the duty of the anointed to vote as to who shall be company servant; but “hewers of wood and drawers of water’’ (Josh. 9:21-27) may serve. (Deut. 10:12-15; 29:11) When there are none in the company capable of filling the places of company servants or service committees and there are Jonadabs who have the ability and zeal, let the Jonadabs be placed on the sen-ice committee and give them opportunity to serve. The work should not drag because some of the company have lack of zeal. The gospel must now be proclaimed.—Matt. 24: 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NEW PORTABLE PHONOGRAPH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society now manufactures and has to offer a light-weight phonograph of new design, which is 14 by 13 by 5 inches in size, and covered with brown cloth and having rounded corners. It weighs only 9 pounds 13 ounces. However, with the three phonograph discs which can be carried in it, it weighs 12 pounds 6 ounces. The volume of sound is just as strong as that of the previous model, and the tone is of the best quality. As shipped out from our factory, the phonograph is timed properly, at 78 r.p.m., and should be cheeked from time to time. This new model, including three discs, is offered on a contribution of $10.00; without the three discs, $8.00. Remittance should accompany orders. Also specify the particular discs wanted.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark1"></a>&quot;SONG OF THE HARLOT”</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten: make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.”—Isa. 23:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">T EHOVAH’S DAY’ is that term used in prophecy I and relates to the time when Jehovah enthrones his commissioned King and sends him forth to rule. (Pss. 2:6; 110:2) It is also referred to in the Scriptures as “that day”. It marks the time when Christ Jesus the King began to interrupt the rule of Satan which he had so long carried on unhindered. It is marked by the beginning of the war in heaven, which resulted in the ousting of Satan and his angels from heaven and casting them down to the earth. (Rev. 12:7) Practically at the same time the World War began on the earth. It is the time of the beginning of Satan’s overthrow, which will ultimately culminate at Armageddon. Reference to that time is made in the prophecy of Isaiah 23:15, where it is written: ‘ ‘ And it shall come to pass in that day.” At this point the prophecy in fulfillment moves back from a consideration of the things that will come to pass at the beginning of Armageddon and gives consideration to things or causes directly provoking the conflict. The time for the beginning of the fulfillment of this part of the prophecy in Isaiah 23:15 is in the year 1914 (A.D.) when the enemy is ousted from heaven. As shown by the historical facts, published in the previous issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> in the year 1914, and for several years prior thereto, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy did not rate as a temporal ruling power in the earth. During that period of time it was claimed that the pope was “the white prisoner” at the Vatican.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Seeing that ancient Tyre pictured the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization, which is therefore modern Tyre, it will be of aid in the examination of the prophecy if we keep in mind the objective or chief purpose of the Hierarchy, which purpose is, to wit: To rule over the nations of the earth as the claimed representative of Christ, with the false slogan, “Chris-tus Rex,” that is, “Christ the King,” meaning, in fact, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the pope, </span><span class="font6">the head of the Roman Catholic “Hierarchy </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Jurisdiction” on the earth. Such has been the objective of the Roman Catholic organization from the beginning, but she has received setbacks from time to time, and which the organization attributes to the opposition of her enemies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Says the prophet of Jehovah: “It shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre [modern Tyre, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization] shall be forgotten.” Forgotten by whom ? By her former illicit paramours who have committed fornication with her. She is forgotten as a temporal power. The political ruling powers counted her out as regards temporal power, viewing the pope as merely a spiritual adviser, without much influence, not to be feared. It does not necessarily follow that the Hierarchy is forgotten for seventy years. The prophecy clearly fixes the time when she is forgotten, by saying: “In that day . . . Tyre shall be forgotten.” A comparison of the language of verse 15 with that of verse 17 more clearly shows this: That there is a period of time in which the harlot is forgotten and that time of forgetting her of which the prophecy takes notice is “in that day”, that is, the day of Jehovah; and that it is at the end of seventy years that the Lord will visit Tyre. The Lord’s visit to Tyre manifestly is not for her upbuilding, but for her adverse judgment, which visit begins with Jehovah’s “strange work” and concludes with the beginning of Jehovah’s “strange act”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SEVENTY-YEAR PERIOD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> The prophecy of Isaiah here considered was paralleled by the prophecy uttered by Jeremiah, in which latter prophecy the “seventy years” was associated with the seventy years of desolation of Jerusalem. Concerning this Jehovah’s prophet Jeremiah said: “Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the Lord, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land [Judah and Jerusalem], and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about [including Tyre], and will utterly destroy them [in the type, for seventy years], and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations. . . . And this whole land [Canaan] shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations [including</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Tyre] shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation [by ousting Satan and his angels from heaven; which began in A.D. 1914], saith the Lord, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.” What land will God make perpetual desolation ? (Vs. 9) Certainly Tyre is included, because it is written: “And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea.”—Jer. 25: 9-22.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> God’s prophet Zechariah speaks of the antitypical fulfillment of this prophecy upon spiritual Israel as pictured by Jerusalem, and the time is clearly marked out. (See Zechariah 14:1,2, book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font6"> page 281.) It was not necessary for spiritual Israel to be desolated the full, literal seventy years in order to fulfill the typical picture of ancient Jerusalem’s desolation. The desolation of spiritual Israel was accomplished between 1914 and 1919, or within a period of about four years. In that time spiritual Israel, that is, the remnant, fulfilled the picture of the return of the captivity from Babylon to Zion, and thus the seventy years of desolation antitypically was counted as completely fulfilled. The important thing was the desolation, and not the mere length of time thereof.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> Note now that Jeremiah counts Tyrus’ desolation of seventy years as running concurrently with the seventy years of desolation of Jerusalem; therefore as in the case of spiritual Israel, so with Tyre in the modern fulfillment, that is, as applying to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy; The desolation or absence of temporal power, or the time in which she is forgotten, would not require literally seventy years. The important point here is the desolation, and not the exact length thereof. Furthermore, the foregoing period of desolation is “in that day”, hence could not begin until the beginning of the day of Jehovah, to wit, in 1914.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>T</sup> In the type or picture the two equal periods running concurrently, seventy years upon modern Tyre, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, would be counted as ended at approximately the same time as the desolation upon the remnant of New Jerusalem is ended, that is to say, about the end of 1918 or beginning of 1919. It would therefore not be at all necessary to measure back from November 24, 1918, to November 24, 1848, in order to locate the time. It suffices, then, that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy was forgotten and neglected “in that day”, that is to say, from 1914 to 1919, and that the forgetting was by her former political associates who had committed fornication with her, classing her as a temporal power. If the physical facts show that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy was forgotten or neglected by the political powers from 1914 to 1919, that would be a further corroboration of the conclusion that the fulfillment of the seventy-year period is as hereinbefore stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“FORGOTTEN”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy tried to seat herself in a prominent temporal position during the World War, but failed. During that time the pope was generally under suspicion, by the allies in particular, and that with good reason. Although the pope tried to screen himself by claims of being neutral and maintaining strict neutrality, his claims naturally were not considered sincere. Note the following historical fact: “London, Treaty of (191'5). A secret agreement concluded between Italy, France, Great Britain and Russia on 26 April and finally signed on 9 May 1915, declaring the terms under which Italy agreed to enter the war on the side of the Entente Allies. ‘By the future treaty of peace’ Italy was to receive the Trenlino, the whole of Southern Tyrol, as far as its natural and geographical frontier, the Brenner Pass; . . . The Holy See was not to be permitted to intervene by diplomatic action in regard to peace or questions arising from the war.”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana, </span><span class="font6">Vol. 17, pages 632-633.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> We see a secret agreement of the Entente Allies to ignore or forget the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and specifically the head thereof. A publication issued at Washington, D.C., in March 1929, known as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Protestant,</span><span class="font6"> Volume 9, Number one, page one, paragraphs three and four, says: “Throughout the World War diocesan periodicals of the Hierarchy in this country [the United States] urged the papal ambition to sit in judgment on the belligerents as arbiter of peace. It was Italy that defeated that aspiration. In the pact of London [treaty of 1915 above mentioned] that country executed a covenant barring the pope from any part in the conduct of hostilities or the terms of peace. Italy had excluded the Papacy from both peace conferences at The Hague. But the concordat [of 1929] removes that obstacle. Instead of the resolute adversary of the Roman See, Italy becomes its foremost confederate. ’ ’ This proves that the pope tried to have illicit relationship with the political powers of the nations during the World War period but was pushed to the side and forgotten during that period, that is, between 1914 and 1919, and this corresponds exactly with the time spiritual Israel was under restraint by Satan’s organization. The old whore’s charms did not allure the greedy nations just at the time of the war, because they wanted all the prospective pie. These facts exactly fulfill the prophecy concerning the “forgotten harlot”. The old woman was hanging down her head and wearing long, black clothes during that time. But, behold, she woke up at the end of that period, as the prophecy foretells.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> Says the prophecy (Isa. 23:15): “According to the days of one king.” In the type the “one king” was the Babylonish line of kings, from Nebuchadnezzar to Belshazzar, of the land of the Chaldeans. But in the antitype or fulfillment of the prophecy “in that day” from 1914 forward, Christ Jesus, the enthroned King of Jehovah, began and has continued his reign. “Like the days of one king” (Leeser); “according to the days of a certain king.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font6"> These two latter translations help to clarify the matter and manifestly refer to the “King of the Chaldeans” and the antitypical desolation-period fulfilled from 1914 to 1918 as above stated. The World War closed November 11, 1918, and it was shortly after that time that the tight position of the pope began to be lifted and the “forgotten” period began to end. When the peace conference began to be discussed the pope immediately got busy and tried to get a seat at that conference. On November 30, 1918, the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Evening World </span><span class="font6">published a statement to the effect that “the pope [then Benedict XV] desired to attend the peace conference in order that he might gain some temporal power”; also stating that the Vatican sought to establish a private telegraph office and lines at the Vatican, “with private wires to all governments, so as not to have to use the Italian lines.” (See </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> January 1, 1919.) The Italian government, up to that time, had kept the ‘old lady’ in the background. The Peace Conference opened on January 18, 1919, when the League of Nations compact was presented, and later adopted, and at that conference the pope made efforts to gain a 3eat on a par with the political governments or nations, but failed. All these facts show that in that period of time above mentioned the old lady was forgotten.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> The events above mentioned were approximately seventy years after November 24, 1848, at which time the pope, in disguise, fled from Rome. On February 8, 1849, the Italian government divested the pope of all temporal power. But these facts appear to be merely incidental to the prophecy, and not in fulfillment thereof. These facts would help to conceal the true meaning of the prophecy for a time and until God’s due time for it to be understood. The prophecy (vs. 15) further says: ‘After seventy years [of desolation typical and antitypical] shall Tyre sing as an harlot.’ Other translations render this part of the prophecy in this manner, to wit: “It shall be unto Tyre as in the song of the harlot” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(R-V.)</span><span class="font6">; “shall it befall Tyre according to the song of the harlot” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham); </span><span class="font6">“there shall be unto Tyre as the song of a harlot” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Douay)</span><span class="font6">; “shall it happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font6"> Note that it is not a song by the harlot, but “as in the song of the harlot”; and that appears to be the reason why </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser</span><span class="font6"> in translating this text puts verse sixteen in quotation, and thus verse sixteen is “The Song”. That “Song of the Harlot” must be and certainly is a prophecy of the Lord concerning the harlot religious system, that is, the Roman Catholic organization, allies and supporters, and which prophecy foretells her conduct immediately following the end of the period in which she is forgotten. The song begins to revive her traffic and patronage and her efforts to gain her chief objective, to wit, to rule the nations of the earth as the vicegerent of Christ and in a dictatorial wrny.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> The words of “the song of the harlot” are addressed to the harlot herself, that is to say, to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and at the period after the end of the World War in 1918, and which is after Satan and his wicked crowd of angels had been cast out of heaven and down to the earth and when Satan began to gather his forces, visible and invisible, to Armageddon. In this action or work Satan brings forward and puts into action his religious institution, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. This also marks the time when the Lord builds up Zion and sends forth the remnant as his witnesses to proclaim his name and kingdom throughout the earth. The words of “the song of the harlot” are these: “Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten: make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.” (Isa. 23:16) This song is not sung to magnify the name of Jehovah, but for the contrary purpose. “And the harp and the viol, the tabret and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts; but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither consider the operation of his hands. ’ ’—Isa. 5:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>13</sup> The harlot is a “street-walker”, and she conducts herself in her best wearing apparel, paints her face, and sallies forth to accomplish her business. She resorts to “an harp”, that is, instruments to make a pleasing sound to the ear of her prospective paramours, including those she once had, and also new suckers, such as the United States, and the professional politicians who run it. She adds whatsoever she can to her attractive charms and carries on her seductive work, and in doing this she stages a hypnotizing background of entrancing sound. The “harp”, as used in the prophecy, pictures the equipment or instrumentality of the old harlot by which she would add power and influence to her religious squawks or doctrinal lies in order that she might inveigle others into her trap and gain control over them. Those instruments antityp-ically are such as the Jesuits, Fascists, Nazis, “holy year” fiasco, Holy Name Society, Catholic Action, Knights of Columbus, anti-communistic schools, the Catholic press, the National Catholic Welfare Conference, the Legion of Decency, controlling moving pictures and moving-picture censorship, feigned, and hypocritical patriotism exhibited in compulsory flagsaluting, the building of monuments and images at the expense of religionists, and all suchlike movements, by and through which she “struts her stuff” and bamboozles and hoodwinks the credulous population, hoping thereby to further her, cause and gain her great objective, to wit, to rule the nations of the earth by dictators. Since the World War the old harlot has daily increased her boastful, scornful attitude and arrogance in parading herself before the peoples of the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> The harlot, that is, the Roman Catholic organization, goes up and down the earth with her instruments of sound under the leadership of the Devil and in opposition to the faithful followers of Christ Jesus, who are now singing the praises of Jehovah and his King. The harlot puts forth her best endeavors to crush everything that makes known the truth as God has put it in his Word. In striking contrast to the conduct of the harlot Jehovah pictures his faithful witnesses with the Lord in this beautiful symbolic phrase: ‘ ‘ And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God. And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints. ”—Rev. 15:2, 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> The song of praise to the Most High announces that his kingdom is the only hope of the world and that Christ will now reign in righteousness and will destroy all hypocrisy and wickedness; and this song greatly disturbs the old “whore” and she whangs her harp with all her power and energy and uses all her power and influence to get the harpers of the Lord out of the way. Her persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses in every country is conclusive proof of this statement. The facts well known, and which are coming to pass in this day, exactly fit the prophecy, and this shows that now is the time, from and after the end of the World War, that the old whore is employing all her “harlot charms” to draw the nations and the people under her control, that she may rule to the satisfaction of her selfish and wieked ambition.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> And where does she go to sing the Harlot song? The prophecy answers: “About the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten.” She once had temporal power, then she was forgotten during the time that the political crowd thought best to ignore the old woman; and again, following the war, conditions are changed, and it is the appropriate time, as she thinks, for her to go out and round up her old, and some of her new, paramours, putting on her most attractive air, and thereby inducing fornicators to turn again to her. And in what “city” does she parade? Not amongst God’s faithful people, not in the temple of Zion, but she goes about the “city” symbolically designated as “Christendom”, the nations that are willing to have the name of Christ indirectly attached to them for commercial purposes. Sueh is the city of the “ten kings”. As a “street-walker” the old and experienced harlot accosts each king or ruling power of the nations, and sings her songs, that is to say, she puts on </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">show before them by which she expects to dazzle the kings. Since the end of the World War the harlot, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, has been exhibiting her</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">self, </span><span class="font6">clothed in her peculiar garments by which she is identified; appearing with painted face and flattering words and at much expense, which expense money she collects from the “Catholic population”, she goes on her campaign of enticement and seduction. She calls it “Catholic action”. It could be dubbed also “Devil’s visible action”. The Jewish rabbis and the so-called “Protestant” clergy fall right into the old harlot’s arms, receive a few lessons from her, and then take their place in the show, attempting to make the politicians and the commercial men believe that their best interests require that they associate themselves with the religious, that is, the “harlot” organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1T</sup> The old harlot, since the World War, has gained complete control of Italy, and Germany, and wherever in those nations her paint and enticing words fail she uses force of arms. She poses as honest, and hypocritically says she represents God and Christ, the great Prince of Peace, and at the same time she organizes and launches a rebellion against the government of Spain because that government kicked her out and refused to yield again to her seductive charms. Her priests and other underlings, wearing clerical robes and armed with sword and gun, go forth to murder the people of Spain in order to carry out the harlot’s wicked design to gain control of that nation. Just at the present time the old “harlot” is putting on her big show at Washington, D.C., endeavoring to establish diplomatic relationship between the United States and the Vatican, and Washington is getting quite drunk with the wine of her fornication. The United States is quite a youth, not so fully acquainted with the harlot as the other nations, and is well likened in the prophecy to a young man getting his eyeteeth cut. Often a young man who is simple yields to the seductive influence of an enticing harlot who sings songs and exhibits herself in public places. The United States appears to be in the class of such simpletons.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> Jehovah God, foreknowing the present-day conditions and the activities of the harlot religious organization, caused an appropriate proverb to be recorded long ago, and which now is applicable, to wit: “And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding [United States], passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, in the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night; and, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house; now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him, I have peace offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows; therefore eame I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face; and I have found thee. I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt. I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; let us solace ourselves with loves: for the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey.” “With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him. He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; till a dart strike through his liver, as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.” “Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.” —Prov. 7: 7-19, 21-23, 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>19</sup> Will the United States yield to the harlot’s blandishments and fall? It so appears. The old “harlot” has her instruments everywhere in the land working overtime to get control of the United States and every branch of the government, and the politicians are falling to her enticements, and many of the people who are dupes and easily deceived are likewise yielding. Fascists and Nazis are one and the same thing and are instruments employed with great effect by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to gain control of the nations. Each day the strength of that organization grows in the United States. The people in general appear to be asleep to the danger. The harlot even controls the moving-picture business in order to keep the people’s thoughts on everything except the danger that besets the nation. It is indeed a frightful time. It is the nighttime and the people slumber. Darkness covers the land, and gross darkness is upon the people. (Isa. 60:2) The harlot organization and her instruments are busy during all hours of the night.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;The old “harlot” sings the prophetic song, as it is written: “Make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.” This she does in order to add to her charms and her power. Her endeavor is to induce the political crowd to believe not only that she is their spiritual guide but that she should exercise temporal power and supremacy over all of the political organizations. Inducing the politicians to yield to her blandishments she will do business with them and through them and thereby gain control of the people and rule as a counterfeit Christ over the nation and ultimately over all the nations of ‘ ‘ Christendom ’ ’.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>91</sup> The aggressive campaign of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of the present time is called by that organization “Catholic action” and shows beyond all doubt that the present is considered the time for the old “harlot” to gain temporal control of the nations of the earth. She therefore squawks her songs, which songs are lies, of course, because that is her stock in trade, as God foretold. Now she boastfully says, as the prophet of the Lord foretold: “We have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves”; nothing can “prevail against” us. (Isa. 28:15) With glaring, brazen hypocrisy she calls attention to her supposed attractiveness and desirability. Hiding the real facts from others, she poses as the rightful censor of the truth. She tells the Federal Communications Commission, and the owners and operators of radio stations, what they shall and shall not broadcast. She tells the people what they shall and shall not hear or read. She dictates to legislative bodies, to the judges of the courts, and to the other political officials of the land. She takes the lead in compulsory saluting of flags contrary to the fundamental law of the nation. She poses as very patriotic and insists on the schoolteachers’ taking an oath,-which never before was thought of in America, and she bluffs the legislative and judicial power to try to sustain her. Claiming to be patriotic, she is a traitor to every country under the sun. She takes oaths of allegiance to governments with a reservation that it is all right to quickly violate them. She poses as the guardian of the people to insure a clean social condition, and underneath and behind the scenes carries on all manner of uncleanness. Amongst her instruments that she uses are ultraselfish men called “Jews”, who look only for personal gain, and who therefore readily yield to and join with the Hierarchy in any unrighteous schemes. The Catholic organization in fact controls the moving-picture business and on every possible occasion in the exhibition of pictures attempts to magnify the merits of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. She raises a great hue and cry about communists’ being a danger, and this she does in order to attract the people’s attention away from her own crookedness and to enable her to take advantage of the people and slip her own instruments into positions of power. Her instruments and her songs seem to be endless, and therefore, in fulfillment of the prophecy, she sings many songs, and the political dupes with gaping mouths are led right into her snare. The prophecy is now being rapidly fulfilled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> And what is the real purpose of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy action? Says the prophet: “That thou mayest be remembered”; that is, that she may get back her position of temporal power. Her great ambition is temporal power and rule of the nations of the world, and therefore she must be remembered by het political paramours. Religion, which she wrongfully claims is ‘ ‘ Christianity ’ ’, is used by her to gain political power. She is determined now to have to do with the treaties and make treaties with the nations and to bring all religious practices under her control and to suppress everyone who does not declare that she is the representative of God on earth. She is determined to suppress everyone who dares declare the truth of God’s Word. Jehovah’s witnesses are commissioned to speak the truth, and therefore Jehovah’s witnesses constitute a stinging thorn in the flesh of the old “harlot” because they lift high the banner of the Lord, pointing the people to the declaration of Jehovah that his kingdom and his King is the hope of the world and that there is none other. The kingdom of God under Christ, as proclaimed by Jehovah’s witnesses, is the only thing the Roman Catholic Hierarchy now really fears. The old “harlot” is now very diligent to hide from the people her long and bloody record as inquisitionists and the many crimes she has committed, and when her allies and filthy record, as recorded in history, are mentioned and the truth of God’s Word is told about her, she howls, and with great crocodile tears says: “That speech is shocking to our religious susceptibilities.” The facts conclusively prove the fulfillment of the prophecy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“ABOMINATION”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> The “abomination of desolation”, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, and by the Lord Jesus, is that which claims to rule in the place and stead of God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus. The League of Nations was set up for that very purpose, claiming the right and power to rule the world. But have in mind what constitutes and controls the League o F Nations. At the very beginning of the organization of the League of Nations the Roman Catholic Hierarchy sought a place or seat in that conference and she there began to put on her show to get into it and to dominate the League. When that ‘beast came up out of the pit’ (Rev. 17:8) immediately following the end of the World War, the old “harlot” climbed on the back of that beast and has been riding since, and exercising the guiding control of the League of Nations, claiming the right to rule and vigorously attempting to rule the world in the place and stead of Christ Jesus; therefore the ‘ ‘ abomination that maketh desolate” is the League of Nations and is labeled by organized religion “the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth”. “Organized religion,” with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in the lead, is the binding tie and the chief part constituting the League of Nations, which claims the right and which attempts to rule the world in the place and stead of Christ. (See </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font6"> Book Two, page 103.) The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the leader of “organized religion”, is the guiding power of the League of Nations, and she expects to exercise even greater power, and doubtless will, in the very near future, regardless of what the combine is called. The old “harlot” is riding on the back of the “beast”, and therefore is the dominating part thereof. The objective of the League of Nations is to rule the world contrary to God’s purpose, and therefore the League of Nations and the Hierarchy are one, constituting the ‘ ‘ abomination that maketh desolate ’ ’, and it stands where it ought not to stand; and this is a warning to everyone who loves God and Christ to flee to God’s organization under Christ.—Matt. 24:15,16; Mark </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">13:14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">•VISITS TYRE’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2&lt;</sup> The prophecy then declares that Jehovah visits Tyre; and surely that visit is not in her favor, but for judgment against that wicked organization. When docs the Lord visit her? The prophecy answers: “And it shall come to pass, after the end of seventy years, that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">Lord will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth. ’ ’ (Isa. 23:17) Other translations of this text are: “And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years that Jehovah will visit Tyre.” (A.R.F.) “So shall it be at the end of seventy years that Jehovah will visit Tyre.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.) </span><span class="font6">This shows that it is from and after 1918 that Jehovah visits Tyre, and during the time in which the Lord is restoring his remnant from Babylon and using them for his purpose. As Jehovah permits the Devil to remain, so for a time he permits the old “harlot”, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization, to remain in existence to operate against his kingdom and his witnesses. First Jehovah visits her with the proclamation of the truth against her, and in doing this he commands his witnesses to ‘arise against her in battle’. (Obad. 1) This is Jehovah’s “strange work”; and, this strange work being completed, he visits her and executes judgment upon her, and that marks the beginning of his “strange act”, which is the second part of his visit. During the first part of his visit, as in case of his visit to Sodom, Jehovah gathers the evidence against her as to her activities as a harlot operating with a harp and song. During the first part of the visit, says the prophet, “she shall turn [shall return (R.F.) ; will return </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)]</span><span class="font6"> to her hire.” She returns to her hire as a harlot and uses that hire with which to commit fornication with the rulers of the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>25</sup> Note this part of the prophecy says: “And shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth”; according to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version:</span><span class="font6"> “Shall play the harlot with all the kingdoms of the world.” Such is exactly what the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization is doing, and has been doing from and after 1918, and will continue to do until the beginning of Armageddon; and while she is doing that Jehovah is doing his “strange work” of exposing her wickedness. The activity of the old “whore” in committing harlotry with all the kingdoms of the world appears to be more than merely establishing diplomatic relationship with all nations and being recognized as a temporal power. It surely means the carrying out of the objective of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to set up a Fascist government controlling the nations of the earth, that the Hierarchy may arbitrarily rule the nations in a dictatorial manner.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DEVIL’S OFFSPRING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>26</sup> The League of Nations is the child of the Devil by his “woman”, “organized religion,” brought forth in opposition to Jehovah’s “man child”, which shall rule the world. (Rev. 12:5) The combination of the League of Nations is made up of religion, politics and commerce, religion being the binding tie and riding on the back of the beast and claiming the right to rule. The old “whore” gains her dominating position in this combine when she ‘returns to her hire and plays the harlot with all the kingdoms of the world upon the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">faee of </span><span class="font6">the earth This is further proof that the com</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">bine </span><span class="font6">is the abomination that maketh desolate. Corroborating this conclusion, note Revelation 17:1, 2: “And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters [as ancient Tyre did] : with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication [which the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has done since 1918, while rejecting the kingdom of God, the ‘Stone laid in Zion’], and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>87</sup> During the past few years the Fascists and Nazis have grown at a tremendous speed, thus showing that the “inhabitants of the earth” are made drunk with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy’s lying, poisonous doctrines, her “wine”, and the fornication and drunkenness continue to increase: ‘ ‘ For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.”—Rev. 18:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> The combine of the nations, under the influence of “organized religion”, was lined up behind the Hague International Arbitration Court, which during the World War went out of sight but quickly eame up out of the pit following the World War: “And the beast that was, and is not [during the World War], even he is the eighth [world power; namely, the combine of the League of Nations with Devil-religion riding], and is of the seven [previous world powers, existing before the World War], and goeth into perdition [at Armageddon, the harlot being first unseated and destroyed].”—Rev. 17:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> While the old ‘ ‘ harlot ’ ’ rides the beast and thus symbolically is in control of it, the Protestant clergy drag along in the procession and shout: “This is the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth”; and the deluded and ignorant populace yell, and for what reason they know not. The old “harlot” returns to her hire, that is, uses her stock in trade, to induce others to commit fornication with her, and with her blandishments as a harlot thereby gains the upper hand of the nations and rides on the back of the combine, and thus the “abomination of desolation” is complete.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>80</sup> It was the Fascists’ leader, Mussolini, who first opposed the pope’s being recognized during the World War, and it was the same Mussolini who saw to it that the pope regained his temporal-power position in 1929, and since then the pope has not been known to seek a seat in the League of Nations, and the reason is, because he has pursued a more subtle policy, thereby obtaining a seat as the rider of the entire beast, and has the whole gang kissing his big toe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>81</sup> The United States is not supposed to be a member of the League of Nations, but the prophecy says: ‘ ‘ She . . . shall play the harlot with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth” (R.V.), and this necessarily includes the United States of America. It is well known, by every person in America who really thinks, that the determination of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is to gain control of the United States and make it a government similar to that of Germany and Italy. Just preceding the election in the United States in 1936 Cardinal Pacelli, Papal secretary of state of the Vatican, visited the United States, and the result was that practically every Roman Catholic voted for Mr. Roosevelt, the man who had said previously that ‘ diplomatic relationship would be established with the Vatican as soon as the American people could be brought around to it’.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BRITAIN AND AMERICA</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>82</sup> No one on earth can tell exactly what will come to pass; but those devoted to the Lord, and according to the divine rule of applying the well-known facts to God’s prophecy now in course of fulfillment, can well reach a reasonable conclusion as to what shall come to pass. The question is, Will Great Britain and America become Fascist under the dominating control of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy ? The Scriptures and the facts appear to fully support that conclusion. Within the borders of the British Empire and the United States of America the truth of God’s kingdom has had its greatest proclamation and witness, and that is exactly what the Roman Catholic Hierarchy hates. It is the truth of and concerning the kingdom of God, when proclaimed, that “shocks the religious susceptibilities” of the Hierarchy crowd, because they hate that which lets God’s light shine and exposes them. For that reason the Hierarchy attempts to suppress the use of the radio and all other means of publication of God’s kingdom message. The prophecy of the Lord shows that modem Tyre, the Catholic organization, commits fornication with all the nations and gains her desire. When the Hierarchy has gained complete temporal power of the earth, that will in her mind fully establish the conclusion that her desire has been fully accomplished, and then she will say: ‘ ‘ Peace and safety ’ ’; and then the ‘ ‘ ten horns ’ ’, that is, all the ruling powers of the nations, receive power with the “beast”, the League of Nations combine being, in fact, a league of Fascism or combined Fascist governments, dominated by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. “And the woman [Devil’s visible religious organization, the harlot] which thou sawest is that great city [the Hierarchy organization], which reigneth over [combined Fascism,] the kings of the earth.”—Rev. 17 :12,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>88</sup> What was the real inducement that caused King Edward VIII to abdicate may be better understood in the near future. That Fascism now is gaining at an alarming rate in Britain, there is not the slightest doubt. Also the Fascists and Nazis are rapidly increasing in the United States. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is confident of putting to silence through its instruments everything and every activity that exposes the crookedness of the Hierarchy and makes known Jehovah God’s purpose. It is nighttime, so far as most of the people are concerned, and the old whore, while the people slumber, moves .forward with greater confidence. A complete fulfillment of the prophecy draws nigh. God caused the apostle Paul to write authoritatively concerning this very time, to wit: ‘ ‘ But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. ’ ’—1 Thess. 5:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>84</sup> Jehovah is now carrying on his “strange work’’, which serves to enlighten the people of good will and to show them the only way of escape; and only those who find that way will escape. The old ‘ ‘ whore ’ ’ sitting upon the back of the beast may soon be expected to say: 'Peace and safety, we have silenced all opponents.’ Then Jehovah’s “strange act” will begin, and sudden destruction comes upon her as travail upon a woman with child. There begins the howl, described by Isaiah 23:1-14; and destruction of Satan’s religious system, by which he has hoodwinked the people and made merchandise of them. As for the harlot, her triumph will be short and her end will be complete destruction.—Ezek. 27:12-34; Rev. 17:16,17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“HOLINESS TO THE LORD”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>85</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy’s “refuge of lies” will furnish no protection to her, but her bulwarks will be completely swept away when her doctrines are known to be false. At some time in the fulfillment of this prophecy it will come to pass as it is written: “And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the Lord: it shall not be treasured uor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the Lord, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.” —Isa. 23:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>88</sup> Surely the words “her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the Lord” could not refer to material merchandise, such as the anarchists might seize and confiscate, because it is written in God’s law: “Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the Lord thy God for any vow; for even both these are abomination unto the Lord thy God.” (Deut. 23:18) What, then, could be meant by “her merchandise” and “her hire”? Jehovah’s prophet, speaking concerning unfaithful Samaria, says: “And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot. ’ ’ —Mic. 1: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>87</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy with an air of superiority, and with great claim of power and authority from God, have approached the kings of the . earth and said to them in effect: “We bestow upon you the divine right to rule; we give you holy sanctions and heavenly blessings; and by reason thereof your positions as political rulers are sacred and are ordained of God, and therefore so far as the people are concerned you are viewed as constituting the earthly ‘higher powers’ and we who compose the Hierarchy arc the spiritual higher powers and superior to all other earthly power.” In this fraudulent representation and manner the harlot proceeds to gain control over gullible men. Such constitutes the merchandise and hire of the harlot by which she draws men into her clutches. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has fraudulently posed as the representative of God with full divine authority to bestow blessings on kings, while in truth and in fact she is the representative of the Devil. The Hierarchy uses ‘the hire of the harlot’ to induce the political power to believe that she should dictate the policy of the world, and thus carry out her purpose to set up a dictatorial rule of the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>38</sup> But now the time arrives when Jehovah turns the tables on the old wench. Jehovah does not bring the merchandise and ‘hire of the harlot’ into his temple, but by carrying on and doing his “strange work” Jehovah exposes the wickedness of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the religionists, and thus he counteracts the effects of her merchandise and hire and causes the same to work against the religionists, and the result is beneficial to those who love righteousness and hate iniquity. This Jehovah does by causing the people to have their eyes opened to the truth and to clearly see that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the leader of religionists, is a part of Satan’s organization, and those people of good will, who thus see and identify the Roman Catholic organization as a part of Satan’s organization, separate themselves from that wicked organization and hasten to Jehovah’s ‘city of refuge’, the place of holiness. Therefore when “her merchandise and her hire” are fully exposed and revealed by the truth, these truths turn those of good will to holiness to the Lord. Jehovah’s witnesses have part in this “strange work”, in this, that as his commissioned servants they carry God’s message of warning to the people of “Christendom”, which message of truth is a true guide to all the people in or outside of “Christendom” who desire to take the right course. When the people of good will see and understand the truth, then the false doctrines which they have been taught by the Hierarchy work against the organization of Satan and to the glory of Jehovah, the Holy One, and thus become “holiness to the Lord”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>89</sup> Says the prophet: “ It shall not be treasured nor laid up.” (Isa. 23:18) Her merchandise and lying shall not be brought into the temple of Jehovah, but it shall be used against and operate against the harlot. As to the “merchandise” and “hire” of a material kind, that is, all the material wealth of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, that, to be sure, shall be left behind the old harlot when, at the beginning of Armageddon, the religious system shall be destroyed. It all, in truth, belongs to the Lord, because the earth and the fullness thereof are his. (Ps. 24:1) At all times such material things have belonged to the Lord, but have been misused and abused by the religionists. Those who survive Armageddon will find better use for such, because they will use material things to the glory of God hi his service. “For her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the Lord.” The word “dwell”, as here used in the prophecy, means to abide and remain as a remnant. (Isa. 7:3; Pss. 27:4; 61:6,7) The promise of Jehovah is that those persons of good will who ‘seek righteousness and meekness’ may be hid during Armageddon and dwell thereafter on the earth. (Zeph. 2:1-3) It is such that the Lord Jesus leads unto the fountain of life, feeding them and fulfilling their desires, and those are the ones that praise Jehovah day and night.—Rev. 7:10-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>40</sup> During the World War, when spiritual Jerusalem, God's faithful remnant people on the earth, seemingly had come to the end of their way, modern Tyre, the religious organization aforementioned, exulted; as it is written: ‘ ‘ Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people; she is turned unto me; I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste.” (Ezek. 26:2) But soon and in God’s due time he turns the tables on the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and that wicked organization is laid waste, and Jehovah’s witnesses are shown as praising the Most High after the Hierarchy goes down. When that calamity befalls the religionists the persons of good will, composing the great multitude who have proved their integrity by obeying Jehovah’s commandments, will then dwell in the presence of 1he Lord and will sing his praises for ever: “Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name; the upright shall dwell in thy presence.”—Ps. 140:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> Again says the prophecy: ‘ ‘ For her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the Lord, to eat sufficiently.” (Isa. 23:18) The so-called “spiritual and religious” foods provided by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and which is her “merchandise”, being exposed by the light and unfolding of Jehovah’s Word, these truths become prpphetic food for those who are fed at Jehovah’s table, which includes, to be sure, those of the great multitude, which the Lamb of God shall feed. (Rev. 7:17) The revelation of Jehovah’s prophecy stripping bare the ecclesiastical frauds and disclosing Jehovah’s judgment against such fraudulent merchandise becomes spiritual “meat in due season” for those who love Jehovah. Prophecy in fulfillment and being understood proves to be their spiritual nourishing and profitable to those who love God. When the people of good will see these things, then no longer are the old “harlot” and her allies, by the use of her “merchandise” and lying, able to keep those who love and serve Jehovah from eating and filling sufficiently, and they do eat sufficiently and are greatly satisfied and rejoice.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Further the prophecy says: “And for durable clothing [stately clothing (margin, R.P.)].” Clpthing symbolically stands for identification. When those persons of good will hear and act upon the truth, seeing that the “hire” and “merchandise” of the old harlot is a fraud and snare, they immediately wash up, that is, they ‘wash their robes and make them white in the blood of the Lamb’. (Rev. 7:14) They thus identify themselves as servants of Jehovah God. They get on the Lord’s side and no longer have anything to do with the harlot organization. Their devotion, service and praise are to Jehovah and his King, who sits upon the throne and who shall for ever rule the world in righteousness. The faithful great multitude have a “stately” appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SUMMARY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>43</sup> Briefly summing up the prophecy of the 23d chapter of Isaiah, this appears as its message to those who love Jehovah and who joyfully obey his commandments :</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;&quot; Ancient Tyre represented commercialized religion and religionists, of which the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is modern Tyre and in the lead. “The king of Tyrus” means the Devil himself; while “the prince of Tyre” stands for the visible, religious representative of the Devil on earth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>45</sup> “Zidon” also stands for Devil religion, including both “heathen religion”, so called, or paganism, and all other religious allies of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;““Ships [that is, vessels] of Tarshish” stands for the various subordinate organizations of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which support and do the bidding of the Hierarchy and carry on her menial work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>47</sup> “Harlot,” an unchaste woman, stands for Satan ’s organization, of which religion is the most subtle part visible to man and used to seduce others from Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;<sup>8</sup> The purpose or objective of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is and ever has been to gain control of and rule the nations of the earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">For many years the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization was recognized as a temporal power ruling over the kings of the earth. She lost that power for a time, and regained it in 1929. During the World War the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the harlot, sought </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">place among the nations in matters pertaining to war and peace, but was cast to the side and forgotten. At the close of the World War, in fulfillment of the prophecy, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy began her activities to regain temporal power, and, as the once forgotten harlot, she goes about the nations singing “the song of the harlot”, that is, using seductive means to induce the political rulers of the nations to recognize her former position as a temporal power.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>80</sup> Fascism and Nazism mean one and the same thing and are the instrument of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the child of the Devil, to gain control of the earth by the Hierarchy and turn all people against God and His kingdom. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy classes everyone that is opposed to her as “red” or “communist”, and this is done to incite the people against those who stand for whatsoever is right. The Hierarchy is particularly opposed to and persecutes Jehovah’s witnesses, because they proclaim the truth of God’s name and kingdom and point to God’s kingdom as the only hope of the world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8X</sup> The prophecy seems clearly to indicate that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy operating its organization of Fascism, together with other religious allies, will gain control of the leading nations of the earth, including Britain and the United States, and then that hypocritical religious organization will cry out, as prophetically written, “Peace and safety.” This part of the prophecy is set forth in Isaiah 23:15-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>82</sup> When the Hierarchy has reached her zenith of glory and supposed absolute security, then God, through Christ Jesus, completely wrecks the ‘old harlot’ organization, and that marks the beginning of Armageddon. This great “burden” or woe coming to the religionist element of Satan’s organization strikes terror into every one of her supporters, and these, by the prophecy, are shown as wailing and howling, because they clearly see that they are next in line for the expression of God’s wrath against them. This part of the prophecy appears in verses 1-14 of Isaiah 23 and shows that the woe comes upon the religious organization at the end of her very short period of seeming triumph.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>83</sup> Now Jehovah is carrying forward in the earth his “strange work”, exposing to view the wicked organization of Satan. He lays upon his witnesses the duty and gives to them -the privilege and opportunity of proclaiming his name and his kingdom in the earth, and thus they have a part in this strange work. When that strange work is done, then begins his “strange act”, which is the battle of the great day of God Almighty. During the period of his “strange work” the great multitude must take their stand on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom and prove their faithful obedience and maintain their integrity toward God. Jehovah now makes known these precious truths to those who love him that they may be comforted and have greater hope in this time of peril. Let all who claim to love Jehovah God prove their love for him and his King by now joyfully obeying the commandments of the Most High. “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle.”—Obadiah 1.</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark3"></a>EVIL SERVANT</span></h1>
<p><span class="font13">F</span><span class="font6">OR three and one-half years the disciples of Jesus walked with him and learned that he is the Christ, the Son of the living God. One of them, called Judas, while claiming to believe on and serve Jesus Christ, was at the same time in a conspiracy with the enemy to bring about the death of Jesus and to destroy his work, and, knowing this, Jesus named him “the son of perdition”. Later the Bible record discloses that Judas was a type of a class of persons who covenant to serve God and Christ and who become unfaithful, and who are therefore the instruments of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For twenty years or more one W. F. Salter was the trusted representative of God’s organization on earth, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. Claiming to believe in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, and often so stating, and while in the pretended service of the Lord’s organization, that man was in a conspiracy to bring about the destruction of the Lord’s work and the death of some of the Lord’s servants. His duplicity being discovered, he was, because of his unfaithfulness, relieved of his position and duty in the Lord’s organization. About a year later this same man enters into a further conspiracy with the enemy to commit more wrong. He got someone to write an article attempting to prove that the Lord Jesus Christ is not present. That article he printed and caused to be distributed amongst many of the Lord’s servants in different parts of the earth, together with a covering letter, which letter and article purported to come from the head office of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. Manifestly this was done in order to practice fraud and deception upon the faithful ones. He caused the printing to be done in the United States, and had his papers posted in the mail at Brooklyn, New York. In his letter of so-called ‘instructions’, and which purported to be instructions from headquarters, the demand is made that the letter and article be read to the various companies at a stated time, and further stated that organization instructions are mandatory and this instruction must be carried out and the letter read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then he issued another paper, had that printed and sent throughout the earth to the various offices and servants of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and in which letter he resorts to lies and manifests a vicious and malicious, lying disposition, attacking the president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and making many statements which he knew at the time are deliberate lies. He demanded that his letter be answered through </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> columns are not open to the discussion of matters with those who are opposed to the Lord, and certainly not to printing the argument of one against the presence of the Lord, when this question of the Lord’s presence has been thoroughly covered by the publications of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord Jesus denounces such as conduct of those who are the evil servants, using this language: “But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken: the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”—Matt. 24:48-51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Judas hanged himself, “and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.” (Acts 1:18) The evil servant is the head or chief part of the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” and concerning which it is written: “And then shall that. Wicked [the man of sin, the son of perdition] be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.” (2 Thess. 2: 8) No notice would be given of this fact and wicked conduct except for the protection of the Lord’s people, whom Salter has attempted to deceive. This is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower’s</span><span class="font6"> answer, and the answer of the president of the Society, to his aforementioned publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">KEEP </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">not </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">thou silence, 0 God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, 0 God. For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. They hate consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and pensh: that men may know that thou, uhose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Host High over all the earth.—</span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Psalm</span><span class="font5"> 83.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">SE work of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is the preaching of the gospel of Jehovah’s kingdom. Every consecrated child of God </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6">privileged to participate in this work. Since the organization of the Society the work during the year has always been outlined in proportion as the Lord provided the money through his consecrated children. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font6">continue to follow that example, as appropriate in the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each one who has been enlightened by the truth appreciates the fact that this blessing came to him as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">gracious gift; and as he has a zeal for the Lord he appreciates his privileges of using time, energy, and money in telling the message to others. Some who are doing as much house-to-house witness work as their conditions allow are also blessed with some money which they desire to use in the Lord’s service, to the end that hungry souls which they cannot personally reach may be fed upon the precious kingdom-gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The custom of setting aside each week so much to be used in the Lord’s service has always proved beneficial to the giver. A notice to the Society that you hope to give so much, enables us to outline the work, based upon what is expected.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Bellingham, Wash., April 15, 1937 </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Enclosed find two printed letters, evidently sent out by Salter, one from New York post office, the other envelope mailed at Brooklyn. Envelope marked No. 1 was received on the 12th of this month, and the one marked No. 2 received on the 14th inst. In No. 1 envelope there is a letter supposed to be written by the Society, instructing the company servant to read his (Salter’s) printed letter to the company on the 11th inst. or at an earlier date or as soon as possible after the 11th inst. However, it is purely Salter’s own diabolical, duty work. You will notice that envelope No. 1 is stamped with the Society’s stamp for the purpose of deceiving the gullible saps. How one can stoop to such low level of wickedness is beyond me to comprehend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I noticed Salter's deflection on January 1933, when he was taking a trip from Mexico to Canada. At every place he stopped he caused much confusion among the brethren, not only doctrinally, but also speaking disparagingly concerning the establishment of divisional campaigns by the Society; also ridiculing the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> articles. This (his conduct) I reported to the Society at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On my way to Wenatchee I will stop at Mt. Vernon, Everett and Seattle to see if the company servants received the same letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Anything I can do in undoing the effects of these letters of Salter I will be pleased to do. Of course, no one who is well established in the present truth can be affected by the Devil’s attacks if they have made the present truth their own and are wholly devoted to Jehovah. Let the others be weeded out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With fervent love and best wishes, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your brother by Jehovah’s grace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">S. H. </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Toutjian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">April 13, 1937 Mr. S. H. Toutjian, Brooklyn, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Toutjian:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thank you for yours of the 15th, in re the enemy’s assault through Salter. It is said there are two causes of insanity, one the disintegration of the brain tissue, and the other the effect of the influence of the wicked spirits. Salter gives every evidence of laboring under this disability. The fact that he resorts to fraud and deceit and forges the name of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society</span><span class="font5"> for the purpose of getting a message before others, shows he is of an unbalanced mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are in a real fight against Satan and his forces. Our business is to proclaim the truth and not to bo disturbed by what the enemy does. So encouiage and comfort the brethren everywhere you go. Remember the words of the psalmist: “Fret not thyself because of evil doers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity; . . . Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him; fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.” (Psalm 37: 1,7,8) Personal assaults upon me are of no material interest. I expect these from the enemy. By the Lord’s grace, I will proceed with His work regardless of the same.

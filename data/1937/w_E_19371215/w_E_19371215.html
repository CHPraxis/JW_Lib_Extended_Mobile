<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>THE KINGDOM INTERESTS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Indeed, I say to you, That he mil appoint him over all his possessions.”—Matt. 24:47, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH is the possessor of all things in heaven and in the earth. From his boundless possessions he makes gifts to his creatures according to his good pleasure. Many centuries ago Jehovah God declared his purpose to establish the world in righteousness and to give it to a righteous ruler. That declaration dated from the time of the rebellion at Eden. Everything in God’s universe was righteous until that time, but covetousness induced Lucifer to become unrighteous and to lead other creatures into unrighteousness. Rebellion against God caused him to declare his purpose to establish a government of righteousness to 1)0 ruled in righteousness by the seed or offspring of his universal organization. From the time of that declaration until now, the thing which is of greatest importance amongst creatures is the completion and setting up of the promised kingdom. Creatures now on the earth are beginning to realize more fully than ever before that all their interests and welfare are centered in God’s kingdom. The primary purpose of that kingdom or government of righteousness is the vindication of Jehovah’s name; and secondarily it affords opixutunity for creatures to find and enjoy life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> It may be truly said that the present day is the worst of times and the best of times: worst of times because never before has there been put forth as now such a desperate effort by selfish men to rule the world contrary to the Word of God. It is the climax time of wickedness. Now is the best of times because Jehovah’s time has come to put in operation his kingdom, which shall eliminate all wickedness and rule the world in righteousness. This transition is accomplished only by great conflict. The final conflict between wickedness and righteousness is at hand, and righteousness is certain to win. Therefore the kingdom of God holds the place of greatest interest in the mind of every person who loves the truth. All the nations and peoples of the world are now struggling, and they are in much distress and perplexity and know not how they may find a place of security; and this is due to the fact that they are blind to God’s gracious provision provided through his kingdom for those who seek righteousness and meekness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Religion has been and is the chief instrument employed to make the people blind and to lead them into the ways of despair and destruction. Since the time that Eve was induced by the Devil to believe that she might become as wise as God, religion has been held before the eyes of men to hide from them Jehovah God and his provision for those who love to do right. It was religion induced by the Devil and practiced among creatures that made necessary the deluge by which the “world that then was” suffered destruction. Following the flood the Devil organized religion and induced the people </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">en masse</span><span class="font4"> to worship the creature and to spurn and mock the Creator. (Rom. 1: 2o) The descendants of faithful Abraham were later organized by Jehovah into a nation and separated to himself as a people for his name, and this he did to prevent their downfall and to hold them in line until the coming of Christ Jesus, the Seed of promise. God gave to the nation of Israel his law. At the same time be gave to them a solemn covenant that if they would obey his law they should be unto him a peculiar people, a treasure, a people for his purpose. The downfall of that nation was due to the sole fact that they spurned God’s law and gave themselves over to the practice of religion which the Devil had introduced amongst them. The course taken and the fate of the nation of Israel find an exact counterpart in these modern days because Israel was a type, of which “Christendom”, so called, is the antitype. What befell Israel is certain to befall “Christendom”, and for the same reason.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> Jehovah sent his beloved Son Jesus to the earth to declare the truth, particularly to the Jews, and to give them warning of the fate that awaited Jerusalem because they had given themselves over to Devil worship. The rulers failed to give heed to the warning, and the city was destroyed. Jesus Christ established in the earth the true worship of Almighty God, and he is therefore the author of Christianity, meaning that company of people who follow in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. His faithful apostles taught the truth and the true worship of Almighty God, but after they had passed into death the Devil used selfish men and again brought in religion and established the practice</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">thereof and misnamed the same “the Christian religion”, and which is more reproachful and dishonoring to the name of God than anything else that has ever been practiced amongst men. This is true because the name of Christ is applied to their unlawful practices. Among the peoples of Israel there were a few faithful men who remained true to God. Likewise in the land called “Christendom”, there have been and are a few faithfully obedient to God and who worship him in spirit and in truth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> About the year 1878 a few faithful men discerned that the time approached for the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, and they began to preach that good news. They were walking along with Babylon, Satan’s organization, yet were sincerely trying to gain and to walk in greater light. They separated themselves from the close association with Babylon, but they came out of that devilish organization with spots upon their garments; meaning that although they left Babylon they continued to practice religion and to observe religious forms. It is only quite recently that honest and sincere followers of Christ Jesus have been given by the Lord a vision of the hideousness of the Devil’s religion, and they have been permitted to see what great reproach religion brings upon the name of Jchotah. This is strong and persuasive evidence that the day of final reckoning is here when everyone who pleases God must forsake religion entirely and give himself wholly over to the worship of Almighty God in spirit and in truth. For that reason there is now a great conflict between religion and Christianity. Many have considered themselves Christians but in fact have been and are merely religionists. Many have looked upon present truth as the best kind of religion known to them, not discerning even now what it means to follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. A small number, comparatively, arc realizing that no man can now practice religion and at the same time be a true follower of Christ Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> How many today truly appreciate the kingdom of God under Christ? It is manifest that there are those who think themselves the true followers of Christ who do not appreciate the kingdom, because they go on in an indifferent way and show no real faith in God and in his kingdom and no keen desire to serve the same. The fact that they take little or no part in the work that God commands to be done and that must now be done in obedience to his will is proof that their interest in the kingdom is at a very low ebb, if they have any interest therein at all. These who attend the assembly of God’s people hear the message of truth proclaimed and hear emphasized particularly the commandment that the kingdom must now be preached, and then they go their way and ignore the commandment of the Lord and fail or decline to take any part whatsoever in preaching this gospel of the kingdom, and thereby they show that they have no appreciation of the kingdom and will never be permitted to share its profits, unless they<sup>7</sup> are quickly aroused and become truly active.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> &quot;Who, then, today are the ones who hear the truth concerning the kingdom and then boldly declare themselves on the side of the King and joyfully obey his commandments? These arc the ones who love God and his King and prove it by their actions. The fact that Jehovah has devoted centuries to making preparation for his kingdom, and the further fact that now he has enthroned his King, are proof conclusive that the kingdom is of paramount importance and that in this day God’s people on earth face the greatest responsibility and enjoy the greatest privilege that men have ever had. Everything pales into insignificance when compared with the kingdom of God under Christ. Because of the great importance of the kingdom this is the time when we must get understanding; which means, among other things, that we must have a proper appreciation of our relationship to the King and to his kingdom. In order to have such appreciation we must keep before the mind the truths that are now being revealed by the Lord and then give full heed and obedience thereto.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR RELATIONSHIP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> The only great man ever on the earth, Jesus of Nazareth, was a modest man. He did not seek to make a reputation for himself, but, on the contrary, humbled himself in obedience to Jehovah God and suffered reproach and ignominious death; and this was a result of his faithfulness in doing the will of his Father. At all times Jesus stressed the magnitude and supreme importance of the kingdom. He proclaimed the truth, and declared that all who are of the truth must and will do likewise. (John 18:37) That is the criterion by which every man may determine whether he is of the truth or not. If he is not with enthusiasm supporting the cause of Jesus Christ and following in his footsteps, he is not of the truth. Jesus died for the kingdom in obedience to his Father’s will. God raised Jesus out of death and exalted him to the highest place in the universe, and this because of his faithfulness. Christ Jesus, then being the anointed King of the world, was fully qualified to begin his reign, but that was not God’s due time. To him Jehovah said: ‘Wail till I make thine enemies thy footstool.’ (Ps. 110:1 ; Hcb. 10:13) For nineteen centuries Jesus Christ waited, and then, when God’s due time arrived, Jehovah sent Jesus forth and said to him: “Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” It was then that Jehovah gave Jesus the nations of earth for bis possession ; as it is written: ‘I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.’ (Ps. 2:0,8) That great event took place, as shown by fulfilled prophecy, in the year 1914. It was then that the mighty King ousted Satan from heaven and began preparation for the final overthrow of that wicked one and his organization. What is now the relationship of God’s faithful people to the great King, and their privilege and duty in connection with the kingdom? Unless we have a proper understanding and appreciation thereof, and unless we act accordingly, we shall miss the greatest privilege ever granted to creatures. For this reason the importance of the kingdom, our relationship thereto, and our duty in connection therewith, cannot be overstressed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE TEMPLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* The temple of God, built not by hands of men, consists of those creatures from among men who have been begotten of God’s spirit and in whom the spirit of God dwells, and who are anointed and are made members of Jehovah’s royal house with Christ Jesus the head thereof. (1 Cor. 3:16; 2 Cor. 6:16) Zion is the name of the capital organization of Jehovah, otherwise called his “royal house’’, and it is Zion wherein God makes his abiding place and through which he acts to carry out his purpose. (Ps. 132:13,14) ‘The coming of the Lord Jesus, and our gathering together unto him’ (2 Thess. 2:1), is his coining to the temple, lie comes to the temple as the great Judge that he may render judgment in behalf of the faithful dead and the faithful living. Those who have died in faith and proving their integrity, such as the apostles, arc first awakened out of death at the coming of the Lord and arc gathered unto him, and then those faithful living ones arc gathered in. (1 Thess. 4:15-17) Prior to the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple of Jehovah he first completed the work of ‘preparing the way before Jehovah’, and then he straightway appeared at the temple. (Alai. 3:1) Corresponding exactly to the time when Jesus offered himself as King to the Jews, God’s enthroned King comes to the temple, and all the scriptures and the facts show that this coming to the temple took place three and one-half years after Christ Jesus was enthroned, to wit, in the year 1918. There began the fulfillment of the prophetic announcement, to wit, “Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.” (Ilab. 2:20, A./f.V.) Jehovah is at his holy temple representatively. being there represented by Christ Jesus, his Executive Officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The Lord comes to the temple for the purpose of judgment, which judgment begins with the house of God; as it is w-Hten: “But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appear-eth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap: and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.”—Alai. 3:2,3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> At the beginning of that judgment, in 1918 or thereabouts, there stood before Christ the great Judge a company of persons who had entered into a covenant to do the will of God and follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. Many of those who there appeared before the Lord were religionists, while others were truly the followers of Christ Jesus and therefore Christians. The religionists were moved by the spirit of selfishness and self-preservation, desiring to be saved and to have a high place where they might receive honor and glory. The true followers of Christ Jesus were determined above all things to have the will of God done in them, forgetting self and looking only to the faithful performance of their covenant. Up to that point they had shown themselves faithfully devoted to God, watching and praying for the appearing of the Lord Jesus and his kingdom and doing whatsoever they could to obey God's commandments and making known the King and his coming. Because of their faithfulness and devotion to the Lord when that judgment was had at the temple, they were cleansed and adjudged approved and were brought into the temple of Clod, being gathered unto the Lord Jesus. It is concerning these faithful ones that the Lord says: “Who then is [that] faithful and wise servant?” They had shown themselves faithful by earnestly endeavoring to do the will of God, and they had shown themselves wise in being guided entirely by his Word. The relationship of this faithful company to the King is this: They are made members of Zion for his service, and they are under the command of Christ Jesus, their Lord and Head; they are brought into the temple not merely that they might be saved and honored, but tiic primary purpose is as stated by God’s prophet in these words, to wit: “That they may offer unto the Loid an offering in righteousness.” (Mal. 3:3) Being cleansed in the fiery judgment, they are commissioned and commanded to offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness, which offering means that they must bear before the people the truth of and concerning Jehovah’s name, which is righteous, and they must proclaim the day of his vengeance upon Satan’s organization, which is a righteous judgment, and they must lift up the standard of .Jehovah and his King, that the people may learn the way to righteousness, and they must proclaim the kingdom is at hand, and which is the kingdom of righteousness. Such are now the people of God, a people taken out of the world for his name and anointed and commissioned to do a specific work as he has commanded them to do.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">POSSESSIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> Such approved ones now designated the “faithful and wise servant”, being brought into the temple, receive instructions from the Lord, which instructions they receive in the secret place, that is, the temple of God, and those instructions are secret to all except the temple company. To them the Lord Jesus now sacs: ‘What I tell you in the dark fin the secret place), that speak ye in the light, and proclaim from the home-tops’; that is, publicly, fearlessly, and boldly make known. (Matt. 10:27) What must this faithful servant proclaim? Jesus answers that in these words;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> These are the ones taken out of the world for Jehovah’s name, and they must fulfill the prophetic utterance recorded by Moses long centuries ago, to make known the name of Jehovah in all the earth. His name and his kingdom must be made known to those who have a hearing ear, and they must be told that it is the only means of deliverance; and this testimony must be given before the battle of the great day of God Almighty. It is of and concerning that faithful temple company that Jesus uttered these words: “Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season'? Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods [possessions </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott)].” </span><span class="font4">(Matt. 24:45-47) The relationship of the “faithful and wise servant” to the King is therefore clearly revealed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>u</sup> The “goods” or “possessions” mentioned by the Lord consist of everything on earth that pertains to the righteous government of Jehovah God and Christ the King. Those possessions or goods mean all the interests of the kingdom now pertaining to the earth and the peoples thereof. In this connection there are divers and numerous things to be done. The message concerning God’s name and his kingdom must be prepared and carried to the people, and God organizes his people into a compact company to perform this work. Some in the servant class must produce, cook and serve material food that other workers may eat; some must prepare copy for the literature to be prints </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ed; </span><span class="font4">while others must operate machines to make ready </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">kingdom message in printed form ; some must prepare and some must operate sound machines which proclaim the message of the kingdom to the people; others must carry the printed message about and call the peoples’ attention thereto; and each and every one of the temple company, the “faithful servant”, takes advantage of all opportunities presented to proclaim the good news of the righteous government now being set up by Christ Jesus. The time is at hand when the Lord will clear out all unrighteous rule and unrighteous workers and will substitute a government of peace and complete righteousness that shall rule to the glory and honor of Jehovah’s name. The preliminary work to be done before this clearing out takes place is the work of making known God’s name and his purpose, that the people may learn about it and have due notice. That work exposes religion and all other wicked elements in the earth; and because it exposes the racketeer religionists, it is a “strange work” to all except those who are on the side of God and his King. It is God’s “strange work”, and it must now . be done. Jehovah, by the mouth of his great prophet, grants that every one of the temple company shall do his part in making known the name of Jehovah and his kingdom. Is that commandment discretionary or mandatory? It is an imperative mandate, the responsibility of which cannot be sidestepped. Christ Jesus, the King, the great Prophet, gives the commandment, and concerning those who are of his temple company this is written: ‘‘ And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.”—Acts 3:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> No creatures ever had a greater favor, and certainly not a greater responsibility, placed upon them. The Lord requires of the temple company full and complete faithfulness. That means faithfulness in performance and a correct report to the King. The Lord has entrusted his goods or possessions to the temple company, and to them he says: “To whom much has been entrusted, of him [the more] will be demanded.” (Luke 12:48, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth)</span><span class="font4"> The opportunity to serve the King and his kingdom is, in another scripture, designated by the Lord as “talents”, handed to his servants, and which talents they must increase by faithful devotion and performance; and that is exactly what he demands of all who prove faithful. They must advance the kingdom interests. They are called and chosen, and now under the test they must prove faithful. In order to be faithful one must be entirely trustworthy and wholly dependable. Whatsoever may be assigned to one of the servant company, that duty he must perform and render the service report unto the Lord. One can deceive men by appearing to perform and yet doing his work in a loose and indifferent manner and hiding the facts from men; but the Lord looks even upon the motive that prompts the act of the servant, and no one can deceive the Lord. One who loves the Lord and really appreciates his position is anxious at all times to perform any and every assigned duty faithfully and timly as unto the Lord. If one cannot learn to be entirely faithful and dependable in small things, he will never be advanced to more important things. Concerning this Jesus said: “He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own?” (Luke 16:10,12) The most important duty ever laid upon a man is that duty which is given to him in relation to the kingdom of God under Christ. Those who are in God’s organization and who are faithful make themselves blind to everything that is contrary to the kingdom interests. In doing our duty we cannot compromise with religion, nor shun to declare the whole truth, even though that truth may shock the religious susceptibilities of others. We are not to seek to go on in the way of least resistance, but it is the duty of the servant class to faithfully perform his duty in proclaiming the kingdom, ‘hewing to the line, and letting the chips fall where they may.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">*• Those to whom the kingdom interests are committed and who perform the assigned duty in an indifferent or careless manner cannot properly seek some way of justifying their mistakes resulting from carelessness. If a task is assigned to one of the temple company and he performs in a careless and indifferent manner and then tries to justify his action, he is unfaithful and makes an unfaithful report and of necessity must be displeasing to the Lord. To profit by mistakes or carelessness one must acknowledge to the Lord his weakness and must be diligent in seeking to do the right thing and sec to it that he doesnot act carelessly again. The Pharisees sought to excuse or justify themselves before the Lord in failing to do their duty, and Jesus said to them: “Ye arc they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.” (Luke 1G: 15) The same rule applies to others. If the servant of the Lord shuns his assigned duty or obligation and then tries to justify his action that he may have the approval of men, he is not faithfully performing his duty in the interests of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The paramount obligation laid upon the temple company is to show forth the name and praise of Jehovah God and his King. That is done by making known to the people that the only true God is Jehovah, and that his kingdom under Christ is the only hope for mankind. Jehovah has plainly stated the reason why he has laid this obligation upon his people and sent them forth to proclaim his name; and that reason is, that the world may know that soon God will exhibit his supremacy by destroying Satan ami his entire organization. The people must be warned and informed that Jehovah is the Almighty and is the only source of life. These things arc kingdom interests, and these kingdom interests must be given the closest attention by the “faithful and wise servant”. If you are of the temple company, you will be diligent in doing your part in making known the name and kingdom of Jehovah G'od, having in mind that God through his prophet says: “In his temple doth every one speak of his glory.” (Ps. 2!): 9) It follows that those who fail or refuse to make known these great truths to the praise of Jehovah’s name are not now in the temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>,B</sup> The light of Jehovah shining in the face of Christ Jesus, the Head of the temple, is reflected upon and illuminates those who are of the temple company. (2 Cor. 3:18; 4:4) The temple company, therefore, is given a vision of the kingdom. They clearly discern that the King of the world is at his temple and that through him Jehovah is unfolding his prophecies and making them to be clearly understood by all of the temple company. Among the many prophecies the Lord has unfolded to his temple company in recent months are these, to wit: That the kingdom of God consists of Christ Jesus and his followers, who prove true and faithful and entirely dependable even unto death; that such are his people taken out from amongst men for his purpose; that they are the sheep of his pasture; that the testimony concerning the kingdom is committed to them, and that they must deliver the same. Furthermore, he has revealed that the Lord has another company of “sheep” that he is now bringing, and which latter company will constitute the “great multitude”, and as these are brought forth they are made the companions of those who arc now of the temple company, that is, the “wise servant” class on earth. They see that it is the duty and obligation laid upon the temple company to go through the land and carry the spiritual food to tho'-c who arc hungry and thirsty for righteousness and that if they fail or refuse to thus minister unto the Lord’s “other sheep” they are unfaithful to God and to his King. Therefore the “faithful and wise servant” class delight to do good unto Jonadabs by carrying the truth to ti un and by inviting them to join themselves to God’s organization and have the privilege of serving there. Those who do not now see the great multitude coming from all lands, kingdoms and people arc not of tic temple. John the revelator, who figuratively stood for those of the temple company now on the earth, spoke concerning the great multitude, and his words apply specifically to the temple company now, and which words are: *1 beheld, and, lo, a great multitude . . . of all nations, . . . before the throne, with palms in their hands, singing the praise of Jehovah and !:is King.’ (Kev. 7:9,10) When the John class, that is to say, the temple company, now sec and appreciate these great truths and see the multitude coming, they delight to serve them in obedience to God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DUTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">io &gt;p]<sub>ie</sub> “g<sub>00</sub>d<sub>s</sub>” or “possessions” of the Lord, meaning his kingdom interests in the earth, the Lord now places in the charge and keeping of his “faithful and wise servant” and demands of that servant the protection and careful guarding and advancement of those kingdom interests. The enemy is desperately fighting against the faithful servant in an endeavor to defeat the purpose of the Lord and to destroy tl:'<sup>1 </sup>kingdom interests. The servant therefore must gu.'id well, protect and advance the kingdom interests, lie must not be negligent, careless and indifferent, but must be watchful and cautions; he must be solicitous and deeply concerned about the welfare and advancement of such kingdom interests; therefore he must be anxious about the faithful performance of his duty and that he may perfonn and report to his Lord that his Lord may be pleased, and that the report may be to God’s glory. It is to those faithful ones the Lord says “Well done”, but not to the indifferent ones A careless, indifferent or “happy-go-lucky” prison cannot maintain his integrity toward the Lord. Faithful performance of duty is required by the Lord of his servant, and one cannot be negligent and indifferent and at the same time receive the Lord’s approval. From the time the kingdom interests are placed in the keeping of the “faithful and wise servant” and until the battle of Armageddon, such is a time of conflict, and when one is fighting the enemy he must be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font4">guard, must be watchful, and see to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font4">that he does not perform his duty in a careless and indifferent </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">way and </span><span class="font4">permit to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">slip </span><span class="font4">by </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">him </span><span class="font4">opportunities for advancing the kingdom interests. Men have never before had such favors and obligations laid upon them, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">the Lord will </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font4">permit these favors and obligations to be treated with indifference. The King’s business and his kingdom interests require the greatest </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">degree of </span><span class="font4">anxious care on </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">part </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font4">“faithful </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">wise servant”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HAPPINESS AND JOY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>w</sup> Seeing that we </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font4">in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">time of conflict and that to safeguard and give attention to the kingdom interests requires a constant warfare, and that we must be anxious about a true and faithful performance of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">duty, how </span><span class="font4">can one be happy under such conditions? Present-day happiness is </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font4">essential to pleasing service unto the Lord. The “joy of the Lord” is very essential. Happiness and joy are often improperly used as synonymous terms. The two words have very different meanings. Happiness is had by the creature who is in a state of peace and tranquillity, when he </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is at </span><span class="font4">rest and in prosperity and cats the labor of his hands in peace. (Ps. 128: 2) He is happy when he has triumphed in a righteous cause. (Ps. 137:8,9) Likewise one is happy when he rests in security, prosperity and safety and is successful, and therefore fully satisfied. (Pss. 144:15; 146:5) Says the apostle Peter: </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“If ye be </span><span class="font4">reproached for the name of Christ, happy </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">are ye; </span><span class="font4">for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">part he is </span><span class="font4">glorified.”—1 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Pet. 4:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> The one who is reproached because of his faithfulness to Christ Jesus has the evidence that he is pleasing to God, and therefore he rests contentedly in the love of God. In the text last above quoted the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">word </span><span class="font4">“happy” means a supremely blessed state by </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">reason of </span><span class="font4">being in the family of God and in a favorable position with the Lord. It does not mean “hilarity”, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">by any </span><span class="font4">means. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Anyone </span><span class="font4">who is careless and negligent </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">the performance </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">his assigned duty, and is chas</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tised for </span><span class="font4">that reason, and then sings and says: “Well, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font4">have told the Lord all about it, and now I am happy,” that person is deceiving himself. To be sure, God </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">knows </span><span class="font4">everything. One’s mistakes cannot properly </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">make him </span><span class="font4">happy, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">but, </span><span class="font4">on </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">contrary, will make him </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">sober and </span><span class="font4">thoughtful that he may profit thereby and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">make </span><span class="font4">further progress. One can hardly be said to be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">happy, </span><span class="font4">within the proper meaning of that term, when he is engaged in a real combat with the enemy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JOY OF THE LORD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses, because of preaching the gospel of the kingdom in obedience to God’s commandment, are often assaulted, arrested and thrown into prison and subjected to ill-treatment while confined in filthy cells, and are there compelled to listen to the name of Jehovah being slandered and vilified, and surely they cannot be happy by reason of such condition; but these same conditions cause them to be joyful in the Lord. They know that they are right and arc suffering because of righteousness, and that this is according to God’s will, and therefore they rejoice or delight to do his will. Jesus makes this clear distinction in the parable of the talents. To his servant, who has been faithful over a few things and who brines </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">faithful report to the Lord, he says: “Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.” (Matt. 25:23) Jesus thus invited the temple company to enter into his joy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> What is the joy of the Lord? and what docs it mean to be joyful in the Lord? It means an inward calm delight because of the knowledge of the fact that God’s purpose is about to be accomplished in the vindication of his name and that the person who is suffering indignities because of righteousness, and who continues faithful, may have a part in that vindication. When Jesus was faced with death by crucifixion upon the tree, knowing that he was about to die as an accursed sinner, he was joyful because he knew th.it such suffering would ultimately result in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. (Ilcb. 12:2) For centuries Satan had reproached the name of Jehovah, and now that reproach had fallen upon Christ Jesus because he had been faithful to his Father. (Ps. 69:9; Rom. 15:3) Jesus knew that it was the will of God that it should be so, and therefore he rested in calm delight that he was permitted to fulfill his Father s will and that he had the assurance that in due time he would vindicate his Father’s name. That was the joy set before him when he was about to be crucified, and for that reason he endured the cross. (Ileb. 12: 2) When Christ Jesus was enthroned and came to the temple, he had reached the point of great joy because the time had come to vindicate his Father’s name. When he gathered unto himself the faithful followers, it was then, and still is, a joyful time, because it is the time </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for the vindication </span><span class="font4">of Jehovah’s name; and therefore he says to the “faithful and wise servant” class, to whom he has committed the care of his “goods”, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">kingdom interests: ‘Come, and participate in this great joy with me.’ In obedience to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">commandment of the Lord </span><span class="font4">the “faithful servant” now goes </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">about </span><span class="font4">the earth proclaiming the name of Jehovah </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">his kingdom under Christ; and because they do so </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font4">arc subjected to all manner of abuse and ill-treatment, even as the Lord Jesus foretold they would be ill-treated. Certainly they are not happy because of ill-treatment, abuse and imprisonment; but they are joyful in the Lord, for the reason that this is evidence they arc following in the footsteps of Jesus and will have a part in the vindication of his name. Many of these faithful ones suffer bodily pain, and bitter tears are forced to How down their cheeks, but they rejoice in the fact that they are the Lord’s children and are privileged to prove their integrity under adverse conditions, that they may have the approval of the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> Suffering or tribulation is a condition precedent to entering fully into the kingdom; as it is written: “We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.” (Acts 14: 22) Therefore the apostle exclaimed: “We glory in tribulations.” (Rom. 5:3) Knowing that tribulation and suffering is a condition precedent to entering into the kingdom the apostle furthermore said: “Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church.”—Col. 1:24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> The true and faithful follower of Christ Jesus will not now confuse so-called “happiness” with the “joy of the Lord”. When one knows and appreciates the fact that he is suffering indignities and punishment at the hand of the enemy, and this because the witness of the Lord is faithfully and truly guarding, protecting and advancing the kingdom interests, that gives the servant real joy, that is, an inherent delight in doing the will of God that he may have God’s approval and thereby a part in proving that Satan is a liar and Jehovah is always right.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PRIVILEGE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> When one enjoys a great privilege at the hand of Jehovah, that brings to him joy, even though it is coupled with much suffering. For this reason the apostle, under inspiration from the Lord, wrote, for the benefit of the “faithful servant” now on earth engaged in war on the side of the Lord, these words, to wit: “Only let the lives you live be worthy of the good news of the Christ, in order that, whether I come and see you or, being absent, only hear of you, I may know that you are standing fast in one spirit and with one mind, fighting shoulder to shoulder for the faith of the good news. Never for a moment quail before your antagonists. Your fearlessness will be to them a sure token of impending destruction, but to you it will be a sure token of your salvation, a token coming from God. For you have had the privilege granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf; maintaining, as you do, the same kind of conflict that you once saw in me and which you still hear that I am engaged in.” —Phil. 1: 27-30, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2T</sup> Jehovah’s faithful witnesses can and do now testify that it is a real joy to suffer with Christ Jesus and to have the assurance that those who do thus suffer with him for righteousness shall reign with him in glory. (2 Tim. 2:12) To the “faithful and wise servant” there has been committed, among other things of the kingdom interests, the testimony of Jesus Christ, and the faithful keep God’s commandments and obey them. For that reason the Devil and all of his invisible and visible instruments make war upon the faithful witnesses of Jehovah and try to destroy them. In this conflict the faithful witnesses are joyful in the Lord because they know that they are in the right and that they are backed up by Jehovah and his King, Christ Jesus. It is a great favor and privilege for anyone to have a part in the warfare of righteousness; as it is written : “For thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.”—Ps. 5:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The kingdom interests, that is, the goods or possessions of the Lord, are closer and dearer to the heart of the “faithful and wise servant” than any earthly thing. The servant loves the kingdom interests and delights to advance the same and is determined that no earthly creature shall separate him therefrom or hinder him in the performance of duty. (Matt. 10:37-39) As the “faithful and wise servant” advances the kingdom interests, another company of the Lord’s sheep join that servant. Such arc the Jonadabs, who go to make up the “great multitude”. The Jonadabs flee to God’s organization under Christ Jesus and there find shelter and protection, and they delight to join the remnant in the battle for righteousness and to proclaim the praises of Jehovah and his King, and to them that is a blessed favor. They have heard the joyful sound of and concerning God’s kingdom under Christ, and of this it is written: “Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound; they shall walk, 0 Lord, in the light of thy countenance.” (Ps. 89:15) From every part of the earth, from all nations, kingdoms and tongues, there now come to the Lord those who will form the great multitude. The light of the King is revealed to them, and in the King they center their hopes, and they enjoy his favor, which is likened unto copious showers of rain descending upon the thirsty earth: “In the light of the king’s countenance is life ; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.”—Prov. 16:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CALAMITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> There is now revealed to the remnant of God, the ‘elect servant’, and to their companions, that the greatest calamity that has ever befallen or ever will befall the world, is just ahead. They sec that every nation of the earth is now torn with strife; hatred, ill will and malice arc in the saddle, and fanatics rule and oppress the people, while the people go mad and resort to wickedness. The mask is now being removed from religion, and it appears before the eyes of honest creatures that religion is the most monstrous and wicked instrument the Devil has employed to reproach Jehovah God and -to make the people blind and turn them into the way of destruction. An unprecedented economic depression has fallen upon all the nations; famine and pestilence, together with murder, stalk through the lands. Satan, knowing that his time is short, is actually hurrying the nations on to the great battle of Armageddon, expecting there to destroy all mankind. Never before has the world been confronted with such a terrible situation. Do these things make the people of God happy? No, not in the least; but they do bring joy to them because it is further and conclusive evidence that the day is at hand when wickedness shall be removed from the earth, when God’s kingdom under Christ shall triumph, and when the name of Jehovah shall be for ever vindicated.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> The prophet Ilabakkuk was a type of God’s faithful servant class now on the earth, and Habakkuk uttered a prophecy, thereby putting these words in the mouth of the “faithful and wise servant”: “Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls; yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.” (llab. 3:17,18) Thus in prophetic language the Lord shows that even though this is the worst time the world has ever known, those who faithfully obey him rejoice in the fact that the day of wickedness is about to for ever end. The faithful ones who trust wholly in the Lord joy in his strength, and they say: “The Lord God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds’ feet; and he will make me to walk upon mine high places.” (Hab. 3:19) The feet of the hind arc sure and steadfast in perilous places and are swift to move and escape the darts of the enemy. Thus the “faithful servant” class is likened unto the hind. Although highly honored by the Lord in having committed to them his goods or kingdom interests and thus made to occupy the highest place amongst men, they are calm and rest in the Lord because they arc sure of their position, knowing that they stand upon the Great Rock, the Lord God, and his Chief Corner Stone, Christ Jesus; that they are in his fortress, and when pursued by the enemy they take the right course, their feet are swift to do the bidding of the Lord. Encompassed by a great horde of enemies, God’s people know that they shall receive full protection and salvation if they continue faithfully in his service. They delight to fight on his side, and therefore they arc joyful in the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>81</sup> For many centuries the faithful followers of Christ Jesus have looked forward and waited for this very time. Now the Lord has gathered unto his temple the remnant of the faithful ones and made them his trusted servant and committed to them all his earthly kingdom interests, laying upon them the obligation of advancing those interests. He has unveiled to them the hidden meaning of prophecy, and these revealed truths thrill the heart of each one of the servant company and they repeat the words of his prophet written long ago for their benefit, to wit: “I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.”— Isa. 61:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> Although greatly suffering many indignities, as well as bodily pain, the joy of the Lord fills the heart of each one of the faithful servants. Clothed with the holy and righteous robe provided by Jehovah for his servant, these are sent forth to proclaim his name and his kingdom, and they rejoice to advance the kingdom interests. The voice from heaven gives to the servant this commandment: “Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.” (Isa. 62:10) Those who love God and his King will not now be indifferent to this commandment. They do now greatly rejoice to go to the sin-cursed nations, lifting high God’s standard of righteousness and truth, and point all persons of good will to the only hope for their salvation. They delight to uncover the racketeers and their racket in obedience to God’s will, to roll away the stumbling stones and point the people to the highway that leads to the kingdom of rest and peace. Because the faithful do joyfully obey the commandment of Ihc Lord, they are beset by the enemy and caused to suffer, but they have the assurance that even these thing: shall work good for them, because the Lord has caused to be written in his Word this precious promise: “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.” (Rom. 8:28) Fully trusting in his promise their joy in the Lord increases.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> In some nations now ruled by fanatics and cruel religionists faithful witnesses for the Lord ind iiis kingdom have been foully murdered, but these, even in death, have been granted the victory through Christ Jesus, because to such Jesus says: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.” (Rev. 2:10, A.R.V.) The Devil and his agents think to defeat the Lord by killing his witnesses, but Jehovah laughs at their folly and has them in derision. The arm of the Lord is not shortened, and nothing can hinder his onward progress. Concerning such faithful ones who die in faith and faithfully devoted to the cause of God’s kingdom, he says: ‘These shall not sleep [in death], but shall be changed ... in the twinkling of an eye.’—1 Cor. 15:51,52.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> Those faithful ones have the assurance of an instantaneous resurrection to life and to immediate entrance into the presence of the Lord. Therefore prisons, persecution, bodily punishment, wickedly in-flictcd upon these faithful ones, do not deter them from the Lord’s service. Faithful men of old sealed their witness work with their blood, and the “faithful and wise servant” class will follow the same course, if that be the Lord’s will. Let none of the faithful ones in the countries ruled by fanatics be deterred from service to the Lord and his kingdom interests by reason of such persecution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> For the past three or four years this wicked persecution in various lands has continued to increase against Jehovah’s witnesses. The “faithful and wise servant” has pressed forward regardless of such persecution. What now is the visible result of their faithful work? As John stood upon the shores of the isle of Patmos and beheld in prophetic vision the coming of a great multitude, so now the temple company behold the coming of a multitude seeking the way to God and his kingdom, and they have the satisfaction of having some part in carrying to these people the message of God’s truth that has opened their eyes. (Rev. 7: 9) Those Jonadabs are the “other sheep” of the Lord who are fleeing that they may find refuge in the “city” or God’s organization, and these are joining in the proclamation of Jehovah’s name and his kingdom and arc saying: “Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.” Fanatical rulers, conscienceless police officers, and other persecutors of God’s people will not hinder the advancement of the kingdom interests. The Lord knows no defeat.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> Let the people of the Lord now fully realize that this is the most weighty or momentous time in the history of man. The King of Righteousness, long ago promised and anxiously looked for, has come, lie is in his temple, separating the nations. As God’s commissioned Great Officer he commands all the earth to keep silence and hear the Word of the Almighty God. At the same time he commands his faithful servants to go and warn the people that they must seek to find the only place of refuge and salvation and find it in the Lord’s organization. The decree of Jehovah is about to be executed, at which execution Satan and all of his organization, invisible and visible, shall fall, to be immediately succeeded by the reign of the world’s rightful King. Upon the shoulder of Christ Jesus, the King of glory, shall rest the government of the world, and which government shall bring in everlasting peace and righteousness. Never before was there a government like his, and it shall abide for ever. Never before have men been honored and favored with the privilege of announcing such a government, and never will there be another such time. In this hour of greatest crisis the Lord has laid upon his faithful servant class the obligation to look after, guard well, make known and advance the present-day interests of his glorious kingdom. Never before was such favor conferred upon creatures in the earth, and never before have men been charged with such a weighty responsibility. The eternal existence of the servant class depends now upon their faithfulness in performance of duty.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3 T</sup> This is not the time for hilarity, but is the time for sober thought, cautious, energetic and diligent forward movement. The servant cannot now slack the hand. It is the time for rejoicing in the Lord, and his people are doing that very thing. Faithful and careful performance of assigned duty will be honored and blessed by the Lord with increased opportunities, and thus the kingdom interest is advanced. Because the enemy has challenged the right of God’s government, this is a time of war, and Jehovah commands those of his organization to rise up against her, the enemy, in war. Therefore the “faithful and wise servant” and the “other sheep” of the Lord, “her companions,” must move forward united in one compact body. They must be at peace among themselves, and for that reason they are commanded to continuously pray for pcaee within God’s organization. The murmurers and complaincrs, the slothful and indifferent, the idlers and fearful, must stand aside, because the Lord will no longer tolerate such indifference or any interference with the forward march of his army. The faithful servant must be blind to everything except the service of the King and his kingdom interests. The faithful ones will give unstinted devotion, all their strength and their money and substance, yea, their all of everything, for the advancement of the kingdom interest. Thus faithfully performing their assigned duty, ultimately they will participate in the victory of Christ Jesus and shall behold the power and glory of the Almighty God, whose name alone is Jehovah and whose majesty and glory shall fill the universe and endure for ever.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> God’s people now on the earth well know that the King’s reign has begun and that soon the earth will be made rid of everything that defiles and that every soul that breathes shall join in the praise of the Most High. This is the joy set before the Lord, and this is the joy of his people. He has now gathered them unto bis temple and invites them to share his joy, his glory' and his riches. The condition precedent to receiving such boundless blessings is that the servant class must faithfully, watchfully, earnestly and truly guard and advance the kingdom interests, the goods or possessions of the Lord in the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>39</sup> Never before was the scripture text so appropriate to God’s people on the earth, to wit: “With all thy getting get understanding”; that is to say, get a proper appreciation of our relationship to Jehovah and to his King and kingdom. (Prov. 4:7) There is but one Almighty God, who is the Giver of every' good and perfect gift; there is but one Lord and Master, Christ Jesus, the Redeemer of man, the King of the world, and Jehovah’s Vindicator; there is one company of faithful servants who are made members of Jehovah’s royal house, and who are the children of God and joint heirs with Christ Jesus; there is but one great multitude that shall for ever serve Jehovah and his King and remain </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font4">the earth, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">that is now being gathered into the fold of the Lord. Salvation to creatures is a blessed thing; but that which is of paramount importance is the kingdom of God under Christ, which will establish everlastingly on the earth peace and righteousness, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">which will vindicate the Word and name of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Most </span><span class="font4">High, who through his King, Christ Jesus, will </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">give </span><span class="font4">life </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">every man who loves and obeys him. Gaining the proper view of our relationship to Jehovah and to his King and kingdom, we can realize to some degree, at least, how blessed the privilege of now making known to those who mourn the goodness of Jehovah God and his King, who will bring indescribable blessings to every honest, obedient soul.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. For he spate, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast. Jehovah bringeth the counsel of the nations to nought; he maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">G</span><span class="font4">OD commanded his prophet Ezekiel to take a brick or tile and an iron pan and to use these in a mimic siege of Jerusalem. This the prophet was to do to show in living pantomime that Jerusalem would surely be besieged and destroyed. He was to portray this city upon the brick. The pan would represent the coverlet or shields behind which the besiegers would operate. Ezekiel lay upon his side during the mimic siege and the Lord laid bands upon him to keep him from turning. Also, Ezekiel was required to live on a restricted diet of bread and water during those days and to cat and drink under much adversity. (Ezek. 4:9-15) This foreshadows the fulfillment of God’s word spoken to the prophet: “Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem; and they shall cat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment; that they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.” (Ezek. 4:16, 17) Such conditions actually existed in the eity of Jerusalem at the time of the siege by the Babylonian army under Nebuchadnezzar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This would seem to picture that just as surely as God’s covenant people would be put in bonds and on a restricted diet, spiritually and materially, for a season to bear the iniquitous practices of “organized Christianity”, just so surely would “organized Christianity” by the Lord’s judgment be made hungry for food and thirsty for drink, both spiritually and materially, and suffer and be destroyed. In the years 1918 and 1919 God’s covenant people were under restraint of bonds, bearing “organized Christianity’s” iniquity, being “hated of all nations”, and many of them were imprisoned and compelled to exist upon scant food rations, while the church everywhere was being fed with meager spiritual rations because “Christendom” had restricted the work and communication of God’s people one with another. Those trying experiences awakened God’s covenant people to the real situation and set them wholly against “organized religion” and all other parts of Satan’s organization Particularly from and after 1922 God’s covenant people have assaulted “organized Christianity” with the weapons of truth provided by the Lord, and have continued so to do with zeal and vigor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The cruel handling of God’s covenant people by “organized Christianity” during the World War has ‘turned for a testimony against them (“organized Christianity”]’ even as Jesus foretold. (Mark 13:9) Ezekiel made a picture of the siege of Jerusalem, and the siege actually began some time thereafter. Up to 1922 Jehovah’s organization was drawing up the machinery for operations before the walls of hypocritical “Jerusalem” or “organized Christianity” and was preparing for the siege. There was then much to the discredit of “organized Christianity” in the eyes of the Lord, among which was the persecution of God’s covenant people during the World War; the Interchurch World Movement, launched by Big Business, with the clergy playing second fiddle, in the year 1919; also the approval by “organized Christianity” of the League of Nations, which is an “abomination” in the sight of the Lord; and the approval of the program of the International Arms Conference in 1921, and other things. In March, 1922, the “ammunition” factory of God’s covenant people was greatly enlarged, being established in more commodious quarters, in ordci* that many books containing the message of truth might be made ready for the assault. Then quickly followed the world-wide witness by Jehovah’s witnesses by many public lectures’ being delivered on “Millions Now Living Will Never Die”, and also the introduction of the radio, which the Lord put forward to tell the truth to the people. Now the campaign has been in progress for several years and is growing more intensive and interesting each year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the mimic siege of Jerusalem God laid bands upon Ezekiel. During the siege of “organized Christianity” God has laid bands upon his people, which bands arc the obligations of being his witnesses to give his testimony which he committed to Jesus Christ, and these bands prevent his people from turning to the right or to the left in their work. God’s “faithful servant” class now have their faces firmly set against Satan’s organization, and they have assaulted and continue the assault with God’s Word which he has put in their mouths and in their hands. They are in a real fight now, and no longer on short rations, spiritually or otherwise, even as it is written: “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, my servants shall cat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed.” (Isa. 65:13) Jehovah is making ample provision for his people, spiritually and temporally, even while all “Christendom” is suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sentiments of “organized Christianity” are well summed up in the recent comment of a well-known newspaper, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Our world presents a strange and sorry spectacle. In the cities millions of people haven’t enough to eat. In the country millions of farmers, facing ruin, are feeding dirt-cheap wheat and corn to the hogs, because they haven’t a market. Around the world there arc hundreds of millions going almost naked, while cotton planters arc on the verge of starvation because they can’t get rid of their cotton. There is too much bread, too much sugar, too much coffee, too much cotton, too much silver, too much copper, too much oil, too much, almost, of everything. Yet 1,500,000,000 people—three-quarters of the population of the globe —half-naked and half-starved, are yearning for the barest necessities of life, but can’t afford them. What</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">a sickening indictment of our system! . . . The remedy is only to be found in a new order of things founded upon world peace. The principal nations of the earth are going to have to get together on a plan to put an end to war, then turn their attention to policies, national and international, which will improve the living conditions of peoples everywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people of Jerusalem, especially the clergy, scoffed at Ezekiel and prophesied man’s ability to bring peace and plenty. The conditions are exactly the same today. After repeated proclamations of the truth; the distribution in &quot;Christendom” of more than two hundred million books in many languages; the proclamation of the message of God’s kingdom by Resolutions, by radio and by other means, &quot;Christendom” is absolutely blind to the cause of the trouble and what is the remedy. This blindness will continue until there falls upon &quot;organized Christianity”, or &quot;Christendom”, exactly what fell upon the city of Jerusalem, except on a far wider and greater scale. The Lord is causing his people now to proclaim the day of his vengeance upon &quot;organized Christianity”. Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s great Executive Officer in the temple, is leading the fight to the glory and the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and when it is done the people shall know that Jehovah is God. His name shall be vindicated!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among all the nations that are on the earth or ever have been on the earth those nations composing &quot;Christendom”, or &quot;organized Christianity”, are the most reprehensible. The Protestant countries of &quot;organized Christianity” are even more reprehensible than the Catholic. It was because of enlightenment coming to view by the favor of the Lord that certain religionists organized Protestantism as a protest against the practice of Catholicism. The light, therefore, that has come upon Protestantism has been greater than that upon Catholics; and greater light brings greater responsibility. Protestants have had free access to the Bibb', while many Catholics have been denied this privilege. The Protestant countries have had the testimony of the truth given to them in their own languages, and their own Bibles have been used to cite the truth to them even more than any other peoples ever upon the earth. In addition to the prophecies with which the nation of Israel was favored, the nations calling themselves &quot;Christian” have had the words of Jesus and of the apostles, and later millions of copies of the Bible have been published and placed in their hands. There appears to be no excuse for any of these lands called &quot;Christendom”, and especially among those of the clergy and the principal of their flocks, to say that they never had an opportunity to know about the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The nations of &quot;Christendom” have held themselves out before all other peoples of earth as models and have sent their missionaries into heathen lands to induce the heathen people to follow the Christians as a model people. They have put forth much effort to convert the heathen nations to the so-called &quot;Christian’s way of thinking” concerning religion. They have claimed to be God’s favorites, and without hesitation have taken his name upon their lips and called themselves by the name of his beloved Son, and at the same time their hearts have been far removed from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God has sent his witnesses throughout &quot;Christendom”, and particularly into the lands known as Protestant, to give a wide witness for the truth. Among all the men in these nations collectively called &quot;Christendom” the most reprehensible are the clergymen. These men claim to be the children and covenant-people of God and to be followers of Christ Jesus. They pose before the people as the only ones qualified and commissioned to interpret and teach the Bible. They have budded great church edifices and called these after the name of Christ and the apostles. They have put themselves forward as leaders of the people and have induced millions to follow after them; they have budded great schools of learning, which they call &quot;theological seminaries”, or places for the education of young men to preach the gospel, and these they have sent forth labeled with the title of &quot;Reverend”, &quot;Doctor of Divinity,” or &quot;Minister of God’s Word”. They are therefore without excuse for the course they have taken and for their failure to know about God’s purposes. Regardless of all the favor that Jehovah has bestowed upon them, today the clergymen of &quot;Christendom”, as a whole, are against the kingdom of God, and among all those who oppose the preaching of the message of Ihe truth of and concerning the kingdom the clergymen are the most violent opposers. They arc the ones who persecute and seek the arrest and imprisonment of humble men and women who carry the message of truth to the people. They arc the ones who busy themselves in attempts to prevent the radio stations from broadcasting the message of God’s kingdom. God will not permit these things to go unnoticed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A large majority of the clergy repudiate the blood of Christ Jesus, which is God’s provision for the redemption of man, and they deny that his kingdom is God’s remedy for the uplift and blessing of the human race. They deny the inspiration of the Scriptures and freely tell the people that the Bible account of the creation, the fail of man, and redemption through the blood of Jesus Christ is merely folklore. They have openly joined hands with the Devil’s makeshift and fraudulent scheme, the League of Nations, and claim it as the substitute for God’s announced kingdom on earth. They have builded the greatest structure of hypocrisy ever known. Hypocritically claiming to be the followers of Christ, they have made themselves a part of Satan’s organization, and therefore the avowed enemies of Jehovah God and his kingdom. They have led the people away from God and into daikness, have acted as Satan’s chief agents, and have desecrated and defamed God's holy name; and now God’s day has come when he will have announcement made of his judgment and will cause to be executed his judgments against “Christendom” as written. “Christendom,” therefore, is in the stocks and is marked for the most severe drubbing any people or nation has ever received. It is upon “Christendom” that the Lord Jesus Christ declares shall be visited the greatest tribulation that was ever known since the world began, and it shall mark the last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In chapter five of Ezekiel’s prophecy, the prophet by his shaved hair and beard predicts and portrays the distressing conditions of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">siege and of the execution of Jehovah’s judgment against “Christendom”. (Read carefully Ezekiel 5:1-5.) Then Jehovah by his prophet tells professed “organized Christianity”, or “Christendom”, that they not only have failed Io walk in his statutes but have been guilty of wickedness greater than that of any other nation. “And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her; for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.” (Ezek. 5:6) The nations calling themselves “Christian”, having had the opportunity to know and to walk in the laws and statutes of the Lord, have failed to do so. Not only have they failed, but their clergymen and the principal of their (locks have deliberately led the people against the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you.” (Ezek. 5:7) Because of their disregard of God’s Word, the persecution of his faithful witnesses and the desecration and defamation of his holy name, Jehovah says to “organized Christianity”; “Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold 1, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee, in the sight of the nations. And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.” —Ezek. 5: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As famine, pestilence, pests that destroy the crops, and other like things now begin to befall the people, the clergy in their pulpits (which they claim to be in the house of God) and by means of the radio proclaim to the people that all their sufierings and calamities Jehovah God has brought upon them and therefore he is responsible; and this is added to all other acts of wickedness that they have committed. “Wherefore, as I live, saith the Lord God, Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore will I also diminish thee; neither shall mine eye spare, neither will I have any pity.” (Ezek. 5:11) The Lord declares that he will show no pity upon these deliberate defamers of his holy name. The people shall know and will know that Jehovah is the Lord God Almighty.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rctiierfobd:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Meat in due season’’ indeed is the June 1 (1937) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">WaDh-tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">My</span><span class="font3"> heart is filled with gratitude as 1 reside at the table ot the Most High and inquire m his temple. Dear Brother Rutherford, how Jehovah has blessed you and through you IIis people on eaith! Bow wonderful to know our heavenly Father is ever watchful of his little ones, and is guiding them in the light way through Christ Jesus, nnd Be thiough </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtowr r ! </span><span class="font3">May he ever bless you as you seek to serve him. I hope to remain</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FROM WHOM ALL LIGHT PROCEEDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Kutheriokp:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has made peace within our borders and has filled us with the finest of his wheat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Be has caused iiis pure river ot water of life to flow freely from the throne of his King, Christ Jesus; and thereby the strength of his remnant is renewed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the July 15 issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> he gives the wotkers of deceit “a new name”, which certainly is most appropiiate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A great contrast between this and the name awarded his “covenant people” in 1931 is plain, and should make glad the heart of him “who hath the God of Jacob for his help”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Tho subtle maneuveis of the enemy are visible only “in the light of his Glittering Sword”, which will smite the strongholds at Armageddon and will reveal to all the One from whom all light proceeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With fervent love and best wishes for a glorious victory, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Clayton</span><span class="font3"> R. </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Morris, A’cio </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">York.</span></p>

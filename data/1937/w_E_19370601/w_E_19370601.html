<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH'S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall live on earth forever.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>ADVERSARIES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“Because our conflict is not ivith blood and flesh, but icith the governments, with the authorities, with the potentates of this darkness, with the spiritual things of wickedness in the heavenlies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Eph. 6:12, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH has given command to his servants: “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her to war.” (Obad. 1, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser)</span><span class="font3"> This command could have its application only after the second coming of the Lord Jesus, when he is sent forth to rule amongst his enemies, and more particularly after his coming to the temple of God, when the Devil is gathering his forces to Armageddon preparatory for the battle of the great day of God Almighty. All the prophecy that is now revealed and made clear by reason of the physical facts, which God has caused to come to pass, proves beyond all doubt that Christ Jesus is at the temple; that he is dividing and judging the nations and causing the various ones to identify themselves and that all the forces of the wicked one are being gathered against those who serve God. All such are adversaries of God and his kingdom. Regardless of how much a Christian loves peace and quietude, this is no time to seek a place of seclusion and quietness. It is the time of war with the enemies. It must of necessity be the time of peace within the ranks of the Lord’s people, when they must dwell together in unity and fight in one solid phalanx. All of the temple company of God are now under the leadership of Christ Jesus, and all must be of one mind, which is the mind of Christ. God and Christ have risen up against the enemies, and all who are on the side of God and Christ must always take their place against the adversaries and do their part in the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">IDENTIFYING THE ENEMY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> It must be the will of God that those of the temple shall be able now to identify the enemies, that their attitude toward the same may be in full harmony with God’s will. Who, then, as shown by the Scriptures, are the enemies of the Lord and of those who serve him? The enemies of God and Christ Jesus </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font3">certainly the enemies of everyone who places him</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">self </span><span class="font3">on the side of God and his kingdom, and who gives his devotion and love and service to God and Christ. It is against such adversaries that the war is now being waged. It is against such that Jehovah now commands his people and all of his organization to ‘rise against her in war’. The fight is not against some imaginary foe, but against the mighty host arrayed against all righteousness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> The arch enemy of God is Satan the Devil. All those who are in the Devil’s organization and under his domination are the enemies of God and of his people. The reason for the existence of that enmity must be fully understood and appreciated by the people of God in order that they may deport themselves in harmony with the will of God. Covetousness led Lucifer to become the enemy of God. He had an insatiable desire to have the praise of creatures, which properly belongs to Jehovah, and not to any creature. He . es&gt; rted to fraud, lying and deceit, resulting in muider, in order to gratify his covetousness. He was sentenced to death and given the criminal names of Satan, Serpent, Dragon, and Devil. Among the first things he did after receiving those titles from Jehovah was to induce the murder of one of God’s faithful witnesses. It is therefore authoritatively said of him by the Lord Jesus that: “The devil . . . was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.”—John 8:44.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">‘Jehovah’s judgment, entered against that wicked one, is death, and which judgment contains amongst other things these words: “I will destroy thee,.. . and never shalt thou be any more.” (Ezck. 28:16-19) That unchangeable judgment has not yet been executed, for the following reason, to wit: Satan the Devil challenged God to put on eartii men that would remain true and faithful to God when put to the most severe test, the Devil claiming that he could cause all men to curse God to his face. (Job 2:5) God could have ignored that challenge, but had he done so the question of Jehovah’s supremacy and unlimited power might not have been settled in the minds of other creatures. God accepted the challenge and suspended the execution of the judgment against Satan in order to give the Devil the full opportunity</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">to prove his wicked challenge and then to have God’s power demonstrated against that wicked one and, before so doing, to have Jehovah’s name proclaimed throughout the earth.—Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> A host of angels joined the Devil in his rebellion against Jehovah God, and they too were sentenced to death, but the execution thereof has been withheld until God’s due time to destroy those adversaries. Awaiting tl at day, the Lord degraded that host of wicked angels by holding them away from the light of his purpose and by keeping them in the darkness. “The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished.’’ (2 Pet. 2:4-9) All of those wicked angels are adversaries of God and of righteousness. That host of rebellious ones later seduced “the sons of God’’, that is to say, angels who are on the side of Jehovah and of his organization. The Scriptures disclose that those “sons of God” were seduced or turned aside from the path of righteousness by fraud, practiced upon them by Satan and the demons, in this manner, to wit: Many persons, male and female, were in the earth who were the offspring of Adam; they were more nearly perfect than those now on the earth, and therefore the women necessarily were more beautiful to the natural eye and pleasant to look upon. The “sons of God” had power to materialize in human form and would necessarily materialize as handsome men. They were no part of Satan’s crowd, but Satan hit upon a scheme to entrap them and to bring further reproach upon the name of the Almighty God. The Devil had used Eve to start the trouble in Eden, and now he would again resort to fraud in the use of women to bring about more trouble and reproach upon God’s name. Satan’s wicked allies also had power to materialize in human form, and they did so appear in the earth as “giants” or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">nephilim.</span><span class="font3"> They, together with the Devil, fraudulently represented to the materialized “sons of God” that they could take those beautiful women for wives and rear up a superior race of people. Their real purpose, however, was to carry out Satan’s wicked challenge to turn all creation against God. It is written in the Scriptures concerning this matter: “The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men, which were of old, men of renown. ’ ’—Gen. 6: 2, 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">• The offspring of that union between the materialized sons of God and the female descendants of Adam was a class of “mighty men”, “men of renown,” all of whom became grossly wicked, being developed under the tutelage of Satan and the wicked, rebellious angels, the nephilim. Of all creatures on earth at that time only Noah was perfect in his generation and stood firm and maintained his integrity toward God. The wickedness in the earth was very great, and it appeared that Satan was gathering most of earthly creation on his side: “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them: and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.”— Gen. 6: 5,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>1</sup> Only the creatures of flesh were destroyed in the flood, Satan and all of his wicked angelic host being permitted to continue in existence and to put forth their best endeavors to carry out Satan’s wicked challenge to turn all men away from God. Those angels or spirit creatures that joined Satan in his rebellion are like the Devil, maliciously wicked, that is to say, fatally bent on doing injury to others and reproaching God. They are all the adversaries of God and of all men who attempt to serve the Almighty God. Those wicked angels are yet alive and active in opposition to God and to all vho serve him. Concerning that wicked host it is written: “And with covetousness they will make gain of you with deceitful words; whose judgment of old [now from of old (A..R.V.)] does not linger, and their destruction does not slumber.” (2 Pet. 2:3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font3"> Those words of the apostle apply at the end of the world, and, since the end of the world is here, the execution of that wicked crowd will soon take place. In the meantime all of those wicked adversaries are desperately fighting against God by attempting to destroy the human race, and particularly those human creatures who take their stand on the side of God and Christ and put forth their best endeavors to maintain their integrity. Before their rebellion the estate of those angels- was in God’s organization, forming a part thereof. When they joined the Devil in rebellion they cut themselves off, and therefore, as it is written, they “kept not their first estate”. They departed from the Lord and turned to wickedness. “And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness, unto the judgment of the great day.”—Jude 6.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> It appears that that wicked host know that it is God’s purpose to destroy them, and therefore they and the Devil continue to fight against God and all who are on the side of Jehovah. Those wicked spirit creatures have been active since the flood, within the bounds to which they are limited. They were active when Jesus was on the earth, and when he rebuked them they replied: ‘And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil; and he cried out with a loud voice. Ah! what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.’ (Luke 4:33,34, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.;</span><span class="font3"> Matt. 8:29) It is this invisible host that the apostle mentions as the adversaries of those who are serving God and his kingdom now.—Eph. 6:12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VISIBLE ORGANISATION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> Within a short time after the flood, and when the human race began to multiply, Satan brought into existence the visible or earthly part of his organization. Nimrod was made an object of adoration and worship, and this that God’s name might be further reproached. (Gen. 10:8-10) It was at this point in the history of man that the Devil brought religion prominently to the fore. From the time of the flood until now every people and nation on the earth have had and practiced some kind of religion, all of which religion and religious practices has brought reproach upon the name of Almighty God and turned great hosts of persons against Jehovah and his kingdom. It was the religious desire in the mind of Eve, planted there by the Devil, that she might have knowledge and wisdom of things equal to God, that led her into disobedience; and from then till now religion has been the chief earthly instrument employed by Satan to war upon Jehovah and his people. When God sentenced Adam to death, amongst other things he said to the old Serpent, the Devil, as it is written: ‘ ‘ And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.”—Gen. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> ‘‘The woman,” as there used, means God’s organization; and ‘the seed of the Serpent’ means the offspring of the Devil’s ‘‘woman”, that is, of the Devil’s organization, symbolized by a woman, and of which seed Satan is the father. The seed of Satan has therefore ever been the enemy of God and righteous creatures. The wicked seed or organization of Satan embraces the host of wicked angels. The chief part of the Devil’s seed which is earthly is religion and religious organizations, which are operated by Satan to oppose God, and all of which tend to turn men away from God and to the worship of creatures or things. Religion has at all times been the binding tie that has held together the political and commercial traffickers and the military elements of the nations of the earth. Satan the Devil has builded great world powers of which he has been and is the invisible overlord or god. For this reason Jesus spoke of him as the “prince of this world”, meaning the invisible ruler of this world who was always opposed to God and Christ Jesus. (John 14: 30) As the invisible ruler of darkness Satan the Devil is the god of this world, and is so designated in the Scriptures. (2 Cor. 4:4) He makes it his business to blind men to the truth, that they may not serve God. Without a doubt, in the invisible part of Satan’s organization there are divisions or principalities, over which certain of the demons operate as the principal ones and hence rule a principality, and each principality exercises power over nations of the earth. (Dan. 10:13) It is therefore Satan the Devil, his invisible principalities, his powers and his wicked princes or rulers, including all the wicked hosts and also including all the wicked agencies on the earth, which now constitute the adversaries or enemies of God and of a' who are on the side of God and for his kingdom. All those wicked hosts once had access to heaven, but since the coming of the Lord Jesus both they and Satan have been cast down to the earth and confine their operations to the earth, working particularly with the earthly division of his organization and against those on the earth who serve God and his kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ACTIVITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> The Devil and his angels have been active from the time of the rebellion at Eden until now, and will continue active until their destruction at Armageddon. As Satan “that old Serpent” is the arch deceiver, also all his wicked angels are deceivers, and the undisputed evidence shows that they continue to deceive men. They operate by gaining control of the mind of man and thereby compel or lead man to commit wrongful acts. When one undertakes to serve Almighty God and thereafter becomes unfaithful, he is easily a victim for those wicked spirit creatures. A striking example is that recorded concerning Saul, who was selected as the first king of Israel. The Israelites asked to have a king, and God yielded to their demands and permitted them to have Saul. The Almighty God gave a specific command to Saul that he must perform a certain duty, and Saul, although attempting it, deliberately failed, and because thereof he fell into the snare of the Devil and his wicked angels. It is written in God’s Word: “The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall bo safe. ’ ’—Prov. 29: 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> When Saul the king was confronted by God’s faithful prophet Samuel, Saul said: “I have trail gressed the commandment of the Lord . . . because I feared the people, and obej’ed their voice.” (1 Sam. 15:24) Such is the unbreakable rule with men who fear other men and for that reason disobey God and fall into Satan's snare. The Lord God withdrew his favor and protection from Saul. Then the Devil and his angels got complete control of Saul’s mind and caused him to make numerous attempts thereafter to commit murder. Saul then sought out the witch of Endor, a medium through whom the wicked spirits communicated with human creatures, and Saul consulted that wicked one. “Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.” (1 Sam. 28:7) This is proof that witches and familiar spirits were and are enemies of God and man and that they gain control of the mind of man and turn men away from God. On that occasion the wicked spirit further de-ccived Saul by inducing him to believe that Samuel, who had lived previous to that time and died, was still alive. Samuel, being dead, could not communicate with anyone alive, but the wicked spirits induced Saul so to believe. (Eccl. 9: 5,10) In due time Saul died the enemy of God because he had feared man and had become unfaithful to God and had fallen away entirely to the Devil. (1 Sam. 28:7-20; 31:4,5) Witchcraft has been practiced from the time of Saul even to the present day. Covenant-breakers of this day are exactly in a condition similar to that of Saul.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WITCHCRAFT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> Witches are those creatures who yield themselves as instruments for use by the Devil and his angels and permit themselves to be employed as mediums for communication between wicked spirits and men on the earth. Witchcraft is of the Devil and is the fruit of rebellion. Satan the rebel invented witchcraft, and he and his wicked spiritual allies employ and practice witchcraft to deceive human creatures. When Saul had disobeyed God the prophet of the Lord said to Saul: “For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he hath- also rejected thee from being king.” —1 Sam. 15: 23.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> Saul had followed Satan’s course and had rebelled against God’s commandment and committed the sin of witchcraft. Furthermore God’s law expressly prohibited the practice of witchcraft because it is of the Devil: “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.” (Ex. 22:18) “There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.”—Deut. 18:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>15</sup> The practice of witchcraft has been carried on for ages and is practiced to this very day. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries a great wave of witchcraft swept over Europe and America. Many persons were tormented by the witches, who represented and acted for the wicked spirits, and particularly in England and Scotland there were many hideous scenes of witch torture and extermination. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font3"> Vol. 29, page 431) In the early days of the American colonics strenuous laws were enacted against the practice of witchcraft. Every American familiar with history knows of the Salem (Massachusetts) witchcraft. The witches, under the influence and control of the Devil and the wicked angels aforementioned, claimed that they were able to ride through thin air on broomsticks, on pokers, or on animals, which, of course, is a physical impossibility. Deluded persons yielded themselves to the Devil and his angels and convinced themselves, no doubt, that they could do such things.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> As another striking example, in this very year (1937) in Russia there have been a number of men tried, convicted and executed for the crime of treason after having confessed to the commission of that crime and the performance of acts of which they could not possibly have been guilty. Those men came into court and pleaded guilty, knowing that their punishment would be death. They recited before the court acts performed by them in accomplishing the alleged crime that they could not under any circumstances have performed. They claimed to have traveled, for instance, from Moscow to Oslo, Norway, by airplanes, the number and description of which they gave, and which airplanes never were in existence. The confession and testimony of those men, and their pleas of guilt, and their execution upon their own statements, have greatly mystified people all over the world, and the public press and radio speakers have repeatedly been asked to state the reason therefor, and all have failed to state the reason because they have either deliberately ignored or are totally ignorant of the Word of God. Those men of Russia, who thus pleaded guilty and were executed, were, without a question of doubt, victims who had fallen under the control of the wicked angels and had pursued a course similar to that followed by King Saul when he fell under the wicked one’s influence. Those wicked angels injected into the minds of those poor men the delusion that they were guilty, and induced them to confess crimes of which they were entirely innocent.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> Another instance of the operation of those wicked spirits is this, to wit: On the night of February 27, 1933, the building of the German Reichstag was burned, and that opened the way for Hitler and his crowd to gain complete control of Germany, which they gained immediately thereafter. That crime of arson brought about exactly what the Nazis desired. The Nazis themselves burned the building and then laid the crime at the door of political foes, many of whom were arrested. A Hollander named Van der Lubbe, described by the press as a half-wit, was arrested, together with several Communists, and charged with the crime of burning the Reichstag. John Gunther, an American journalist, was present at and reported the trial of this man. In his book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Inside Ezirope</span><span class="font3"> are published the facts, and from which the following is quoted, to wit: “Van der Lubbe, a typical enough unfortunate by-product of modern civilization, was not only weak-minded; he had a deep grievance against society and authority, which his feeble brain sought to remedy by pyromania. He was a genuine arsonist. A homeless vagrant, wandering in the Berlin slums, he set several fires, and in his thick manner boasted about them. And Nazis heard him. The further facts revealed are that the Nazis had arranged for Van dcr Lubbe to be in the building with fire material so that they could make him appear as the guilty one. The fire that destroyed the building was the chemical fire set by the Nazis, who carried their material through the Goering tunnel, and timed it to go off at just that moment Van der Lubbe thought he set the fire. Lubbe retreated from the building in proud triumph and was arrested by the police, and that was what the Nazis had planned. Lubbe was an obvious victim of maniacal depressive psychosis.” Furthermore the authority above cited says: “The court was terrified every time Lubbe opened his mouth. ’ ’ Lubbe was put on the witness stand and admitted that he fired the building. He confessed to physical facts impossible for him to have committed. ‘ ‘ He was proud of his fire. He resented it deeply when anyone was put forward to share the credit of it. ’ ’ The public has been mystified about that fire since. What is the real explanation ? Without any question of doubt Van der Lubbe was the victim of the wicked spirits described afore, which wicked spirits had gained control of his mind and made him believe that he was the one who burned the building. Those wicked spirits produce insanity in anyone who yields to their influence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> There are numerous other instances of the operation of these wicked spirits in their attempt to seize control of the minds of men and plunge them into a desperate condition leading to destruction. Recently there has come an affliction upon the laboring element of the nations, and which is expressed in what is called “sit-down strikes”. Such has been a mystery to many persons, and is yet. The fact is that the same devilish crowd that operated the Nazis in Germany and conspired to have a weak-minded man to confess to a great crime likewise is operating upon the minds of men to produce a situation mystifying to the people and in an endeavor to bring about a destruction of the nations and the people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> From the time of the flood until now the Devil and his associated wicked spirits have been actively exercising power over men and nations. Just now, in the year 1937, that crowd of wicked spirits have gained a greater control over rulers and the people of the various nations than at any other time since the flood. Without any question of doubt the dictators in the various nations of the world today are under the influence of those wicked spirits. The object or purpose of those wicked ones is to carry out the Devil’s purpose from the beginning, which is to try to defame or reproach the name of Almighty God, and to turn the people away from Almighty God and to plunge them into destruction.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VISIBLE ENEMIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> The Devil and the host of wicked angels are invisible to human eyes, but they operate through visible creatures who are also the enemies of God and his kingdom. Religion, which originated with the Devil, makes fanatics of men. Strict obedience to God’s commandments keeps men sane. Religionists often become insane. Do not the faithful followers of Christ Jesus on earth engage in conflict with human creatures who are religionists? No. The words of the apostle, in the text first above quoted, show that this is not their conflict. Human creatures are employed as instruments of the Devil and the wicked angels, and used by them to war against the followers of Christ Jesus. Many of these visible ones do so ignorantly. Many religionists are moved by the spirit of malice, covetousness, envy and murder, while others follow along with them in wrongdoing, being overreached by the Devil and his agencies. As the Devil was “a murderer from the beginning”, so he has induced the commission of murder ever since, and it is the fanatical religionists that have a desire to murder those who are doing right. That is the reason why Catholic priests and members of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have a desire to see the servants of Almighty God and his kingdom killed. It is not unusual to see some Roman Catholic priest advocating the murder of others. As an example, a Catholic priest, who publishes the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Intermountain Catholic</span><span class="font3"> at Salt Lake City, Utah, editorially suggests (and doubtless for the purpose of inciting others to commit a crime) that ‘there would be a certain poetic justice in the act of impaling the body of Rutherford on tongs’. Also, the same editorial advises jail and the mob for such as are performing the service of Jehovah’s witnesses. To be sure, this is a subversive publication, but, since the enemy has control of this world, it goes on without challenge. It is certain that such murderous intent is due to the influence of Satan and the wicked angels operating on the mind of a fanatical religionist who desires to bring about the death of others who tell the truth concerning God and his kingdom and which truth exposes God’s adversaries. The same wicked ones even attempted to kill Jecus and did bring about his death through the operation of religionists. His faithful apostles suffered martyrdom at the hands of the same adversaries of God. Jesus told those religionists that opposed him and sought his death that they were of the Devil. (John 8: 40-44) This is proof that the invisible wicked host, the Devil and his host of rebellious angels, are the ones that fight against God and God’s people and all who serve Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> Would any true follower of Christ Jesus commit murder? Certainly not. A true Christian cannot even hate his brother without being guilty of murder in the sight of the Lord ■ and this shows that he is not fighting against visible creatures. (1 John 3:15) Does any true Christian desire to inflict bodily harm upon any Catholic priest or any other person? Certainly not. No good could result from that, and the Christian must do good and not do that which is wicked. A true follower of Christ Jesus has no desire to fight against any man or to do any bodily harm or injury to any person, be that person Catholic, Jew, Gentile or infidel. The infliction of bodily harm upon the wicked ones by Jehovah’s witnesses is no part of their Christian work, and they are specifically commanded to refrain from any such thing. The true follower of Christ Jesus is commanded to tell the truth and to leave all punishment to the Lord, who will render just recompense to the wicked in his own due time. (Rom. 12:17,19) The fact that religionists desire to do injury to and do inflict bodily punishment upon Jehovah’s witnesses is proof conclusive that such religionists are moved by the spirit of the Devil and his wicked angels. Hatred, ill will, and malice of one person against another open the door for the Devil and his wicked spirits to come in and take complete charge of the person who permits hatred, ill will or malice to dwell in his heart. The demons, swiftly taking advantage of that condition of mind and heart, seize the mind of the person in such condition and use the same as an instrument to fight against the followers of Christ-Jesus, and thus the human creature becomes an adversary of God and his people. This is one part of the warfare that the invisible host of the Devil carries on against God’s people in the earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;EVIL SERVANT”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> The Scriptures disclose a class of creatures designated “the man of sin ... , the son of perdition”. (2 Thess. 2: 3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.Ii.V.)</span><span class="font3"> That composite body is made up of men who have received some knowledge of God's purpose and have undertaken to serve God, and who claim to be the servants of God, but have turned themselves over to the Devil and permitted themselves to be used as his instruments. The chief part of that composite body is designated the “evil servant”, and is so described by the Lord Jesus Christ. Such are they that once made a covenant to do the will of God, and were looking for the kingdom of God under Christ and the second coming of Christ, and that made an open confession and declaration of being on the Lord’s side and on the side of his kingdom. They walked for a time with the faithful ones. At the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple, judgment there began at the house of God (1 Pet. 4:17) to determine who is of the right heart condition and who of the wrong condition of heart. (Mal. 3:1-3; Matt. 25:26,30-33) At the beginning of that judgment all of the consecrated stood equal before the Lord and were gathered before the Lord for judgment. Those of a pure heart condition at that judgment arc approved by the Lord and gathered into the temple, and these have their minds illuminated and their hearts filled with joy. They put self and selfishness clear out of the way, and their devotion is wholly to the Lord and his kingdom. Those of an impure heart condition do not receive approval at this judgment, but rather disapproval, and they stand on the outside and for some time claim to walk with the faithful, and still claim to be children of God. Then their bad heart condition makes itself manifest. Being outside of the temple, they are denied the light of the temple, to be sure, because of their blindness or lack of understanding, and because </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font3">the selfishness in yielding to the influence of the invisible rulers of this wicked world, and they manifest their wicked heart condition ■ and those are designated by the Lord Jesus as “that evil servant”. The words of the Lord Jesus Christ and the physical facts clearly identify that “evil servant” class. Concerning them Jesus says: “But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken: the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”—Matt. 24:48-51.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> It is clear, therefore, that the “evil servant” falls under the power and influence of Satan and the demons and becomes a part of the wicked organization and the enemies of the Lord God and his kingdom, and thereafter the Devil uses the “evil servant” to make war upon the faithful servants of the Lord. Before anyone can become a servant of the Lord he must be cleansed by the blood of Christ, and when that person becomes a part of the “evil servant” the demons have control of him and he is entirely unclean, and he is in a far worse state and condition than he ever was before. Concerning this Jesus says: “When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house, whence </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">came out. And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished. Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. ’ ’—Luke 11: 24-26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> A person once having a measure of the truth and then losing the light and turning to the Devil becomes the worst amongst the human agencies that are used by the Devil and that fight, against the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. Concerning such it is written: “For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. He that despised Moses’ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace? For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.”—Heb. 10:26-31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> Judas Iscariot was a striking example and type of the “evil servant”. For three and one-half years he claimed to be the servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, and then the Devil got control of his mind and heart and Judas betrayed Jesus into the hands of the enemy Satan, who, operating through religionists, brought about the murder of Christ Jesus. (John 13:2,27) Judas had pretended to believe that Jesus is The Christ, but manifestly he did not believe that Christ was present; otherwise he would not have yielded to the Devil. While he walked with Jesus there must have been a doubt in his mind that Jesus was the Christ. There was covetousness in his heart, ill feeling toward the Lord and his brethren, and that opened the door for the Devil to come in and take possession of him. The “evil servant” class first claims the presence of the Lord and so declares it, but manifestly those who compose that class do not sincerely and truly believe in the second presence of the Lord. They were professing the presence of the Lord at the temple judgment. Because of their impure heart, and being set to the side, then said they: ‘The Lord delayeth his coming’; and thereby they deny the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, and quickly join the enemies of God and begin the persecution of God’s faithful people. First they speak evilly of them, and then attempt to bring about their injury and destruction. The “evil servant” and the “man of sin” belong to the same company or class, but the “evil servant” is the most reprehensible of the entire company “the man of sin ’ ’. Such receive first the fundamental truths of God’s purpose, but they do not receive the love of the truth and hence they perish. (2 Thess. 2:10) The “evil servant” becomes insane and no longer possesses the spirit of a sound mind. They become “vessels of wrath” fit only for destruction.—Rom. 9:22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COVETOUSNESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> What causes one who starts on the way of serving God to later fall away? Lucifer was the first of that class, and it is written of him that covetousness was the cause of his rebellion and downfall. (Jer. 51:13) All who follow after Lucifer get into the same wicked condition. God directed that those who should be the rulers of men, holding prominent places amongst the Israelites, should be “such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness”. (Ex. 18: 21) The man who fears God will not covet that which God has committed to another, because he will not presumptuously attempt to get what has not been assigned to him, knowing that God hates such. “He that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.”—Prov. 28:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> Concerning the religionists (which includes those of the “evil servant” and those of the “elective elder” or ambitious spirit) it is written: “For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.” (Jer. 6:13) “And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them; for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart gocth after their covetousness.”—Ezek. 33:31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> About the same matter Jesus said: “Take heed, and beware of covetousness.” (Luke 12:15) No man can take unto himself the place of honor in God’s organization, because it is God who assigns each man to his place. “But now hath God set the members every one of them in 1he body, as it hath pleased him.” (1 Cor. 12:18) “And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.” (Heb. 5:4) One who claims to be a servant of God and who sees another in a position which he ambitiously desires to fill that he might shine and who, moved by this spirit, says: “That man will die soon and then I will succeed him and do a great work,” that man who thus states is moved by covetousness. One who has that spirit or desire in his mind or heart has fallen under the influence of Satan and the demons, and in due time that person will become the open enemy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gc-j.</span><span class="font3"> of Christ Jesus, and of his kingdom. He does not fear God, and no one can make progress and be pleasing to God who does not fear the Most High. It is such covetous persons that the Devil seizes upon and employs as his visible instruments to make war on the remnant of her seed, who have the testimony of Jesus Christ, and who obey the commandments of God’. (Rev. 12:17) Covetousness is the worst type of selfishness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Another description of the same instrument of Satan, and described in connection with the rebellious demons, is given by Jude, and which statement enables others to identify this class: “And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains, under darkness, unto the judgment of the great day. Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities. But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute boasts, in those things they corrupt themselves. These arc mur-murers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men’s persons in admiration because of advantage. How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the spirit.’’-Jude 6.8,10.16,18,19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Such visible enemies of God war against God’s people, and these arc not the ones against whom the Lord’s faithful on earth are commanded to rise up and fight. It is not these with whom controversies should be had. On the contrary, they are to be avoided. Those of the “evil servant” class employ soft speech and smooth words to beguile and deceive others who are seeking the truth. Concerning such the apostle, under the Lord’s direction, wrote: “Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.”—Rom. 16:17,18.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> Those visible enemies of God and his people are mere tools or instruments of the unseen principalities, powers and wicked rulers that control this wicked world. Many of the political, judicial and military rulers of this world are enemies of God and of the ‘‘faithful servant” class, but they are less reprehensible because of their lack of knowledge. The clergy are more reprehensible than the political element because they claim to be servants of God and they should know better than to fight against any person who is serving the Lord. But the most reprehensible of all is the ‘‘evil servant” class, beeause of having undertaken to be the servant of God and Christ and then openly repudiating the Lord and turning to the Devil. They become the chief part of the ‘ ‘ man of sin ..., the son of perdition”, and it is by their course of action that they identify themselves as to whether they are the servants of the Devil or not. ‘‘Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?”—Rom. 6:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NOT SHAKEN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> These are the “last days”, and therefore perilous times. This every one of God’s faithful children now well knows. (2 Tim. 3:1-5) The unseen enemies are very active and use the visible instruments, particularly the religionists, in every possible way to make war upon the people of God. One who is supposed to be a servant of God, and who suddenly turns about and begins a vicious assault upon those who do serve the Lord and his kingdom, causes a surprise to those who are not fully fortified in the Lord. But none of the Lord’s people, however need be disturbed or trouble themselves concerning the course of those wicked ones. No man can succeed in doing any injury to the truth, nor can he shake anyone who is really fully devoted to God and his kingdom. The truth is eternal and shall firmly stand for ever, and all who are really of the truth will stand by the Lord and hear and obey his voice. God’s Word is true, and if we have full confidence in God we know that all things shall work together for good to those who love God and who are called according to his purpose. (Rom. 8:28; 2 Cor. 13:8) &quot;Will not the circulation of wicked reports against God’s organization and those who are his servants shake some of the Lord’s people? If they can be shaken, yes; but those who really love God cannot be shaken. The Lord could prevent the activity of the instruments of the Devil and the circulation of evil reports, if that were for the best. But the present is the time when all things that can be shaken will be shaken, so that the approved ones may clearly appear. (Heb. 12:27) Addressing the faithful remnant concerning the second coming of Christ, and the gathering of the faithful ones to the temple, and the appearing of the “man of sin”, the inspired apostle says: “Be not . . . shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word.” (2 Thess. 2:2) Regardless of what the wicked may do, they cannot separate from God and Christ those who truly love and serve him and his kingdom.—Rom. 8: 36-39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> We know that we are in the war and that the enemy is desperately striving to destroy all who are on the Lord’s side. We are not at all ignorant of the devices of the Devil, provided we have studied the Lord’s Word. From every side we see the enemy’s forces advancing against us and working every possible scheme against the people of God, but this should not disturb those who love the Lord. To be forewarned is to be forearmed. When we know we have a fight and expect the assault of an enemy, our trust and full confidence should be in the Lord, and we should not permit ourselves to be disturbed by enemies: ‘ ‘ Fret not thyself because of evil doers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.” (Ps. 37:1) Do not permit yourself to become bitter or have hatred and ill will or desire to do bodily injury to any of the workers of iniquity. The Lord will take care of them in his own due time and good way. Let those who love the Lord trust in him, knowing that he. will bring about the result according to his will. “Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself beeause of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. For evil doers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth. The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth. The Lord shall laugh at him; for he seeth that his day is coming. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the Lord upholdeth the righteous.” (Ps. 37 :7-9,12,13,17) “Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the wicked; for there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out. My son, fear thou the Lord and the king; and meddle not with them that are given to change.” —Prov. 24:19-21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FORTRESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>34</sup> Go'l’s children know that they have no power within themselves to withstand the assault of the enemies, but they know also that they have a strong fortress that cannot be shaken and by abiding therein they shall be safe. It was for their comfort and benefit that this was written, to wit: “The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. ’ ’—Ps. 18: 2, 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> Suppose the name and reputation of all God’s children should be trampled in the mire and they be made to appear in the eyes of others as wicked lawbreakers and as corrupt. The enemy can do that, but that amounts to nothing in the sight of the Lord. The reputation of God’s people amongst men is of no importance. Their standing with the Lord Jehovah and Christ Jesus is all-important. Jesus made himself of no reputation. What others think about us need not disturb us in the least. Every servant must stand or fall to his own master. If we are faithfully trusting and serving God, he will make us to stand: “Who art thou that judgcst another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up ; for God is able to make him stand.”—Rom. 14:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>36</sup> Are all of God’s people the objects of assault by the Devil and his demons and his other instruments? Yes, to be sure; because such are the ones that make war upon the anointed of the Lord. How, then, are we to find protection and be assured that we are safe ? Jehovah answers that question: “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.” (Ps. 34:7) Those who fear God will stand firmly on his side, and all such will receive the protection which God has provided. Those of the “evil servant” do not fear God; otherwise they would not assault those whom they know God has given a place in his service. One who fears the Lord God fears to disobey his commandments, but that person does not fear any creature nor any of the Devil’s crowd. To his servants Jehovah says: “Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. ’ ’—Isa. 8:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>37</sup> Everything that is against God and his kingdom we should avoid, and what God hates we should hate, because it is against God and against his kingdom. Any person who attempts to cause division in the ranks of God’s organization, whether that person claims to be in the truth or not, because he is a disturber he should be avoided. There is no time nor reason to engage such a one in controversy. (Rom. 16:17,18) We do not need to engage in argument with the enemies of God and waste time on them. We know from an abundance of evidence that the Lord Jesus is present at the temple of God, and it is useless to argue with those who dispute that truth. The ones outside of the temple cannot understand it. The revelation and unfolding of the prophecies given to God’s people in the last five years has furnished an abundance of proof that the Lord is present at the temple, and all those who are of the temple show forth his praises and find no time to indulge in vicious assaults upon others. (Ps. 29:9) Let the “evil servant” class follow their chosen course, and let those who love the Lord get on with his work in doing what the Lord has commanded to be done. The wicked spirits or demons, including Satan and Gog (Ezek. 38:1-16), •will employ every possible means to bring about the destruction of God’s faithful servant, but if we fear the Lord and are diligent to obey him, we are safe. If we observe others doing despite to the commandments of God and attempting to work injury upon God's people and his kingdom, shall we not be angry against such? We may properly be righteously indignant against all unrighteousness, but it is not the prerogative of ours to apply the rule of retaliation against evildoers. Says the scripture: “Be ye angry, and sin not.” (Eph. 4:26) A hatred and malice toward the evildoers, and a desire to do them bodily injury, would be sin, but to hate die wrong and let the wrongdoers take their own course is a different thing entirely. Vengeance belongs to the Lord, he will repay, and it is not the business of any Christian to mete out punishment to another; and the one who does so is certain to fall under the influence of the Devil and his demons. Remember that Jehovah has said: “Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord.” (Heb. 10:30; Deut. 32: 35, 36) The one who loves the Lord will not permit anger, hatred, or ill will toward another to have a place in his heart, because by so doing he opens the door and leaves it open and invites the adversaries of God, the demons, to come in and take possession. Instead of being disturbed in mind and permitting ourselves to become incensed at others, we must keep in mind the admonition given to God’s people: ‘ ‘ Let us watch and be sober. But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.” (1 Thess. 5:6,8) Now we are in a war when we are commanded to rise up against the enemy: “Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.” (1 Pet. 1:13) “But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto praj’er.” (1 Pet. 4:7) “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.” (1 Pet. 5:8) Knowing that we are surrounded everywhere by enemies, and therefore all in grrat danger, God’s devoted people should trust him implicitly and obey his commandments. If we fear God we will obey his commandments, and to such God gives his sure word that they shall be shielded and protected. Those who are of the temple of God and abide there and obey his commandments arc certain to abide in safety. “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge, and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust; his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation, there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.”—Ps. 91:1-4,9-11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE FIGHT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>88</sup> Since God commands his faithful witnesses to ‘rise against her in war’, does not that mean that we must fight? Yes, to be sure, that is the meaning. Our part in the fight, however, must be strictly in accord with the rules and commandments of the Lord, and not according to the rules of the wicked one. The enemies attempt to kill and destroy creatures, and particularly those who serve God, and they carry on their fight by the use of carnal or deadly weapons. That is-not the course to be taken by the Christian. The true Christian would not do bodily injury to any man. The Christian adheres fully to the rules of the Lord and is always in favor of freedom of speech, that everyone who has a say should be permitted to say so, but let the Lord be the Judge and let those who have the ear' to hear the truth, hear. The weapon of warfare which Christians are commanded to use, and the only weapon the Christian properly uses, is the Word of God, ‘‘the sword of the spirit.” (Eph. 6:17) Not only is that a weapon of defense, but now it is positively a weapon of offense with which the Christian makes the assault. The Christian is commanded to arise against her, that is, the Devil’s organization, and use his weapon, the Word of God, with telling effect against the enemy and to do so fearlessly and boldly. (1 John 4:17,18) Jehovah’s witnesses have no desire to do injury to any person because he is a Catholic or is connected with the Catholic organization. The desire of Jehovah’s witnesses, in obedience to God’s commandment, is to do good to all persons and to use their best endeavors to help them to see and understand the truth. It seems quite probable that the greater number of those who will form the ‘ ‘ great multitude” (Rev. 7 : 9-17) are within the Catholic organization or under the Catholic organization. Hany of the Catholic population are sincere and desire to know the Lord, but have had no opportunity. That organization, ruled by the Hierarchy, however, is entrenched in a stronghold which the Devil has provided, and by attacking that stronghold with the ‘‘sword of the spirit” the stronghold is greatly weakened. Says the Word of God concerning those who are servants of God and his kingdom: ‘‘For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh ; (for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.” —2 Cor. 10: 3-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>89</sup> It is the Word of God, the sword of the spirit, which is now being wielded with telling effect against the stronghold of the Roman Catholic organization, and that religious system is terribly shaken. That stronghold is entrenched lies behind which the workers of iniquity hide, and it is the Word of God that sweeps away that hiding place of lies and opens the doorway for honest persons to see how they may take their stand on the side of God and find a place of sure habitation. What is the purpose of Jehovah’s witnesses’ having a part in this fight? It is to declare the name and purpose of the Almighty God, that the people may be warned to flee from the wicked organization of the Devil before God exercises his great power against the wicked workers. For this reason the faithful witnesses of Jehovah engage in this warfare with real joy, because their work, if faithfully done, results in good to those who love righteousness and results to the honor and vindication of Jehovah’s holy name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>40</sup> Jehovah graciously permits his anointed witnesses and their companions to locate and properly identify the enemies. Now, by his grace, they clearly sec that the Devil is the arch enemy; that his chief operative agent in wickedness is Gog, and that with him is a host of wicked spirits who rebelled in the beginning, and all of which abide in a place called Magog (Ezek. 38:1-16; 39:1-6); that for centuries that wicked crowd have preyed upon the human race and ruled the peoples of earth with a cruel hand and scorned everything that is good; that for centuries the Devil has employed religion and religious practitioners to deceive the people and to turn them away from God; that God lies not interfered until his due time to interfere; that now is the due time for God to interfere, and he is doing so; that he has enthroned his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, and sent him forth to rule and to destroy the wicked, and that before the execution of the wicked takes place God commands that his name shall be declared throughout all the earth, and this must be done by his witnesses. Jehovah has selected out from the world a people for his name (Acts 15:14), and these constitute his witnesses to declare his name; and he sends them forth under the command of the Lord Jesus, and their part in the warfare is to wield his Word, the sword of the spirit, and to keep on doing it until the work is done. Knowing that the enemy is desperately fighting, no one who is on the Lord’s side, truly and sincerely, will be disturbed, regardless of what comes to pass. The Devil brings into action all his invisible forces, particularly the wicked and rebellious angels, to make war on the witnesses of Jehovah, and then uses his visible instruments, many of whom are insane, to attempt to bring about the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses. (Rev. 12:17) Ti e wicked spirits invade the mind of those who are proud, covetous, ambitious, and who fail to control themselves, and who permit ill will or hatred and malice to abide in them, and, thus invading their minds, seize such creatures and use them as instruments to make war upon the servants of the Most High. Religious leaders, and particularly the “evil servant” class, constitute the “man of sin , the son of perdition”, that arrogantly assumes a high position and claims that they are mighty ones; and all of those wicked ones fight against God and against his servants. The time has come, therefore, when God commands his faithful ones to boldly go forward and to ‘arise against her to battle’, and all his invisible forces are likewise arrayed in battle against the enemy. All the faithful now will arise and use the sword of the spirit in making a vigorous assault upon the enemy’s stronghold, which stronghold is religion. By proclaiming the truth they expose to the people the hypocrisy and duplicity that has been practiced upon them by the Devil and his religious agents, and which enables the people to gain freedom in Christ. The assault now being made upon the enemy is shaking the enemy’s stronghold, and soon the Lord will completely demolish that stronghold by and through Christ Jesus. The great battle of Armageddon will bring about the destruction of wickedness and the honor of God’s holy name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ARMOR</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>41</sup> This is not a sham battle, but is a real fight; and the children of God now on earth engaging in this war must have on the warrior’s armor. It must be an armor furnished by the Lord. The apostle uses the armor of an earthly warrior as a symbol of the armor which the Lord has prepared for those that love and serve him. Seeing that we are engaged in this warfare, the admonition is given to God’s children, to wit: “Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having done all, to stand.” (Eph. 6:13) Having taken our stand on the side of God and his kingdom, now let us stand firm and quit ourselves like men fully matured in Christ Jesus. In order that those who have taken their stand on the side of the Lord may remain firm and maintain their integrity and engage successfully in this fight, performing the part assigned to them, the apostle tells them what they must do: “Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness. ’ ’ (Eph. 6:14) The girt around the loins symbolically says: ‘I am a servant of the Almighty God and Christ Jesus, and my girt of servitude is that of the truth.’ In the breast is situate the heart, and the breastplate of righteousness means the proper keeping or shielding of the heart. Therefore the admonition is, “Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.” (Prov. 4:23) Those who stand firm now must see to it that they are unselfish, that their motive is pure toward God and toward man; otherwise they cannot stand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>42</sup> God’s warriors, that is to say, his witnesses now on the earth engaged in this warfare, were foreshadowed by Gideon’s army. These soldiers of the Lord must be on their feet and on the march; therefore the admonition: “And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace.” (Eph. 6:15) Peace must now be the condition among God’s'people. If there is strife, faultfinding, backbiting or fighting in the company, that is evidence that the demons are exercising influence over some of the company, and those who are causing the strife are going to lose out unless they quickly amend their course of action. This is the time of unity in Christ, when all must stand firmly united together. (Eph. 4:13) They must all present a solid, united front, fighting shoulder to shoulder, against the enemy and for the common cause of righteousness. (Phil. 1: 27, 28) Let everyone who is of the temple see to it that he abides entirely in peace with his brethren; otherwise he will not remain in the temple. Those who do not dwell in peace are certain to be cast out. Now is the time when the words of God’s prophet apply specifically to those who, by his grace, have been brought into the temple or house of the Lord, to wit: “I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord. Our feet shall stand within thy gates, 0 Jerusalem. Jerusalem [God’s organization] is builded as a city that is compact together. ’ ’—Ps. 122:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>43</sup> It is the time of judgment, when the great antitypical David is on the throne of judgment and when those of the temple class or the house of the Lord are admonished to “pray for the peace of Jerusalem [God’s organization]: they shall prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good.” (Ps. 122: 6-9) It is the love of Christ that holds them together and enables them to march forward in one solid mass against the enemy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> The fiery darts of the enemy are striking from every direction; and to prevent them from piercing the armor of Jehovah’s witnesses these faithful ones must have a shield, and that shield is faith: “Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.” —Eph. 6:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>45</sup> The importance of this part of the armor is emphasized. To have faith, one must fully believe in and trust Jehovah God and his Word and follow and obey God’s commandments, as Jesus does. To have faith, one must have a knowledge of God’s Word, and an understanding mind, and then confidently rely upon his Word and refuse to be disturbed or turned aside by any teaching or theory of man. Having engaged in the fight under the command and banner of the Lord, these must remain true, firm and faithful unto death. The faithful know that, regardless of what the enemy may do against them, no harm can come to those who abide in the Lord and remain faithfully and joyfully in his service to the last. Against such the darts of the wicked are harmless, because they cannot pierce the breastplate of righteousness, that is, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">pure and unselfish heart.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>46</sup> In </span><span class="font3">order to have faith and abide in faith and faithful, one must have a knowledge and an understanding of the Word and of his relationship to the Lord; therefore the admonition: “And take the helmet of salvation.” Salvation depends upon one’s understanding and relying upon the Lord and not upon any object or thing. The helmet symbolically represents the head or mind, which must feed upon the Word of God. Some foolishly conclude that they learned the truth years ago and do not need to study the Word of God </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">these days; and such are almost certain to fail. God reveals his truth in his own due time, as his people need it. He is now unfolding his prophecies, that his people on earth may have greater comfort and strengthened hope. (Rom. 15:4) Such revealed truths must be carefully studied, that we may have an intellectual conception of the same, and which enables us to have </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">proper understanding, that is, of our proper relationship to God and to his King. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower, </span><span class="font3">by the Lord’s grace, publishes the truth, and all the publications thereof should be studied in connection with the Word of God, because it is the Bible, the Word of God, which proves whether or not we are pursuing the right course. Theories of men are of no </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">value, </span><span class="font3">but, on the contrary, such theories make the Word of God of none effect. God’s people not only must avoid religion and all teachings based upon the tradition of men, but must fight against it now and proclaim the truth, that others may have an opportunity to learn the truth and flee to the Most High and his King. God provides the Watch Tower publications for those who love him, and these, together with the Bible, upon which such publications are based, point out the right way for the followers of Christ to go. By this means the Lord enables us to now identify and locate our enemies, that we may be prepared to meet them in successful combat.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>47</sup> The only weapon that God’s faithful representatives on earth arc commanded to use, and must use, is “the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God”. How can one properly use that weapon unless he familiarizes himself first with the weapon ? He must study the Word of God and then be diligent to obey what it says. That Word contains the commandments of Jehovah and the Lord Jesus Christ, the great Prophet, which now must be obeyed by those who are in his house and in his organization.—Acts 3: 23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>48</sup> The Lord then again emphasizes the necessity of complete unity in harmonious action by giving this further declaration, to wit: “Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.”—Eph. 6:18.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>40</sup> His people must pray for unity and peace amongst themselves. They are specifically admonished to pray for prosperity, and as the fight grows with intensity they pray: ‘ ‘ Save now, I beseech thee, 0 Lord: 0 Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.” (Ps. 118:25) This means prosperity or advancement of the kingdom, and all must be in unity in order to look well to the kingdom interests. His faithful ones must and will avoid all covetousness, ill will and harsh criticism. They will give every one of the saints credit for doing his best and will pray that God’s people or sons may be made to do his will. Thus praying, God’s people can never fight each other, but always fight harmoniously together against the enemies of God and thus maintain their integrity toward the Most High. The fight is on. The victory is certain for God’s great Field Marshal, Christ Jesus, and those who are with him in this fight who are called, and chosen, and who continue faithful to the end, shall share with him in his victory and in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">IMPLICIT CONFIDENCE IN JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The enclosed resolution is self-explanatory. To pass it on to you, in harmony with the wishes of the Toronto company, is a real joy and pleasure, especially so at this time, when the enemy is seeking to come in like a flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The scripture says, ‘ ‘ The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib. ’ ’ It was through the Watch Tower publications I received a knowledge of the truth concerning the fundamental doctrines, and this despite the fact I had read the Bible from cover to cover several times. It is through the publications of the Society I have been privileged to have an understanding of the prophecies and to rightly divide the Word of truth. It is through the Watch Tower I have received other precious things far too numerous to mention. Sticking closely to the Lord’s channel I am but using the same intelligence as the ox or ass. I know where I am fed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Praying the Lord’s sustaining grace may guide and keep you, and with much Christian love, I am</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Robert McNaul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RESOLUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Almost a year has now passed since (under the Lord’s direction) as president of the Society you removed from office one W. F. Salter, to whom we had long looked for leadership in the service, but who had become unfaithful to his charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At that time some could not quite clearly see the reason for such action. We had, however, implicit confidence in Jehovah and that the steps there taken were under his direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Subsequent events not only have fully justified this faith and confidence in Jehovah, and yourself as the one used in this connection, but also have made clearly to appear why this action was necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Because of the fact that the Lord’s people are being, from this source, now subjected to a barrage of literature calculated to undermine and overthrow their faith, we, the Toronto company of Jehovah’s witnesses, at a joyous assembly on this the eighteenth day of April, nineteen hundred and thirty-seven, unanimously adopt the following resolution, to wit:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. That we fully endorse the action of our president, Brother Rutherford, in thus removing from office one who so manifestly had, by his course of action, said, “The table of the Lord is contemptible,’’ and who had “snuffed’’ at what is spread on that table, by ‘offering polluted bread upon the altar’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. That, as a means for our protection, we will meet this latest move of the enemy with</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(a) Increased activity and interest in the Lord’s service, especially in the new ‘strange work’ just beginning and also the studies in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and other publications of the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(b) That we will destroy without reading any such literature received through the mail or otherwise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(c) That we will turn a deaf ear to any, either among us or outside, who manifests a desire to debate or argue respecting this course of action.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">3. That we acknowledge as the visible organization of Jehovah on earth the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, and recognize the Society as the channel or instrument through which Jehovah and Christ Jesus give instruction and meat in due season to the household of faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">4. Further, that we pledge our faith in and loyalty to the Society and its servants, Brother Rutherford at Brooklyn, and also the branch servant, Brother Chapman at Toronto; that we are pleased and thankful for his appointment in charge of the Lord’s work in our midst. We wish to say that, the company following your instructions, woiking under the unit arrangement, and because of the zeal manifested by the blanch servant, Brother Chapman, never before has the intei est in and on behalf of the Lord’s work been so keenly aroused nor has there ever been such a manifestation of activity as now. W’e pledge our co-operation to the fullest extent with him in the work, and, together with you, pray that the Lord will smite His enemy to the dust and shine forth in Kingdom glory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">5. That we once more express our united determination to do the will of Jehovah as expressed through his executive officer, Christ Jesus. That, in obedience to God’s commandments, having heard the call, “Arise ye, and let us rise up against her in battle,’’ we will carry forth the fruits of the kingdom to our brethren, the great multitude, who must be led and fed by Christ Jesus before Armageddon and may be preserved at Armageddon in vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">6. That our great desire is to have you visit us at Toronto, and herewith extend to you a most cordial invitation to make this visit when your multitudinous duties will so permit.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Furthei, that a copy of this resolution be sent to Brother Rutherford by the servant of companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With much Christian love and best wishes, we are</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brethren and co-laborers in His service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Toronto company of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">P.S. Seldom, if ever, was such an expression of unity and loyalty to the Society as the Lord’s channel and yourself as president as that expressed by about twelve brethren speaking on this resolution, most of these having been in the truth and associated with the organization for over twenty years, and some over thirty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RICH BLESSINGS JEHOVAH HAS BESTOWED</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The eastern North Carolina division of Jehoxuh’s publishers in assembly at Raleigh, N.C., November 7 and 8, voted to extend to you an expression of loxc and deep appreciation of your bold and fearless stand for Jehoxah, and of our determination, by his grace, to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and all of Jehovah’s organization for the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We wish to express our thankfulness for the many rich blessings Jehovah has bestowed upon Ins people; for the unfolding of his prophecies; for the knowledge and understanding thereof; and for the privilege of bearing testimony concerning the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May the joy of the Lord be our strength as we lift high the banner of his kingdom, ever keeping in mind God’s command to his people now: “Let not thine hand be slack.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PHONOGRAPH EFFECTIVE: DESTROYS PREJUDICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah is to be praised! The Bay cities convention is a matter of history now, but, ah! the memory thereof will never be forgotten in the age to come. As the prophet Malachi said, “Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another; and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.” No doubt the many words of comfort and encouragement spoken by Jehovah’s honored servant and the joy augmented and blessings received by His witnesses are i ecorded in the book of remembrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Not a complaint nor murmur was to be heard among the conventioners. They came together for one purpose—to exalt the name of Jehovah. After hearing the Friday night lecture on the Memorial and also the one on Saturday afternoon, many of the conventioners expressed their great satisfaction and joy in understanding their relationship to Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Saturday night several brethren from Los Angeles gave some fine points regarding the use of the phonograph—what it is all about, how it is a gift from the Lord to be used with thankfulness to Jehovah for such an effective instrument in destroying prejudice, with whom it should be used, and, after interest is aroused in the minds of the people of good will, how to help them into God’s organization. Several hundred of the publishers indicated that they have phonographs and are using them, and more than five hundred brethren expressed their desire to obtain phonographs in the immediate future. They are beginning to realize the fact that the use of the phonograph is a very effective integral part of the witness work and they showed much enthusiasm regarding it and proved themselves to be very much sound-ininded. Many good points were made regarding the use of phonogiaphs in house-to-house, store-to-store, office-to-office, and also in back calls. Additionally, that when a phonogiaph is not in use it should bo placed conveniently in the front room ready for action. When a caller comes to the door, the witness opens tie door and says, “Come in. I am going to play a five-minute lecture entitled ‘ . . . ’, and will be pleased to have you listen to it.” Then introduce the books. Thus even those who are not able to go from house to house in the field service can have a share in the phonograph work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The witnesses of Jehovah are fully realizing the fact that we are at war with a very formidable enemy; that these are not the civilian days of yore, but «c are living in the days of Jehovah’s martial power, and that the fight is on and vciy shortly Jehovah will crush the enemy to the dust at Armageddon. However, just before the destruction, the Lord has given us several mighty instruments of destruction, such as the books and booklets, particularly the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font2"> and the booklets </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Protection,</span><span class="font2"> and with these, by the Lord's grace, we can put up a mighty fight against the appaiently invulnerable fortresses of the enemy; and under the withering barrage of fire of Jehovah's militant forces the refuge of lies even now is disintegrating and crumbling, and shortly will pass into oblivion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On Sunday afternoon at the public lecture there were more than six thousand listeners who gave very close attention and manifested their keen appreciation of the points made, by repeated applause. Of course, we cannot estimate the number of those in the unseen audience who heard the lecture over the radio stations on the Pacific coast from the Mexican intei-national line up to Canada. While the “Armageddon” lecture was being delivered in the Oakland Municipal Auditorium, a brother was rebroadcasting it on the auditorium grounds to about four hundred and fifty listeneis. The brethren of the companies of San Francisco and Oakland used almost eveiy avenue of publicity in order to adveitise the public lecture. One of the most unique methods of advertising was the “sandwich parade”, participated in by moie than five hundred bieth-ren. There was a small dog in the parade carrying a sign on its back announcing the public lecture on “Armageddon”. If all the dumb dogs of “Chiistendom” cannot know and appreciate the day of their visitation, the Lord can use a poodle dog </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font2">he used a jackass in the days of Balaam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font2">sincerely and witli deep gratitude thank Jehovah, our God, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font2">opening the heavenly portals and pounng out at this convention such blessings, the inemoiy of which will remain with </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">us </span><span class="font2">through the countless ages of eternity to the praise of Jehovah’s name. May Jehovah, onr Father, continue to richly bless you end use you bountifully in this woik of greatest importance, the vindication of vehovrJi's holy v.oid and name. I thank you much for permitting me to be at this convention. The brethren heard the lecture with absolute clarity, to their great joy and satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With much love and best wishes, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brother and fellow servant by Jehovah’s grace,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PHONOGRAPH DOING A WONDERFUL WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the close of this special period of testimony to the name and purposes of Jehovah and his Faithful Warrior, Christ Jesus, X feel called upon to express my deep appreciation of the privilege of serving him day and night in his temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Words seem inadequate to describe the joy and thankfulness in my heart in acknowledging the loving-kindness of our God. Surely if we prove Jehovah he does pour out upon us boundless blessings, such as we are not able to retain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While meditating on the unity in the Lord’s organization and realizing how profitable are the instructions and admonitions as they proceed through the proper channel, it occurred to me that many times certain questions arise in our minds and, before we ask, an article appears in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font2"> giving a direct answer to our questions. Surely this is one of the proofs we have that Jehovah and Christ Jesus are our teachers as is stated in Isaiah 30: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I take this occasion to thank you, Brother Rutherford, and all of the Bethel family for their loving co-operation in assisting the pioneers. Another cause for rejoicing is the letter in the April 1 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> regarding the activities of our brethren in Germany. After reading of the ternble persecutions in that country, it greatly strengthens us to know how the Lord sustains Ins people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And now a word about the local conditions. We are finding many sincere persons who are seeking the truth, especially of the Catholic population, and the phonograph is doing a wonderful work in presenting the message clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The convention in Newark aroused much inteiest and left a lasting impression upon the miuds of the people; even those who did not attend the lecture are asking many questions about the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. While witnessing in the business section we have had many interesting experiences. One young man, after subscribing for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font2"> said he would like to be one of Jehovah's witnesses but he didn’t think he was good enough. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May Jehovah bless and keep yon as you continue to lift high the banner of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yours in the service of Jehovah,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ruth Foster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SATAN HAS LOST OUT</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In reply to your kind letter of counsel which reached me at Memorial time, I have followed your advice, have gone to the brethren and have acknowledged my wrongful ideas regarding the survivors of Armageddon, and have received their hearty forgiveness; and I believe the Lord has fully forgiven me and reinstated me again in his favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I appreciate that the Lord’s chastening hand has been laid heavily upon me, as evident in my experiences; and your reference to Psalm 141: 5 is to the point in my case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am rejoicing in the fountain of mercy that Jehovah has uncovered in the three phonograph records on “Armageddon Survivors”, and am also rejoicing that Satan lias lost out in tins attempt to turn me aside from the Lord’s favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I have served for the past ten years as an auxiliary, and my earnest desire is to abide in Jehovah’s organization and to humble myself as wax under the mighty hand of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Witli love and appreciation to you, dear brother, for assisting me in the right way, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your brother and fellow witness,</span></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● The March 15, 1981, <em>Watchtower </em>made the point that ordination as a minister of God takes place at one’s baptism. How does this affect our view of those who are qualified to perform marriages?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In each state the requirements for performing marriages may differ somewhat. In some states, cities or communities, the marriage ceremony may be solemnized only by ministers who are duly registered by the local authorities. It is, therefore, essential to check locally to find out what legal requirements are necessary for performing marriages and to comply with them. Please do not write the Society for such information as we do not have such available for the various states, cities or communities in this country.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Because Christian marriage is a very serious and binding commitment made by two individuals before Jehovah, the marriage ceremony should be presided over by a well-qualified ordained minister who gives the marriage talk and solemnizes the marriage. Therefore, it is preferred that congregation elders, men well spoken of in the congregation, care for this responsibility in order that all things take place in proper order.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Information dealing with the marriage discourse, ceremony and approved vows is to be found in <a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:1969203/1-27$p/E:1969204/"><em>The Watchtower </em>of March 15, 1969, pages 174-179</a>, May 1, 1974, pages 274-277, March 15, 1977, pages 172-185 and <a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://p/E:101974361/1-36$p/E:101974362/"><em>Awake! </em>of May 22, 1974, pages 3-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Arrangements for the use of a Kingdom Hall for marriage should be approved by the body of elders of the congregation. Since the Scriptural direction is to marry “only in the Lord” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:39-46:7:39" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:39</a>), those performing marriages should refrain from solemnizing unequaled marriages, nor should such weddings be held at the Kingdom Hall. If there are any very unusual situations in this connection, it is best to write to the Society about the circumstances involved.</p>

Where Did the Devil Come From?
If God created everything, and everything he created is good, where did the Devil come from? God could not have made him, could he?
This question and many others are examined in The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. Already more than 100 million copies of this book have been printed. This makes it the most widely distributed publication in the Western world, aside from the Bible.
Please send me, postpaid, the 192-page book “The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life”. I enclose 60 cents (U.S.).

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">If God created everything, and everything he created is good, where did the Devil come from? God could not have made him, could he?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This question and many others are examined in <strong>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. </strong>Already more than 100 million copies of this book have been printed. This makes it the most widely distributed publication in the Western world, aside from the Bible.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send me, postpaid, the 192-page book “The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life”. I enclose 60 cents (U.S.).</p>

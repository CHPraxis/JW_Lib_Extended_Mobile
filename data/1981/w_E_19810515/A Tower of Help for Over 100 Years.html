<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Starting with a first-issue circulation of 6,000, <strong>The Watchtower </strong>has grown to become the most widely circulated religious magazine in the world. Over 200 million copies were printed last year in 106 languages.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The New Zealand evangelical newspaper “Challenge Weekly” commented: “The magazine is now published fortnightly in 9,200,000 copies every issue and is distributed from house-to-house by 2,200,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses . . .</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“It is very easy to criticise the work and efforts of others. But surely their example of commitment and dedication​—and use of the printed page—​should be a challenge to every committed Christian.”</p>

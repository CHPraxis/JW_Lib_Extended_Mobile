A Tower of Help for Over 100 Years
Starting with a first-issue circulation of 6,000, The Watchtower has grown to become the most widely circulated religious magazine in the world. Over 200 million copies were printed last year in 106 languages.
The New Zealand evangelical newspaper “Challenge Weekly” commented: “The magazine is now published fortnightly in 9,200,000 copies every issue and is distributed from house-to-house by 2,200,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses . . .
“It is very easy to criticise the work and efforts of others. But surely their example of commitment and dedication​—and use of the printed page—​should be a challenge to every committed Christian.”

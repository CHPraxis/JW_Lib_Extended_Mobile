<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 1. Why is there much confusion as to who God is?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">MAN’S need for God and his help has never been greater than now. Our lives depend upon knowing him. But, strangely enough, there is much confusion as to who he is, for today, as in the past, there are many gods worshiped in different lands. Yet the Bible makes clear that there is only one true God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:5-46:8:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 8:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 2. (a) Is “God” the personal name of the true God? (b) What is his personal name?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>To distinguish himself from the many false gods, the true God has given himself a personal name. This sets him apart from all others. “Is not ‘God’ his name?” some may ask. No, for “God” is merely a title, just as “President,” “King” and “Judge” are titles. God’s personal name is made known to us through his Word, the Bible, and that name is JEHOVAH. In many translations of the Bible this name is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a>, where we read (<em>AV</em>): “That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.” And in almost all translations the name is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:1-66:19:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 19:1-6</a> as part of the expression “Alleluia” or “Hallelujah.” This means “praise Jah” (a shortened form of Jehovah). <em>The Catholic Encyclopedia </em>(1910, Vol. VIII, p. 329) says of this Divine Name: “Jehovah, the proper name of God in the Old Testament.” <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>However, <em>The Jerusalem Bible, </em>a recent Catholic translation, regularly uses the name “Yahweh,” as do a number of other translations. Why is that?</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 3. (a) How is God’s name represented in the Hebrew Scriptures? (b) Why is it not possible to know exactly how God’s name was pronounced in Hebrew in ancient times?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>In Hebrew, the language in which the first thirty-nine books of the Bible (<em>AV</em>) were written, God’s name is represented thousands of times by four Hebrew letters, YHWH. In ancient times the Hebrew language was written without vowels, the reader supplying the vowels as he read the words. So, the problem is that today we have no way of knowing exactly which vowels the Hebrews used along with the consonants YHWH. Many scholars think the name was pronounced “Yahweh,” but the form “Jehovah” has been in use for many centuries and is most widely known.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 4. (a) How are clergymen who say we should not use God’s name because we do not know its exact pronunciation inconsistent? (b) What is far more important than how we pronounce God’s name?

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Because there is uncertainty as to the exact pronunciation of God’s personal name, some clergymen say you should not use it at all, but instead simply say “God” or “the Lord.” However, they do not insist that you should not use the names “Jesus” and “Jeremiah.” And yet these commonly used pronunciations are quite different from the Hebrew pronunciations “Yeshʹua” and “Yirm<sup>e</sup>iahʹ.” The vital point is not what pronunciation you use for the Divine Name, whether “Yahweh,” “Jehovah,” or some other, as long as the pronunciation is common in your language. What is wrong is to <em>fail </em>to use that name. Why? Because those who do not use it could not be identified with the ones whom God takes out to be “a people <em>for his name.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:14-44:15:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 15:14</a>) We should not only know God’s <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>name but honor it and praise it before others, as God’s Son did when on earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:6-43:17:6" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> John 17:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:26-43:17:26" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 26</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Since all things were created ‘because of his will,’ they all must serve God’s purpose. Jehovah informed the first man and woman, Adam and Eve, of his purpose for them, and he held them accountable to act in harmony with it. Are we, too, accountable to God? Yes, because God is the Source of our life. This is true, not only because we have descended from that first human pair to whom God gave life, but also because our continued life each day depends on the sun, rain, air and food from which Jehovah continues to let us benefit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Psalm 36:9</a> [35:10, <em>Dy</em>]; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:45-40:5:45" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 5:45</a>) To what extent, then, do we live our lives in harmony with God’s purpose for us?

Yes, but with a healthy fear of rebelling against his will, because his will is <em>right. </em>In even ordinary things, do we not fear to take risks that could cause injury or loss of life? How much more so should we fear to displease “Jehovah God, the Almighty.” Yet we can be glad that he is almighty, for “as regards Jehovah, his eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:9-14:16:9" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>;<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:29-23:40:31" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>.)

We may well ask, then: “Why should anyone ever doubt God’s wisdom?” The Bible shows that his requirements are for our good, with our everlasting welfare in view. It is true that there may be times when we, as humans having limited knowledge and experience, do not fully appreciate why a certain law stated by God is so important, or how it really works for our good. Yet our firm belief that God obviously knows far more than we do, that his experience is so much greater than ours, and that what he does is for our everlasting good, will move us to obey him with a willing heart.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:11" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7-11</a> [18:8-12, <em>Dy</em>]; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:6:8-33:6:8" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Micah 6:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">12. (a) What do church creeds, such as the Athanasian Creed, teach about God? (b) What questions should we ask about this teaching?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Many religions of Christendom teach that God is a “Trinity,” although the word “Trinity” does not appear in the Bible. The World Council of Churches recently said that all religions that are part of that Council should advocate the belief that there is “one God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit,” that is, three persons in one God. Those teaching this doctrine admit that it is “a mystery.” The Athanasian Creed, of about the eighth century of the Common Era, says that the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost (Spirit) are all three of the same substance, all three are eternal (and hence had no beginning), and all three are almighty. So the creed reads that in the “Trinity none is afore or after other; none is greater or less than another.”<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> Is that reasonable?

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">13. According to the <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia, </em>did the Hebrew prophets and the first Christians believe in a “Trinity”?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>This doctrine was unknown to the Hebrew prophets and Christian apostles. The <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia </em>(1967 edition, Vol. XIV, p. 306) admits that “the doctrine of the Holy Trinity is not taught in the OT [Old Testament].” It also admits that the doctrine must be dated as from about three hundred and fifty years after the death of Jesus Christ. So the early Christians who were taught directly by Jesus Christ did not believe that God is a “Trinity.”</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">14. How did Jesus show that he was not equal with his Father?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>When Jesus was on earth he certainly was <em>not </em>equal to his Father, for he said there were <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>some things that neither he nor the angels knew but that only God knew. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:32-41:13:32" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Mark 13:32</a>) Furthermore, he prayed to his Father for help when undergoing trial. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:41-42:22:42" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Luke 22:41, 42</a>) Also, he himself said: “The Father is greater than I am.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:28-43:14:28" data-bid="29-1" class="b">John 14:28</a>) Because of this, Jesus spoke of his Father as “my God” and as “the only true God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:17-43:20:17" data-bid="30-1" class="b">John 20:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 17:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>After Jesus’ death, God raised him to life again and gave him glory greater than he had before. However, he was still not equal to his Father. How do we know? Because later the inspired Scriptures state that God is still “the head of the Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:3-46:11:3" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>) The Bible also says that Jesus is to reign as God’s appointed king until he has put all enemies under his feet, and that then shall “the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:28-46:15:28" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>, <em>AV</em>) Clearly, even since his resurrection Jesus Christ is not equal with his Father.</p>

However, that statement does not even suggest a “Trinity,” since he spoke of only two as being one, not three. Jesus was surely not contradicting the scriptures we have already read. What he meant by this expression he himself made clear later when he prayed regarding his followers that “they may be one just as we are one.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:22-43:17:22" data-bid="34-1" class="b">John 17:22</a>) Jesus and his Father are “one” in that Jesus is in full harmony with his Father.

Does that not prove the “Trinity”? No. Notice, first of all, that only two persons are mentioned, not three. Also, in this same chapter, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:2-43:1:2" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Joh 1 verse 2</a> says that the Word was “in the beginning <em>with </em>God,” and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Joh 1 verse 18</a> says that “no man hath seen God at any time,” yet men have seen Jesus Christ.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:11-40:3:11" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Matthew 3:11</a>) What John foretold was fulfilled when God caused his Son Christ Jesus to pour out holy spirit on the apostles and disciples during the day of Pentecost 33 C.E., so that “they all became filled with holy spirit.” Were they “filled” with a person?

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:4-2:20:5" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Exodus 20:4, 5</a>, in one of the Ten Commandments, God himself says: “You shall not make yourself a carved image or any likeness of <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>anything . . . you shall not bow down to them or serve them.” (The Catholic <em>Jerusalem Bible</em>) Some people regard a religious image simply as an “aid” to worshiping God because they can see and touch the image. But God inspired the apostle Paul to write: “We are walking by faith, not by sight.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:7-47:5:7" data-bid="45-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>) God is very frank about the matter. He tells us that the use of images is no part of true worship, but that such images are “a falsehood.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:14-23:44:20" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:14-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:4-19:115:8" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> Psalm 115:4-8</a> [113:4-8, second set of numbers, <em>Dy</em>]) Even though one may say that the honor given to a religious image is less than that given to God, God himself says that he will not share any of his glory and praise with such images.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:8-23:42:8" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:8</a>.</p>

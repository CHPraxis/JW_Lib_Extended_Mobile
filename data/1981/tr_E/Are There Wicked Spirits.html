<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Are There Wicked Spirits?</strong></p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 1. (a) Did Jesus believe that wicked spirits exist? (b) What did Jesus call the Devil?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">JESUS CHRIST, who came to earth from the spirit realm, acknowledged the existence of wicked spirits. You may recall that he often spoke of the Devil, and that he called him “the father of the lie” and a “manslayer.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>) For our own protection in this time when lying and murder are on the increase, we do well to examine this subject.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 2. (a) Contrary to what Jesus taught, what do some persons believe the Devil is? (b) What experience did Jesus have with the Devil?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Many persons, of course, do not believe that there are wicked spirit creatures. Even some who claim to use the Bible say that Satan the Devil is only a quality of evil, not an invisible spirit person. But do the facts agree with their belief? What about Jesus Christ’s own experience when the Devil tempted him? The Bible tells us that the Devil showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and said to him: “All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me.” Jesus answered the Devil: “Go away, Satan! For it is written, ‘It is Jehovah your God you must worship.’” Then the Devil left Jesus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:1-40:4:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 4:1-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 3. (a) How does that experience show that the Devil could not be merely a quality of evil? (b) What, then, is Satan the Devil?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span id="page56" class="pageNum" data-no="56" data-before-text="56"></span><sup>3 </sup>During that experience, by whom was Jesus Christ tempted? By a real person? or by a mere quality of evil? If he was tempted by a mere quality of evil, in whom did this quality dwell? Was this evil in Jesus Christ? If so, then it could not be true that in him there was no sin. Yet the Bible, God’s Word of truth, makes it very clear that Jesus was “guileless, undefiled, separated from the sinners.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:26-58:7:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:26</a>) The Bible also says: “He committed no sin, nor was deception found in his mouth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:22-60:2:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:22</a>) So Jesus could not have been carrying on a conversation with “evil” in his own self. He was talking to a living spirit creature. Thus the Scriptures and sound reasoning make clear that Satan is a real, live person in the invisible spirit realm.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>A SELF-MADE DEVIL</strong></p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 4. From what we know about God, why can we be certain that he would not create someone wicked?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>But in what way did the Devil originate? Obviously, the God ‘whose work is perfect’ would not create someone wicked. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>) He would not create intelligent creatures with whom he could not associate. Such would be contrary to reason and God’s love.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:5:4-19:5:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 5:4-6</a> [5:5-7, <em>Dy</em>].</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 5. (a) How did the spirit creature who became the Devil take a wrong course? (b) Was it a mere snake that put the idea of rebellion into the mind of Eve?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>So, the invisible spirit who later became the Devil must at one time have been perfect, without defect as a creation of God, just like all the other millions of angelic “sons of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:7-18:38:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Job 38:7</a>) How, then, did he go bad? After the creation of the first man and woman, this particular spirit creature entered on a course of rebellion against God. He developed a desire to be worshiped and so enticed <span id="page57" class="pageNum" data-no="57" data-before-text="57"></span>Adam and Eve to rebel against God. How did he do this? The Bible shows that a serpent spoke to Eve, telling her a lie. As a result she disobeyed God. Then she caused her husband to join her in revolt against God. But who actually put the idea of rebellion into Eve’s mind? Was it a mere snake with no speech organs? No, there was someone behind the serpent making it appear as if it were talking. We know that some skilled humans can speak words with their lips nearly shut, making it appear as if a nearby animal or a dummy is talking. How much easier for a superhuman invisible person to do this! God made Balaam’s ass speak. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:22:28-4:22:28" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Numbers 22:28</a>) In Eden, Satan used the serpent. And so the Bible identifies the Devil, or Satan, as “the original serpent,” hence the one who really introduced rebellion and wickedness into the universe.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:3-47:11:3" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 11:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6. How could a perfect creature turn to wickedness?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>But, you may wonder, if this highly intelligent spirit really was perfect, how could he turn to wickedness when there was no one to tempt him? The Bible answers that it was by his thinking upon a wrong idea. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:14-59:1:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b">James 1:14, 15</a>) There is nothing wrong in itself with seeing the possibilities in a certain situation. For example, a person in someone else’s home may see money lying on a table. The possibility of his taking that money and putting it into his pocket is there. But, since that would be stealing, he should not even consider it. Or, if the idea does come into his mind, he ought to dismiss it. But if he keeps the idea in his mind and allows it to grow, then wrong desire develops. Soon this may move him to commit an act of wickedness.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 7. (a) So how did this spirit creature become wicked? (b) Who, then, made Satan the Devil?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span id="page58" class="pageNum" data-no="58" data-before-text="58"></span><sup>7 </sup>So, too, with the perfect spirit creature. The possibility was there of his using the human pair for his own purpose rather than carrying out what God wanted. As a free moral agent, he not only considered it but also failed to dismiss it from his mind, and it led him to sin. Just as a formerly honest man can make himself a thief by stealing, so this spirit creature made himself Satan by acting as a <em>resister </em>of God; and he made himself the Devil by becoming a <em>slanderer </em>of God, because that is what those names mean.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 8. Why was it not Just a mistake that Satan made?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Of course, someone may say, “Might it not have been simply a mistake that he made? Could he not have apologized and so ended the matter there?” In answer, we need to keep in mind that a perfect individual is different from us. When he uses his free will, the choice that he makes is not due to weakness or imperfection. Imperfect people often make mistakes due to inherited weakness. They can admit their mistakes, apologize and change their course. But when a perfect creature chooses to do wrong, he does it deliberately and he does not later turn back to doing good. This was the case with the one who made himself the Devil.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>OTHER SPIRIT CREATURES MAKE THEMSELVES DEMONS</strong></p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 9. How did others of God’s holy angels make themselves demons?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>The Devil was not the only spirit creature to turn to disobedience and wickedness. God had created a great number of holy angels, millions of them. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:10-27:7:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Daniel 7:10</a> reveals a portion of them as being 100,000,000. The Bible record at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:1-1:6:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 6:1-5</a> explains that before the flood of Noah’s day <span id="page59" class="pageNum" data-no="59" data-before-text="59"></span>some of these spirit “sons of God” materialized as men, that is, they left their place in heaven as spirit creatures and clothed themselves with fleshly bodies. And why? To enjoy human passions by marrying the good-looking daughters of men. This was an act of disobedience to God, and the Bible associates it with the actions of the people of Sodom and Gomorrah who ‘went after flesh for unnatural use.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:6-65:1:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jude 6, 7</a>) So, too, it was against their heavenly nature for angels to come down and seek human flesh with which to have sex relations. Their course brought bad results, including a freakish offspring, “mighty ones” called Nephilim. By their rebellious action, those spirit sons of God turned themselves into demons and put themselves on the side of the Devil, who is the “ruler of the demons.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:34-40:9:34" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 9:34</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">10. (a) When the flood of Noah’s day came, what happened to the disobedient angels who had married the daughters of men? (b) To what should the increase in wrongdoing in our day alert us?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>When the global flood of Noah’s day destroyed all the wicked humans, the unfaithful angels dissolved their fleshly bodies and returned to the spirit realm. But they were not allowed to become part of God’s organization of holy angels again. Instead, they were confined in a debased condition of spiritual darkness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:4-61:2:4" data-bid="16-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:4</a>) Since the Flood, God has not permitted these demonic angels to materialize in the flesh as they did before then. Yet they can still exercise dangerous power over men and women. In fact, with the help of these demons Satan is “misleading the entire inhabited earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9</a>) The great increase in wrongdoing that we see all over the earth today should alert us to the need to be on guard against being misled by them.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Three times in the Bible book of John we read that the Lord Jesus Christ called the Devil “the ruler of this world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:31-43:12:31" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 12:31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:30-43:14:30" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 14:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:11-43:16:11" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 16:11</a>) At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:4-47:4:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:4</a> he is referred to as “the god of this system of things.” Does this mean, then, that all the nations of the earth are under the control of Satan the Devil? The Bible answers: “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) Thus the Devil, as “ruler of the world,” exercises great influence on men, overreaching them and even controlling political governments.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:13-66:16:14" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Revelation 16:13, 14</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>If you will open your Bible to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9</a>, you will see that the Devil is described as “the great dragon.” In the next chapter, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:1-66:13:2" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Re 13 verses 1 and 2</a>, we are told that this dragon, the Devil, gave power and a throne and great authority to what is symbolically called a “wild beast” out of the sea. What is this symbolic “wild beast”? Well, over what does Satan hold authority? What did he offer to Jesus Christ? “All the kingdoms of the inhabited earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:5-42:4:8" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Luke 4:5-8</a>) Jesus quickly rejected that offer, but he did not deny that the Devil ruled over the political kingdoms of the earth.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:13:1-66:13:2" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Revelation 13:1, 2</a>) So the “wild beast” represents the Devil’s entire political organization that has exercised beastlike rule over the earth throughout the centuries until now.

It is getting in touch with wicked spirit creatures, being misled by them either directly or through a human or other medium.

<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">21. (a) What does the Bible show as to the time left for the wicked spirits? (b) Why should a person break free from spiritism and all other false religion?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>So Jesus Christ was not imagining something when he called the Devil “the ruler of this world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:31-43:12:31" data-bid="42-1" class="b">John 12:31</a>) There are indeed wicked spirits misleading “the entire inhabited earth.” But only a “short period of time” remains before the Devil and his wicked angels are to be put out of operation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Revelation 12:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:12-66:12:12" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 12</a>) Meantime, keep free from every form of spiritism and break free from religion that may appear respectable but is really based on falsehood. You cannot hold to spiritism or any other religious falsehood and get eternal life in God’s new system of things, because it is only the truth that leads to eternal life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:12-49:6:12" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:16-49:6:16" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>

‘Not One of the Predictions Was on the Mark’
At the beginning of 1980, a newspaper published the 62 predictions of a number of prominent “seers” regarding events that they predicted would happen during the year to come. After 1980 ended, Jack Mabley, writing for the Chicago “Tribune,” reported: “Not one of those 62 predictions was on the mark.” As to their predictions on personal matters, he advised: “My suggestion is to do the opposite of what they say. The seers are consistently wrong.”

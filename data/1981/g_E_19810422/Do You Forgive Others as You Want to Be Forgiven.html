<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The story was told of a slave who owed his master 60 million denarii and could not pay. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:23-40:18:35" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 18:23-35</a>) The master ordered him, his family and his possessions to be sold to pay the debt. The slave fell down and pleaded with his master . . .</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Be patient with me and I will pay back everything to you.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">So his master pitied him and canceled his huge debt.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">He then went to a fellow slave who owed him only 100 denarii.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Pay back whatever you owe.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Be patient with me and I will pay you back.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>But the one who had been forgiven so much refused to forgive his fellow slave so little, and had him thrown into prison.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The other slaves who had seen this reported it to the master.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The master, furious, ordered the unforgiving slave to appear . . .</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“I canceled all that debt for you . . . Ought you not, in turn, to have had mercy on your fellow slave?”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The master then had that wicked slave thrown into jail.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">LESSON FOR US TODAY: The master forgave one slave what to us might be around $12 million (U.S.), but then this slave would not forgive his fellow slave something like $20! Similarly, we sin against God thousands of times, often not even being aware of our trespasses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:12-19:19:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 19:12</a>) Yet, when we ask for his forgiveness, he forgives us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:1:9-62:1:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 1:9</a>) But how many times does a particular person sin against us? Two or three times? If Jehovah forgives us thousands of times, can’t we forgive our brother a few times? Keep in mind that we are taught to pray that God will “forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:12-40:6:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 6:12</a>)</p>

Accidents of Evolution or Acts of Creation?
A HOT QUESTION BECOMING HOTTER
SCIENTIFIC CREATIONISM wants to go to school. It wants equal time with evolution in the science classes of the public schools in the United States. To a lesser extent, it is also an issue in Canada.
EVOLUTIONISTS oppose its entry into the classroom. They say it is not a science, doesn’t belong in science classes, and would violate the principle of separation of Church and State.
THE CONTROVERSY has made headlines in newspapers across the United States. It has been debated in state legislatures and has been the issue in court trials.
Even the prestigious American Association for the Advancement of Science railed against creation at its meeting this year and announced tentatively that at next year’s meeting it will discuss ways of combating creation.
The controversy started by Darwin more than 100 years ago is still raging. But without getting involved in the political issues: THIS SPECIAL “AWAKE!” considers some basic questions:
Is evolution a fact established by the scientific method? Or is evolution unproved theory?
Is the Bible doctrine of creation scientific?
Can evolutionists show how nonliving chemicals turned into the first living, reproducing simple cell?
Does the fossil record tell how this first cell evolved into all living things on earth, including mankind?
Can random mutations produce the intricate designs and amazing instincts found in living creatures?
Let’s start our investigation with a look at the incredible cell itself. It’s not as simple as once thought!

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">A RELIGIOUS “FAITH”? A PHILOSOPHY?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">EVOLUTION “IS ALSO BEING QUESTIONED BY REPUTABLE SCIENTISTS”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">‘UNBELIEVERS are uninformed, unreasonable, irresponsible, incompetent, ignorant, dogmatic, enslaved by old illusions and prejudices.’ In these ways leading evolutionists describe those who do not accept evolution as a fact. However, cool, logical, scientific reasoning, backed by observational and experimental evidence, need not resort to such personal invective.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The position of the evolutionists is more characteristic of religious dogmatism. When the chief priests and Pharisees saw the crowds accepting Jesus, they sent officers to arrest him, with this result: “The Temple police who had been sent to arrest him returned to the chief priests and Pharisees. ‘Why didn’t you bring him in?’ they demanded. ‘He says such wonderful things!’ they mumbled. ‘We’ve never heard anything like it.’ ‘So you also have been led astray?’ the Pharisees mocked. ‘Is there a single one of us Jewish rulers or Pharisees who believes he is the Messiah? These stupid crowds do, yes; but what do they know about it? A curse upon them anyway!”’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:32-43:7:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 7:32,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:45-43:7:49" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 45-49</a>, <em>The Living Bible.</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">They were wrong, for evidence proves that many of the rulers were being affected by Jesus’ teaching. Even individual priests became his followers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:42-43:12:42" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 12:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:7-44:6:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Acts 6:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:5-44:15:5" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 15:5</a>) Unable to refute Jesus, the Pharisees as a group resorted to tyranny of authority. Today evolutionists adopt the same tactics: ‘Stupid crowds, what do they know? All reputable scientists accept evolution!’ Not so. As <em>Discover </em>magazine said: “Now that hallowed theory is not only under attack by fundamentalist Christians, but is also being questioned by reputable scientists.”​—October 1980.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Writing in <em>Science, </em>R. E. Gibson said that Galileo possessed “a passionate antagonism to any kind of dogma based on human authority.” It was his intellectual integrity that got him into trouble with the Inquisition. But such integrity, Gibson asserts, “is not fashionable now; the present tendency is for the scientific community, now grown powerful, to behave much as the church did in Galileo’s time.” Is modern science handling power and prestige any better than the Catholic Church did? Einstein once remarked that we are not as far removed from Galileo’s time as we would like to think.​—<em>Science, </em>September 18, 1964, pp. 1271-1276.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Robert Jastrow refers to “the religious faith of the scientist” and his irritation when the evidence doesn’t match his beliefs. J. N. W. Sullivan calls belief in spontaneous generation “an article of faith,” and T. H. Huxley said it was “an act of philosophical faith.” Sullivan said that to believe that evolution made all life on earth was “an extraordinary act of faith.” Dr. J. R. Durant points out that “many scientists succumb to the temptation to be dogmatic, seizing upon new ideas with almost missionary zeal . . . In the case of the theory of evolution, the missionary spirit seems to have prevailed.” Physicist H. S. Lipson says that after Darwin “evolution became in a sense a scientific religion; <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>almost all scientists have accepted it and many are prepared to ‘bend’ their observations to fit in with it.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Proving the above, <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report </em>(March 2, 1981) told of scandals in science labs. A researcher at Yale said: “It’s the Watergate of science.” The article concluded: “‘It’s shocking,’ acknowledges Dr. Arnold Relman, editor of the <em>New England Journal of Medicine. </em>‘It strikes yet another idol. Everyone turns out to have clay feet​—even some research scientists.”’ Simpson, in <em>The Meaning of Evolution, </em>said evolutionists “may use the same data to ‘prove’ diametrically opposed theories” and each one “puts his particular theory into the data.” (Pp. 137-9) Sullivan said that scientists do not “invariably tell the truth, or try to, even about their science. They have been known to lie, but they did not lie in order to serve science but, usually, religious or anti-religious prejudices.”​—<em>Limitations of Science, </em>pp. 173-5.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The original quest for truth is often forgotten as each one gleans for ideas to bolster his own emotional conviction, whether it be scientific dogma or religious creed. Evolution is not the caliber of the science that sends men to the moon or cracks the genetic code. It is more like religion​—priestlike authorities that speak <em>ex cathedra, </em>sectarian squabbles, unexplainable mysteries, faith in missing links and missing mutations, a laity that blindly follows, wresting evidence to fit their creed, and denouncing nonbelievers as stupid. And their god? The same one the ancients sacrificed to, preparing “a table for the god of Good Luck.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:11-23:65:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 65:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In Hans Christian Andersen’s famous tale of the emperor’s new clothes, it took a small child to tell the emperor that he was naked. Evolution now parades as fully clothed fact. We need childlike honesty to tell it that it’s naked. And we need courageous scientists like Professor Lipson, who said: “We must go further than this and admit that the only acceptable explanation is <em>creation. </em>I know that this is anathema to physicists, as indeed it is to me, but we must not reject a theory that we do not like if the experimental evidence supports it.”</p>

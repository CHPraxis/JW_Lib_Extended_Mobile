Unworked Territory
Some congregations have territory that has not been worked in the past year or more. We have asked the circuit overseer to make arrangements for other congregations in or outside the circuit to help cover territory that has not been worked during the past year. Please inform your circuit overseer if you are available to help out in this activity.
There are 305 counties or parts of counties in the United States that are not assigned to any congregation. This territory needs to be worked also. Those interested in helping out should check with their congregation secretary for information from the Society concerning unassigned territory.
As we all have a full share in the work of Kingdom-preaching, it is hoped that a good witness will be given in all our territory this year.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Circuit overseers regularly visit all congregations in an effort to stimulate and spiritually encourage their brothers. When they complete their visit, they submit a written report to the Society, leaving a copy with the congregation. How can these reports be best utilized by the elders?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The <em>Organization </em>book, page 86, outlines this arrangement, stating in part: “Before leaving the congregation, but after his meeting with the body of elders, the circuit overseer fills out a report to the branch office on what service he rendered during his visit, making observations on the spiritual condition of the congregation, matters that were discussed with the elders, and so forth.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>This report should be circulated to all elders so that they can personally review it and make notes, where needed. It should also be considered at subsequent elders’ meetings as an aid to analyzing the needs of the congregation as well as the observations and suggestions of the circuit overseer. Elders will want to act upon the suggestions made in this report, applying these to the congregation’s activity. To this end, they can make good use of the time set aside in the service meeting for considering local needs. If proper use is made of this report, both the local elders and the congregation as a whole can benefit more fully from the visits of the traveling overseers.</p>

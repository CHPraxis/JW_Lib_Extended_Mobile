(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:22-49:1:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 1:22, 23</a>) He appointed a “faithful and discreet slave” class to care for his interests on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>) Individual Christians must recognize arrangement and work closely with organization.

A few minutes can be taken at conclusion of weekly study to do so. Subjects can be considered, such as location and function of Kingdom Hall; purpose of each meeting and how conducted; no collections at meetings (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:2-40:6:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 6:2, 3</a>); appointed elders have no titles (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:8-40:23:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 23:8-10</a>); all in congregation share in witnessing and teaching (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:1-44:8:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 8:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:4-44:8:4" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 4</a>).

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Talk on subject “Share Regularly in Magazine Distribution.” It is vital that we appreciate the part <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>have in spreading the good news of the Kingdom. Even though persons may have limited interest in our message, they are often willing to accept magazines. Distribution has increased during last service year. (Note current <em>Yearbook.</em>) A constant effort is being put forth to make magazines more interesting and appealing. Are we making full use of this provision? All will want to have a regular share in magazine activity. Select specific theme that ties in with a preselected article or subject from current issues. Highlight illustrations. (Illustrate talking points from current issues.) Young publishers can be effective in placing magazines. Prepare and participate in this activity as a family. While congregations may have arrangements for publishers to participate in the magazine activity every Saturday, it is suggested that all make special effort to share in some feature of magazine distribution on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month, whether it be regular house-to-house or store-to-store work, engaging in street work, or building up a magazine route. All will want to endeavor to be magazine conscious, appreciating the full value of these publications.</p>

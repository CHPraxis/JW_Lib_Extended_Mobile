Announcements
● The MEDICAL ALERT cards distributed last September should now be updated for 1981. Please cross out the former date and neatly write in the new date so that your card will be current. If additional copies are now needed, a small supply can be ordered with a congregation order. Next year’s supply will be sent automatically in September.
● Literature offer for February and March: One of the older 192-page books. Encourage publishers to offer books of which congregation has an excess stock. April and May: Watchtower subscription for $2.50.
● Arrangements will be made to provide a copy of the March 15, 1981, Watchtower, for all newly interested persons who attend the Memorial on April 19, 1981. This is the issue scheduled to be studied on April 26. Congregations may wish to order extra copies for Memorial distribution.
● The April 1 and 15 issues of The Watchtower and also the April 8 and 22 issues of Awake! will have articles specially suitable for placing with the public and for obtaining subscriptions. Be sure to place your order early for extra copies, including those that will be needed by auxiliary pioneers.
● All bodies of elders will have their quarterly elders’ meeting during the month of March. They should review latest report of circuit overseer.
● New cassette recordings (also with Braille labels) available:
To the Hebrews and The Letter of James—English (Both books on one cassette. Price for congregation and public: $2; pioneers: $1.75.)
Acts of Apostles—Dutch (Set of 3 cassettes. Price for congregation and public: $6; pioneers: $5.50.)
● On Saturday, April 11, the Bethel home and factory and Watchtower Farms buildings will be closed for spring cleaning, so there will be no arrangements for tours on that day.

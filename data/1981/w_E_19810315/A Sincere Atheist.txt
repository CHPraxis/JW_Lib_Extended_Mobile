A Sincere Atheist
The following letter was received at the Toronto, Canada, branch office of the Watch Tower Society: “For all my adult life I have been a ‘sincere’ atheist, believing firmly in an evolution supported by all my private studies of chemistry, physics, . . . etc.
“Lately I was . . . offered a subscription to your ‘Watchtower’ and ‘Awake!’ Reading these and a number of your books, I began to realize that I was wrong, that there had to be a Creator.”
Have you thoroughly investigated whether the theory of evolution has a real foundation in fact? Are you willing to check it out? You can do so in the 192-page book “Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?”
Please send, postpaid, the hardbound book “Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?” I enclose 60 cents (U.S.).

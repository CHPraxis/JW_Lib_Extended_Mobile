● The book Happiness—How to Find It is now available in grade-two English Braille. This four-volume publication may be obtained on a free loan basis or purchased and kept permanently. A remittance of $5.00 should accompany the order if purchased. Orders for Braille items should be sent to the Society’s BRAILLE DESK and not included on regular congregation literature orders. Braille publications should not be stocked by the congregation.
● Due to the demand for Braille material, it would be appreciated if the brothers that have obtained Braille publications on a loan basis would return those that are not currently being used by a visually handicapped person so that other readers may use them. All Braille publications requested on a loan arrangement should be returned to the Society when readers have finished with them. A return label is provided in each book for this purpose.

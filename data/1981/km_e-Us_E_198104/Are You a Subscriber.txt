Are You a Subscriber?
1 Why do you recommend that householders subscribe to The Watchtower? Is it not because you know that by their doing so they are availing themselves of an abundant and continuous supply of spiritually upbuilding information? Receiving the magazines at home regularly will maximize the opportunity for them to be motivated favorably toward the truth. Would this not also be true for ourselves? So, are you and every member of your family subscribers?
2 Think of the benefits. For one thing, subscription copies of the magazine arrive weeks before the issue date. This allows ample time for reading and personal and family study before the congregational study. Due to sickness or other reasons, or simply through being forgetful, we may miss out on picking up the magazines at the Kingdom Hall. With the magazines coming to us regularly in the mail, we are assured of getting every issue, thus building up a complete file for future use in connection with the Theocratic School and service meeting, as well as for research. In many families, the children are very much encouraged when the magazines come to them in their own name. This helps them to take greater interest in the magazines and receive greater benefits therefrom.
3 This month we will be offering the Watchtower subscription once again. It would be appropriate to start with ourselves and our household becoming subscribers. Then, we might think about those among our friends, relatives, acquaintances, workmates, schoolmates, and so forth, who may enjoy receiving a gift subscription. Of course, the house-to-house work is still the principal way in which we may obtain subscriptions. Yes, by looking out for all the opportunities, we will have another rewarding month of activity with the magazines.

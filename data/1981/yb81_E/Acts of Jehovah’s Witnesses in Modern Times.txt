Acts of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Modern Times
Just as Jesus foretold, the good news of the Kingdom is being preached on a marvelous scale worldwide. (Matt. 24:14) What has particularly initiated this in many countries is the zealous activity of missionaries from Gilead School. In the next 223 pages, you will read how these missionaries, along with other courageous men and women, pioneered the Kingdom preaching in modern times in the following four countries.
EL SALVADOR: In 1945 a married couple from Gilead School became the first Kingdom proclaimers here. Now there are over 7,000. Read how the Kingdom work developed and grew, and how it continues to prosper during the dreadful civil strife.
IVORY COAST: In 1949 two Gilead missionaries did the first recorded Kingdom service in the country. Learn how, despite a ban on the preaching work for a time and other difficulties, the good news has been carried to the remote regions of the country.
UPPER VOLTA: The first Kingdom publishers came here in 1963, but they were expelled the following year. Read how eventually Gilead missionaries spearheaded the preaching work, resulting in fine growth.
NEW ZEALAND: The Kingdom work had its beginning here over 75 years ago. The zealous activity of the early pioneers, the activity under ban during World War II and the postwar growth of the Kingdom work make for exciting reading.
We believe that these stirring reports of Christian faith in modern times will strengthen and encourage you to carry on in your service to God.

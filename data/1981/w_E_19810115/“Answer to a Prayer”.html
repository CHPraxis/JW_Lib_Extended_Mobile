<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">BACK in November 1978 the four-page tract “Relief from Pressures, Is It Possible?” was left at the home of Mrs. K​——— in Framingham, Massachusetts. Later Mrs. K​——— wrote the headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses, saying in her letter:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sg">“Dear Sir or Madame,</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I came home this afternoon after driving to several churches looking for a minister of God to answer some questions I have. I said a short prayer asking the Lord, ‘Where can I find someone to teach me and my son the Bible?’ Your leaflet was under my door. Call it a coincidence, but I know it was an answer to a prayer because I seldom pray and never go to church. I want my son to have some religion though and I’d only be too happy to allow one of your ministers to stop by and answer some questions and teach the Bible to us.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sj">“Sincerely,</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sj">(signed Donna K​———)”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A minister of Jehovah’s Witnesses was sent, free of charge, to help Mrs. K​——— and her son to understand the Bible in the privacy of their own home. You also can receive the same help.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Further helps to understanding the Bible are subscriptions for <strong>The Watchtower </strong>and <strong>Awake! </strong>These magazines point readers to the fulfillment of the Bible prophecies that show the present wicked system of things will soon end, being destroyed by God. But they also announce the coming in of a righteous new order where, under the rule of God’s kingdom, people will enjoy life forever in true peace, health and happiness on a paradise earth.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">[ ]  Please send, postpaid, a year’s subscription for “The Watchtower” and “Awake!”; I enclose $5 (U.S.). For mailing this coupon I am to receive six free booklets.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">[ ]  I would appreciate it if a qualified person would visit me, free of charge, to help me to get better acquainted with the Bible.</p>

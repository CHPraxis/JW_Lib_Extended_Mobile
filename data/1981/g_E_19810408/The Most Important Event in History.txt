The Most Important Event in History
The event was the death of Jesus Christ. Why so?
It served to vindicate God’s name, proving that a human could keep perfect integrity to God.
It opened to mankind the prospect of attaining everlasting life in paradise conditions.
Jesus himself instituted a memorial of his death on the night before he died. It was a simple ceremony. During it Jesus told his disciples: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”​—Luke 22:19, 20.

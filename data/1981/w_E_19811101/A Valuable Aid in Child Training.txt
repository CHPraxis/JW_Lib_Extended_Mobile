A Valuable Aid in Child Training
That is what the book “Listening to the Great Teacher” has been for millions of parents. An amazing 29,000,000 copies of this book have been printed. One parent wrote:
“Our son, Jason, was about one year old when the publication came out. We began reading to him immediately. By the time he could speak he practically knew all the answers by heart. He could turn to the pictures and tell me what the story was about. By the age of three we began teaching him to read. The simplicity of the book did much to aid in his learning. . . .
“By the age of four he was reading an entire lesson, slowly, to me. . . . Now, at age five, he is ‘conducting’ the study on his own, asking me the questions and looking up the accompanying scriptures. . . . We hope that when Jason begins his formal schooling his reading skills and Biblical knowledge gained from the ‘Great Teacher’ book will help him to maintain his integrity and to be a fine example.”

● In the parable of the “talents,” who are represented by the three slaves?​—Matt. 25:14-30.
Since all three slaves are in the ‘master’s’ household, they would stand for all the prospective heirs of the heavenly kingdom, with differing abilities and opportunities for increasing Kingdom interests. From Pentecost 33 C.E. onward to the modern day, some anointed slaves would have greater abilities, energy and opportunities for increasing the master’s “belongings” committed to their care. The apostles and others with enlarged privileges would be in the five-“talent” category. The circumstances of others would limit them, comparatively speaking, in what they would be able to do. Nevertheless, all were required to be whole-souled in their devotion and work, and all would receive the same reward.
Even the slave given one “talent” was not predestined to fail. If he had turned the one “talent” into at least two, likely he would have received the same reward of ‘entering into the joy of the master.’ Because he proved to be “sluggish” and “wicked,” he would represent those prospective Kingdom heirs who turned unfaithful. They lose not only their privileges but also any reward.
Members of Christendom profess to be the true slaves of the Master, Jesus Christ, but their words and deeds serve to disqualify them from any claim that they might make of being in the Master’s household. Thus they do not enter into the picture as prospective heirs of the heavenly kingdom.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">We have good reason to be thankful to Jehovah for his rich blessings this past April. Here in the United States the field service report gives solid evidence of keen appreciation for the Kingdom ministry entrusted to us. The April report shows we had our best month this service year as far as total hours, magazines, subscriptions, return visits and home Bible studies are concerned. In fact, it was one of the best months in a number of years. While the total publishers is not a new peak for this service year, it is still 20,081 more than April a year ago, a 4.4-percent increase over last year’s average.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The 41,887 auxiliary pioneers plus the number of regular and special pioneers shows that 61,199, or 10.8 percent of the total publishers shared in full-time field service during April. This is commendable. We feel confident that all who shared in this privilege experienced much joy. So did the congregation publishers who put forth added effort in the ministry during that month. Let us keep on glorifying our ministry, doing our utmost to make known the marvelous Kingdom hope to all who will hear.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:13-45:11:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 11:13</a>.</p>

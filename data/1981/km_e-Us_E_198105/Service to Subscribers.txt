Service to Subscribers
Imagine a pile of magazines over 400 feet high. This would be equal to over 100,000 subscription copies of the magazines that became undeliverable as addressed. Last year the Society paid the postal service 25c each for these magazines, which totaled over $25,000.
The main reason for this was that subscribers moved and did not advise the Society of their new address in advance. Some were undeliverable due to inaccurate address information. What can we do to help reduce the number of undeliverable subscriptions?
 1. When we initially fill out a subscription slip, we should carefully verify the name and address. Double-check numbers in the address.
 2. Advise the Society as soon as a moving date is known. Send both old and new address to Watchtower, Wallkill, N.Y. 12589. When possible, include the old address portion of the subscription wrapper.
 3. When a subscription becomes undeliverable, the Society sends an Undeliverable Subscription Follow-up slip. The secretary should endeavor to obtain a new address and promptly send it to the Societyâ€™s Wallkill office. We will then reinstate delivery to the corrected address. If the delivery address is correct and copies are not being received, please return the Undeliverable Subscription Follow-up slip to the Society. Additionally, the secretary should make arrangements for a personal visit to the local post office. This may help to restore delivery.
We hope these suggestions will help you to help us provide the best possible service to our subscribers and reduce the number of subscriptions that become undeliverable.

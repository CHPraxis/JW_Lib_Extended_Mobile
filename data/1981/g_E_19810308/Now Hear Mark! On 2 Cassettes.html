<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Now you can hear the complete Gospel of Mark on tape cassettes. Enjoy Mark in your car on the way to work. Or listen while you are doing housework. Play the cassettes with your children. They are also a particularly thoughtful gift to those who have grown older, or perhaps are sightless. Playing time, about 2 hours.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Please send me the set of 2 tape cassettes containing a recording of the complete Gospel of Mark. I enclose $3 (U.S.).</p>

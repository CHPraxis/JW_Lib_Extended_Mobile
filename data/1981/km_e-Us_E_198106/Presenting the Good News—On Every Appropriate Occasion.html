<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The psalmist was keenly interested in showing his love and appreciation for Jehovah. He said: “It is good to give thanks to Jehovah and to make melody to your name, O Most High; to tell in the <em>morning </em>about your loving-kindness and about your faithfulness during the <em>nights.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:92:1-19:92:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 92:1, 2</a>) Do you feel that way?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Three young brothers who wanted to serve as auxiliary pioneers got an early start. In their town there was a transportation center where people took trains and buses into the city to work. The three young brothers were there at 6:30 each morning. Between 6:30 and 8:00 they placed many magazines as they spoke to people about Jehovah’s kingdom.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Late afternoon and early evening hours have also proved to be good times to share in the service. Many brothers and sisters have observed that, while in some territories they find few persons at home when doing house-to-house work during the day, they find many more at home in the early evenings. Some people are more relaxed at the end of the day. Oftentimes men are pleased to have someone to talk with, and it is the men who are rarely found at home weekdays.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>In just a few weeks we will be attending the “Kingdom Loyalty” District Convention. Your lapel card may open up opportunities to present the good news. Be sure to wear it.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>It may be that you have found other ways to draw people into conversation. For instance, after making a purchase, some brothers and sisters just ask the clerk: ‘Do you like to read?’ After receiving a reply, they reach for a magazine or other publication and tell the person, ‘Here is an article that I enjoyed reading very much.’ They show it to the person and ask if he would like to read it also. If it is an older magazine, they may say: ‘I have finished reading it. Would you like to read it, too?” Current publications can be offered for a contribution.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>When sharing in the house-to-house work remember that <em>we are looking for people. </em>During the summertime people are often in the yard or walking along the sidewalk. Someone may be working on his car. Children may be playing in the street. People watch you going from house to house. By all means stop and satisfy their curiosity. You may find an excellent opportunity to present the good news.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>As you endeavor to reach out to speak to more people, pray to Jehovah that he will direct you and bless your efforts. With his blessing you may have the pleasure of presenting the good news to someone who is hungering and thirsting for the truth. Yes, with Jehovah’s blessing, we can enjoy both happiness and success in our efforts to present the good news on every appropriate occasion.</p>

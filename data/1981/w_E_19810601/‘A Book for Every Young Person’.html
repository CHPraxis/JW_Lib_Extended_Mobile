<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That has been said about “Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It.” A reader in Tennessee wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sg">Dear Sir:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"> Enclosed is a check for $10.00 worth of ‘Dating and Courtship.’ Since having seen a copy of this book, I feel that every young person in America would be helped if they would let their conduct be guided by the instruction which the book provides.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"> If I were able, I would send a check to pay for one thousand copies. . . .</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sj">Respectfully,</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sj">J. W. J​———.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Evidently the reader thought the chapter “Dating and Courtship” itself was worth the price of the book. Other chapters include “Does Sexual Morality Make Sense?” and “Drugs​—Key to Real Living?” Receive a copy by filling in and mailing the coupon.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Please send, postpaid, the hardbound, 192-page book “Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It.” I enclose 60 cents (U.S.).</p>

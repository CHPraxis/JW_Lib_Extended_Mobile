‘A Book for Every Young Person’
That has been said about “Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It.” A reader in Tennessee wrote:
Dear Sir:
 Enclosed is a check for $10.00 worth of ‘Dating and Courtship.’ Since having seen a copy of this book, I feel that every young person in America would be helped if they would let their conduct be guided by the instruction which the book provides.
 If I were able, I would send a check to pay for one thousand copies. . . .
Respectfully,
J. W. J​———.
Evidently the reader thought the chapter “Dating and Courtship” itself was worth the price of the book. Other chapters include “Does Sexual Morality Make Sense?” and “Drugs​—Key to Real Living?” Receive a copy by filling in and mailing the coupon.
Please send, postpaid, the hardbound, 192-page book “Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It.” I enclose 60 cents (U.S.).

Fulfillment of God’s Word Certain
Jehovah God told Abraham: “As regards Ishmael I have heard you. Look! I will bless him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him very, very much. He will certainly produce twelve chieftains, and I will make him become a great nation.” (Gen. 17:20) Abraham’s son Ishmael then was about 13 years of age. (Gen. 16:16; 17:1) No man could have predicted that this unmarried youth would become the father of 12 chieftains. But the all-wise Creator did. Two historical sources preserve the fulfillment of the divine revelation, listing the following 12 chieftains: Nebaioth, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah. (Gen. 25:13-15; 1 Chron. 1:29-31) How forcefully this illustrates the certainty of the fulfillment of God’s prophetic word!

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jehovah God told Abraham: “As regards Ishmael I have heard you. Look! I will bless him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him very, very much. He will certainly produce twelve chieftains, and I will make him become a great nation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:20-1:17:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 17:20</a>) Abraham’s son Ishmael then was about 13 years of age. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:16:16-1:16:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 16:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:1-1:17:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 17:1</a>) No man could have predicted that this unmarried youth would become the father of 12 chieftains. But the all-wise Creator did. Two historical sources preserve the fulfillment of the divine revelation, listing the following 12 chieftains: Nebaioth, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:13-1:25:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gen. 25:13-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:1:29-13:1:31" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Chron. 1:29-31</a>) How forcefully this illustrates the certainty of the fulfillment of God’s prophetic word!</p>

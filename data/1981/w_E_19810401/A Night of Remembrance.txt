A Night of Remembrance
During a simple ceremony, Jesus Christ used wine and unleavened bread as symbols of the sacrifice that he was about to make for mankind.
When instituting this celebration, he said: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”​—Luke 22:19.
Last year, 5,726,656 persons remembered Jesus by attending the memorial of his death at special meetings sponsored worldwide by Jehovah’s Witnesses. You are cordially invited to attend the Memorial observance this year at the Kingdom Hall nearest to your home.
It will be held Sunday, April 19, after sunset. Check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time.

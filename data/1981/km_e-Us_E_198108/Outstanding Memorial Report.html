<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">At the past Memorial celebration on April 19, the attendance in the U.S. totaled 1,463,070, an all-time peak. This is 101,458 more than the year before. There were 4,204 partakers compared to 4,237 in 1980. In this report we have a strong indication of the need to continue helping thousands of persons to become disciples of Jesus Christ and loyal proclaimers of Godâ€™s kingdom.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">We all look forward to the new circuit assembly programs that the Society arranges for us twice a year. They always provide just what we need in order to face current problems and situations. The new program that begins in September will surely be no exception. Do not miss it.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">To help us appreciate our place in the theocratic arrangement of things and avoid the course of independence pursued by the world, the program will develop the theme “Subjecting Ourselves to God.” It should strengthen our determination to thus subject ourselves and deepen our appreciation for the many blessings and privileges that result therefrom. Be sure to attend with your brothers when your circuit assembly is scheduled.</p>

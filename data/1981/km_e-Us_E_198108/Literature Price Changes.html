<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">All of us are aware of the constantly rising costs for food and materials of all kinds. We continue to experience cost increases in paper and other products we purchase for the publishing of books, booklets, magazines, and so forth. Also, postage and shipping costs are constantly rising. There is little else we can do at this time than increase the cost of the publications so as to be able to continue printing Bibles, Bible literature and other materials that are vital to Jehovah’s people and the many new ones associating with us at our Kingdom Halls and in our Bible study activity.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Therefore, beginning September 1, 1981, we will have to put into effect some price changes. We outline herewith some of the items where changes are being made. When ordering and then placing the publications with the pioneers, congregation publishers and the public, you can have such price changes in mind.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">After we receive your September 1 Literature Inventory form (S-18), we will charge your literature account an amount equal to the increase in the value of your stock of literature on hand. This charge should appear on your November statement. It will not create a deficit because it is equaled by the increased value of the literature on hand. When you fill out the September 1 Literature Inventory form, please bear in mind that you should figure your literature at the rates listed on the form in order to determine the true standing of your literature account at the end of the service year. Please do not write in changes or alter the form in any way.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The price of magazines will increase from 10c to 15c each, beginning with the September issues. In August when you receive the September 1 and September 8 issues, you should begin charging magazines at 15c each. When you request pioneer credit on the Remittance and Credit Request form for magazines obtained in August, please list the number of magazines dated in August separate from the number of magazines dated in September. Print the month clearly next to each amount in the space provided for requesting pioneer credit.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">In figuring the standing of your magazine account on the September 1 inventory form, remember to figure the value of August issues at 10c and September at 15c as that is the way they are being charged on your account.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHEN stressing that fleshly distinctions do not affect a Christian’s standing as a member of Christ’s body, the apostle Paul wrote: “There is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all things and in all.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:11-51:3:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Col. 3:11</a>) The inclusion of the Scythians is noteworthy, as these fierce, nomadic people were regarded as the worst of barbarians. However, through the power exerted by God’s holy spirit, even they could put on a Christlike personality, discarding their former ways. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:9-51:3:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Col. 3:9, 10</a>) How powerful is the spirit of God!</p>

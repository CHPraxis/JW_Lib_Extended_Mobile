“Kingdom Loyalty” District Conventions
HOW rare loyalty is today! Citizens display disloyalty by cheating on their taxes; mates cheat on each other; employees cheat on their employers in a multitude of ways; religionists cheat on God by their hypocrisy. How comforting, therefore, is the Scriptural assurance that Jehovah God, above all others, is the loyal One!​—Jer. 3:12; Rev. 15:4; 16:5.
As imitators of God we likewise want to manifest loyalty, and especially do we want to be loyal to Jehovah God and to his kingdom. If we are loyal to Jehovah he will never forsake us.​—Ps. 18:25; 37:28; Rom. 8:35-39.
Satan and his world are seeking to lure us into acts of disloyalty, and so we need all the help we can get to keep loyal. What are the many instances of those who have drifted away, or, worse yet, been disfellowshiped, but examples of disloyalty?
To help us effectively to meet the challenge of being loyal to Jehovah and his kingdom, and in line with our yeartext, Psalm 145:10, 11, the theme “Kingdom Loyalty” has been chosen for our 1981 district conventions. We can be confident that our “Kingdom Loyalty” conventions will be every bit as encouraging, spiritually stimulating and enjoyable as were last year’s “Divine Love” district conventions. There will be upbuilding talks, starting from Thursday morning and continuing through all four days, that none will want to miss.

For Fundamental Bible Knowledge
The beautifully illustrated publication My Book of Bible Stories provides such knowledge in a most interesting, easy-to-understand way. Already over 15 million copies have been printed since its release in 1978. The following letter to the Ghana (Africa) branch office of the Watch Tower Society illustrates the requests for it:
“Dear-In-Christ,
“REQUEST FOR THE PURCHASE OF ‘MY BOOK OF BIBLE STORIES’
“I have read with great satisfaction a copy of the book entitled ‘My Book of Bible Stories,’ borrowed from a friend of mine.
“I have every belief that with my own personal copy of this wonderful book, I shall not only be able to impart the Word of God to my children easily but also to the children of my household, for their fundamental knowledge in Christ.
“I shall be grateful therefore to God if you could send me a copy on re-payment basis, and let me know the price, or you may direct me to a place I can purchase a copy. I would have sent the money through the post direct but unfortunately I do not know the price.
“I hope I should count on your assistance in this urgent matter.
“Hoping to hear from you in due course.
                         Yours-In-Christ,
E. O. A​———.”

Why Control Our Tongue?
Do you know someone who talks too much? Proverbs 10:19 presents a reason for guarding against that. It says: “In the abundance of words there does not fail to be transgression, but the one keeping his lips in check is acting discreetly.”
Jesus’ half brother James confirmed the need to guard against stumbling with the tongue, for failure to bridle it may make one’s worship futile. (Jas. 1:26) None of us can perfectly control our tongue, but we can definitely improve.​—Jas. 3:2-8.
This does not require that we remain mute, never joining in or contributing to conversation. But why not run this test? Take note of your impulses for a while. See if you observe that, in group conversation, you feel impelled to speak up quite a bit on every topic. With conversations on various subjects of life, do you consistently wind up having spoken more than most others in the group? If so, some meditation on Proverbs 10:19 may be a safeguard.

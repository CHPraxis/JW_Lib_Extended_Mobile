<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Do you know someone who talks too much? <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:19-20:10:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:19</a> presents a reason for guarding against that. It says: “In the abundance of words there does not fail to be transgression, but the one keeping his lips in check is acting discreetly.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jesus’ half brother James confirmed the need to guard against stumbling with the tongue, for failure to bridle it may make one’s worship futile. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:26-59:1:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jas. 1:26</a>) None of us can perfectly control our tongue, but we can definitely improve.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:2-59:3:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jas. 3:2-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This does not require that we remain mute, never joining in or contributing to conversation. But why not run this test? Take note of your impulses for a while. See if you observe that, in group conversation, you feel impelled to speak up quite a bit on every topic. With conversations on various subjects of life, do you consistently wind up having spoken more than most others in the group? If so, some meditation on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:19-20:10:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:19</a> may be a safeguard.</p>

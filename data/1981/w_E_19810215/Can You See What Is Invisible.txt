God’s Word Is Alive
Can You See What Is Invisible?
HAVE you ever been in real trouble? Did it seem that there was no way out, no possible relief? That is how a young man felt in the days of God’s prophet Elisha.
Looking back to that time, we find that the Syrians are fighting against the Israelites. However, the king of Israel always seems to know in advance where the Syrians are going to strike. So the Syrian king calls his officers, as you can see, and asks: ‘Who from among us is betraying our troop movements to the king of Israel?’
‘No one,’ an officer answers. ‘It is Elisha, the Israelite prophet. He knows what you say even in the privacy of your own room, and he tells the king of Israel.’
‘Find him,’ the king orders, ‘that we may go and capture him.’ Later, the report is made to the king: “There he is in [the city of] Dothan.” So he sends a large army there with horses and chariots. The soldiers reach the town at night and surround it.
Early the next morning Elisha’s attendant goes outside, and look! all around is the Syrian army! The frightened young man says to Elisha: “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”
“Do not be afraid,” Elisha calmly replies. Then he says something that sounds very strange to his attendant. “There are more who are with us than those who are with them.” But how can that be?
Elisha prays: “O Jehovah, open his eyes, please, that he may see.” And right away his eyes are opened to see what is ordinarily invisible. There on the hillsides are horses and chariots of fire all around. Yes, Jehovah miraculously opens his eyes to see His heavenly armed forces!​—2 Ki. 6:8-23.
Does this mean that God’s angels are ready to help his servants today? Yes, it does! They are really there, even though we cannot see them. And they can come to our help, even as they protected Elisha and his attendant from any harm. Do you see, with your eyes of understanding, God’s invisible heavenly forces?

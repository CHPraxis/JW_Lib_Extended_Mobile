<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>DRUGS</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is high time that the disastrous effects of marijuana and hashish be expressed clearly and understandably. You can be congratulated for handling the drug problem in your “Awake!” magazine in such a realistic manner.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sj">G. S., Germany</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We of the Working Group for the Prevention of Drug Addiction received a copy of “Awake!” and considered the article “Drugs​—How Dangerous Are They?” very carefully. Your contribution has helped place our difficult task in the right light. Our greatest problem, however, is that the number one drug in our country, alcohol, is not being taken seriously. We would be happy if you could publish an article dealing with this problem.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><em>For discussions of misuse of alcohol, please see “Awake!” of March 8, 1980, and May 22, 1981.​—ED.</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Your article on drugs is brave, forthright and timely. Congratulations.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>RELIGION IN POLITICS</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Congratulations on your recent issue of “Awake!” with the articles on “Does Religion Belong in Politics?”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sj">P. J., Kansas</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">I take exception to your articles on “Does Religion Belong in Politics?” Where would all God-fearing people and all the United States of America be if we God-fearing people stopped voting and quit trying to elect men who are followers of Christ’s teaching?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sj">D. W., Florida</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Why can’t we Christians tell the politicians we don’t want bad morals, bad books on the stands, bad TV?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sj">M. C., Missouri</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><em>We agree as to the need of improvement in world conditions but differ as to how this can be accomplished. Our views are bound by the principle stated by Jesus: “My kingdom is no part of this world.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><em>John 18:36</em></a>)​<em>—ED.</em></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">I want to express my appreciation for your frank exposé of the topic “Does Religion Belong in Politics?”</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>THE OCCULT</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Thank you for your fine articles. They are not only informative but comforting in a frightening world. I find each issue very timely. The magazine dealing with the occult and its trappings arrived at a critical time. Being encouraged by friends I was on the verge of getting seriously involved in these things. By carefully reading the articles and references on this subject, I had the strength to tell my friends I could not participate in this.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><strong>VITAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">I want to congratulate you on the fine articles that I have had the chance to read. They are truly matters that affect our very existence. As Coordinator and Supervisor of MOBRAL (Brazilian Literacy Movement) in this municipality, I have made good use of certain articles in my meetings with the personnel. Keep on as you are doing, for we need someone to investigate world events and bring to us readers the facts as they stand.</p>

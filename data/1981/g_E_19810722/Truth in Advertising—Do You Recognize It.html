<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Warning​—this card may damage your wealth.” That was part of the advertising slogan used for Barclaycard, Britain’s leading credit card. Why would a bank issue such a warning about one of its own money-making schemes? “The problem is,” said one bank manager, “it is credit extended without any control and a lot of them are getting into trouble.” This has resulted in mounting uneasiness in the banking world and stress and anxiety among cardholders.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“It was like having four weeks’ extra pay,” said an engineer in the West Midlands in England, because the bank allowed about a month before settlement had to be made. Many cardholders had a similar notion, that the card gave them an imaginary 13th month’s salary, and that got them into financial trouble. An Anglican vicar who used the card admitted: “It led me into awful temptation and they started sending me warning letters.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Perhaps another group of British banks had it right all along when its advertisement said that their credit card was designed to “take the waiting out of wanting.” When a person confuses his wants and needs and can no longer wait, there is bound to be damage not only to his wealth but also to his health, physical and spiritual.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● The 1961 or 1970 revisions of the <em>New World Translation </em>are still in stock in some congregations in regular or pocket-size for $2.50 and these supplies should be used in the field first. The 1961 and 1970 Deluxe editions will continue to be placed for $5.00. We recommend these Deluxe editions also be offered in the field if your congregation has some in stock. When your stock of these Bibles is used up, you may order the 1981 edition. This will be placed for $3.00 for the regular edition and $6.00 for the Deluxe edition. The 192-page books are now 75c.</p>

Stress fact that the more times we offer subscriptions the more likelihood there is of obtaining subscriptions.

Encourage publishers desiring assistance in service or who cannot get to regular meetings for service to talk to study conductors and the service overseer to see if more help can be given.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:6-47:9:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:6</a>.</p>

We view householders as potential sheep. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:13-40:10:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 10:13</a>) No need to be discouraged or upset because of opposition. Viewpoints change as in the case of Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:3-44:8:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 8:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:1-44:9:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 9:1-22</a>) Good to remember <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:1-20:15:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:1</a>. But opposition is usually the exception. We do not come to argue but to share good news. It helps to be a good listener. Work toward knowing what is in the mind of householder. Take time to listen. Be friendly even in the face of apathy. Have Topic for Conversation well in mind. We know the “sheep” will listen.

Ask audience if any have other suggestions on handling similar situation. In second demonstration, after householder refuses magazine offer, have Witness then present tract <em>Is Planet Earth Near the Brink? </em>Householder wishes he could know for sure. Witness points to Bible answer in tract, recommends reading it with Bible and offers to call back later to discuss additional points. Explains to chairman that next time he will review tract to stimulate further interest and offer new magazines. Hopes tract will help person to see crisis earth is facing just as Jesus foretold. Review with audience key points from tract. One can be placed with every householder.</p>

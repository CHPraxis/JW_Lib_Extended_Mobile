<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A reader of the new book “Happiness​—How to Find It” wrote: “I would like to tell you how impressed I am after reading your book. I already feel like a new man. I’m 19 years old and I never felt this good. Thank the Lord that there’s people like you who can really help people.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">We are confident that this Bible aid can help you too. Chapters such as “Youths​—How Can YOU Be Happy?” “Sex​—Which Advice Really Works?” and “Death Is Not an Unbeatable Enemy” may contain just the information you need.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send me, postpaid, the 192-page, hardcover book “Happiness​—How to Find It” for which I enclose 60 cents (U.S.).</p>

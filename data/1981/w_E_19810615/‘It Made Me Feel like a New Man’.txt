‘It Made Me Feel like a New Man’
A reader of the new book “Happiness​—How to Find It” wrote: “I would like to tell you how impressed I am after reading your book. I already feel like a new man. I’m 19 years old and I never felt this good. Thank the Lord that there’s people like you who can really help people.”
We are confident that this Bible aid can help you too. Chapters such as “Youths​—How Can YOU Be Happy?” “Sex​—Which Advice Really Works?” and “Death Is Not an Unbeatable Enemy” may contain just the information you need.
Please send me, postpaid, the 192-page, hardcover book “Happiness​—How to Find It” for which I enclose 60 cents (U.S.).

New Tract to Use with “Happiness” Book
You will have an exciting new item to use with the Happiness book during June and July. It is a colorful new tract, “Is a Happy Life Really Possible?” The tract will be printed with four colors, so it will readily catch attention. It is designed to move persons to have discussions, or a Bible study, using the new Happiness book. We are confident that the tract will be very effective. You will feel the same when you see it and use it in the field service.
Congregations should quickly determine their needs for the two months. Order in lots of 1,000, or multiples thereof, using the S-14 Literature Order Blank. The charge will be $3.50 per 1,000 tracts. Order Kingdom News No. 29.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">You will have an exciting new item to use with the <em>Happiness </em>book during June and July. It is a colorful new tract, “Is a Happy Life Really Possible?” The tract will be printed with four colors, so it will readily catch attention. It is designed to move persons to have discussions, or a Bible study, using the new <em>Happiness </em>book. We are confident that the tract will be very effective. You will feel the same when you see it and use it in the field service.</p>

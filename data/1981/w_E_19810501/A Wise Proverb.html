<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Anyone stupid finds no delight in discernment, except that his heart should uncover itself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:2-20:18:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 18:2</a>) This proverb contains an instructive lesson. A stupid person does not highly evaluate discernment. In his egotism he does not wish to have depth of understanding as to what is true and what is not. There is one thing in which he does excel, however. That is in boldly and frequently stating his opinions, with the misplaced confidence that they are right. Thus he uncovers what he truly is. His loquacity thus serves to alert others to the sort of individual the stupid one is.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:19-20:10:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:19</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Some time ago a brief letter was received from a woman in Des Moines, Iowa. She wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“A very nice lady came to my door today and gave me a book called ‘The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life.’ I just finished it. The first time I’ve read 190 pages of anything in one day of my life. On June 29, 1967, I stopped believing in God. Today I started thinking again.”</p>

It Will Make You Think
Some time ago a brief letter was received from a woman in Des Moines, Iowa. She wrote:
“A very nice lady came to my door today and gave me a book called ‘The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life.’ I just finished it. The first time I’ve read 190 pages of anything in one day of my life. On June 29, 1967, I stopped believing in God. Today I started thinking again.”
Would you like to do some thought-provoking reading too? Then clip this coupon and receive the hardcover book “The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life.”
I am enclosing 60 cents (U.S.).

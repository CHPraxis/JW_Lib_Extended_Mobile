An Encouraging Report
The October 1980 service report is most encouraging. Compared with October 1979, total publishers increased by 4.4 percent. We devoted 533,829 more hours, placed 292,415 more magazines, made 191,220 more return visits, conducted 30,130 more Bible studies and obtained 11,112 more new subscriptions. Truly we are grateful for Jehovahâ€™s blessings upon our united efforts!

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Bible has come alive for both young and old through the pages of “My Book of Bible Stories,” a beautifully illustrated publication. A letter from Denmark says of the reaction of an elderly man on receiving this book:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“It was absolutely wonderful for me to see how he reacted to ‘My Book of Bible Stories.’ His eyes were beaming with joy each time he turned a leaf of the book. . . . When I returned some time later, he obtained more copies of the book, explaining that he read it aloud to his many great-grandchildren. He is 97 years old.”</p>

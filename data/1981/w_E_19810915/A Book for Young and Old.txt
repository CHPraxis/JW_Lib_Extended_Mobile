A Book for Young and Old
The Bible has come alive for both young and old through the pages of “My Book of Bible Stories,” a beautifully illustrated publication. A letter from Denmark says of the reaction of an elderly man on receiving this book:
“It was absolutely wonderful for me to see how he reacted to ‘My Book of Bible Stories.’ His eyes were beaming with joy each time he turned a leaf of the book. . . . When I returned some time later, he obtained more copies of the book, explaining that he read it aloud to his many great-grandchildren. He is 97 years old.”

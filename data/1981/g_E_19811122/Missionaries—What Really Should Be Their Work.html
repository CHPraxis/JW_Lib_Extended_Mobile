<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">FOUR missionaries were gunned down in a Central American country and the shots were heard around the world. The 1979 killing of these women brought to the front page an old question: What really should be the work of Christian missionaries?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The role of these four missionaries has been hotly debated. Viewpoints differ about what a missionary should do. One graduate of a Catholic missionary school reportedly declared: “We don’t want to change people​—we only want to help them.” Many feel that missionaries should help by establishing hospitals, secular schools, refugee centers or orphanages​—principally, care for people’s material needs.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Others now believe that they should make the poor people that they serve more conscious of their situation and rights. “It used to be God’s will to accept the suffering,” stated one South American Catholic missionary. “Now it’s God’s will to denounce the suffering.” This attitude has brought missionaries in conflict with some national governments.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Are such activities really the work of a Christian missionary? Are they the best way to help people?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong><em>A Different Kind of Missionary</em></strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">At least one missionary school is convinced that the role of a Christian missionary is to <em>teach people the Bible. </em>Established nearly 40 years ago, while World War II was raging, the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead began producing missionaries who would engage only in Bible education. “Your principal work,” stated the then president, N. H. Knorr, on the school’s opening day, “is that of preaching the gospel of the Kingdom from house to house as did Jesus and the apostles.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Those successfully completing the course receive a diploma that states that the graduate is “specially qualified to engage in educational work, promoting goodwill and working in behalf of permanent peace.” So those of the current graduating class (see picture) are to promote peace, not strife. “Our missionaries are to be Bible educators,” stated the first registrar of the School, A. D. Schroeder. “They are to give people the finest education of the heart with the Word of God.” To help the students to fulfill this role, Bible courses are featured. A detailed study of each book of the Bible forms a major portion of the curriculum.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">But is such Bible education practical? ‘Many people today need medical attention, proper food and housing,’ exclaim missionaries of traditional religions. ‘They need material help <em>first. </em>Then we can tend to their spiritual needs.’ So is the role of Gilead-trained missionaries unrealistic? What have the results of nearly 40 years proved?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong><em>“An Education in Living”</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“I came home in tears the first few days of my working in the poor areas of my <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>assignment in a Central American country because of the living conditions,” stated Charlotte Bowin Schroeder, a member of the first class. Julia Clogston, who accompanied Charlotte, added, “but when persons began following the Bible, their family life would improve, their home would become cleaner, they even dressed better. In fact, at one of our conventions the daughter of a former president of the country was working alongside several other young Witness girls. Yet you couldn’t tell the difference in the way the girls dressed. Those from unfortunate circumstances were dressed as clean and neat as the former president’s daughter!”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">But how did Bible education accomplish this? Julia illustrates: “A husband whose wife was already studying the Bible with a Gilead missionary asked me, ‘What do you have to do to become a Witness?’ I showed him <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Galatians chapter 5 [verses 19-21]</a>, where it says to stop such practices as sexual immorality, fits of anger, drunkenness and the like. He too began to study the Bible.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">“At the time he was sharing his meager earnings with ‘another woman.’ This adulterous practice was common. Some men even supported several families. Applying the Bible, he stopped his adultery. His family had more money, for even though he earned a small amount, it all went to <em>one </em>place! As a Witness he now took pride in his family. I have seen scores of cases just like this,” said Julia.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">This Bible educational work was not limited to the poor. Among those taught by the graduates of that first class of Gilead was a government official who certainly did not need the material help of any missionary. Yet why was Bible knowledge so valuable to him?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">“The Bible helped our family to appreciate the realities of life and not live in a dreamworld,” reflected this official’s son, Baltasar Perla, Jr. “Dad realized from the Bible that having a ‘big name’ did not make you a better person than others. As a result, we developed warm, lasting friendships, for we could see the real worth and value of others. We learned how to treat people of all backgrounds with respect.” Then pausing, as if to look back on his life, Baltasar added, “I think of the wealthy persons in our country who overnight lost everything. Or those in high positions who are too busy working to enjoy their families, perhaps paying maids to care for the children. How empty my life would be if wealth had been the biggest thing in our lives! Though we had maids to do household chores, I’m glad that my parents didn’t have one to care for us children, but gave us their time. The Bible education by the missionaries gave our family right values in living!”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong><em>Is Bible Education Practical?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Among the 27 graduates of the most recent Gilead class, the 71st, was a couple born and raised in the Philippines, Jamir and Rufina Dela Paz. Jamir, before coming to Gilead, taught people the Bible in a area served by missionaries of other churches. “If yours is a true Christian religion, why don’t you give food to the poor as we do?” said one of these missionaries. “I <em>am </em>giving out ‘food!”’ replied Jamir. “No, not like yours, but spiritual ‘food.”’ He added: “Wait till you run out of food to give to those people, then we’ll know who is doing the work of God.” Which method was really practical?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">“Sure enough, the food ran out,” reported Jamir. “One by one persons stopped going to the church, which today is practically abandoned. But what a contrast with the still-thriving congregation I helped to establish there by using the Bible!</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">“One of these families, before becoming <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>Witnesses, received food handouts from this mission. The man ran around with many women and was not married to the woman with whom he was living. Being poor, neither they nor their children had proper clothing and shelter,” explained Jamir. “Then I began to study the Bible with him. He soon wanted to straighten out his life so he asked the woman with whom he lived to marry him.” Her reply: “Absolutely not!” She told Jamir: “You can never trust that man. I know as soon as I turn my back he will have another woman!”</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Only after observing the faithful conduct of the man for a year did she concede to marriage. “But what changes!” exclaimed Jamir. “Both became Jehovah’s Witnesses and stopped smoking, overdrinking and playing the lottery. They now could buy proper clothing and food​—even fix up their home. Their neighbors talked about their better way of life. Now they not only have the necessities but also a rich family life, self-respect and a solid hope for the future.”</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">But can Bible education create genuine peace? Can it promote goodwill among people, as the diploma given to the Gilead missionaries promises?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong><em>The Key to Real Peace</em></strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">“Since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed,” so states the preamble of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), admitting the need for proper education to bring peace. Many government leaders recognize that it is a strong moral fiber in a country that contributes to peace. In fact, Charlotte Schroeder recalls making several visits to the president of the country wherein she served to discuss the work of missionaries. “We told him that our work helped the country,” explained Charlotte, “for it teaches people to get along with others and to refrain from violence.” So impressed was the president that he also began a study of the Bible with the Witnesses after his term was completed.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">“When you have over 7,500 persons of all social classes who refuse to kill, cheat or steal, and who are talking about these high principles with their neighbors in a country of some 4 1/2 million people, it has to improve the moral fiber of the country and promote peace,” argued Julia Clogston.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Because Gilead missionaries unselfishly give of themselves, many warm friendships have been forged with the local people. Rufina Dela Paz reflected on the relationship she and her parents had with the Gilead missionaries who helped them to apply Bible principles when they were becoming Witnesses many years ago. “Our family felt so close to the missionaries because they did even more than study the Bible with us,” said Rufina. “They visited our home frequently just to encourage us and help my parents with their problems.”</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Yet the love was not one-sided. While attending Gilead, Rufina received a letter from the former missionary who had helped her family. Though 30 years have passed, he wrote: “Your mother is one of those many mothers Jesus promised to those who would leave home and family for the sake of the good news. How much I appreciate the attention she gave to me when I was stung by the stingray and was very sick! I will never forget her love.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:29-41:10:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 10:29, 30</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">An ‘unforgettable love.’ Yes, it is this same love that those who graduated on September 13, 1981, contemplate giving and receiving as they leave for 14 lands. Their work: Bible education​—the only Scriptural and practical work of a genuine Christian missionary.</p>

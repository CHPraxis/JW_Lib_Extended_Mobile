Attractiveness Is​—Good Looks or Good Nature?
What makes a person appear attractive and pleasing to others? Many people put the emphasis on looks, grooming and style. But several independent studies have found that personality and behavior far outweigh physical appearance or features, such as the mouth, eyes, nose, hair, and so forth. People generally associate attractiveness with warmth and kindness, the studies found. If such qualities are apparent, even ordinary-looking individuals are perceived by others as good-looking.
So far better than plastic surgery or high fashion is the Bible’s advice: “Do not let your adornment be that of the external braiding of the hair and of the putting on of gold ornaments or the wearing of outer garments, but let it be the secret person of the heart in the incorruptible apparel of the quiet and mild spirit.” (1 Pet. 3:3, 4; see also Proverbs 31:30.) Surely, attention to one’s physical appearance has its place. But to cultivate and express spiritual qualities in one’s daily life is a far more positive approach to becoming attractive and pleasing to others.

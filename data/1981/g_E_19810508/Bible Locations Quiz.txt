Bible Locations Quiz
DO YOU think of the Bible as something unrelated to the real world? A lot of people feel this way.
It is noteworthy, however, that a respected scholar, George Rawlinson, M.A., pointed out that because of the factual nature of the Bible, Christianity “is in nothing more distinguished from the other religions of the world than in its objective or historical character.” Did you realize that? Now, this is not true of every doctrine taught by all the groups that claim to be Christian. But it is true that the Christianity taught in the Bible itself is based on facts, not myths. This is because the Bible tells about real people who lived at particular times in precise locations.
One such real person was Jesus Christ. The Bible mentions numerous places connected with his first-century ministry. The present-day locations of many of these sites have been agreed on by most authorities. The map across the page shows some of these locations, but they are identified here only by number. Can you fill in the names?
The clues will help you. Don’t give up too soon; some places will have more than one clue. The numbers following the clues correspond to the numbered locations on the map. The Bible references following the list of clues will also help you; these, too, are keyed by number to the map.

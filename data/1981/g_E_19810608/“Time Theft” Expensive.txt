“Time Theft” Expensive
“Time theft” practices by employees cost Canadian business some $10 billion in 1980, according to a study done by Robert Half Agencies, Inc. The figure is an estimate based upon projections from findings by the agency in 1977 when the cost was set at $8 billion.
Gillian Shaw, Vancouver “Sun” business writer, reports that the study pointed out that an average of 3.5 hours per worker per week were lost to such practices as Friday and Monday absenteeism, employees being late for work, talking on the job, making personal telephone calls and taking extended lunch periods. The agency’s president likened such “time theft” to the crime of shoplifting.
Extremes of what he termed “planned time theft” included that involving persons who operate various businesses of their own on company time, even using company stationery and its business address to conduct their private enterprises.
Even the coffee break is abused by many, though it is itself a concession made by business after finding out it could not stamp out that form of “time theft” in years gone by.
The Christian worker who conscientiously applies the Bible counsel of Ephesians 4:28 will not be a cause of such tremendous loss, the cost of which eventually must be borne by all.

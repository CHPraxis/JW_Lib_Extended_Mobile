<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">BACK IN 1947, atomic scientists concerned about nuclear war invented a “doomsday clock” to dramatize their fears. The clock has since become the best known symbol of the publication “Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.” Should the hands of the clock reach midnight, it will mean that nuclear war has begun.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Recently the position of the hands was set ahead​—from seven minutes before midnight to only four minutes to that hour. Quite a jump! The hands have been moved only 10 times in 33 years.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Why do the scientists think the world is now getting closer to nuclear war? Because of the failure of the SALT II arms treaty and because of each side’s stated willingness to fight a “limited” nuclear war.</p>

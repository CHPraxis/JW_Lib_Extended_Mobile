<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Last year letters like this one were received: “I would like to express my appreciation for the ‘1980 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.’ This book captivated me and held my attention during the two days it took to read it. The experiences were faith-strengthening, especially for a teenager like myself, and instilled in me the urge to pioneer [become a Christian missionary] as did so many written about in the book. Surely we can see the blessings these pioneers had in the proclamation of God’s Word.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The 384-page “1981 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses” contains the same kind of exciting, faith-strengthening experiences. It tells of stalwart men and women who left family, friends and homeland to bring Bible truths to remote peoples. Learn of the opposition, superstitions and other obstacles that were overcome to bring the good news of God’s kingdom to peoples in the Ivory Coast, Upper Volta, El Salvador and New Zealand. Send for your copy. Only $1 (U.S.), postpaid.</p>

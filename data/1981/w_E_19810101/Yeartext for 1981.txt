Yeartext for 1981
Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide are delighted that their loving God has given them the privilege of announcing his Kingdom. With loyalty to Jehovah, therefore, they are determined to press on in this blessed activity.
Each year, Jehovah’s people are pleased to have before their minds a specially selected Bible text. It spurs them onward in “sacred service” and provides spiritually upbuilding food for thought.​—Rom. 12:1; Rev. 7:9-17.
During the 1981 calendar year, Jehovah’s Witnesses will have as their yeartext the following words of the divinely inspired psalmist David, who said of Jehovah God:
“Your loyal ones will bless you. About the glory of your kingship they will talk.”​—Ps. 145:10, 11.

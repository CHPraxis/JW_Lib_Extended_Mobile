<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">With regard to cancer, there appears to be a distinct difference between men and women. Only 10 percent of the cancer in men is in a specifically sex organ, the prostate. Yet nearly 40 percent of the cases in women involve cancer of the uterus or breast, organs that are associated with reproduction.</p>

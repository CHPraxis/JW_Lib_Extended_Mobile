<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Your polemics on smoking about turned me off. You sound like those who were going to cure the evils of the world when they got prohibition. Most thinking people realize how that worked out.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Please send me 10 copies of your “Awake!” on smoking. The article was very good and it has helped me to quit smoking. I’d like to share it with some smoking friends. I am not interested in being visited or becoming a member, as I‘m affiliated with another religious body; but I do appreciate what you’re doing. Keep up the good work.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">I am a single parent (divorced not by my own choice). I’d like to say this: Divorce is not the recommended way. However, the innocent victims need not feel that the world ends there. It doesn’t. Oftentimes a new and better life begins. It did with me. To be honest, I am much happier now and my children seem happier. My daughter’s grades have improved. I’m sure we all know of single-parent homes that are far happier and more successful than many two-parent homes. It really depends. Life is what you make it.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">As a father of four children I just had to drop you this line of thanks. I have just read “Awake!” of April 8 on children and parents. As a court reporter employed by a family court, I have heard and written millions of words dealing with the full gamut of family problems, and particularly with children. I have never read anything so touching to the heart. Also I can see the need for an immediate adjustment in my own household.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">We have found the crossword puzzles especially helpful in teaching the children. They have their own Bibles and, with questions phrased to their understanding, thoroughly enjoy finding the books required to give the answers. This is teaching them to find their way around in God’s Word.</p>

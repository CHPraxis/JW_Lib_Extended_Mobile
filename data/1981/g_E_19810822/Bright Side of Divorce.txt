Bright Side of Divorce?
One Soviet marriage out of three now ends in divorce. But rather than viewing the rapidly rising divorce rate with alarm, Soviet authorities apparently try to give the statistics a positive turn. Female sociologist Zoia Yankova writes that the fact that Soviet women most often initiate divorce proceedings “proves that the Soviet woman has achieved full emancipation and is in as good a position to divorce as men are.”

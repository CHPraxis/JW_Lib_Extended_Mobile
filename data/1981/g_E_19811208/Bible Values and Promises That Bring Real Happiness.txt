Bible Values and Promises That Bring Real Happiness
The Bible is not a book of politics or economics. It does, however, condemn injustice and foretell the end of man-made systems and their replacement by a new order of peace and prosperity under God’s Kingdom government.
SPIRITUAL VALUES ABOVE MATERIAL PROSPERITY:
“Happy is the man that has found wisdom, and the man that gets discernment, for having it as gain is better than having silver as gain . . . Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its roadways are peace. It is a tree of life to those taking hold of it, and those keeping fast hold of it are to be called happy.”​—Prov. 3:13-18.
GREED CONDEMNED:
“Woe to the ones joining house to house, and those who annex field to field until there is no more room.”​—Isa. 5:8.
“Incline my heart to your reminders, and not to profits.”​—Ps. 119:36.
WARNING AGAINST MATERIALISM:
“Men who set their hearts on being wealthy expose themselves to temptation. They fall into a trap . . . For loving money leads to all kinds of evil.”​—1 Tim. 6:9, 10, “Phillips,” Revised Edition.
“A person’s true life is not made up of the things he owns, no matter how rich he may be.”​—Luke 12:15, “Today’s English Version.”
PROMISE OF A JUST NEW ORDER:
“We have his [God’s] promise, and look forward to new heavens and a new earth, the home of justice.”​—2 Pet. 3:13, “The New English Bible.”
THE END OF ALL OPPRESSION:
“The oppressor has reached his end; the despoiling has terminated; those trampling down others have been finished off the earth. And in loving-kindness a throne will certainly be firmly established; and one [Christ, the Messianic King] must sit down upon it in trueness in the tent of David, judging and seeking justice and being prompt in righteousness.”​—Isa. 16:4, 5.
A LIFE OF SPIRITUAL AND MATERIAL ABUNDANCE:
“The earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.”​—Isa. 11:9. “The earth itself will certainly give its produce; God, our God, will bless us.”​—Ps. 67:6.

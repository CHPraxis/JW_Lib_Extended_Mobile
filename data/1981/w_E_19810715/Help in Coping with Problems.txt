Help in Coping with Problems
Would you care for such help? One woman says her family has received it from reading the book Making Your Family Life Happy. She writes:
“When I first started reading it I couldn’t stop. . . . I found this book to be so important because today, more than ever before, we feel the pressures of this system and sometimes we tend to take it out on our families. But now, by referring to different chapters, we can cope with problems and get the best and the most out of the time that we spend together as a family.”
Reading together such chapters as “The Value of Disciplining in Love” and “Keeping the Lines of Communication Open” has helped many families to deal with problems. Receive this valuable book by filling in and mailing this coupon.

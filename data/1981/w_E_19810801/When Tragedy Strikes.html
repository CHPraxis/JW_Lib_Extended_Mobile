<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE family apparently did not have much materially. Yet they had a great deal for which to be thankful. Their land was productive, the climate was pleasantly warm most of the year, and they had an ideal location.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Their city of Nain was beautifully situated in the fertile plain of Esdraelon on the northwest side of the Hill of Moreh. From their home the family could look out across a green valley to the gracefully wooded hills of Galilee only a few miles away. And, towering in the distance beyond, the snowcapped summit of Mount Hermon and the Lebanon mountains could be seen. How pleasant it was at the day’s end to sit out on the housetop and view the scenery​—just the three of them together—​the man, his wife and their young son!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Then one day tragedy struck​—the man died. What a bitter experience! Now there would no longer be those peaceful evenings together. However, the woman took consolation in the fact that she still had her son. Her hopes, desires and ambitions became wrapped up in his future. In this way she again found meaning and purpose in life.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">But then tragedy struck once more. The son died. Now there was no one in whom she could find consolation. The widow’s grief was great as the son’s remains were prepared for burial.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Perhaps you are familiar with the empty feeling that comes with losing a loved one. How depressed and utterly helpless you can feel! Death is indeed a bitter enemy. On such occasions, a person is very concerned about the future for the dead. Is there really hope for them?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Imagine if someone could come along <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>and take the hand of your dear one and deliver him back to you alive and healthy once again. What joy you would have! How wonderful it would be!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">‘But that is impossible,’ you may say. True, it has never happened in our lifetime. Yet it <em>has </em>happened before. Women have received their dead back by resurrection.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">When did this happen? Why can we believe it? What does it mean for us today?</p>

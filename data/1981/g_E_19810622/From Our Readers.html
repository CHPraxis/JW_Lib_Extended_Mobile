<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Lately it seems as though there has been an outpouring of articles “pounding” on the sad fate of broken homes. All these articles may be true, but how do they make the innocent victims feel? To me it feels like someone constantly saying over and over again: “You lost your mate; you’re hurting. You and your kids are doomed to sadness.” Why do we have to be constantly reminded of how misfortunate we are, how unhappy our kids are, how bad we are going to fare in life?</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Thank you again for another article on dealing with single parents, “Just you and me, Mom.” Sometimes being a single parent really can be quite a battle, but when I can read an article that deals with my situation, it helps me to be balanced. Please, Please, Please continue.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">I need to thank you [for the articles on rape]. Four weeks ago after leaving work at a department store at a shopping mall at 7:30, I went to my car that was parked nearby and quickly got in. Out of nowhere a man pulled my car door open and threatened to kill me if I didn’t get in the back seat. I didn’t have to stop and think how to react. I started screaming loudly and clawing at his head, and when he said he was going to kill me, I screamed, “No, you aren’t.” Anyway, he knew it wouldn’t be easy. The counsel on not being intimidated helped immensely. Thankfully, he ran away, and I locked the door and drove home.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">I especially liked that number, since I was raped at the age of 6 and, believe me, I will never forget the fact. I am now 14 years old. I thought it was excellent, the advice you gave us on how we can protect ourselves. I thought it important to stress in that issue that in the majority of cases relatives are the guilty ones, as was true in my case.</p>

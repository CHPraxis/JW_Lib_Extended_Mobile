Fireflies Mystify Evolutionists
The insect world is famous for its “femme fatales”​—female insects that seduce males and then dine on them. Female fireflies of the genus “Photuris” mimic the light-flashings of other firefly species, then eat the males of those species that respond. Now, the plot thickens. Photuris males also mimic the light signals of these other species, and Photuris females who come to dine may end up mating.
Evolutionists ponder how this most complex example of mimicry known to exist in the insect kingdom evolved. An authority in the field offered these explanations: The male may be trying to seduce the hunting female Photuris to mate with him​—before she eats him. Old males unable to compete in gaining a mate may be sacrificing themselves for the sake of the vitality of the next generation​—noble souls! Third explanation​—and an evolutionary gem—​the males are trying to find sexually unresponsive females and rape them!

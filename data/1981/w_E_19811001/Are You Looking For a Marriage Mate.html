<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">What qualities in a mate will contribute most to a happy marriage? A young woman, who was wondering about this, wrote in a letter of appreciation:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I really didn’t have anywhere I could go to for information on choosing a mate or what questions to ask yourself when considering marriage. I have been praying continually to Jehovah for help in choosing my mate . . . I could hardly believe it when the book ‘Making Your Family Life Happy’ was released. It was truly an answer to my prayers. And I know it will help me to become a good wife, one my husband would be proud of. I thank you for publishing the new book. It is greatly appreciated by me.”</p>

It Helped Them Stop Smoking
A young student in Belgium stopped smoking. When the opportunity arose, he explained to his schoolmates the reason why. He showed them what was said on the matter in Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It, placing copies of the book with them.
One of the students stopped smoking after reading the book. The mother of another student read the book, and forbade her son to continue to smoke. Another mother requested more literature. The director of the school was impressed by what was happening, and also became interested in the literature of Jehovah’s Witnesses. All together 30 books were distributed.
Besides discussing smoking, this book covers the use of drugs and alcohol, and many other matters that affect youths, including sports, music, dancing, dating and courtship. Receive a copy by filling in and mailing the coupon.
Please send, postpaid, the hardbound, 192-page book “Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It.” I enclose 60 cents (U.S.).

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">After reading the book “Making Your Family Life Happy,” a young man who had been thinking of marriage wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“How happy I was to read through this book! The material is exactly what I have been looking for.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I am single, twenty-four years of age, and have prayerfully been thinking of marriage. I knew that marriage would not be easy. I knew that it meant a lot of giving by both. What I did not know was, How can I handle problems when they arise? After reading through this material, I can feel confident of success by applying the principles within.”</p>

● In the illustration of the 10 virgins (Matt. 25:1-13), who made the cry: “Here is the bridegroom! Be on your way out to meet him”?
Jesus did not say. In a Hebrew wedding such as Jesus was using to make an illustration, the bridegroom probably would have been accompanied by male attendants or friends. (John 3:29) These could alert any people awaiting the bridegroom’s party. However, there was no need for Jesus to mention such attendants. Nor would there be any application of them in a figurative way. The point is that there was a cry that alerted the virgins, moving them to activity.

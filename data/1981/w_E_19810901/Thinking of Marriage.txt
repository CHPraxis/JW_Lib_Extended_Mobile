Thinking of Marriage?
After reading the book “Making Your Family Life Happy,” a young man who had been thinking of marriage wrote:
“How happy I was to read through this book! The material is exactly what I have been looking for.
“I am single, twenty-four years of age, and have prayerfully been thinking of marriage. I knew that marriage would not be easy. I knew that it meant a lot of giving by both. What I did not know was, How can I handle problems when they arise? After reading through this material, I can feel confident of success by applying the principles within.”
If you are thinking of marriage, or are already married, such chapters as “Laying a Fine Foundation for Your Marriage,” “A Husband Who Gains Deep Respect” and “A Wife Who Is Dearly Loved” can really help you. Receive your copy by filling in and mailing the coupon.

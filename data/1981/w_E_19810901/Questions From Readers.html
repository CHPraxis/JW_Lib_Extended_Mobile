<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● In the illustration of the 10 virgins (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:1-40:25:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Matt. 25:1-13</strong></a><strong>), who made the cry: “Here is the bridegroom! Be on your way out to meet him”?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jesus did not say. In a Hebrew wedding such as Jesus was using to make an illustration, the bridegroom probably would have been accompanied by male attendants or friends. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:29-43:3:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 3:29</a>) These could alert any people awaiting the bridegroom’s party. However, there was no need for Jesus to mention such attendants. Nor would there be any application of them in a figurative way. The point is that there was a cry that alerted the virgins, moving them to activity.</p>

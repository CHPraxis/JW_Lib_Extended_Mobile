<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">How thankful we all are for Jehovah’s rich blessings upon our efforts during the 1981 service year! On April 19, 1981, we had the highest number ever to attend a Memorial celebration in this country. Then, during the summer months 1,057,237 attended the district conventions in the United States. This was another peak figure. And now, to close out the 1981 service year, a new all-time peak of 588,503 publishers was reached. This is 11,134 more than the previous publisher peak back in November of 1975. Let us continue moving forward as loyal Kingdom proclaimers, praying that the Word of God will keep on growing in its powerful influence on our lives and that the number of new disciples will keep on multiplying.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:6:7-44:6:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 6:7</a>.</p>

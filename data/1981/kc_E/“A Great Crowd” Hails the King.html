<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 4. What is the relation of Jesus to his “little flock”?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>In Bible times, and even down to our day, an Oriental shepherd enjoyed a most intimate relationship with his sheep. He called each one by name, and they knew his voice and responded readily as he led them in and out of the sheepfold. In <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:1-43:10:42" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John chapter 10</a> Jesus drew on this in illustrating, first, the loving relationship between himself and his “little flock” of 144,000 anointed followers, saying: “I am the fine shepherd, and I know my sheep and my sheep know me, just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I surrender my soul in behalf of the sheep.” These become part of <span id="page153" class="pageNum" data-no="153" data-before-text="153"></span>“Abraham’s seed,” through which “all the families” of the earth are to bless themselves.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:14-43:10:15" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 10:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:12:3-1:12:3" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Genesis 12:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:28-48:3:29" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Galatians 3:28, 29</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>What, then, is the relation of “the fine shepherd” to the families of mankind that are to live forever on earth? A most blessed one! For Jesus says of these:</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="si">“And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold [of the “little flock”]; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Today, a “great crowd” of these “other sheep” are to be observed as they pasture along with the “little flock”​—all of them unitedly obeying the “voice” of their shepherd in preaching “this good news of the kingdom . . . in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations.” Happy is your portion if you are one of these! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:14</a>) Under the Kingdom rule, the number of the “other sheep” will increase into the billions by means of the resurrection of the earthly dead, as God’s purpose to populate the earth with righteous humans moves on to its completion.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 1:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 6. How does Jesus’ prophecy indicate when the “other sheep” come into prominence?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>That the “other sheep” come into prominence at “the conclusion of the system of things” is shown by the illustration with which Jesus closes out his prophecy on the “sign” of his presence. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3</a>) He says:</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si">“When the Son of man arrives in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne. <span id="page154" class="pageNum" data-no="154" data-before-text="154"></span>And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Since the glorious King and his angels are invisible to human eyes, how does he carry out the separating work?</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 7. (a) How is the separating work directed? (b) What must you do to receive a favorable judgment, and why?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>The holy angels give direction to that work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Revelation 14:6-12</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:26-44:8:29" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 8:26-29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:1-44:10:8" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 10:1-8</a>.) And here on earth the remaining ones of the “little flock,” who are called the King’s “brothers” at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:40-40:25:40" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 25:40</a>, take the lead in the preaching of the “good news.” The King judges people according to their response to his “brothers” and the Kingdom message that they proclaim. What they do to his “brothers” he counts as done to himself. People who receive the King’s “brothers” hospitably are in line for a blessing. Are you one of these? Of course, you must follow through, in accepting the Kingdom message wholeheartedly and in becoming a dedicated, baptized servant of Jehovah, on the basis of Jesus’ name​—for “there is no salvation in anyone else.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:4:12-44:4:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 4:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:35-40:25:40" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Matthew 25:35-40</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 8. In what invitation and promises may you share?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>As one of the Lord’s “other sheep,” to what may you look forward? What will be the result of your obeying the “voice” of your “fine shepherd” and “king”? In pronouncing judgment, the King says to the humble “sheep” at his right hand of favor: “Come, you who have been blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the founding of the world.” You may expect to <span id="page155" class="pageNum" data-no="155" data-before-text="155"></span>share in these Kingdom blessings proceeding from our Father, as the ‘righteous ones depart into everlasting life.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:34-40:25:34" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 25:34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:46-40:25:46" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 46</a>) Yes, you may expect to share in the fulfillment of many prophetic promises, such as that in Isaiah, which says of Jehovah: “He will actually swallow up death forever, and the Sovereign Lord Jehovah will certainly wipe the tears from all faces. And the reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth, for Jehovah himself has spoken it.” Wicked men may reproach you only a short time longer. For God’s promise is that all who hope in Jehovah will enter soon into a veritable “banquet” of good things in a “new earth.” You want to share in that “banquet,” do you not?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:6-23:25:9" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 25:6-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:66:22-23:66:22" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 66:22</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>It may not be easy for you to pursue a course of righteousness in these “last days.” Satan and his dupes may ridicule you, as they make their last all-out attempt to ruin this earth and mankind on it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:3-61:3:4" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:1</a>) When you call on your neighbors with the Kingdom message, you may find some who display a goatlike disposition.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>However, as one of the Lord’s “sheep” you should not try to judge who may be a “goat.” It is for the King, not for his “sheep” here on earth, to do the judging. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:10-45:14:12" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Romans 14:10-12</a>.) And, though you may meet with opposition because of your becoming a proclaimer of the “good news,” God will strengthen you to do his will, as the <span id="page156" class="pageNum" data-no="156" data-before-text="156"></span>apostle Peter indicated in these words: “The God of all undeserved kindness . . . will himself finish your training, he will make you firm, he will make you strong.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:10-60:5:10" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:10</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:10-47:12:10" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 12:10</a>.) Also, the apostle Paul gives this fine admonition: “Do not loiter at your [Kingdom] business. Be aglow with the spirit. Slave for Jehovah. Rejoice in the hope. Endure under tribulation. Persevere in prayer.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:11-45:12:12" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Romans 12:11, 12</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Your loyal service and fervent prayers to Jehovah, along with your exemplary Christian behavior, may result in some who at first <em>appeared </em>to be “goats” turning out to be “sheep.” The patient, respectful conduct of Christian wives has often been effective in winning over unbelieving husbands “without a word.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:1-60:3:2" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:1, 2</a>) Certainly we do not want to see people “depart into everlasting cutting-off,” but, rather, we should want to help them to shed goatish dispositions, so as to attain to everlasting life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:41-40:25:41" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 25:41,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:46-40:25:46" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 46</a>.</p>

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">12. How have the King’s “brothers” and the “sheep” supported one another in modern times?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>It is to be noted that the “sheep” of Jesus’ illustration went out of their way to minister to the King’s “brothers” while these were sick and in prison. And in some parts of the earth today, privation and persecution, sickness and imprisonment have been the experience not only of the “little flock” but also of the “other sheep” who are serving so loyally and unitedly with them. For example, during 1933 to 1945, when the Nazi Hitler <span id="page157" class="pageNum" data-no="157" data-before-text="157"></span>was making his drive for world domination, Jehovah’s Witnesses underwent bitter persecutions​—first in the Nazi-Fascist countries and later in all the warring nations. Many, both of the “little flock” and of the Lord’s “other sheep,” were killed. But they conquered marvelously in holding fast their integrity to the King and his kingdom!</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">13, 14. What contrast has been noted between the stand of Christendom’s religions and that of Jehovah’s Witnesses?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>The contrast between the compromising stand of Christendom’s religions and the integrity of Jehovah’s Witnesses under pressure has often been commented on by historians. For example, in the book <em>A History of Christianity, </em>published in London, England, in 1976, Paul Johnson says first of the Catholic and Evangelical churches in Hitler’s Germany: “Both churches, in the main, gave massive support to the regime. The Catholic bishops welcomed ‘the new, strong stress on authority in the German state’; Bishop Bornewasser told the Catholic youth in Trier Cathedral: ‘With raised heads and firm step we have entered the new reich and we are prepared to serve it with all the might of our body and soul.’ In January 1934, Hitler saw twelve Evangelical leaders, and after this meeting they . . . issued a communique which pledged ‘the leaders of the German Evangelical Church unanimously affirm their unconditional loyalty to the Third Reich and its leader.’”</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Then, with reference to the few professing Christians who he said “stuck to their principles,” the writer goes on to say: “The bravest were the Jehovah’s Witnesses, who proclaimed their outright doctrinal opposition from the beginning and suffered accordingly. They refused any cooperation <span id="page158" class="pageNum" data-no="158" data-before-text="158"></span>with the Nazi state which they denounced as totally evil. . . . Many were sentenced to death for refusing military service . . . ; or they ended in Dachau or lunatic asylums. A third were actually killed; ninety-seven per cent suffered persecution in one form or another. They were the only Christian group which aroused Himmler’s admiration.”</p>

Throughout the earth, whether in Axis or Allied countries, the King’s “brothers” and their companion “sheep” were mobbed, beaten up, imprisoned and maltreated. But they conquered in their spiritual warfare. The Devil could not crack their loyalty to the Kingdom.

Shortly, Theocratic Ministry Schools were set up in all congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and these have served invaluably in training male and female Witnesses to speak the Kingdom message more effectively and persuasively to others. Over the years, various textbooks have been provided for these schools. Nor was the missionary field overlooked. <span id="page159" class="pageNum" data-no="159" data-before-text="159"></span>On February 1, 1943, the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead was established in New York State. From many countries of earth, thousands of experienced full-time ministers (“pioneers”) have been brought to the U.S.A., trained and sent forth “into all the earth” to preach “this good news of the kingdom.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:18-45:10:18" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Romans 10:18</a>.</p>

But the total of other attenders, who have an interest in living forever on earth as subjects of the Kingdom, has risen above 5,700,000. In 43,000 and more congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses around the earth today, the “great crowd” of the “other sheep” are doing by far the greater part of the witness work.

Are you loyally supporting the anointed “faithful and discreet slave” class of true Christians as they continue to take the lead in sounding forth the Kingdom message “into all the earth . . . , and to the extremities of the inhabited earth,” and in ‘making disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing and teaching them’?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> 24:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="32-3" class="b"> 45-47;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="32-4" class="b"> 28:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:42-44:5:42" data-bid="32-5" class="b"> Acts 5:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:20-44:20:20" data-bid="32-6" class="b"> 20:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:18-45:10:18" data-bid="32-7" class="b"> Romans 10:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>You may enjoy a grand privilege today in thus ‘rendering sacred service day and night before the throne of God.’ At the same time you place yourself in line to be one of the “great crowd” that will inherit everlasting life on an earth made glorious.

What will Armageddon mean for mankind and our earth?</p>

<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sc">  During the second world war, many young witnesses of Jehovah paid for their neutrality with their lives. The following letter is typical of a number of ‘last letters’ that such courageous Witnesses wrote to their families. It was written by 23-year-old Marcel Sutter, of Alsace-Lorraine, a few hours before he was beheaded with an ax in Torgau prison, Germany, August 1942.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="se">“My dearly beloved parents and sisters,</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sc">  “When you receive this letter, I will no longer be alive. Only a few hours separate me from my death. I ask you to be strong and courageous; do not cry, for I have conquered. I have finished the course and kept the faith. May Jehovah God help me until the end. Only a short period of time separates us from the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. Soon we will see each other again in a better world of peace and righteousness. I rejoice at the thought of that day, since then there will be no more sighing. How marvelous that will be! I am yearning for peace. During these last few hours I have been thinking of you and my heart is a little bitter at the thought of not being able to kiss you good-bye. But we must be patient. The time is near when Jehovah will vindicate his Name and prove to all creation that he is the only true God. I now wish to dedicate my last few hours to him, so I will close this letter and say good-bye until we meet again soon. Praise be to our God Jehovah! With my warm love and greetings,</p>

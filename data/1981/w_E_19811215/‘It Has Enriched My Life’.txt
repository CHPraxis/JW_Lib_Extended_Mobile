‘It Has Enriched My Life’
What has? It is something mentioned in a letter received by the Canadian headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Toronto. The letter reads, in part:
“I am 18 years old and have never really believed in God. I would like to say that after meeting a Witness at school a few months ago, I now believe in God. We have been studying together from a book called ‘The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life’ . . . The learning I have been doing has enriched my life greatly.”
You can obtain a copy of this fine, faith-strengthening book by simply filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.
Please send me the 192-page, hardbound book “The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life.” I enclose 75 cents (U.S.).

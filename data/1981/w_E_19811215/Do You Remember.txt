Do You Remember?
Have you given careful thought to recent issues of “The Watchtower”? If so, likely you will recall the following:
● Why is speaking in tongues not part of Christianity today?
Because the gift of tongues was given only to the first-century Christians, verifying that God’s favor had shifted from the old Jewish arrangement to the newly established Christian congregation. (1 Corinthians 13:8; Hebrews 2:2-4)​—8/15, pp. 4-6.
● What is the “pure language” mentioned at Zephaniah 3:9?
It is “the pattern of healthful words” that speaks in praise of Jehovah and his righteous purposes through Christ Jesus. (2 Timothy 1:13)​—8/15, p. 28.
● Who alone can successfully tell right from wrong?
Those whose minds are constantly being reinforced by spiritual information from God’s Word. This knowledge sharpens their “perceptive powers,” thus training their senses not to be easily deceived. (Hebrews 5:14; Genesis 8:21)​—10/1, p. 9.
● Is sickness a punishment for sin?
Sickness can be a direct result of sin as the Bible states: “Whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.” (Galatians 6:7) This is true of those “sowing” immorality, smoking, drunkenness, gluttony, and so forth. However, the root cause of all sickness can be traced to the sin of Adam. (Romans 5:12)​—10/15, pp. 5, 6.
● How can you as a Christian youth resist temptations to immorality?
Confide in your God-fearing parents or the elders in the congregation. Avoid thinking about, looking at or sharing in things that will excite sexual feelings. (Colossians 3:5; 1 Corinthians 9:27) Build up a personal relationship with Jehovah by study and prayer.​—11/1, pp. 11-13.
● How can you as a parent reach your child’s heart?
From an early age, communicate with your children, giving them positive, friendly help as needed. Parents should cooperate in building a close family relationship, setting a good example themselves in regular Bible study, prayer and field ministry. Recognize that divine help is necessary to reach your child’s heart. (2 Corinthians 4:7; Psalm 51:5)​—11/1, pp. 19, 20.
● Will it be possible for a sincere person to come over to God’s side after the start of the “great tribulation”?
The evidence from the Scriptures answers, No. For any person to survive into God’s righteous new order, he now has to build up a right relationship with God. (Proverbs 18:10; Zephaniah 2:3)​—11/15, pp. 16, 17.
● What features make Matthew’s Gospel account distinctive?
It stresses the theme of the “kingdom of the heavens.” Jesus is presented to the Jews as the long-promised Messiah by referring to some 100 places in the Hebrew Scriptures. Matthew gives the only eyewitness account of Jesus’ instituting the memorial of his death​—11/1, pp. 24, 25.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you given careful thought to recent issues of “The Watchtower”? If so, likely you will recall the following:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>● </strong><strong>Why is speaking in tongues not part of Christianity today?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Because the gift of tongues was given only to the first-century Christians, verifying that God’s favor had shifted from the old Jewish arrangement to the newly established Christian congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:8-46:13:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:2-58:2:4" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Hebrews 2:2-4</a>)​—8/15, pp. 4-6.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>● </strong><strong>What is the “pure language” mentioned at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:3:9-36:3:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Zephaniah 3:9</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It is “the pattern of healthful words” that speaks in praise of Jehovah and his righteous purposes through Christ Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:13-55:1:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 1:13</a>)​—8/15, p. 28.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>● </strong><strong>Who alone can successfully tell right from wrong?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Those whose minds are constantly being reinforced by spiritual information from God’s Word. This knowledge sharpens their “perceptive powers,” thus training their senses not to be easily deceived. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 5:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:21-1:8:21" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Genesis 8:21</a>)​—10/1, p. 9.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>● </strong><strong>Is sickness a punishment for sin?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Sickness can be a direct result of sin as the Bible states: “Whatever a man is sowing, this he will also reap.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a>) This is true of those “sowing” immorality, smoking, drunkenness, gluttony, and so forth. However, the root cause of all sickness can be traced to the sin of Adam. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>)​—10/15, pp. 5, 6.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>● How can you as a Christian youth resist temptations to immorality?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Confide in your God-fearing parents or the elders in the congregation. Avoid thinking about, looking at or sharing in things that will excite sexual feelings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:27-46:9:27" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 9:27</a>) Build up a personal relationship with Jehovah by study and prayer.​—11/1, pp. 11-13.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>● </strong><strong>How can you as a parent reach your child’s heart?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">From an early age, communicate with your children, giving them positive, friendly help as needed. Parents should cooperate in building a close family relationship, setting a good example themselves in regular Bible study, prayer and field ministry. Recognize that divine help is necessary to reach your child’s heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:7-47:4:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:5-19:51:5" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Psalm 51:5</a>)​—11/1, pp. 19, 20.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>● Will it be possible for a sincere person to come over to God’s side after the start of the “great tribulation”?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The evidence from the Scriptures answers, No. For any person to survive into God’s righteous new order, he now has to build up a right relationship with God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:10-20:18:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:3-36:2:3" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Zephaniah 2:3</a>)​—11/15, pp. 16, 17.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>● </strong><strong>What features make Matthew’s Gospel account distinctive?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">It stresses the theme of the “kingdom of the heavens.” Jesus is presented to the Jews as the long-promised Messiah by referring to some 100 places in the Hebrew Scriptures. Matthew gives the only eyewitness account of Jesus’ instituting the memorial of his death​—11/1, pp. 24, 25.</p>

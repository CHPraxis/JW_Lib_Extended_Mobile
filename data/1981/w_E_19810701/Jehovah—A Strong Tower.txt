Jehovah​—A Strong Tower
SALVATION comes from trusting in Jehovah, as two fleshly sisters from southeast France experienced. One of them relates:
“It was 12:30 a.m. and both of us were peacefully sleeping. Suddenly, we were aroused by an unusual noise coming from the kitchen, and then a man appeared in the doorway. Panic-stricken, my sister cried out: ‘Jehovah, Jehovah, please help us!’ At these words the man ordered us to be quiet while threatening us with knife and rasp. Thanks to Jehovah our calm returned and we got dressed.
“The intruder had climbed onto our sixth-floor balcony and had cut his hand when smashing the kitchen window to break in. So I looked after his cut and made some food and coffee to help him over the remaining effects of alcohol. Also, I spoke to him about Jehovah, showing how we must trust in Him. He replied that he did not know Jehovah, even insulting his name. While he looked on, my sister read the Bible and I silently prayed. Seemingly irritated by such calm, he picked up a piece of broken windowpane, held it against my sister’s throat, while keeping the knife on the back of her neck, and declared: ‘Just a little pressure and the blood will flow!’ I jumped up and said in a clear voice: ‘You cannot frighten us, for we have Jehovah to uphold and deliver us. Even if you kill us we have the hope of the resurrection.’ Staggered by these words, he desisted.
“It was about 2:45 a.m. when he said he would be leaving, and I accompanied him to the door. On his way out, he said: ‘O.K. I get it. Jehovah is stronger than I am.’ After having closed the kitchen shutters, we offered up a prayer of gratitude to Jehovah our God, who had not forsaken us.”​—Prov. 18:10.

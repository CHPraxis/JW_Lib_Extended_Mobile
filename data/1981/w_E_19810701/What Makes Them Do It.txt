What Makes Them Do It?
“OUTLANDISH letters.” The crier at an auction had used those words to describe it. Soon one bidder​—a tall, intelligent man—​had it in his possession. “It” was only part of a book​—a portion of the Septuagint Version of the so-called Old Testament. But it was enough to prompt the purchaser to embark on a study of the Greek language.
About two years later, the buyer happened to pass the same bookstore. Surprisingly, there he found the rest of the same book, and readily obtained it for a meager sum. The owner of the now-complete copy of the Septuagint Version of the “Old Testament” in Greek spent years translating it and thus produced “the first translation of the Septuagint into English.” He also translated the “New Testament” from the original Greek. What made him do it?
We cannot be sure because the translator, Charles Thomson, apparently never wrote a preface that might have told us. Thomson was the secretary of the Congress of the United States from 1774 to 1789. In that capacity, he and the then president of the Congress, John Hancock, were the initial signers of the Declaration of Independence. After Thomson’s resignation, he spent about 20 years translating the Holy Scriptures.
Comparatively few people have had the linguistic ability and motivation to translate the Word of God from the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. But some have been moved to share the Bible’s grand message with their fellow humans. By comparison with the billions of mankind, of course, the number of those who have spread Scriptural truth has been small indeed. Nevertheless, we can well ask, what makes them do it?
Yes, what motivates Jehovah’s Witnesses to call at your door? Why are they eager to share with you the “good news” from God’s Word? Whose example do they follow? That of Christ.

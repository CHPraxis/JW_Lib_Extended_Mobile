Soon one bidder​—a tall, intelligent man—​had it in his possession. “It” was only part of a book​—a portion of the Septuagint Version of the so-called Old Testament. But it was enough to prompt the purchaser to embark on a study of the Greek language.</p>

Surprisingly, there he found the rest of the same book, and readily obtained it for a meager sum. The owner of the now-complete copy of the Septuagint Version of the “Old Testament” in Greek spent years translating it and thus produced “the first translation of the Septuagint into English.” He also translated the “New Testament” from the original Greek.

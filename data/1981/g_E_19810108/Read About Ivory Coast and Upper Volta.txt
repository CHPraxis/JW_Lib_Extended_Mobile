Read About Ivory Coast and Upper Volta
Customs and beliefs in these African lands should be very fascinating to people who live elsewhere. Read about the stalwart men and women who left their homelands to bring Bible truths to these remote peoples. Learn of the opposition, superstitions and other obstacles that were overcome to bring them the good news of God’s kingdom. It is absorbing reading in the 1981 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Also included in this 384-page book are faith-strengthening reports about the beginning and growth of true Christianity in the Central American country of El Salvador and the Pacific islands of New Zealand. Send for your copy.

“A Great Help in our Family”
That is what a mother wrote regarding the book Happiness​—How to Find It. It had especially helped her 18-year-old daughter, as the mother explains:
“Recently she and her father went on a business trip, at which time I tucked into her suitcase her new copy of the ‘Happiness’ book. When she got back, her whole attitude and expression had changed. My prayers had been answered! She has bubbled with enthusiasm since reading the entire book from cover to cover.”
Would you like some encouraging help? Chapters such as “You Can Cope with Life’s Problems,” “Money Problems​—What Help?” and “Sex​—Which Advice Really Works?” may contain just what you need.
Please send me, postpaid, the 192-page hardcover book Happiness​—How to Find It, for which I enclose 60 cents (U.S.).

Do You Remember?
Have you enjoyed reading the last several issues of The Watchtower? See if you can recall the following points:
▪ How have millions of Catholics and Protestants alike been robbed of the Bible’s millennial hope?
With the infiltration of the Greek doctrine of the immortality of the soul, apostate Christians transferred “paradise” from earth to heaven and so abandoned the Bible’s millennial hope. A similar apostasy took place among the Jews before the Common Era. They replaced their hope of the resurrection with Greek thinking of immortality.​—4/15, pp. 11, 12.
▪ How can problems in a Christian’s life turn out to be an encouragement to him?
When a Christian is faced with such daily problems as inflation, pollution and sickness and he applies the Bible’s unsurpassed counsel, he sees how it really works. This is a source of great encouragement to him and teaches him to rely always on God’s wisdom rather than his own. (Ps. 119:105)​—5/1, p. 7.
▪ How is the house-to-house activity a blessing from Jehovah?
Spending time preaching from house to house serves to protect the Christian witness of Jehovah from being tempted by the world. (1 John 2:15, 16) By sharing in this activity he is doing good to others and is learning to be more sympathetic and empathetic. He is also laying up for himself treasures in heaven, making Jehovah God and Christ Jesus his friends. (Matt. 6:19-21; Luke 16:9) He cultivates humility.​—5/15, pp. 15, 16.
▪ What personal questions might test our faith in God’s Kingdom government?
How do we personally look upon this world? Do we see ourselves as ‘foreigners’ and ‘aliens’ in it? Do others in our community view us as being different? Can we see ourselves as prospective subjects of God’s government? Are we loyally advocating it to others?​—5/15, pp. 17, 27.
▪ Why is it wise to conduct ourselves as lesser ones?
The Bible shows that such a course of wisdom makes for good relations with Jehovah God, our fellow Christians and members of our own family. Moreover, giving others the preferences and advantages adds to our happiness in life. (Acts 20:35)​—6/1, p. 25.
▪ Unlike many, why did Jehovah’s Witnesses not lose faith while in the concentration camps?
Their complete trust in God and his Word gave them standards to live by, day by day. It helped them to maintain mental and moral balance, thus preventing their health’s being undermined by worry and their strength’s being sapped by despair.​—6/15, p. 12.
▪ How can God be in your marriage?
The secret lies in each mate having a close personal relationship with God, reflecting God’s qualities such as kindness, forgiveness and long-suffering.​—7/1, pp. 13-15.
▪ Why was the prophet Micah a fine example for Jehovah’s Witnesses today?
Micah was no spiritual weakling. He was full of spiritual strength, identifying sin as sin. His name, meaning “Who is like Jah?” was in keeping with his challenging message of judgment against all false gods. (Mic. 3:8)​—7/15, pp. 11-13.

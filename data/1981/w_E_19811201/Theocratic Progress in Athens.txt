Theocratic Progress in Athens
Because of a court victory our first ‘House of Prayer’ (actually, Kingdom Hall) has been under preparation in Athens. The authorities have now given permission to display a sign outside the building that reads ‘House of Prayer​—Athens’ congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses’—​a steppingstone, we hope, toward establishing many more ‘Houses of Prayer’ in Greece.​—Report from Watch Tower Society’s branch.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Vicente is blind and 75 years of age. He has served in Spain as an auxiliary pioneer for some five years, distributes about 110 magazines each month, and conducts three Bible studies. One cold winter’s night his service companion did not show up to accompany him to a return visit on an interested person, scheduled for 9:15 p.m. Since it was a little early to make the visit and not wanting to waste time waiting, Vicente decided to make a door-to-door call by himself. The man who answered the door treated him kindly, listened to the Kingdom hope and accepted the two magazines offered. A few weeks later when a further visit was made to take him the most recent issues, the man said: “Señor Vicente, if you had not called at my door that night, we would not be talking together today. I had decided to shoot myself with a pistol. At that moment I only desired to die, but now as I read these magazines and learn more about the Kingdom, my will to live is growing stronger and stronger.”</p>

“The Most Enticing Book I Have Ever Read”
The following letter was received from a man who was serving in the United States Navy:
“I have read your book entitled ‘Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It,’ and it is the most enticing book I have ever read. I have been in a few places while in the Navy and the articles in the book are true and very accurate. I am very interested in finding more information. When my friends first introduced me to the book, I thought it would be boring, but the more I read the more I enjoyed reading it. I want to thank you people for putting out such a book and I hope you have a very good year. This book really changed my life and I hope you keep up the good work.
“Thank you,
D. D. S.”

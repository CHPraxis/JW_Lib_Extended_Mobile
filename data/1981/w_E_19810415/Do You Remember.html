<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HAVE you enjoyed reading the last several issues of <em>The Watchtower? </em>Then you will probably remember some of the following interesting points that were discussed:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>▪ What helps in controlling your spirit?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">First, examine yourself to see whether you have some motive or particular weak spot that you did not realize existed. If another person is involved, try to see him as God sees him. Are you judging him on the basis of one or two “irritating” traits? Are you ignoring his good traits? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:8-50:4:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Phil. 4:8</a>) Also, try to see the other person’s point of view. This has a calming effect and may help you to avoid the trap of prejudging. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:13-20:18:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 18:13</a>)​—12/15 pp. 4-6.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>▪ Why is God’s vengeance compatible with his love?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It is because God loves righteousness and hates wickedness. His love cannot forever tolerate wickedness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:1:2-34:1:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nah. 1:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:35-5:32:35" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Deut. 32:35,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:41-5:32:41" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 41</a>) To rescue those who love him and who exercise faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice requires that God cleanse the earth of all bloodguilt, corruption and immorality. Thus, by inflicting vengeance on his enemies, the ‘God of love’ will clear the way for a global paradise. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>)​—1/15 pp. 5, 15.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong><strong>Why is smoking a sin?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“Sin is a breaking of [God’s] law.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:4-62:3:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 John 3:4</a>, <em>Today’s English Version) </em>One of God’s laws is: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:8-59:2:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 2:8</a>) Smoking infringes on the rights of others, and may actually cause them physical damage. The nicotine in tobacco also acts as a drug, dulling the smoker’s appreciation of the Creator and His purposes. He becomes a slave to this unclean habit. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:6-45:6:6" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Romans 6:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:1-47:7:1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 7:1</a>.) Smoking is a sin.​—2/1 pp. 4-9.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong><strong>What are some proofs of God’s existence?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Among these proofs are the following: Astronomical evidence agreeing with the Biblical view that there was a beginning to the material universe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 1:1</a>) The harmony and orderliness that make life possible on earth. The marvels of the human body composed of trillions of cells producing the needed chemicals, proteins and hormones. The instinct of animals, birds and fish.​—2/15 pp. 3-5.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>▪ How can we make a good name with God?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">By concerning ourselves with what is right and what is wrong in God’s eyes. We must stop doing what is wrong and start doing what is right. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2</a>) To achieve such a goal we have to study God’s Word and then apply to ourselves the knowledge thus gained. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:21-45:2:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 2:21, 22</a>) This includes following Jesus’ footsteps and sharing in preaching the “good news” of the kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:21</a>)​—2/15 pp. 25, 27, 29, 30.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong><strong>How can the “faithful and discreet slave” be identified today?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Jesus indicated that the “slave” would be identifiable by its watchfulness and by its faithfully and discreetly providing spiritual food as needed by all in the Christian congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>) The facts show that from the early 1870’s a body of Bible Students (now known as Jehovah’s Witnesses) realized the need of making an unsectarian search of the Scriptures. This resulted in a restoration of many Bible truths. They were published and shared with all who desired to be prepared for the Lord’s return. This has resulted in the gathering together of a congregation of anointed disciples of Christ, individually fed and spiritually awake. In recognition of this faithful “slave,” a “great crowd” of companion workers now serve loyally by his side. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rev. 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:15-66:7:15" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 15</a>)​—3/1 pp. 24, 26, 27.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>▪ </strong><strong>What did Paul mean when he wrote to Christians at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:13-45:11:13" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 11:13</strong></a> <strong>about ‘glorifying his ministry’?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Paul viewed his “ministry” as a most privileged service. There was nothing about his “ministry” of which to be ashamed. This is how all of Jehovah’s Witnesses should individually feel today. They are ministers representing the Sovereign of the Universe, announcing the greatest government in existence. There is every reason for all Christians to ‘glorify their ministry.’​—3/15 pp. 20-25.</p>

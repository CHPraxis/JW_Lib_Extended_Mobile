It Can Answer Your Questions
While engaged in door-to-door teaching in Oregon, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses met a young man who said that he had just about done it all. He had led a wild life despite having been raised by religious parents, one a Baptist and the other a Catholic. It was, as he said,‘a hellfire and no answer’ religious background. Yet the man had tried drugs and the life-style that often goes along with drug abuse.
The Witness showed him the new book “Happiness​—How to Find It.” Looking through the index and noting particularly the chapters “You Can Cope with Life’s Problems” and “Money Problems​—What Help?”, he said,“That’s just what I need!” Arrangements were made to study the Bible with him. Now he feels he has finally found help in answering his questions. You also can receive such help by obtaining the book “Happiness​—How to Find It.”
Please send me, postpaid, the 192-page, hardcover book “Happiness​—How to Find It,” for which I enclose 60 cents (U.S.).

Whom Can You Trust?
Clergyman?
Butcher?
Lawyer?
Politician?
Dishonesty has penetrated every walk of life. Certainly we need a voice we can trust.
“The Watchtower” and “Awake!” are such voices. You can trust them. Why? Because these magazines are pledged to uphold the righteous standards of the Bible. They have no commercial advertisers to please. Read them regularly.
Please send a year’s subscription for “The Watchtower” and “Awake!” I enclose $7 (U.S.) for 48 issues of these magazines (four copies a month). For mailing this coupon I am also to receive six free booklets.

Communication Breakdown
A speech communications expert who monitored “happily” married couples reportedly found that they talked to each other, on the average, less than 30 minutes a week. By way of contrast, the family television set may be operating 100 times that long in many households during a week. And instead of family conversation at mealtimes, says a University of Miami speech communications expert, “we usually share our meals with Walter Cronkite [a prominent newscaster].”

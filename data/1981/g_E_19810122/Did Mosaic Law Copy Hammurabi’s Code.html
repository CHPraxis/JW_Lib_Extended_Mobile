<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HAMMURABI’S Code, based on earlier legislation, is a collection of decisions or “casebooks” on clay tablets. These were later copied on a stele placed in the temple of Marduk in Babylon. After that, this stele was taken by a conqueror to Susa, where it was discovered in 1902.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Some parts of the Mosaic law are similar to certain sections of Hammurabi’s Code, and because of this certain scholars claimed that the Hebrews got their law from Hammurabi and not from Jehovah God. Modern scholars generally disagree. However, the book “Documents from Old Testament Times” states: “There is no ground for assuming any direct borrowing by the Hebrew from the Babylonian. Even where the two sets of laws differ little in the letter, they differ much in the spirit.”</p>

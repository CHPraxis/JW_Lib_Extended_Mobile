How to Find Happiness
Jonathan Freedman, professor of psychology at Columbia University, observed that most of today’s “instant happiness theories” teach persons to look out for themselves.
He noted, however, that studies of happiness have proved that “people are happiest in a good relationship with someone else.”
That being so, certainly we can find much happiness by developing a close and warm relationship with God.

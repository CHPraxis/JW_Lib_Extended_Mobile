Untapped Creativity
“Even the largest, most advanced computer cannot be made to understand sentences that a four-year-old child can grasp without hesitation. . . . The best way of expressing the total creative capacity of the human central nervous system in layman’s language is that, for all practical purposes, it is infinite. . . . It is still clear that we are operating at only a tiny fraction of our true abilities. Studying nature, we find that systems are created to be used to the full. What is the purpose of all the unused human capability?”​—“The Ultimate Athlete.”

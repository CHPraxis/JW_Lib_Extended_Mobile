<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The following experience goes to illustrate how “Awake!” has a positive influence on people. A Witness from the south of France wrote in: “One day we found the following message in the Kingdom Hall mailbox: ‘Dear Mister Overseer, I am an “Awake!” subscriber, and that is why I am venturing to ask you to do something for me. However, I prefer to remain anonymous. On account of a mistake made some 10 years ago, I owe approximately $45 of material to the F‐‐‐ firm. I am trusting you to settle this debt for me . . . If they will not accept the money, please use it for your Kingdom Hall. With many thanks, Yours sincerely.’</p>

Read about Ivory Coast and Upper Volta
Customs and beliefs are probably much different in these African lands from where you live. Read about the stalwart men and women who left their homelands to bring Bible truths to these remote peoples. Learn of the opposition, superstitions and other obstacles they overcame. It is absorbing reading in the 1981 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Also included in this 384-page book are similar reports about El Salvador and New Zealand. Send for your copy.

The Magazine Pricked His Conscience
The following experience goes to illustrate how “Awake!” has a positive influence on people. A Witness from the south of France wrote in: “One day we found the following message in the Kingdom Hall mailbox: ‘Dear Mister Overseer, I am an “Awake!” subscriber, and that is why I am venturing to ask you to do something for me. However, I prefer to remain anonymous. On account of a mistake made some 10 years ago, I owe approximately $45 of material to the F‐‐‐ firm. I am trusting you to settle this debt for me . . . If they will not accept the money, please use it for your Kingdom Hall. With many thanks, Yours sincerely.’
“So we went along to pay the firm. The astonished director thanked us for our part in the affair and was delighted with the outcome.”

Best Memory of All
How do the marvelous mechanical memories of computers and other methods compare with the memory capacity of the human brain? The RCA Corporation’s Advanced Technology Laboratories offers these comparisons, as published in “Business Week” magazine:
Hence, with all of human technology the human brain still has a capacity 10 times as great as that which is stored in the U.S. National Archives, 500 times as great as an advanced computer memory system and 10,000 times as great as that which is recorded in the “Encyclopædia Britannica.” Does this not make one pause to reflect on how such prodigious storage in such a small vessel came to be?

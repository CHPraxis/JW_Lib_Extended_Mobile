Castor Oil Gains in Popularity
FOR many centuries castor oil has been used as a medicine. But it has never been very popular with the patients!
Today, however, only about 1 percent is used medicinally. On the other hand, would you like to have a dress that feels smooth and that is free from static cling? Such fabrics are made from castor oil. The oil that once brought upturned noses is also found in fine soaps, lotions and creams. Its low freezing point also makes it ideal for a lubricant in cold climates, and the fact that it does not burst into flames until it reaches 270° Celsius (518° F.) has made it an ideal lubricant for jet aircraft. You may find that it has been used to rust-proof your car, or for any of scores of other uses​—all of which are much easier to take than a swallow of castor oil.

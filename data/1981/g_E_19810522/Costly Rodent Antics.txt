Costly Rodent Antics
China’s newspaper “The People’s Daily” recently reported that a rat in Shanghai caused a petrochemical complex to suffer a loss in production of almost $12 million (U.S.)! The rodent short-circuited a main switch on a power line, paralyzing the entire plant. Even Peking’s subway has come to a complete standstill three times because of rats fouling electrical equipment. On one occasion, power was off for 40 minutes, while passengers waited in the dark. “The People’s Daily” urged people to keep more cats.

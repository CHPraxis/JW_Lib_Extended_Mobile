<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“BEFORE you take the first dose of any medication your doctor prescribes, you should make it your business to learn more about the drug than the doctor himself knows.”​—Robert Mendelsohn, M.D., author of “Confessions of a Medical Heretic.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Another doctor advises, “Choose a physician as if your life depends on it, because one day, it might.” He adds, “If your doctor is competent, he will not place you on a medication without telling you</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="so">□ the name of the drug,</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="so">□ what he is using it for,</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="so">□ what risks may be involved,</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="so">□ and what early warning signs you should look for so that you can intelligently watch for serious side reactions.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The principle is simple: never take a drug unless its name, nature, risks and side effects are clearly spelled out by your physician.”​—George D. Lemaitre, M.D., author of “How to Choose a Good Doctor.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">You need not become belligerent or argue with your doctor in order to communicate with him. Most doctors are glad to answer your questions. If your doctor is too busy to explain why he is prescribing a certain drug for you, then the information is readily available in publications such as “The Physician’s Desk Reference.” If you find it difficult to communicate with your physician, then find another one. A good relationship with your doctor will enable him to treat you more effectively.</p>

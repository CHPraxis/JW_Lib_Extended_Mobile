<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The apostle Paul did all that he could to strengthen fellow believers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:14:19-44:14:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 14:19-22</a>) Likewise, we are concerned when our brothers face difficult situations, and we want to help them. The Bible indicates that all, not just elders, should take an interest in others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:1-45:15:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 15:1, 2</a>) Consider two ways in which we can heed the loving admonition: “Keep comforting one another and building one another up.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:11-52:5:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Discern Others’ Needs: </strong>God’s Word reports that Dorcas “abounded in good deeds and gifts of mercy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:36-44:9:36" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 9:36,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:39-44:9:39" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 39</a>) She took note of those who were in need and did what she could to help them. What a fine example she set for us! You may learn that an older one needs a ride to the meeting. Or there may be a pioneer who has no one to work with in service on a weekday afternoon. If you discern such a need and offer practical assistance, imagine how that one will be encouraged!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Spiritual Conversations: </strong>We can also build others up by our speech. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:29-49:4:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eph. 4:29</a>) An experienced elder observed: “If you want to be encouraging, talk about spiritual things. To start an upbuilding conversation, you might use a simple question, such as, ‘How did you learn the truth?’” Show a sincere interest in the young people in the congregation. Reach out to those who are discouraged and those who may be shy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:25-20:12:25" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 12:25</a>) Do not allow discussing the world’s entertainment to crowd out good spiritual discussions with fellow believers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:11-45:1:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rom. 1:11, 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>What, though, can you say to build others up? In your personal Bible reading and study, did you recently find a principle that deepened your appreciation for Jehovah? Were you moved by something you heard in a public talk or at a <em>Watchtower </em>Study? Or was your heart touched by a faith-strengthening experience? If you treasure up such spiritual gems, you will always have something encouraging to share with others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:1-20:2:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Prov. 2:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:45-42:6:45" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Luke 6:45</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>By offering practical assistance and making wise use of our tongue, may we keep building one another up.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:18-20:12:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Prov. 12:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Our desire to please Jehovah moves us to center our lives on spiritual activities. His Word instructs us to ‘keep on seeking first the kingdom’ and to “make sure of the more important things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:10-50:1:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Phil. 1:10</a>) How can we buy out time for Kingdom interests and keep less important activities in their place?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:15-49:5:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eph. 5:15-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Put Kingdom Activities First: </strong>Schedule your time so that it is not wasted on nonessentials. Some start each month by blocking out specific times on their calendar for the field ministry. Then they are careful not to allow other matters to interfere with those plans. The same can be done to buy out time for meetings, personal study, and conventions. Many have a daily plan that begins or ends with Bible reading. Set aside a specific time for each important activity, and do not let other things needlessly interfere.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:40-46:14:40" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 14:40</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Limit Use of the World: </strong>In some lands, sports, entertainment, recreation, hobbies, and other pursuits are readily available. Many spend an inordinate amount of time watching television or using computers. However, becoming preoccupied with leisure activities and new gadgets that this world has to offer will inevitably lead to disappointment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 John 2:15-17</a>) Hence, the Scriptures urge us not to use the world to the full. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:31-46:7:31" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:31</a>) By heeding that wise counsel, you can show Jehovah that his worship occupies first place in your life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:19-40:6:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 6:19-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The time left for this present system is about to run out. Those who put Kingdom interests first will be happy and will gain God’s favor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:32-20:8:35" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 8:32-35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:25-59:1:25" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Jas. 1:25</a>) May we, therefore, make wise use of this valuable resource, our time.</p>

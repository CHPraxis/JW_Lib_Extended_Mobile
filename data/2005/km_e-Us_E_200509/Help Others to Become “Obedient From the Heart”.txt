Help Others to Become “Obedient From the Heart”
 1. What does Jehovah require of his worshippers?
1 Obedience is fundamental to worshipping Jehovah acceptably. (Deut. 12:28; 1 Pet. 1:14-16) Soon, God’s judgment will come upon “those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news.” (2 Thess. 1:8) How can we help others to become “obedient from the heart” to the teachings of God’s Word?​—Rom. 6:17.
 2. Why is it important to help others build strong faith?
2 By Helping to Build Faith and Love: In the Scriptures, obedience is closely associated with faith. The apostle Paul spoke of “the command of the everlasting God to promote obedience by faith.” (Rom. 16:26) Hebrews chapter 11 cites numerous examples of faith, many of which involved acting in harmony with Jehovah’s expressed will. (Heb. 11:7, 8, 17) On the other hand, disobedience is associated with lack of faith. (John 3:36; Heb. 3:18, 19) We need to develop skill in the use of God’s Word in order to help others develop the kind of faith that produces obedience.​—2 Tim. 2:15; Jas. 2:14, 17.
 3. (a) How is obedience linked with love? (b) How can we help Bible students to develop love for Jehovah?
3 Obedience is also linked with love for God. (Deut. 5:10; 11:1, 22; 30:16) “This is what the love of God means,” says 1 John 5:3, “that we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome.” How can we help Bible students to develop love for Jehovah? Look for opportunities during the study to build appreciation for Jehovah’s qualities. Express your own deep feelings for God. Help the student think in terms of developing a personal relationship with Jehovah. More than anything else, love for Jehovah will motivate others​—as well as ourselves—​to obey him from the heart.​—Matt. 22:37.
 4. (a) Why is our example important? (b) What must we do to cultivate “an obedient heart”?
4 By Our Example: A powerful means by which we can encourage others to obey the good news is by our example. However, constant effort is required on our part to cultivate “an obedient heart.” (1 Ki. 3:9; Prov. 4:23) What does this involve? Nourish your heart through regular Bible study and meeting attendance. (Ps. 1:1, 2; Heb. 10:24, 25) Seek association with those whose hearts are unified in true worship. (Prov. 13:20) Share regularly in the field ministry, with a sincere desire to help people in your territory. Pray for Jehovah’s help to guide the development of a good heart. (Ps. 86:11) Avoid things that can corrupt your heart, such as immoral or violent entertainment. Pursue things that bring you closer to God and that strengthen your relationship with him.​—Jas. 4:7, 8.
 5. How are obedient ones being blessed?
5 Jehovah assured his ancient people that blessings would overtake them if they listened to his voice. (Deut. 28:1, 2) Likewise today, Jehovah is richly blessing “those obeying him as ruler.” (Acts 5:32) By our teaching and example, therefore, may we help others to become obedient from the heart.

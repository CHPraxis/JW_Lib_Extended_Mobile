Announcements
▪ Literature offer for September: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. Before requesting additional supplies from the branch office, congregations should use what is available locally and check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand. October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the Require brochure and make a special effort to start Bible studies. November: Learn From the Great Teacher. If individuals say they have no children, offer the Knowledge book or the tract Would You Like to Know More About the Bible? December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. As an alternative offer, you may use My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, or You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.
▪ The elders are reminded to follow through on instructions given on pages 21-3 of the April 15, 1991, Watchtower regarding any disfellowshipped or disassociated ones who may be inclined toward becoming reinstated.
▪ The special public talk for the 2006 Memorial season will be given on Sunday, April 30. The subject of the talk will be announced later. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer or an assembly that weekend will have the special talk the following week. No congregation should have the special talk before Sunday, April 30, 2006.
▪ Since October has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of The Watchtower and Awake! for 2005 and the Watchtower Library​—2005 Edition on CD-ROM with their next literature request. A listing of the languages in which these items are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed each month. Please note that Watchtower Library​—2005 Edition is a provision for baptized members of the congregation and is made available only through the congregation.
▪ During the 2006 service year, all who are serving as auxiliary pioneers during the month in which the circuit overseer visits the congregation will be invited to attend the first half of the meeting held with the pioneers during the week of the visit. All who can do so are encouraged to benefit from this special arrangement.
▪ Beginning with the October 2005 issue, the branch service report in Our Kingdom Ministry will appear one month later than it had previously. Thus, the June service report will appear in the October issue instead of the September issue. This adjustment will bring Our Kingdom Ministry for the United States in line with that of other branches.
▪ The Annual Congregation Property Documents Review Work Sheet (T-33-E) and Safety Inspection Work Sheet (T-34-E) are to be completed each September by the secretary of the congregation holding title to Kingdom Hall property. Copies of the completed forms should promptly be provided to the body of elders for each congregation meeting in the Kingdom Hall and to the Regional Building Committee. If corrective actions are needed, the elders should care for these. When the circuit overseer visits the congregation, he will review both work sheets.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>Part 1: What Is a Bible Study?</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If you regularly and systematically have Bible discussions, though brief, using the Bible or along with it one of the recommended publications, you are conducting a Bible study. The study may be reported when it has been conducted two times after the study arrangement is demonstrated and if there is reason to believe that the study will continue.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:202004240/1-6$p/E:202004241/1-7"><em>km </em>7/04 p. 1</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>Part 2: Preparing to Conduct the Study</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">We need to present the information in a way that touches the student’s heart. This requires thorough preparation with the student in mind.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:202004281/1-7$p/E:202004282/1-8"><em>km </em>8/04 p. 1</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>How to Prepare</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="su">▪ Examine the title, subheadings, and visual aids of the chapter or lesson.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="su">▪ Identify the answers to the printed questions, marking only key words and phrases.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="su">▪ Decide which cited scriptures to read during the study. Make brief notes in the margin of the study publication.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="su">▪ Prepare a brief review of main points.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="su">▪ As needed, prepare an illustration, an explanation, or a series of questions to help the student grasp a point or a scripture.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn"><strong>Part 3: Effective Use of the Scriptures</strong></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">Our purpose in conducting Bible studies is to “make disciples” by helping people to understand and accept the teachings of God’s Word and apply them in their lives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:13-52:2:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Thess. 2:13</a>) Therefore, the study should center on the Scriptures.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="15" href="jwpub://p/E:202004406/1-8$p/E:202004407/1-10"><em>km </em>11/04 p. 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="su">▪ Look up and discuss Bible texts that show the Scriptural basis for our beliefs.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="su"><span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>▪ Keep it simple. Do not try to explain every aspect of a scripture. Include only what is needed to make the point clear.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="su">▪ Make practical application. Help the student to see how Bible texts apply to him personally.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sn"><strong>Part 4: Training Students to Prepare</strong></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">A student who reads the lesson beforehand, marks the answers, and thinks of how to express them in his own words makes rapid spiritual progress. Therefore, once a regular study has been established, prepare a lesson together to show the student how. With most students, it will be helpful to prepare an entire chapter or lesson together.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:202004441/1-6$p/E:202004442/1-8"><em>km </em>12/04 p. 1</a>.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="su">▪ Show the student how to examine the chapter or lesson title, subheadings, and illustrations before beginning his detailed preparation.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="su">▪ Encourage the student to review the main points at the conclusion of the preparation session.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sn"><strong>Part 5: Determining How Much Material to Cover</strong></p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">The amount of material that can be considered will depend on the ability and the circumstances of both the teacher and the student.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="19" href="jwpub://p/E:202005000/1-7$p/E:202005001/1-9"><em>km </em>1/05 p. 1</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="ss"><strong>Build Solid Faith</strong></p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="su">▪ Do not sacrifice the student’s having a clear understanding of God’s Word for the sake of speed.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="su">▪ Spend whatever time is necessary to help the student understand and accept what he is learning.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="su">▪ Allow sufficient time to consider key scriptures that provide the basis for the teachings.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="ss"><strong>Keep the Study Moving</strong></p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="su">▪ If the student is inclined to speak at length about personal matters, you may need to arrange to discuss these after the study.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="su">▪ Do not talk excessively during the study. Limit the discussion of side points and experiences so as not to hinder the student from acquiring an accurate knowledge of basic Bible teachings.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sn"><strong>Part 6: When a Student Raises a Question</strong></p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb">Once a Bible study is well-established, it is usually best to consider Bible teachings in an orderly manner rather than jump from subject to subject. This helps the student to build a foundation of accurate knowledge and to progress spiritually.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="21" href="jwpub://p/E:202005046/1-7$p/E:202005047/1-7"><em>km </em>2/05 p. 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="ss"><strong>Be Discerning</strong></p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="su">▪ Questions related to the study material can usually be answered on the spot.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="su">▪ Questions unrelated to the study material or that require research can be considered at another time. It may be helpful to write down such questions.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="su">▪ If the student has difficulty accepting a certain teaching, consider additional material that thoroughly discusses the subject.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="su">▪ If the student is still not convinced, leave the subject for another time and continue with the study.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="ss"><span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span><strong>Be Modest</strong></p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="su">▪ If you do not know the answer to a question, do not venture an opinion.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="su">▪ Progressively teach the student how to do research.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sn"><strong>Part 7: Offering Prayer at the Study</strong></p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sb">In order for Bible students to make spiritual progress, Jehovah’s blessing is essential. Therefore, it is proper to open and close an established study with prayer.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="23" href="jwpub://p/E:202005085/1-6$p/E:202005086/1-10"><em>km </em>3/05 p. 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="ss"><strong>How to Introduce Prayer</strong></p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="su">▪ With those who are religiously inclined, prayer can often be offered from the very first study.</p>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="su">▪ With others, we need to discern the appropriate time to introduce prayer.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="su">▪ <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:4-19:25:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 25:4, 5 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:14-62:5:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:14</a> can be used to explain why prayer is offered.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="su">▪ <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:16-43:15:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 15:16</a> can be used to show that we should pray to Jehovah through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="ss"><strong>What to Include in Prayers</strong></p>
<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="su">▪ It is fitting to praise Jehovah as the Source of instruction.</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="su">▪ Express sincere interest in the student.</p>

<p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="sn"><strong>Part 8: Directing Students to the Organization</strong></p>
<p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="sb">Our goal in conducting Bible studies is not only to teach doctrinal information but also to help students become part of the Christian congregation. Take a few minutes each week on the study to share a point about Jehovah’s organization.​—<a class="xt" data-xtid="25" href="jwpub://p/E:202005129/1-7$p/E:202005130/1-10"><em>km </em>4/05 p. 8</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>March: </strong><em>Keep on the Watch! </em>Where genuine interest is shown, offer the <em>Knowledge </em>book, making a special effort to start Bible studies. <strong>April and May: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on placing the <em>Worship God </em>book. The objective should be to start a home Bible study, especially with individuals who have already studied the <em>Knowledge </em>book and the <em>Require </em>brochure. <strong>June: </strong><em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>If individuals say they have no children, offer the <em>Family Happiness </em>book or the <em>Knowledge </em>book and make an effort to start Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ In the United States, any direction you write on the DPA card, including medical options, should be in English. This will help to ensure that medical personnel fully understand your wishes. Book study overseers in non-English-language congregations should see that all are given assistance in this matter as needed.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Congregations should release the latest issues of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>as soon as they are received. That will allow publishers to become familiar with the contents before offering the magazines in field service. <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>also should be released to the publishers as soon as it arrives. It may be distributed through the Congregation Book Study arrangement.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Congregation secretaries should maintain an adequate supply of the forms <em>Application for Regular Pioneer Service </em>(S-205) and <em>Application for Auxiliary Pioneer Service </em>(S-205b). These can be ordered on the <em>Literature Request Form </em>(S-14). Maintain at least a one-year supply.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ The Memorial will be held on Thursday, March 24, 2005. If your congregation normally has meetings on Thursday, these are to be switched to another day of the week if the Kingdom Hall is available. If this is not possible and your Service Meeting is affected, the parts that are particularly applicable to your congregation may be incorporated into another Service Meeting.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ A number of publishers have telephoned the branch office regarding certain recordings of Kingdom songs sung in a popular style that are presently being circulated among Jehovah’s Witnesses. They wonder if these recordings have the organization’s approval. We are aware of these recordings and would like to inform you that they do not have our approval. Please do not circulate or download these recordings from the Internet. We trust this information will clarify matters.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men register at the post office within 30 days after reaching 18 years of age. A male noncitizen under the age of 26 who takes up residency in the United States must also register with Selective Service within 30 days of becoming a resident. All of those required to do so should comply with this law, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. From the time he registers until the year he turns 26, a brother must notify Selective Service of any change of address within ten days of the change. Elders should be aware of young brothers nearing the age of 18 and new alien residents between the ages of 18 and 26 and remind them of their duty to register with the Selective Service System.</p>

A Video With a Timeless Message
What is the message in the video David​—He Trusted in God? That we, like David, must trust in Jehovah. (Ps. 91:2) Seeing major events in David’s life portrayed will help children and adults to learn from the example he set. (Ps. 31:14) For our added benefit, this DVD includes a “Video Quiz” and several “Learning Activities.”
Watch the video, and then quiz yourself: (1) Why did Jehovah choose a better king? (1 Sam. 15:10, 11; 16:1) (2) Why did he not choose any of David’s brothers? (1 Sam. 16:6, 7) (3) Why did Saul like David to play the harp? (1 Sam. 16:14-23) (4) Who was Goliath? (1 Sam. 17:4-10) (5) Why did David want to fight Goliath? (1 Sam. 17:23, 24, 36, 37) (6) Who was Jonathan? (1 Sam. 14:1) (7) At what point did Saul become David’s worst enemy? (1 Sam. 18:25-29) (8) Why did David not kill Saul? (1 Sam. 26:7-11) (9) How did Saul die? (1 Sam. 31:1-6) (10) What was David’s reaction to Jonathan’s death? (2 Sam. 1:11, 12) (11) What promise did Jehovah make to David? (2 Sam. 7:12, 13, 16) (12) What serious mistake did David make? (2 Sam. 11:1-5, 14-17) (13) How did David show that he was very sorry for what he had done? (Ps. 51) (14) What lessons did David share with young Solomon? (1 Ki. 2:1-4; 1 Chron. 22:6-13; 28:9, 10) (15) How will Jesus’ rule benefit David, Jonathan, and you?​—Isa. 11:6-9; John 11:25, 26.
Now reflect: How can you personally imitate the trust in God that David displayed?
Parents, impress upon your children the timeless importance of trusting in God, as David did.​—Ps. 56:11.

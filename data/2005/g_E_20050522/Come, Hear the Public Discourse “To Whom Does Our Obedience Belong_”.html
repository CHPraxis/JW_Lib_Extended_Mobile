<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The very notion of obedience is distasteful to many people. ‘I want to be free to do as I please’ is a common view. The fact is, though, that all of us value obedience in our everyday life. Each time you heed a warning sign or follow instructions, you are showing a measure of obedience. And who can rightly deny that obedience to the laws of secular authorities is needed to maintain order and peace in human society? Why, just imagine what would happen if all people refused to obey traffic laws!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">However, when humans exercise authority over other humans, the results are not always positive. A long time ago, the Bible noted that “man has dominated man to his injury.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:8:9-21:8:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 8:9</a>) Is there a ruler who is worthy of our trust and obedience? If so, how can we identify him? And what can we expect under his rule? These questions will be answered in the stirring public discourse “To Whom Does Our Obedience Belong?” This address will be delivered at the district conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses beginning this month. Hundreds of such conventions will be held around the world. To find the location nearest you, contact Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area or write to the publishers of this magazine at the addresses given on page 5.</p>

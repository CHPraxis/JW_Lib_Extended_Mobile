<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHAT event is this? It is the death of a man who died nearly 2,000 years ago. “I surrender my soul, in order that I may receive it again,” he said. “No man has taken it away from me, but I surrender it of my own initiative.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:17-43:10:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 10:17, 18</a>) That man was Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jesus instructed his followers to observe the Memorial of his sacrificial death. The occasion is also called “the Lord’s evening meal,” or “the Lord’s supper.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:20-46:11:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 11:20</a>; <em>King James Version</em>) The Memorial that Jesus instituted to commemorate his death will be observed by Jehovah’s Witnesses and their friends on Thursday, March 24, 2005, after sunset.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A Bible-based talk will explain the meaning of the unleavened bread and the red wine used for the occasion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:26-40:26:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 26:26-28</a>) The discourse will also answer such questions as these: How often should Christians commemorate this event? Who should rightly partake of the emblems of bread and wine? Who benefit from Jesus’ death? This important observance will help all to appreciate the purpose of Jesus’ life and death.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">You will be warmly welcomed at the Memorial of Jesus’ death. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact meeting place and time.</p>

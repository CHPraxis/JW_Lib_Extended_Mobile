<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of First Samuel</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE year is 1117 B.C.E. Some three hundred years have elapsed since Joshua completed the conquest of the Promised Land. The older men of Israel come to Jehovah’s prophet with a remarkable request. The prophet takes the matter up in prayer, and Jehovah allows them to have their way. This marks the end of the period of the Judges and the beginning of the era of human kings. The Bible book of First Samuel narrates exciting events surrounding that turning point in the history of the nation of Israel.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Written by Samuel, Nathan, and Gad, First Samuel covers a period of 102 years​—from 1180 to 1078 B.C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:29-13:29:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>) It is an account of four leaders of Israel. Two serve as judges, two as kings; two are obedient to Jehovah, two are not. We also meet two exemplary women and a valiant but gentle warrior. Such examples provide valuable lessons about attitudes and actions to imitate and to avoid. The contents of First Samuel can thus exert power on our thoughts and deeds.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:1-9:7:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>1 Samuel 1:1–7:17</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">It is time for the Festival of Ingathering, and Hannah, who lives in Ramah, is beside herself with joy.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Jehovah has answered her prayers, and she has given birth to a son. To fulfill her vow, Hannah presents her son Samuel for service at “the house of Jehovah.” There the boy becomes “a minister of Jehovah before Eli the priest.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:24-9:1:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Samuel 1:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:11-9:2:11" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 2:11</a>) When Samuel is still of tender age, Jehovah speaks to him, pronouncing judgment against the house of Eli. As Samuel grows older, all the people of Israel come to recognize him as a prophet of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In time, the Philistines come up against Israel. They capture the Ark and slay Eli’s two sons. Upon hearing the news, aged Eli dies, having “judged Israel forty years.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:4:18-9:4:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Samuel 4:18</a>) Possession of the Ark proves to be disastrous for the Philistines, so they return it to the Israelites. Samuel now judges Israel, and there is peace in the land.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:10-9:2:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>2:10</strong></a>​<strong>—Why did Hannah pray that Jehovah “give strength to his king” when there was no human king over Israel? </strong>That the Israelites would have a human king was foretold in the Mosaic Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:17:14-5:17:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 17:14-18</a>) In his deathbed prophecy, Jacob said: “The scepter [a symbol of royal authority] will not turn aside from Judah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:49:10-1:49:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 49:10</a>) Moreover, concerning Sarah​—the ancestress of the Israelites—​Jehovah said: “Kings of peoples will come from her.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:16-1:17:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 17:16</a>) Hannah, then, was praying about a future king.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:3:3-9:3:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>3:3</strong></a>​<strong>—Did Samuel actually sleep in the Most Holy? </strong>No, he did not. Samuel was a Levite of the nonpriestly family of the Kohathites. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:6:33-13:6:38" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 6:33-38</a>) As such, he was not permitted to “come in to see the holy things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:4:17-4:4:20" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Numbers 4:17-20</a>) The only part of the sanctuary that Samuel had access to was the tabernacle courtyard. That is where he must have slept. Apparently, Eli also slept <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>somewhere in the courtyard. The expression “where the ark of God was” evidently refers to the tabernacle area.</p>

So as God’s representative, Samuel offered a burnt offering at Mizpah and also set up an altar in Ramah. These actions were apparently approved by Jehovah.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Samuel is faithful to Jehovah all his life, but his sons do not walk in godly ways. When the older men of Israel request a human king, Jehovah permits them to have one. Samuel follows Jehovah’s direction and anoints Saul, a handsome Benjamite, as king. Saul strengthens his position as king by defeating the Ammonites.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Saul’s valiant son Jonathan strikes down a Philistine garrison. The Philistines come up against Israel with a huge army. Saul panics and disobediently offers a burnt sacrifice himself. Taking along only his armor-bearer, courageous Jonathan attacks another Philistine outpost. Saul’s rash oath, however, weakens the force of the victory. Saul goes “warring round about” against all his enemies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:14:47-9:14:47" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Samuel 14:47</a>) Upon defeating the Amalekites, though, he disobeys Jehovah by sparing what had been “devoted to destruction.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:27:28-3:27:29" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Leviticus 27:28, 29</a>) Consequently, Jehovah rejects Saul as king.</p>

First of all, Jonathan did not know about his father’s oath. Moreover, the oath, prompted either by false zeal or by a wrong view of kingly power, caused problems for the people. How could such an oath have God’s approval? Although Jonathan was willing to accept the consequences of breaking the oath, his life was spared.</p>

After three attacks by Saul, David flees and becomes a fugitive.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">During his years as a runaway, David spares Saul’s life twice. He also meets and eventually marries beautiful Abigail. As the Philistines come up against Israel, Saul inquires of Jehovah. But Jehovah has left him. Samuel has died. Desperate, Saul consults a spirit medium, only to hear that he will be killed in the battle against the Philistines. During that battle, Saul is severely wounded, and his sons are killed. The account closes with Saul dying as a failure. David is still in hiding.</p>

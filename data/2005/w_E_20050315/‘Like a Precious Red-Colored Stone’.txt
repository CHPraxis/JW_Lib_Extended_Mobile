‘Like a Precious Red-Colored Stone’
THE apostle John had a vision of a glorious throne in heaven. The One seated upon the throne looked “like a jasper stone.” He was also like “a precious red-colored stone.” (Revelation 4:2, 3) What stones were these?
These were not opaque stones that shine from their surface. In ancient times, the Greek word translated “jasper” was used to denote stones of different colors, including precious gems that were transparent. The “jasper stone” of Revelation 4:3 “certainly [was] not our cheap modern jasper,” states A. T. Robertson in Word Pictures in the New Testament. Moreover, later in the book of Revelation, John describes the heavenly city, Jerusalem, saying: “Its radiance was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone shining crystal-clear.” (Revelation 21:10, 11) The stones John refers to were apparently translucent, allowing light to pass through them.
The one represented as being seated upon the throne in John’s vision is the most glorious Person in the universe, Jehovah God. He is pure and holy to a superlative degree. In harmony with that, the apostle John wrote: “God is light and there is no darkness at all in union with him.” (1 John 1:5) Hence, John urged his fellow believers to ‘purify themselves just as Jehovah is pure.’​—1 John 3:3.
What must we do to be viewed by God as pure? Our having faith in Christ’s shed blood for forgiveness of our sins is absolutely essential. We must also keep “walking in the light” by regularly studying the Bible and living in harmony with its teachings.​—1 John 1:7.

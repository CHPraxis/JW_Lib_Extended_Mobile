Draw Close to the Creator
After reading the book Draw Close to Jehovah, one reader from California, U.S.A., wrote: “I would like to tell you how reading and meditating on this book has enriched my life and my relationship with our heavenly Father. I feel that Jehovah is my friend now. This is the first publication that has made me laugh, cry, sit in awe of what I just read, and pray to Jehovah immediately. I love Jehovah more than I think my heart can contain, and I know that this book is one of the reasons for such feelings.”

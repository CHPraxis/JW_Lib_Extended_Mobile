Family Schedule​—Congregation Meetings
1 If you are a Christian parent, you want your children to grow up to love and serve Jehovah and, ultimately, to gain everlasting life in God’s promised new world. How can you help them to put the worship of Jehovah first in their lives? A major way is by your example. (Prov. 20:7) Recalling the example of her believing mother, one sister said: “There was never any question as to whether or not we were going to the meeting.” This made a lasting impression on her.
2 Does your family appreciate the purpose of congregation meetings? The instruction that we receive at these gatherings invigorates us to go on doing God’s will, and the fellowship that we enjoy with our brothers is an invaluable source of encouragement. (Isa. 54:13; Rom. 1:11, 12) However, the primary purpose of such meetings is for praise to be lifted up to Jehovah “among the congregated throngs.” (Ps. 26:12) Christian meetings afford us opportunities to demonstrate our love for Jehovah and to worship him.
3 “Keep Strict Watch”: Appreciation for the sacred purpose of our meetings will move us to “keep strict watch” that we do not gradually develop the custom of missing meetings over matters of lesser importance. (Eph. 5:15, 16; Heb. 10:24, 25) When making your family schedule, you might begin by marking the times for congregation meetings. Then be careful not to allow other activities to interfere with them. Make sure that meeting attendance is a priority for your family.
4 Are we not moved when we read of our brothers overcoming obstacles to attend meetings and assemblies? Although your circumstances may be less dramatic, likely you too face challenges. Satan is making it increasingly difficult for God’s people to worship Jehovah. Yet, be assured that your children will without fail notice your family’s determined efforts to attend congregation meetings. Indeed, by so doing, you may impart to them a spiritual gift that will never be forgotten.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>May: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on placing the <em>Worship God </em>book. The objective should be to start a home Bible study, especially with individuals who have already studied the <em>Knowledge </em>book and the <em>Require </em>brochure. <strong>June: </strong><em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>If individuals say they have no children, offer the <em>Family Happiness </em>book or the <em>Knowledge </em>book and make an effort to start Bible studies. <strong>July and August: </strong><em>Worship the Only True God. </em>If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the <em>Knowledge </em>book and the <em>Require </em>brochure be studied before the <em>Worship God </em>book.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Loving parents put forth much effort each day to provide good food for their children. Providing them with spiritual nourishment from God’s Word is even more important. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4</a>) One way you can help your children develop a healthy spiritual appetite and “grow to salvation” is by taking time each day to consider the daily text and comments as a family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:2-60:2:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:2</a>) When might you include this in your family schedule?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>At Mealtimes: </strong>Starting your day with a discussion of the text can help your family to keep Jehovah in mind throughout the day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:16:8-19:16:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 16:8</a>) One mother made it a point to read and discuss the text and comments with her son while he ate breakfast and to say a prayer with him before he went to school. This fortified him to take an uncompromising stand in the face of nationalism, to resist improper advances, and to give a courageous witness to students and teachers alike. Although he was the only Witness at school, he never felt alone.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>If discussing the text in the morning is not practical, you might consider it as a family later in the day, perhaps during the evening meal. Some also discuss experiences from the field ministry and points enjoyed from their personal Bible reading at this time. Many fondly recall such occasions around the table as among the happiest times spent together as a family.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>At Night: </strong>For some families, the best time to consider the daily text is just before retiring at night. This can also be a fine occasion to pray together. As your children daily hear you speak about Jehovah and pray to him, he becomes a real person to them.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>May Jehovah bless your efforts to instill the truth in your children as you make good use of <em>Examining the Scriptures Daily.</em></p>

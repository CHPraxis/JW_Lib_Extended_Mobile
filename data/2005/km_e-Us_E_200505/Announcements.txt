Announcements
▪ Literature offer for May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on placing the Worship God book. The objective should be to start a home Bible study, especially with individuals who have already studied the Knowledge book and the Require brochure. June: Learn From the Great Teacher. If individuals say they have no children, offer the Family Happiness book or the Knowledge book and make an effort to start Bible studies. July and August: Worship the Only True God. If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the Knowledge book and the Require brochure be studied before the Worship God book.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on June 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. If a separate checking account is maintained, such as for maintenance or construction, arrangements should also be made to audit this account. Completion of the audit(s) should be announced to the congregation with the next accounts report.
▪ Donations made by check and put in the local Kingdom Hall contribution boxes for the worldwide work and the Kingdom Hall Fund should be made payable to “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Donations made by check at district conventions and those sent to the branch office should be made payable to “Watch Tower.” The branch office financial address is Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, c/o Office of the Secretary and Treasurer, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483.

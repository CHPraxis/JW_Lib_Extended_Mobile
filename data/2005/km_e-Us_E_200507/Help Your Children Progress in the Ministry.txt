Help Your Children Progress in the Ministry
1 Christian parents shoulder the serious responsibility of training their children in the ministry from a young age. This may be achieved in a number of ways. Some children are able to recite an appropriate Bible text even before they are able to read. This can have a powerful effect on listeners. As little ones get older, they can do even more in the ministry. How can you parents help your children to share in giving a witness? Perhaps the following suggestions will be of further help.
2 After a greeting, you might say:
▪ “My son, [his name], has a meaningful scripture that he would like to call to your attention.” Your child may say: “This scripture in Psalms taught me God’s name. [Child reads or recites Psalm 83:18.] These magazines talk about what Jehovah God will do for us. May I leave them with you?” You could conclude the conversation by explaining how the worldwide work is supported.
3 Or you might try this approach:
▪ “Hello. I am training my daughter, [her name], to show concern for others in the community. She would like to share a brief Bible message with you.” She could say: “One way I like to help people is by sharing the Bible’s hope for the future. [Child reads or recites Revelation 21:4.] These magazines explain what God’s Kingdom will do for us. I think you will enjoy reading them.”
4 Consistently using a simplified presentation allows children to gain confidence in their ability to share the Kingdom message. Practice sessions that focus on speaking clearly and with adequate volume will equip them to speak under a variety of circumstances. Good advance preparation and sincere commendation will help little ones to express their faith.
5 With such encouragement, many young ones have qualified as unbaptized publishers. What a joy it is to see our children making progress in the Christian ministry!​—Ps. 148:12, 13.

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for July and August: Worship the Only True God. If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the Knowledge book and the Require brochure be studied before the Worship God book. September: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. Before requesting additional supplies from the branch office, congregations should use what is available locally and check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand. October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the Require brochure and make a special effort to start Bible studies.
▪ Starting in September, circuit overseers will give the public talk entitled “Why Be Guided by the Bible?”
▪ It is recommended that applications for regular pioneer service be submitted to the branch office at least 30 days before the requested start date. The congregation secretary should review the forms to make sure that they are complete. If applicants cannot recall the exact date of their baptism, they should estimate the date and keep a record of it. The secretary should note this date on the Congregation’s Publisher Record (S-21) card.
▪ Congregation secretaries should make sure that they have a Pioneer Appointment Letter (S-202) for each regular pioneer in the congregation. If they do not, please write the branch office.
▪ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed on the following dates: September 10, 2005 (Gilead graduation); October 1, 2005 (annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania); March 11, 2006 (Gilead graduation); and May 12-13, 2006 (spring cleaning). There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on those dates.
▪ It is important that groups of 20 or more planning to visit the U.S. branch office facilities at Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill first correspond by mail with the Central Tour Desk at 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson, NY 12563-9204. You may also use the following fax number: (845) 306-0200. Please send information on the number coming and the dates and times for visiting each location. Lodging information may be obtained from the congregation secretary. Before your visit, please review the June 2002 Our Kingdom Ministry Question Box regarding proper dress and grooming when visiting Bethel homes.
▪ A packet of legal material is available to assist publishers who are involved in lawsuits over child custody and visitation matters in which our religion is under attack. The packet should be requested by the body of elders only in a case in which it is evident that the publisher’s religious beliefs will be at issue. For those facing secular issues on child custody or visitation, helpful information can be found in Awake! of December 8, 1997, pages 3-12; in Awake! of October 22, 1988, pages 2-14; and on the chart found in Awake! of April 22, 1991, page 9.

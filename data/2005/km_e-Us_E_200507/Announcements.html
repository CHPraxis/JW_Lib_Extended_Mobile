<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>July and August: </strong><em>Worship the Only True God. </em>If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the <em>Knowledge </em>book and the <em>Require </em>brochure be studied before the <em>Worship God </em>book. <strong>September: </strong><em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life</em>. Before requesting additional supplies from the branch office, congregations should use what is available locally and check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand. <strong>October: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the <em>Require </em>brochure and make a special effort to start Bible studies.</p>

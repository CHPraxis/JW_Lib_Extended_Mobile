It Moved a Young Man to Examine His Life
▪ Last year a young man wrote to a branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses. He explained that his grandmother had given him a copy of the book The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. “I put it on a bookshelf,” he said. But recently he became seriously ill, even thinking that he might die.
“Something drew me to take this book out,” he noted. “I began reading the book with a certain amount of skepticism. But after finishing it, I came to the conclusion that the way I was leading my life was wrong. I began praying to God.”
“After I recovered from my illness,” he explained, “I decided to read the book a second time. To my surprise, I still found new things. I began to discern that though praying to God and reading Bible literature are very good, these are not enough. The main thing is to devote our life to God and help other people believe in him. As I learned from the illustration of the minas, we must work for the increase of God’s Kingdom.”—Luke 19:13-27.
In conclusion, the man wrote: “I would like to express my thanks to Jehovah’s Witnesses for this excellent book that has changed my life. I would like to receive more information and study the Bible. But my biggest desire is to serve God all my life, helping others to believe in him.”
The book The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived includes the speeches Jesus delivered as well as his illustrations and miracles. To the extent possible, everything is related in the order in which it occurred. And the book features beautiful, authentic illustrations that endeavor to convey the feelings of Jesus and his contemporaries.

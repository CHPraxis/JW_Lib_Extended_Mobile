Its 176 verses are based on successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet. In the original Hebrew, each of the psalm’s 22 stanzas has 8 lines that begin with the same letter. This psalm refers to God’s word, law, reminders, ways, orders, regulations, commandments, judicial decisions, sayings, and statutes. In this article and the next, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:176" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 119</a> will be discussed according to an accurate translation of the Hebrew Bible text. Reflecting on experiences involving Jehovah’s servants past and present should enhance our appreciation for this divinely inspired song and increase our gratitude for God’s written Word, the Bible.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>Faith in God and his word helps us to endure affliction and to do his will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:65-19:119:72" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Psalm 119:65-72</a>) Although presumptuous ones had ‘smeared him with falsehood,’ the psalmist sang: “It is good for me that I have been afflicted.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:66-19:119:66" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Psalm 119:66,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:69-19:119:69" data-bid="64-2" class="b"> 69,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:71-19:119:71" data-bid="64-3" class="b"> 71</a>) How could it be good for any of Jehovah’s servants to suffer affliction?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>When we suffer affliction, we undoubtedly supplicate Jehovah earnestly, and that draws us closer to him. We may spend more time studying God’s written Word and may make greater effort to apply it. This results in a happier life. But what if we react to affliction in a way that shows up undesirable traits, such as impatience and pride? With earnest prayer and the help of God’s Word and spirit, we can overcome such flaws and more fully ‘clothe ourselves with the new personality.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:9-51:3:14" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Colossians 3:9-14</a>) Moreover, our faith is strengthened when we endure adversity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:6-60:1:7" data-bid="66-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:6, 7</a>) Paul benefited from his tribulations because they made him more dependent on Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:8-47:1:10" data-bid="67-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 1:8-10</a>) Do we allow suffering to have a good effect on us?</p>

<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="qu">21. What happens when God puts presumptuous ones to shame?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[60]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>God’s word gives us a sound basis for trust in Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:73-19:119:80" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Psalm 119:73-80</a>) If we really trust in our Creator, we will have no reason for shame. Because of what others do, however, we need comfort and may feel like praying: “Let the presumptuous ones be ashamed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:76-19:119:78" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Psalm 119:76-78</a>) When Jehovah puts such ones to shame, this results in the exposure of their evil ways and in the sanctification of his holy name. We can be sure that persecutors of God’s people really do not gain anything. For example, they never have​—and never will—​put an end to Jehovah’s <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>Witnesses, who trust in God with all their heart.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:3:5-20:3:6" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="qu">22. In what sense was the psalmist “like a skin bottle in the smoke”?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[61]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>God’s word strengthens our trust in him when we are persecuted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:81-19:119:88" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Psalm 119:81-88</a>) Because presumptuous ones were persecuting him, the psalmist felt “like a skin bottle in the smoke.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:83-19:119:83" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Psalm 119:83,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:86-19:119:86" data-bid="72-2" class="b"> 86</a>) In Bible times, bottles made of animal hide were used to hold water, wine, and other liquids. When not in use, these bottles might shrivel up if hung near a fire in a room lacking a chimney. Does hardship or persecution ever make you feel “like a skin bottle in the smoke”? If so, trust in Jehovah, and pray: “According to your loving-kindness preserve me alive, that I may keep the reminder of your mouth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:88-19:119:88" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Psalm 119:88</a>.</p>

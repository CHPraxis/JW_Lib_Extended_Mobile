Do You Remember?
Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of The Watchtower? Well, see if you can answer the following questions:
• What was behind the choice of December 25 as a date for celebrating Jesus’ birth?
God’s Word provides no date for Jesus’ birth. The Enciclopedia Hispánica notes: “The date of December 25 for the celebration of Christmas is not the result of a strict chronological anniversary but, rather, of the Christianization of the festivals of the winter solstice.” The ancient Romans celebrated the rise of the sun in the winter sky by feasting, revelry, and the exchanging of presents.​—12/15, pages 4-5.
• Does Acts 7:59 mean that Stephen prayed to Jesus?
No. The Bible shows that prayer is to be directed only to Jehovah God. Seeing Jesus in vision, Stephen apparently felt free to appeal to him directly, saying: “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” Stephen knew that Jesus had been given authority to raise the dead. (John 5:27-29) So Stephen asked, or appealed to, Jesus to safeguard his life force until the resurrection.​—1/1, page 31.
• How do we know that a person’s destiny is not predetermined?
God has given man freedom of choice, which precludes predestination. It would have been unloving and unjust for Jehovah to have predetermined the course we would take and then hold us responsible for our actions. (Deuteronomy 32:4; 1 John 4:8)​—1/15, pages 4-5.
• Why would it be immodest to say that miracles are impossible?
Recognizing that they have only partial knowledge of the scientific wonders behind God’s creations, some scientists admit that they can no longer state with certainty that something is impossible. At most, they are willing to say that it is improbable.​—2/15, pages 5-6.
• Why did Judge Samson tell his parents that he wanted a daughter of the Philistines as a wife? (Judges 14:2)
It was against God’s law to marry a false worshiper. (Exodus 34:11-16) Yet, the Philistine woman was “just right” in Samson’s eyes. Samson “was looking for an opportunity against the Philistines,” and the woman was just right for that purpose. God backed Samson by means of His spirit. (Judges 13:25; 14:3, 4, 6)​—3/15, page 26.
• Should a Christian give a government employee a tip or some type of gift for his services?
It is wrong to bribe an official, to give him something valuable so that he will do something illegal, pervert justice, or give preferential treatment. But it is not bribery to give a tip or a gift to a public servant when he performs his duty or to obtain a legitimate service or to avoid unfair treatment.​—4/1, page 29.

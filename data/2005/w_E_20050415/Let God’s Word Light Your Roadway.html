<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Our love for Jehovah’s law brings us abundant peace. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:161-19:119:168" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Psalm 119:161-168</a>) Persecution does not rob us of the incomparable “peace of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a>) So much do we appreciate Jehovah’s judicial decisions that we praise him for them often​—“seven times in the day.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:161-19:119:164" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Psalm 119:161-164</a>) “Abundant peace belongs to those loving your law,” sang the psalmist, “and for them there is no stumbling block.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:165-19:119:165" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Psalm 119:165</a>) If we as individuals love and keep Jehovah’s law, we will not be stumbled spiritually by what someone else does or by any other matter.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">21. What Scriptural examples show that we need not stumble if difficulties arise in the congregation?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span><sup>21 </sup>Many individuals of Bible record did not let anything be a lasting stumbling block for them. For instance, the Christian man Gaius was not stumbled but ‘went on walking in the truth’ despite the ungodly conduct of Diotrephes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:1-64:1:3" data-bid="62-1" class="b">3 John 1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:9-64:1:10" data-bid="62-2" class="b"> 9, 10</a>) Paul exhorted the Christian women Euodia and Syntyche “to be of the same mind in the Lord,” likely because difficulties had arisen between them. Apparently, they were helped to resolve their problem, and they continued to serve Jehovah faithfully. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:2-50:4:3" data-bid="63-1" class="b">Philippians 4:2, 3</a>) So we need not stumble if difficulties of some sort arise in the congregation. Let us concentrate on keeping Jehovah’s orders, remembering that ‘all our ways are in front of him.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:168-19:119:168" data-bid="64-1" class="b">Psalm 119:168;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:3-20:15:3" data-bid="64-2" class="b"> Proverbs 15:3</a>) Then nothing will permanently rob us of “abundant peace.”</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="qu">22. (a) If we obey God, what privilege can we enjoy? (b) How should we view some who have wandered away from the Christian congregation?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>If we always obey Jehovah, we will be privileged to keep on praising him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:169-19:119:176" data-bid="65-1" class="b">Psalm 119:169-176</a>) By living in harmony with God’s regulations, not only do we enjoy spiritual security but ‘our lips continue to bubble forth Jehovah’s praise.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:169-19:119:171" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Psalm 119:169-171,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:174-19:119:174" data-bid="66-2" class="b"> 174</a>) This is the greatest privilege we could have in these last days. The psalmist wanted to keep living and praising Jehovah, but in some undisclosed way, he had ‘wandered like a lost sheep.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:175-19:119:176" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Psalm 119:175, 176</a>) Some who have wandered away from the Christian congregation may still love God and may want to praise him. Let us therefore do all we can to help them so that they may again find spiritual security and experience the joy of praising Jehovah with his people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:15-58:13:15" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:6-60:5:7" data-bid="68-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:6, 7</a>.</p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:176" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Psalm 119</a> can benefit us in various ways. For instance, it can make us more reliant on God, for it shows that true happiness results from “walking in the law of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:1" data-bid="70-1" class="b">Psalm 119:1</a>) The psalmist reminds us that ‘the substance of God’s word is truth.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:160-19:119:160" data-bid="71-1" class="b">Psalm 119:160</a>) This surely ought to enhance our appreciation for the entire written Word of God. Meditating on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:1-19:119:176" data-bid="72-1" class="b">Psalm 119</a> should move us to study the Scriptures diligently. The psalmist repeatedly petitioned God: “Teach me your regulations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:12-19:119:12" data-bid="73-1" class="b">Psalm 119:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:68-19:119:68" data-bid="73-2" class="b"> 68,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:135-19:119:135" data-bid="73-3" class="b"> 135</a>) He also pleaded: “Teach me goodness, sensibleness and knowledge themselves, for in your commandments I have exercised faith.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:66-19:119:66" data-bid="74-1" class="b">Psalm 119:66</a>) We do well to pray in a similar way.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>Divine teaching makes possible a close relationship with Jehovah. The psalmist repeatedly calls himself God’s servant.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:7-19:119:7" data-bid="76-1" class="b">Psalm 119:7</a>) Are you serving God joyfully as a Kingdom proclaimer? If so, be assured that Jehovah will continue to support and bless you in this privileged activity if you always trust in his word and let it light your roadway.</p>

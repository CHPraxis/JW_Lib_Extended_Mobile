Why a Book for All People?
▪ Did you know that the Bible is by far the most widely circulated and widely distributed book in all history? The 32-page brochure A Book for All People explains why the Bible is beloved and trusted by millions of people despite efforts to misrepresent and suppress it.
This brochure describes briefly what the Bible contains and why we can trust it. It also shows that the Bible is scientifically accurate, even though parts of it were written over 3,500 years ago. Moreover, the brochure explains how Bible teachings are a practical guide for modern-day living. In particular, you will see how Bible prophecies given hundreds of years in advance realized fulfillment, thus providing a basis for confidence in the marvelous promises the Bible contains of a coming righteous new world.

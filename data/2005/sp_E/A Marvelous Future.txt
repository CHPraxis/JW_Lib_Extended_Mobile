A Marvelous Future









Soon Satan and the demons will be put out of action




Satan and his demons will not deceive mankind much longer. Jehovah has already thrown them out of heaven. (Revelation 12:9) In the near future, God will again act against Satan and his demons. In a vision from God, the apostle John said: “And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven with the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he seized the dragon, the original serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. And he hurled him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, that he might not mislead the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended.” (Revelation 20:1-3) Later, the Devil and his demons will be destroyed forever.—Revelation 20:10.
Bad people on earth will also be done away with.—Psalm 37:9, 10; Luke 13:5.



The Dead Will Live Again!






The dead will come back to life on earth




After Satan and the demons are out of the way, Jehovah will bring many blessings to mankind. You will remember that the dead are lifeless, nonexistent. Jesus compared death to sleep—a deep sleep without dreams. (John 11:11-14) He did that because he knew the time would come when those asleep in death would be awakened to life. He said: “The hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will . . . come out.”—John 5:28, 29; compare Acts 24:15.
They will be brought to life here on earth. Instead of announcements that people have died, joyful reports will tell of those who have been brought back to life! What a joy it will be to welcome loved ones back from the grave!

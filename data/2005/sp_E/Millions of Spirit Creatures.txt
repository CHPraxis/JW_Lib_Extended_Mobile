Millions of Spirit Creatures




The Bible tells us that there are many spirit persons. Jehovah is himself a spirit.—John 4:24; 2 Corinthians 3:17, 18.
At one time Jehovah was alone in the universe. Then he began to create spirit persons called angels. They are more powerful and more intelligent than humans. Jehovah created many angels; God’s servant Daniel, in a vision, saw a hundred million angels.—Daniel 7:10; Hebrews 1:7.
These angels were created by God even before he made the earth. (Job 38:4-7) None of them are people who once lived and died on earth.








The great Spirit, Jehovah, created millions of spirit persons

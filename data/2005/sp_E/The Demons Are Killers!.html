<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Satan and the demons have always been cruel and dangerous. In early times Satan killed the livestock and servants of faithful Job. Then he killed Job’s ten children by causing “a great wind” to destroy the house they were in. After that Satan struck Job with “a malignant boil from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:7-18:1:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 1:7-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:7-18:2:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In Jesus’ day, the demons made some people speechless and blind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:32-40:9:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 9:32, 33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:22-40:12:22" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 12:22</a>) They tormented one man and made him slash himself with stones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:5:5-41:5:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 5:5</a>) They also caused a boy to cry out, dashed him to the ground, and “violently convulsed him.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:42-42:9:42" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 9:42</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>Today, Satan and the demons are as murderous as ever. In fact, their evil activity has increased since they were thrown out of heaven. Reports from around the world testify to their cruelty. They plague some people with illness. Others they harass at night, depriving them of sleep or giving them terrible dreams. Others they abuse sexually. Still others they drive to insanity, murder, or suicide.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Lintina, who lives in Suriname, relates that a demon, or bad spirit, killed 16 members of her family and tormented her physically and mentally for 18 years. From firsthand experience she states that the demons “enjoy torturing their unwilling victims until death.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">But Jehovah is able to protect his servants from Satan’s attacks.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:10-20:18:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:10</a>.</p>

The Paradise Earth









Jehovah will completely undo all the bad that Satan has done. Jehovah has made Jesus the King over all the earth. Under his rulership, the earth will be made into a paradise.—Daniel 7:13, 14; Luke 23:43.
Jehovah promises these things:
PLENTY OF FOOD: “The earth itself will certainly give its produce; God, our God, will bless us.” “There will come to be plenty of grain on the earth; on the top of the mountains there will be an overflow.”—Psalm 67:6; 72:16.

NO MORE WAR: “Come, you people, behold the activities of Jehovah, how he has set astonishing events on the earth. He is making wars to cease to the extremity of the earth.”—Psalm 46:8, 9.

NO BAD PEOPLE: “For evildoers themselves will be cut off . . . And just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; and you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be.”—Psalm 37:9, 10.






NO SICKNESS, SORROW, OR DEATH: “At that time the eyes of the blind ones will be opened, and the very ears of the deaf ones will be unstopped. At that time the lame one will climb up just as a stag does, and the tongue of the speechless one will cry out in gladness.”—Isaiah 35:5, 6.
“And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”—Revelation 21:3, 4.


Unlike Satan and the demons, Jehovah never lies. Everything he promises must come true. (Luke 1:36, 37) Jehovah loves you and wants you to live in the Paradise that he will make. So contact Jehovah’s Witnesses to learn more about the marvelous truths found in God’s Word. If you apply the truth in your life, you will be set free from bondage to falsehood, superstition, and ignorance. In time, you will even be released from bondage to sin and death. As Jesus said: “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”—John 8:32.

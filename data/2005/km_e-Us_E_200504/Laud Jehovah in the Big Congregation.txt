Laud Jehovah in the Big Congregation
1, 2. With what opportunity does the district convention provide us, and in what ways can we accomplish this?
1 Our district conventions each year provide us with a marvelous opportunity to glorify Jehovah. Our feelings are as those of David, who sang: “I will laud you in the big congregation; among a numerous people I shall praise you.” (Ps. 35:18) At the upcoming “Godly Obedience” District Convention, how can we make certain that as a united people, we are a cause for praise to Jehovah?
2 One way that we can do this is through our conduct. The management of one convention facility said: “Based on your conventions, we have told other religious groups wanting to rent the facility to come and see how Jehovah’s Witnesses put on a convention, as they have a perfect arrangement.” By our appearance, our cooperation, and our conduct, each of us contributes to such glowing expressions of praise, which rightly belong to our God.​—1 Pet. 2:12.
3, 4. How will modesty help us to dress in a way that befits Christian ministers, both at the convention and following the sessions?
3 Personal Appearance: To dress and groom ourselves in a manner that brings praise to Jehovah requires modesty. (1 Tim. 2:9) The Ministry School book, page 132, says: “A person who is modest is concerned about not needlessly offending others and not drawing undue attention to himself.” In many lands, immodest clothing has become commonplace. However, Jehovah appreciates the effort we put forth to represent him properly. (Acts 15:14) Although the convention may be held in a sports center or recreational facility, the gathering becomes our “big congregation” during the three days of the convention. Hence, as we assemble before Jehovah, we should dress with the dignity due the highest Personage in the universe.​—1 Chron. 29:11.
4 We also need to give attention to our appearance following the closing session each day. Even though we may desire to wear more comfortable clothes during leisure time or during a meal at a restaurant, it is important that our dress and grooming still befit those “professing to reverence God.” (1 Tim. 2:10) Acceptable dress is not determined by what is popular in the world. (1 John 2:16, 17) Our Christian publications provide helpful illustrations of modest, well-arranged dress of men and women in various circumstances. Wearing our badge cards while in the convention city will serve as a reminder that we are Christian ministers at all times.​—2 Cor. 6:3, 4.
5, 6. How can we show respect for Jehovah’s spiritual table?
5 Respect Jehovah’s Table: The Sovereign Lord of the universe has spread before us a feast. (Isa. 25:6; 1 Cor. 10:21) If we highly treasure our place at Jehovah’s spiritual table, our goal will be to attend all three days of the convention. Have you arranged for accommodations, transportation, and time off from secular work? Have you allotted sufficient time for preparation and travel so that you can arrive at the convention site early enough to find seats, to associate with your brothers, and to join them in giving praise to Jehovah in the opening song and prayer?​—Ps. 147:1.
6 Respect for Jehovah’s table will move us to pay close attention to the program and to avoid needlessly talking with others, eating, or walking about in the corridors. Through the faithful and discreet slave class, Jehovah is providing the spiritual food that we need right now. (Matt. 24:45) None of us can afford to miss any of it. Parents should sit with their children and help them to benefit fully.​—Deut. 31:12.
 7. What are we requested to do for the noon meal, and why?
7 It is requested that we bring a lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain food during the noon break. It was commendable that most delegates carefully followed this direction at last year’s convention. How good it would be if all would do so this year! (Heb. 13:17) This arrangement provides a fine opportunity to enjoy upbuilding fellowship with our brothers and contributes to an atmosphere of unity and peace that brings honor to Jehovah.​—Ps. 133:1.
8, 9. What additional opportunity to praise Jehovah does the convention afford us?
8 Witnessing Informally: While traveling to and from the convention site, we have many opportunities to praise Jehovah with our lips. (Heb. 13:15) Whether we are eating at a restaurant or conversing with hotel personnel, let us look for ways to give a witness. Our minds and hearts will be full of spiritual treasures from the convention. Let us share these good things with those we meet informally.​—1 Pet. 3:15.
9 We look forward with keen anticipation to this opportunity to bless Jehovah “among the congregated throngs.” (Ps. 26:12) May we unitedly laud Jehovah at the “Godly Obedience” District Convention.

District Convention Reminders
▪ Program Times: The program will begin at 9:30 a.m. all three days. The doors will open at 8:00 a.m. A few minutes before the start of the session, the chairman will be seated on the platform while introductory Kingdom music is played. All of us should take our seats at that time so that the program can begin in a dignified manner. The program will conclude at 5:05 p.m. on Friday and Saturday and at 4:10 p.m. on Sunday.
▪ Parking: At all convention sites where we have secured control of the parking facilities, the spaces will be made available at no charge on a first-come, first-served basis. Convention badge cards will serve as identification for parking. Only those who have a state-approved disabled license plate or placard will be allowed to park in the parking reserved for the disabled. Since parking space is usually limited, carpooling should be done to the extent possible rather than having only one or two persons per car.
▪ Seat Saving: Seats may be saved only for those traveling with you in the same vehicle or living with you in the same home.
▪ Donations: Considerable expense is involved in arranging a district convention. We can show our appreciation by making voluntary contributions to the worldwide work at our Kingdom Hall or at the convention. Any checks contributed at the convention should be made payable to “Watch Tower.”
▪ Hearing Impaired: The program will be broadcast in the vicinity of the auditorium on an FM radio frequency. An announcement regarding this will be made at the beginning of the first session. To make use of this provision, you will need to bring a small FM receiver with earphones.
▪ Noon Meal: Please bring a lunch rather than leave the convention site to obtain a meal during the noon break. A small cooler that can be placed under a seat may be used. Large family-size picnic coolers, glass containers, and alcoholic beverages are not permitted in the convention facility.
▪ Recording: Recorders of any type should not be connected to the facility’s electric or sound system and may be used only in a way that does not disturb others.
▪ Picture Taking: If you take pictures, no flash should be used during sessions.
▪ Pagers and Cell Phones: These should be set so as not to cause a distraction.
▪ Accidents and Emergencies: Emergency-response services have complained that they receive many cell-phone calls to 911 over minor matters. If a medical emergency arises at the convention site, please contact a nearby attendant, who will immediately notify the First Aid Department so that our qualified first-aid personnel on site can assess the seriousness of the situation and render assistance. If necessary, 911 will be called.
▪ Restaurants: In many places it is customary to leave a 15 to 20 percent tip, depending on the service.
▪ Hotels: (1) Do not reserve more rooms than will actually be needed, and do not have more people stay in your room than allowed. (2) If you must cancel your reservation, notify the hotel immediately. (3) Take a luggage cart only when you are ready to use it. (4) Do not cook in noncooking rooms. (5) Leave a tip for the housekeeper each day. (6) Do not abuse any complimentary breakfast, coffee, or ice provisions that are made available for guests to use while they are at the hotel. (7) Display the fruitage of the spirit in dealing with the hotel staff, especially during very busy check-in and checkout times.

Do Good and Share With Others
1 Dorcas “abounded in good deeds and gifts of mercy.” (Acts 9:36, 39) Her generous spirit endeared her both to the people who knew her and to Jehovah God. Hebrews 13:16 says: “Do not forget the doing of good and the sharing of things with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.” How can we do good and share with others today?
2 One way we can benefit others is by sharing our “valuable things.” (Prov. 3:9) Our contributions to the worldwide work make it possible for Kingdom Halls, Assembly Halls, and branch facilities to be built throughout the world. Our generosity has enabled millions to benefit from theocratic instruction and upbuilding spiritual association.
3 Sharing Comfort: When disaster strikes, Jehovah’s people are ready to “work what is good” toward fellow believers as well as toward those who do not share our faith. (Gal. 6:10) Following an explosion in a chemical plant in France, one couple who lived next to the plant stated: “Our Christian brothers came immediately to help clean up our apartment as well as those of others in the building. Our neighbors were very surprised to see that so many people came to help.” Another sister added: “The elders rallied around us. They came to encourage us. In fact, this was what we needed, more than material help.”
4 While there are many ways that we can do good to our neighbors, the most beneficial way we can help them is to share the precious knowledge of the truth, which includes the “hope of the everlasting life” promised by Jehovah himself. (Titus 1:1, 2) The Bible’s message brings true comfort to those who are mourning over world conditions and their own sinful state. (Matt. 5:4) May we do good and share with others when it is in the power of our hand to do so.​—Prov. 3:27.

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for April and May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on placing the Worship God book. The objective should be to start a home Bible study, especially with individuals who have already studied the Knowledge book and the Require brochure. June: Learn From the Great Teacher. If individuals say they have no children, offer the Family Happiness book or the Knowledge book and make an effort to start Bible studies. July: Worship the Only True God. If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the Knowledge book and the Require brochure be studied before the Worship God book.
▪ Beginning in April, district convention badge cards for 2005 will automatically be included with literature shipments. It will not be necessary to request these unless you have a foreign-language group associated with your congregation. Based on the size of each congregation, cards will be shipped in lots of 25. If the congregation needs additional badge cards, these should be requested on the Literature Request Form (S-14). Plastic badge holders must be requested for any in the congregation who desire them.
▪ Congregation secretaries should maintain an adequate supply of the forms Application for Regular Pioneer Service (S-205) and Application for Auxiliary Pioneer Service (S-205b). These can be ordered on the Literature Request Form (S-14). Maintain at least a one-year supply. Review all regular pioneer application forms to make sure they are complete.
▪ Arrangements for spring cleaning at the branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, have been adjusted to include Friday afternoon, May 13, in addition to Saturday, May 14, 2005. Those who have already arranged to visit the branch office on May 13 are encouraged to plan to tour in the morning, since tours in the afternoon will be very limited. As was previously announced, there will be no arrangements for tours on Saturday, May 14.

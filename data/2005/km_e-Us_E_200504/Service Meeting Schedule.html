<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>Note: </strong><em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Godly Obedience” District Convention. Where appropriate, use 15 minutes on the last Service Meeting before attending the convention to repeat counsel and reminders from this month’s insert that apply locally. A month or two following your convention, set aside 15 to 20 minutes on a Service Meeting (perhaps using a local needs portion) for a review of convention highlights that the publishers have found to be helpful in the field ministry. The special Service Meeting part will give us the opportunity to explain how we are using what we learned at the convention and how that has helped make our ministry more effective.</p>

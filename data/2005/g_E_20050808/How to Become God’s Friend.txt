How to Become God’s Friend
▪ That is what the 32-page brochure You Can Be God’s Friend! teaches us. Its appealing lessons include “God Invites You to Become His Friend” and “God Is the Best Friend You Could Ever Have.” The brochure is designed to help the reader learn the basic teachings of the Bible.
In its lesson “God’s Friends Will Live in Paradise,” the brochure clearly explains God’s purpose for our earth. Yet, to enjoy the Paradise that the Bible promises, we must learn how God wants us to serve him. Such lessons as “How to Find the True Religion” and “Reject False Religion!” will help you to become God’s friend and to enjoy his favor. We are sure that you will find reading this brochure rewarding.

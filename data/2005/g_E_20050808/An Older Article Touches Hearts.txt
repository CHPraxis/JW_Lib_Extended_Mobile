An Older Article Touches Hearts
AT A school in Suwałki, in northeast Poland, a teacher asked students to prepare for a discussion on abortion. Sixteen-year-old Justyna gathered some information from the publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses. On the day of the discussion, the teacher gave the students an opportunity to express their opinions.
“I approached the teacher and showed her the article ‘Diary of an Unborn Child,’ published in the May 22, 1980, issue of Awake!” says Justyna. She told her teacher: “Please notice that it is written from the point of view of a child, a fetus, that is to undergo abortion. I think it is very interesting.” The teacher started to read the diary aloud. The students were silent, everyone listening attentively.
Before the teacher had read even half the text, she found she was not able to continue and asked a student to read it. The teacher sat down and started to cry. After the diary was read, an interesting discussion followed, and some students asked for a copy of the article. “The class changed their attitude toward the literature published by Jehovah’s Witnesses,” says Justyna. “Formerly they had a negative view, but now their view was favorable. One boy even became a regular reader of Awake!”
Just as Justyna successfully used an article she found in an issue of Awake! that was over 20 years old, you too can find “a bagful of wisdom” in the back issues of this magazine. (Job 28:18) When attending meetings at the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses, you can examine the bound volumes of Awake! found there on the shelves in the library. You will enjoy reading beneficial articles that do not lose their value with the passing of time. You may also obtain a current copy of Awake! from Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area.

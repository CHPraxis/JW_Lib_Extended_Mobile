<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AT A school in Suwałki, in northeast Poland, a teacher asked students to prepare for a discussion on abortion. Sixteen-year-old Justyna gathered some information from the publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses. On the day of the discussion, the teacher gave the students an opportunity to express their opinions.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I approached the teacher and showed her the article ‘Diary of an Unborn Child,’ published in the May 22, 1980, issue of <em>Awake!” </em>says Justyna. She told her teacher: “Please notice that it is written from the point of view of a child, a fetus, that is to undergo abortion. I think it is very interesting.” The teacher started to read the diary aloud. The students were silent, everyone listening attentively.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Before the teacher had read even half the text, she found she was not able to continue and asked a student to read it. The teacher sat down and started to cry. After the diary was read, an interesting discussion followed, and some students asked for a copy of the article. “The class changed their attitude toward the literature published by Jehovah’s Witnesses,” says Justyna. “Formerly they had a negative view, but now their view was favorable. One boy even became a regular reader of <em>Awake!”</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Just as Justyna successfully used an article she found in an issue of <em>Awake! </em>that was over 20 years old, you too can find “a bagful of wisdom” in the back issues of this magazine. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:28:18-18:28:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 28:18</a>) When attending meetings at the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses, you can examine the bound volumes of <em>Awake! </em>found there on the shelves in the library. You will enjoy reading beneficial articles that do not lose their value with the passing of time. You may also obtain a current copy of <em>Awake! </em>from Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area.</p>

What Is God’s Purpose for Us?
▪ Is it simply to live a short time on earth—perhaps 70 or 80 years—and then die? Is it God’s purpose to take good people to live in heaven? Why did God create the earth? Was it meant to be only a temporary home for people?
The 32-page brochure Enjoy Life on Earth Forever! shows that God made the earth to be a lasting home for humans. Our earth was made so that with proper care it would be a beautiful paradise. The brochure’s sections “Why Does Man Die?” and “What Is Death?” show what went wrong, and “Jehovah Gives Us a Savior” and “How We Are Saved From Sin and Death” reveal how earth will become a wonderful paradise home for humankind.
The brochure has over 75 pictures, and one or more Bible texts are listed with each picture. These texts provide a basis for discussion of the pictures. If you have children, you can use the pictures to help them learn about God’s purposes.

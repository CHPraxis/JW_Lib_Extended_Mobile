<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Is it simply to live a short time on earth<wbr />—perhaps 70 or 80 years—<wbr />and then die? Is it God’s purpose to take good people to live in heaven? Why did God create the earth? Was it meant to be only a temporary home for people?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The 32-page brochure <em>Enjoy Life on Earth Forever! </em>shows that God made the earth to be a lasting home for humans. Our earth was made so that with proper care it would be a beautiful paradise. The brochure’s sections “Why Does Man Die?” and “What Is Death?” show what went wrong, and “Jehovah Gives Us a Savior” and “How We Are Saved From Sin and Death” reveal how earth will become a wonderful paradise home for humankind.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The brochure has over 75 pictures, and one or more Bible texts are listed with each picture. These texts provide a basis for discussion of the pictures. If you have children, you can use the pictures to help them learn about God’s purposes.</p>

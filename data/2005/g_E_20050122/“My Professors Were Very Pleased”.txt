“My Professors Were Very Pleased”
That is what a first-year medical student at the Tbilisi State Medical University in the country of Georgia said in a letter to the publishers of Awake! Why did this student write to Awake!?
“I have been reading your journals since 1998. . . . They really help me with my studies. The articles are always timely and full of reliable information. Recently I used information from the series in the November 22, 2002, issue of Awake! magazine, ‘Stem Cells—Has Science Gone Too Far?’ for a paper on the subject ‘Cloning and Stem Cell Kinds.’ My professors were very pleased, and I received the highest marks.
“I am very happy that you publish articles on such interesting subjects, especially regarding medicine. Even though neither I nor my family are Jehovah’s Witnesses, we thoroughly enjoy your journals, as they help us to broaden our knowledge of the world around us.”

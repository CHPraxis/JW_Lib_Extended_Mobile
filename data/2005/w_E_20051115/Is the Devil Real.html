<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HOW do you view the Devil? Do you think of him as a real person who tempts people to do wicked things, or does he merely represent the principle of evil? Is the Devil someone to be feared, or should he be dismissed as nothing more than a superstitious notion or a mythological unreality? Does the word “devil” refer to some abstract destructive force in the universe? Could the term simply be a symbol of the evil traits in humans, as many modern theologians claim?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is not surprising that mankind is divided on the question of who the Devil is. Imagine how difficult it can be to discover the true identity of someone who is a master of disguise! Particularly is that so if he is determined to remain concealed behind a mask. The Bible describes the Devil as such a personality. Referring to him as Satan, it says: “Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:14-47:11:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 11:14</a>) Though he is evil, the Devil presents himself as good in order to misguide others. And if he gets people to believe that he simply does not exist, that suits his purpose even better.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Really, then, who is the Devil? When and how did he come into existence? How does he influence mankind today? What, if anything, can we do to resist that influence? The Bible contains the accurate history of the Devil from his very beginning and provides truthful answers to these questions.</p>

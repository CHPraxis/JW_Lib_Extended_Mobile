<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Adolescence  </strong>Thank you for the series “Meeting the Challenges of Adolescence.” (July 8, 2004) Recently I entered adolescence and have had some problems that made me feel bad. Thanks to these articles, I have received the needed counsel that will help me to remember my Grand Creator. I hope to go through adolescence without the pains that succumbing to this world brings.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When I was a child, I had many friends my age. But as we got older, we stopped talking to one another. After Christian meetings, I would sit in the car without associating. I was relieved when I read that it is common for adolescents to experience a wide range of emotions and that one of the best ways to counteract loneliness is to reach out to others<wbr />—including those not part of your peer group. That day at the meeting I spoke to others, regardless of their age, and this made me happy.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">I am 15 years old, and I needed this information very much. The young people quoted helped me to understand that I am not the only one dealing with painful emotions and that these feelings can be conquered. This strengthened and encouraged me!</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Thank you for this series. It is good to see that it is possible to cope with this turbulent period. I hope that these articles will help other young ones to deal with this phase of life in a balanced way.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">This series is just what I have been looking for. I have emotional ups and downs, and sometimes I feel very insecure and lonely. I always thought that it was my fault that I was having these feelings. But the last article in the series stated: “Jehovah God wants you to be happy<wbr />—really happy. That involves far more than the mere facade of fun that is simply a mask for underlying misery.” When I read these words, my tears flowed. The article also said that in time these disturbing feelings can pass. This really, really comforted me. I got renewed strength. Thank you very much!</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">When I saw this magazine at the Kingdom Hall, I immediately started looking through it. Reading it at home, I couldn’t put it down. I was very disappointed with the ending, though, because I didn’t want the article to stop! Keep writing articles like this!</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>Keyboards  </strong>I am 12 years old. Thank you for the article “A World of Music at Your Fingertips.” (July 8, 2004) I bought a book on musical instruments, which included explanations of keyboard instruments. The details of the keyboard are explained but not as well as in <em>Awake! </em>I have been looking for such an article for quite some time! The ability to play a musical instrument is indeed a wonderful gift from our Creator!</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><strong>Mobbing  </strong>Recently, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses gave me the magazine with the series “Victimized at Work<wbr />—What Can You Do?” (May 8, 2004) Because of workplace bullying (mobbing), an acquaintance of mine quit his job. In Germany, that means no unemployment benefits for three months. I did what I could for the young man. But it is especially thanks to your magazine, which I enclosed with a letter to the employment office, that the young man got his benefits three days later!</p>

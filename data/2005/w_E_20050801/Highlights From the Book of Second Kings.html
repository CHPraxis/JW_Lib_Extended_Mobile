<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Second Kings</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE Bible book of Second Kings takes up where the book of First Kings leaves off. It is an account of 29 kings<wbr />—12 from the northern kingdom of Israel and 17 from the southern kingdom of Judah. Second Kings also relates activities of the prophets Elijah, Elisha, and Isaiah. Though not strictly in chronological order, the record reaches down to the time of the destruction of Samaria and Jerusalem. Altogether, Second Kings covers a period of 340 years<wbr />—from 920 B.C.E. to 580 B.C.E. when the prophet Jeremiah completed the writing of this book.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Of what value is Second Kings to us? What does it teach us about Jehovah and his dealings? What lessons can we draw from the actions of the kings, the prophets, and others mentioned in the book? Let us see what we can learn from Second Kings.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>ELISHA SUCCEEDS ELIJAH</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:1:1-12:8:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>2 Kings 1:1–8:29</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">King Ahaziah of Israel suffers a fall in his home and is sick. He receives a notice of death from the prophet Elijah. Ahaziah dies, and his brother Jehoram ascends to the throne. Meanwhile, Jehoshaphat is king over Judah. Elijah is taken up in a windstorm, and his assistant, Elisha, succeeds him as a prophet. During some 60 years of his ministry that follows, Elisha performs many miracles.<wbr />—See the box “Elisha’s Miracles.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">When a Moabite king rebels against Israel, Jehoram, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom go out to meet him in battle. They are given victory because of the faithfulness of Jehoshaphat. Later, the king of Syria plans a surprise attack against Israel. However, Elisha foils the plan. The Syrian king is enraged and sends “horses and war chariots and a heavy military force” to capture Elisha. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:6:14-12:6:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Kings 6:14</a>) Elisha performs two miracles and turns back the Syrians in peace. In time, Syrian King Ben-hadad lays siege against Samaria. This results in a severe famine, but Elisha foretells that the famine will end.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Some time later, Elisha goes to Damascus. King Ben-hadad, now sick, sends Hazael to inquire if he will recover from his sickness. Elisha foretells that the king will die and that Hazael will rule in his place. The very next day, Hazael suffocates the king under a wet “netted cloth” and assumes the kingship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/12:8:15-12:8:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Kings 8:15</a>, footnote) In Judah, Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram becomes king, and he is succeeded by his son Ahaziah.<wbr />—See the box “Kings of Judah and of Israel.”</p>

Realizing this, Elisha asked for a double portion of Elijah’s spirit. <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>Elisha was appointed by Elijah as his successor and had been his attendant for six years, so Elisha viewed Elijah as his spiritual father; Elisha was like the firstborn spiritual son of Elijah.

It would have been unthinkable on his part to profit from his God-appointed office. True worshippers today do not reach out for personal gain from Jehovah’s service. They take to heart Jesus’ admonition: “You received free, give free.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:10:8-40:10:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 10:8</a>.</p>

When the king bowed down in worship to Rimmon, Naaman did also. For Naaman, though, it was a purely mechanical act, strictly for the purpose of supporting the body of the king and not for rendering worship. Naaman was asking Jehovah to forgive him for performing this civil duty. Believing Naaman, Elisha said to him: “Go in peace.”</p>

The children recognized Elisha as Jehovah’s representative and simply did not want him around. They told him to “go up,” that is, keep going up to Bethel or be taken up as Elijah had been. The children evidently reflected the antagonistic attitude of their parents. How vital that parents teach their children to respect God’s representatives!</p>

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">The book of Second Kings portrays Jehovah as the Fulfiller of promises.

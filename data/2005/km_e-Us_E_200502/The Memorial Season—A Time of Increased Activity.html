<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="qu"> 1. What effect did “seasonal festivals” have on God-fearing Israelites?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[15]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>At designated times during the year, the ancient Israelites celebrated “seasonal festivals of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:2-3:23:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lev. 23:2</a>) Taking time to reflect on the goodness of their God resulted in great joy and moved them to be zealous for pure worship.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:30:21-14:31:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Chron. 30:21–31:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="qu">2, 3. Why is it fitting that we increase our spiritual activity during the Memorial season, and when will we observe the Memorial?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[16]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>In modern times, our joyful theocratic activity intensifies each year during the Memorial season. It is a time when we reflect deeply on the priceless gift Jehovah gave in our behalf​—his only-begotten Son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:18-60:1:19" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 1:18, 19</a>) As we meditate on the love shown by God and his Son, we feel impelled to praise Jehovah and to exert ourselves in doing the divine will.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:14-47:5:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[16]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>This year the Lord’s Evening Meal will be observed on Thursday, March 24, after sundown. How might we increase our share in the ministry during the months of March, April, and May?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="qu">4, 5. (a) What has helped some to reach more people with the good news? (b) What have you found to be effective locally?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[17]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Reaching More People: </strong>Look for ways to reach as many people as possible when you share in field service. Can you plan to participate in door-to-door work when more people are at home, such as in the late afternoon or in the evening? If some in your book study group would like to share in service before the study, the book study overseer may be able to arrange to have a brief meeting for service in order to work a nearby territory.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[17]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Another way to reach many people is by witnessing in public places. A sister in Japan wanted to auxiliary pioneer even though she had a full-time job. An elder suggested that each day before going to her secular job, she might do street witnessing near a train station. After overcoming her own timidity and the ridicule of some commuters, she developed a magazine route of some 40 persons, including commuters, station workers, and nearby shop owners. She placed an average of 235 magazines a month. By sharing Scriptural points with people for just a few moments each day, she was able to start six Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="qu"> 6. How might youths increase their spiritual activity?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[18]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong>Opportunities to Witness: </strong>Many school-age publishers have periods of time off during the year. These may be opportune times to auxiliary pioneer. In addition, Christian youths can increase their activity by giving a witness at school. You may be surprised how curious classmates may be about your beliefs. Why not take advantage of classroom discussions or school essays to give a witness? Others have been able to do so using our videos. Some have started Bible studies with classmates and helped them progress to dedication and baptism. These are fine ways to “praise the name of Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:12-19:148:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 148:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="qu"> 7. (a) How did one brother take advantage of opportunities to witness to others? (b) Have you enjoyed a similar experience?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[19]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>In your daily routine, look for ways to speak with people about our wonderful God and his marvelous promises. One brother who travels on the same trains every day witnesses to fellow commuters when appropriate. For example, while waiting at one station for his next train, he <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>witnessed to a young man each day for about five minutes. As a result, the young man and his colleague agreed to a Bible study. The Bible study was conducted on the train as they traveled. Some time later, an elderly woman who had been listening to their conversations approached the brother and asked him for a Bible study. She too is enjoying her study on the days she uses the train. In this way, the brother has studied with ten different individuals on the train.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="qu"> 8. What avenue of service may enable those limited by advanced age or health problems to increase their share in the ministry?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[20]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>What if you are limited in what you can do because of advanced age or health problems? There may still be ways you can increase your praise to Jehovah. Have you tried telephone witnessing? If you are unsure of how to go about this, mention it to your book study overseer. He may be able to arrange for publishers who use this method to work with you. Working together as partners, you can learn from one another and help one another to give an effective witness. Fine suggestions for doing telephone witnessing can be found in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="23" href="jwpub://p/E:202001044/1-20">February 2001 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry, </em>pages 5-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="qu"> 9. How can we help Bible students to qualify to share with the congregation in the public ministry?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[21]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Attending the Memorial may stimulate new ones to want to increase their praise to Jehovah. You can help them to overcome any apprehension they may have about sharing in the formal preaching work by relating positive field service experiences and by progressively training them to explain Bible teachings and defend their faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:15</a>) If a Bible student expresses a desire to begin publishing the good news, speak with the presiding overseer. He will arrange for a meeting with the student to determine whether he qualifies to share with the congregation in the public ministry. How it must make Jehovah’s heart rejoice to see new ones take their stand on his side of the universal issue!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="qu">10. (a) How can a good schedule help us to auxiliary pioneer? (b) Were you able to arrange to auxiliary pioneer last year during the Memorial season? How so?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[22]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup><strong>Can You Auxiliary Pioneer? </strong>The auxiliary pioneer requirement of 50 hours should be viewed seriously. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:37-40:5:37" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 5:37</a>) This means that you will need to arrange to spend an average of 12 hours in field service each week. Does one of the sample auxiliary pioneer schedules on page 5 fit your circumstances? If not, can you arrange a schedule that will enable you to auxiliary pioneer in March, April, or May? Ask Jehovah to bless your efforts to increase your service activity.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:3-20:16:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Prov. 16:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="qu">11. How can the elders and ministerial servants support those who will be serving as auxiliary pioneers?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[23]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>The elders and ministerial servants will fully support your endeavors to make this Memorial season one of special praise to Jehovah. Likely, many of them will be auxiliary pioneering. The elders will arrange to have extra meetings for service, such as in late afternoons, on weekday evenings, and on weekends, as needed. To determine where and when such meetings will be held and who will be available to take the lead, the elders may speak with those who have definite plans to pioneer or who are considering doing so. The elders will strive to coordinate the arrangements so that there will be other publishers to work with on the days and times that you have set aside for service. In this way, plans can be firmly established and much good can be accomplished.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:18-20:20:18" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Prov. 20:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="qu">12. What moves us to praise Jehovah at all times?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[24]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup><strong>Do Your Utmost: </strong>If your circumstances do not allow you to auxiliary pioneer, remember that Jehovah accepts our efforts and sacrifices ‘according to what we have, not according to what we do not have.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:12-47:8:12" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:12</a>) We have so much for which to thank Jehovah. With good reason David wrote: “I will bless Jehovah at all times; constantly his praise will be in my mouth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:1-19:34:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 34:1</a>) May that be our determination during this Memorial season.</p>

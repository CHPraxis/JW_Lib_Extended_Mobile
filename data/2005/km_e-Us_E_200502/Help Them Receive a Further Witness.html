<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>As we share the good news, we often meet people who live outside our territory or who speak another language, including sign language. Others with whom we have enjoyed good Bible discussions may move out of our territory. How can we arrange for such ones to receive a further witness? By using the <em>Please Follow Up </em>(S-43) form.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>People often listen more intently to the good news when it is presented in their mother tongue. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:22:1-44:22:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 22:1, 2</a>) Hence, in most cases, when we meet someone who speaks another language, we should fill out the form <em>even if the person does not show interest in the Kingdom message. </em>However, where there is a sizable foreign-language population that is regularly receiving a witness in their own language, it may not be necessary to fill out the form except when interest is shown.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Filling Out the Form: </strong>Tactfully endeavor to obtain the person’s name, his address, and his telephone number. Indicate the degree of interest shown, when the person can be reached, the literature that was placed or requested, and the language that the person best understands. After completing the form, promptly give it to the congregation secretary, who will forward it to the appropriate congregation or group.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Forwarding the Form: </strong>If the secretary does not know which congregation or group should receive the form or does not have the mailing address, he may telephone the Territory Desk at the branch office to obtain the needed information. It is no longer necessary to involve the city overseer when forwarding the form.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Whenever a congregation or a group receives a completed <em>Please Follow Up </em>form, arrangements should be made to call on the person promptly. As we diligently do our part, we can be confident that Jehovah will open the hearts of those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 13:48</a>.</p>

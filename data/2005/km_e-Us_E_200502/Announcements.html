<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>February: </strong><em>Draw Close to Jehovah. </em>If this publication is not available, you may use the <em>Creation </em>book (large or small size) or the <em>Revelation Climax </em>book as an alternative offer. <strong>March: </strong><em>Keep on the Watch! </em>Where genuine interest is shown, offer the <em>Knowledge </em>book, making a special effort to start Bible studies. <strong>April and May: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on placing the <em>Worship God </em>book. The objective should be to start a home Bible study, especially with individuals who have already studied the <em>Knowledge </em>book and the <em>Require </em>brochure.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on March 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. If a separate checking account is maintained, such as for maintenance or construction, arrangements should also be made to audit this account. When the audit(s) have been completed, this should be announced to the congregation with the next accounts report.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the hour requirement, the elders should arrange for assistance to be given. For suggestions, review the annual S-201 letters.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The special public talk for the 2005 Memorial season will be entitled “Why Did Jesus Suffer and Die?” See the related announcement in the September 2004 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry.</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ All will want to be present at the Public Meeting on Sunday, March 20, for a special announcement regarding a provision that will be made available to publishers.</p>

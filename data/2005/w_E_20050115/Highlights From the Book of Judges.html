<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Judges</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">HOW does Jehovah respond when his own people turn their back on him and begin to worship false gods? What if they repeatedly fall away and call on him for help only when they are in distress? Does Jehovah provide a way of escape for them even then? The book of Judges answers these and other vital questions. Completed by the prophet Samuel about 1100 B.C.E., it covers events that span some 330 years​—from the death of Joshua to the enthronement of Israel’s first king.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As a part of God’s dynamic word, or message, the book of Judges is of great value to us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>) The exciting accounts recorded in it give us insight into God’s personality. The lessons that we learn from them strengthen our faith and help us to get a firm hold on “the real life,” everlasting life in God’s promised new world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:12-54:6:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:19-54:6:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:13</a>) The deeds of salvation that Jehovah performs in behalf of his people provide a foregleam of the greater deliverance by his Son, Jesus Christ, in the future.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>WHY WERE JUDGES NEEDED?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:1:1-7:3:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Judges 1:1–3:6</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">After the kings of the land of Canaan are defeated under the leadership of Joshua, the individual tribes of Israel go to their inheritance and take possession of the land. However, the Israelites fail to dispossess the inhabitants of the land. This failure proves to be a real snare for Israel.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The generation that comes after the days of Joshua ‘does not know Jehovah or the work that he has done for Israel.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:2:10-7:2:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Judges 2:10</a>) Moreover, the people proceed to form marriage alliances with the Canaanites and to serve their gods. So Jehovah gives the Israelites into the hands of their enemies. When oppression becomes severe, though, the sons of Israel call upon the true God for help. In this religious, social, and political climate unfolds the account of a line of judges whom Jehovah raises up to save his people from their enemies.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The exciting account of the exploits of the judges begins with Othniel’s bringing an end to Israel’s eight-year subjugation to a Mesopotamian king. Using a courageous strategy, Judge Ehud kills Eglon, the fat Moabite king. Valiant Shamgar single-handedly strikes down 600 Philistines using a cattle goad. With encouragement from Deborah, who serves as a prophetess, and with Jehovah’s backing, Barak and his lightly equipped army of ten thousand men rout the powerful army of Sisera. Jehovah raises up Gideon and gives him and his 300 men victory over the Midianites.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Through Jephthah, Jehovah delivers Israel from the Ammonites. Tola, Jair, Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon are also among the 12 men who judge Israel. The period of the Judges ends with Samson, who fights against the Philistines.</p>

Having the prophetess with him would reassure him and his men that they had God’s guidance and would give them confidence. Barak’s insistence that Deborah accompany him, then, was not a sign of weakness but of strong faith.</p>

Undoubtedly, however, there was some type of divine intervention.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:7:1-7:7:3" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>7:1-3;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:8:10-7:8:10" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> <strong>8:10</strong></a>​<strong>—Why did Jehovah say that Gideon’s 32,000 men were too many against the enemy force of 135,000? </strong>This was because Jehovah was giving Gideon and his men the victory. God did not want them <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>to think that they defeated the Midianites in their own strength.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:30-7:11:31" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>11:30, 31</strong></a>​<strong>—When making his vow, did Jephthah have a human sacrifice in mind? </strong>Such a thought would be far from Jephthah’s mind, for the Law stipulated: “There should not be found in you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:18:10-5:18:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>) However, Jephthah did have in mind a person and not an animal. Animals suitable for sacrifice were not likely kept in Israelite homes. And the offering of an animal would be nothing outstanding. Jephthah was aware that the one coming out of his house to meet him might well be his daughter. This one was to be offered up “as a burnt offering” in that the person would be devoted to Jehovah’s exclusive service in connection with the sanctuary.</p>

(2) When dealing with those inclined to quarrel, displaying modesty is the course of wisdom. (3) Modesty protects us from being position oriented.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">The last part of the book of Judges contains two outstanding accounts. The first concerns a man named Micah, who sets up an idol in his house and employs a Levite to act as a priest for him. After destroying the city of Laish, or Leshem, the Danites build their own city and name it Dan. Using Micah’s idol and his priest, they set up another form of worship in Dan. Evidently, Laish is captured before Joshua’s death.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:19:47-6:19:47" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Joshua 19:47</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">The second event takes place not long after the death of Joshua. A mass sex crime committed by some men of the Benjamite city of Gibeah leads to the near annihilation of the entire tribe of Benjamin​—only 600 men survive. However, an expedient arrangement allows them to get wives, and their number increases to nearly 60,000 warriors by the time of David’s rulership.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:7:6-13:7:11" data-bid="37-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 7:6-11</a>.</p>

He gave them the Law and the priesthood to educate them in his way. By means of the Urim and the Thummim, the high priest could consult God on important matters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:28:30-2:28:30" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Exodus 28:30</a>) Every city also had older men capable of providing sound counsel. When an Israelite availed himself of these provisions, he had a sound guide for his conscience. His doing “what was right in his own eyes” in this way resulted in good. On the other hand, if a person ignored the Law and made his own decisions about conduct and worship, the result was bad.</p>

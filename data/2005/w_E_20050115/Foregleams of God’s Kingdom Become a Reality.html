<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 1. What contrast do we find in the world today?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb">CRISIS after crisis​—that is a major theme of today’s world. From ecological disasters to global terrorism, mankind’s problems seem to be raging out of control. Even the world’s religions have not been able to help. In fact, they often make matters worse by inflaming the bigotry, hatred, and nationalism that divide people. Yes, as foretold, “thick gloom” has enveloped “the national groups.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:2-23:60:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 60:2</a>) At the same time, however, millions look to the future with confidence. Why? Because they pay attention to God’s prophetic word “as to a lamp shining in a dark place.” They allow God’s “word,” or message, now found in the Bible, to guide their steps.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:19-61:1:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 2. According to Daniel’s prophecy about “the time of the end,” who only are granted spiritual insight?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Concerning “the time of the end,” the prophet Daniel wrote: “Many will rove about, and the true knowledge will become abundant. Many will cleanse themselves and whiten themselves and will be refined. And the wicked ones will certainly act wickedly, and no wicked ones at all will understand; but the ones having insight will understand.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:4-27:12:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Daniel 12:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:10-27:12:10" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 10</a>) Spiritual insight is reserved only for those who sincerely “rove about” in, or diligently study, God’s Word, submit to his standards, and strive to do his will.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:11-40:13:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 13:11-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:20-62:5:20" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 3. During the 1870’s, what important truth did early Bible students discern?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>As early as the 1870’s, before “the last days” commenced, Jehovah God began to shed more light on “the sacred secrets of the kingdom of the heavens.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:11-40:13:11" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Matthew 13:11</a>) At that time a group of Bible students discerned​—contrary to popular opinion—​that Christ’s return was to be invisible. After being enthroned in heaven, Jesus would return in the sense of focusing his royal attention on the earth. A visible, <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>composite sign would alert his disciples that his invisible presence had begun.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3-14</a>.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 4. How has Jehovah strengthened the faith of his modern-day servants?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The transfiguration vision was a brilliant foregleam of Christ in Kingdom glory. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:1-40:17:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 17:1-9</a>) That vision strengthened the faith of Peter, James, and John at a time when many had left off following Jesus because he had not fulfilled their unscriptural expectations. Likewise, in this time of the end, Jehovah has strengthened the faith of his modern-day servants by shedding increased light on the fulfillment of that awesome vision and many related prophecies. Let us now consider some of these faith-strengthening spiritual realities.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 5. Who proved to be the Daystar, and when and how did he ‘rise’?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Referring to the transfiguration, the apostle Peter wrote: “Consequently we have the prophetic word made more sure; and you are doing well in paying attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until day dawns and a daystar rises, in your hearts.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:19-61:1:19" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:19</a>) That figurative Daystar, or “bright morning star,” is the glorified Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:16-66:22:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Revelation 22:16</a>) He ‘rose’ in 1914 when God’s Kingdom was born in heaven, marking the dawn of a new era. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 11:15</a>) In the transfiguration vision, Moses and Elijah appeared alongside Jesus, conversing with him. Whom do they foreshadow?</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu">6, 7. Who are represented by Moses and Elijah in the transfiguration, and what important details do the Scriptures reveal about those represented by them?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Since Moses and Elijah shared in Christ’s glory, these two faithful witnesses must represent those who rule with Jesus in his Kingdom. The understanding that Jesus has corulers is in harmony with a visionary foregleam of the enthroned Messiah that the prophet Daniel was granted. Daniel saw “someone like a son of man” receiving “an indefinitely lasting rulership” from “the Ancient of Days,” Jehovah God. But note what Daniel is shown shortly thereafter. He writes: “The kingdom and the rulership and the grandeur of the kingdoms under all the heavens were given to the people who are the holy ones of the Supreme One.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Daniel 7:13, 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:27-27:7:27" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 27</a>) Yes, more than five centuries before the transfiguration, God revealed that certain “holy ones” would share in Christ’s royal grandeur.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Who are the holy ones in Daniel’s vision? It is with reference to such individuals that the apostle Paul says: “The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God’s children. If, then, we are children, we are also heirs: heirs indeed of God, but joint heirs with Christ, provided we suffer together that we may also be glorified together.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:16-45:8:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Romans 8:16, 17</a>) The holy ones are none other than Jesus’ spirit-anointed disciples. In the Revelation, Jesus says: “To the one that conquers I will grant to sit down with me on my throne, even as I conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.” Numbering 144,000, these resurrected ‘conquerors,’ along with Jesus, will rule over the entire earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:21-66:3:21" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Revelation 3:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 5:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 14:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:3-66:14:4" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:53-46:15:53" data-bid="14-5" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:53</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 8. How have Jesus’ anointed disciples served in the capacity of Moses and Elijah, and with what results?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Why, though, are anointed Christians represented by Moses and Elijah? The reason <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>is that such Christians, while still in the flesh, do a work similar to that performed by Moses and Elijah. For example, they serve as Jehovah’s witnesses, even in the face of persecution. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:10-23:43:10" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:1-44:8:8" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Acts 8:1-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:2-66:11:12" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> Revelation 11:2-12</a>) Like Moses and Elijah, they courageously expose false religion while exhorting sincere people to give God exclusive devotion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:32:19-2:32:20" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Exodus 32:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:22-5:4:24" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 4:22-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:18-11:18:40" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 1 Kings 18:18-40</a>) Has their work borne fruit? Absolutely! Besides helping to gather the full complement of anointed ones, they have helped millions of “other sheep” to show willing submission to Jesus Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:4-66:7:4" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Revelation 7:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>No longer a mere human mounted on the colt of an ass, Jesus is now a powerful King. He is portrayed as riding on a horse​—a Biblical symbol of warfare. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:31-20:21:31" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:31</a>) “Look! a white horse,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:2-66:6:2" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Revelation 6:2</a>, “and the one seated upon it had a bow; and a crown was given him, and he went forth conquering and to complete his conquest.” Moreover, concerning Jesus, the psalmist David wrote: “The rod of your strength Jehovah will send out of Zion, saying: ‘Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:2-19:110:2" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Psalm 110:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">10. (a) How did Jesus’ ride of conquest get off to a glorious start? (b) How did Christ’s first victory affect the world in general?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Jesus’ first victory was over his most powerful foes​—Satan and the demons. Expelling them from heaven, he hurled them down to the earth. Knowing that their time is short, these wicked spirits have vented their violent anger on mankind, causing great woe. This woe is symbolized in Revelation by the ride of three more horsemen. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:3-66:6:8" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Revelation 6:3-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:7-66:12:12" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 12:7-12</a>) In line with Jesus’ prophecy concerning “the sign of [his] presence and of the conclusion of the system of things,” their ride has resulted in warfare, famine, and deadly plague.

Despite brutal opposition from Babylon the Great​—the world empire of false religion—​and from hostile governments, the preaching work not only has continued but has attained a scale unprecedented in the history of the world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:17:5-66:17:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Revelation 17:5, 6</a>) What a powerful testimony to Christ’s kingship!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Psalm 110:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Sadly, though, most people, including millions of professed Christians, fail to discern the invisible realities behind the momentous events occurring on earth. They even ridicule those who announce God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:3-61:3:4" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:3, 4</a>) Why? Because Satan has blinded their minds. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:3-47:4:4" data-bid="27-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:3, 4</a>) In fact, he began to cast the veil of spiritual darkness over professed Christians many centuries ago, even causing them to abandon the precious Kingdom hope.</p>

<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">13. To what did the veil of spiritual darkness lead?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Jesus foretold that apostates, like weeds sown among wheat, would infiltrate the Christian congregation and lead many astray.

But what induced professed Christians to adopt these unchristian celebrations? Says <em>The New Encyclopædia Britannica </em>(1974): “Christmas, the festival of the birth of Jesus Christ, was established in connection with a fading of the expectation of Christ’s imminent return.”</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">14. How did the teachings of Origen and Augustine misrepresent Kingdom truth?</p>

Not on the Scriptures, but on “the framework of a philosophy and world view quite different from the thought world of Jesus and the earliest church.” In his work <em>De Civitate Dei </em>(The City of God), Augustine of Hippo (354-430 C.E.) stated that the church itself is the Kingdom of God. Such unscriptural thinking gave the churches of Christendom theological grounds to embrace political power.

According to the journal <em>Christianity Today, </em>“now the great cathedrals of Europe [serve] not as houses of worship but as museums, empty of all but tourists.” The same trend can be observed in other parts of the world.

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[57]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Some now associated with Jehovah’s people have allowed their spiritual vision to grow dim. Could it be that they lack patience or endurance, as did some of Jesus’ early disciples? Have anxieties of life, materialism, or persecution affected them? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:3-40:13:8" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Matthew 13:3-8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:18-40:13:23" data-bid="43-2" class="b"> 18-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:34-42:21:36" data-bid="43-3" class="b"> Luke 21:34-36</a>) Perhaps some have found certain information published by “the faithful and discreet slave” hard to grasp. If any of this has happened to you, we urge you to study God’s Word with renewed zeal and to supplicate Jehovah so that you may regain a strong, close relationship with him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:11-61:3:15" data-bid="44-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:11-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">22. How has consideration of the transfiguration vision and related prophecies affected you?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>The transfiguration vision was given to Jesus’ disciples when they needed encouragement. Today, we have something far greater to strengthen us​—the fulfillment of that spectacular foregleam and many related prophecies. As we contemplate these glorious realities and their future significance, may we too express with all our heart the sentiments of the apostle John when he said: “Amen! Come, Lord Jesus.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:20-66:22:20" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Revelation 22:20</a>.</p>

<div id="fn1" class="fcc"><p id="p31" data-pid="31">In the original Greek, the word rendered “pangs of distress” literally means “pangs of birth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:8-40:24:8" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Matthew 24:8</a>, <em>Kingdom Interlinear</em>) This suggests that like birth pangs, the world’s problems will increase in frequency, intensity, and duration, climaxing in the great tribulation.</p></div>

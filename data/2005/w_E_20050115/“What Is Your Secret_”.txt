“What Is Your Secret?”
THIS question from an elderly stranger at a fast-food restaurant took Muriel, a mother of three, by surprise. Muriel had been busy with doctors’ appointments for her children, and she was running behind schedule. There was not enough time for them to go home and eat supper before attending their Christian meeting. So she took the children to a nearby restaurant so that they could have something to eat.
As they were finishing their meal, a man approached Muriel and said: “I have been observing you ever since you came in here. And I have noticed a big difference between your children and those I normally encounter. You should see the way children treat the tables and chairs. Their feet go on the table. The chairs are bounced around. But your children are so quiet and well behaved. What is your secret?”
Muriel replied: “My husband and I regularly study the Bible with our children, and we try to apply in our lives what we learn. We are Jehovah’s Witnesses.” At this, the man said: “I am Jewish and a Holocaust survivor. I remember seeing Jehovah’s Witnesses being persecuted in Germany. Even then they stood out as being different. The behavior of your children has really impressed me. I must look into your religion.”
The Bible is an excellent guidebook in bringing up children. Jehovah’s Witnesses are very much interested in helping others benefit from the guidance found in the Scriptures. You have our warm invitation to respond to the following offer.

Video Programs on DVD
The DVD entitled Transfusion Alternatives​—Documentary Series contains three video programs. Transfusion-Alternative Strategies​—Simple, Safe, Effective was designed for doctors and medical students and thus includes more medical scenes than the other two programs. Transfusion-Alternative Health Care​—Meeting Patient Needs and Rights was designed especially for medical journalists, health officials, social workers, and the judiciary. It considers how to care for patients’ medical needs while also recognizing their legal rights. No Blood​—Medicine Meets the Challenge was designed primarily for the general public. The DVD contains the English videos with additional sound tracks in French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, and Spanish. Please feel free to share these programs with your doctor, Bible students, non-Witness mate, relatives, teachers, workmates, and schoolmates.

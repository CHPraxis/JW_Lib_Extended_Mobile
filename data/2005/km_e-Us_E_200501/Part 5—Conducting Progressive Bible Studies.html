<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Determining How Much Material to Cover</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>When teaching, Jesus took into consideration his disciples’ limitations, speaking to them “as far as they were able to listen.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:4:33-41:4:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 4:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:12-43:16:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> John 16:12</a>) In a similar way, teachers of God’s Word today need to gauge the pace at which they cover material on a Bible study. The amount of material that can be considered will depend on the ability and the circumstances of both the teacher and the student.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Build Solid Faith: </strong>Some students may require two or three sessions to grasp what other students can easily take in during one session. We do not want to sacrifice the student’s having a clear understanding for the sake of speed. Every student needs a solid basis for his newfound faith in God’s Word.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:7-20:4:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Prov. 4:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Rom. 12:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>As you conduct the study week by week, spend whatever time is necessary to help the student understand and accept what he is learning from God’s Word. Avoid a hurried pace that detracts from the richness of the truths being taught. Allow sufficient time to focus on the main points and to consider key scriptures that provide the basis for the teachings.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Keep the Study Moving: </strong>While we want to avoid rushing through the study, we also want to avoid becoming sidetracked. If a student is inclined to speak at length about personal matters, we may need to arrange to discuss these after the study.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>On the other hand, our own enthusiasm for the truth can make it a challenge not to talk excessively during the study. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:6-19:145:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 145:6, 7</a>) An occasional side point or experience can enrich a study, but we would not want these to become so numerous or lengthy that they hinder the student from acquiring an accurate knowledge of basic Bible teachings.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>By covering a reasonable amount of material at each study session, we help Bible students to “walk in the light of Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:5-23:2:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 2:5</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Pursuing a life of godly devotion requires strenuous effort. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:7-54:4:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:7-10</a>) In our own strength, we would soon grow weary and stumble in trying to follow such a course. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:29-23:40:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 40:29-31</a>) One way we can draw strength from Jehovah is by being “nourished with the words of the faith.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:6-54:4:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Rich Spiritual Food: </strong>Through his Word and through “the faithful and discreet slave,” Jehovah provides rich spiritual food. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45</a>) Are we doing our part to benefit from it? Do we read the Bible each day? Do we have set times for personal study and meditation? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:2-19:1:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 1:2, 3</a>) Such a healthy spiritual diet invigorates us and protects us from the weakening effects of Satan’s world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) If we fill our mind with wholesome things and apply them in our lives, Jehovah will be with us.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:8-50:4:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Phil. 4:8, 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Jehovah also strengthens us by means of congregation meetings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25</a>) The spiritual instruction and wholesome association found at these gatherings fortify us to stand firm in the face of trials. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:9-60:5:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:9, 10</a>) One Christian youth said: “I go to school all day long, and it tears me down. But the meetings are like an oasis in the desert, where I am refreshed to make it through the next school day.” How we are blessed for the effort we put forth to attend meetings!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Proclaiming the Truth: </strong>Preaching to others was like food to Jesus. It energized him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:32-43:4:34" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 4:32-34</a>) Likewise, when we talk to others about the marvelous promises of God, we feel rejuvenated. Being busy in the ministry also keeps our heart and mind focused on the Kingdom and the blessings soon to come. That truly refreshes us.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:28-40:11:30" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 11:28-30</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>How privileged we are to benefit from the rich spiritual nourishment that Jehovah is providing for his people today! May we continue crying out joyfully to his praise.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:13-23:65:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 65:13, 14</a>.</p>

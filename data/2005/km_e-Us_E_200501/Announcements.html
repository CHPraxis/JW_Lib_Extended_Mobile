<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>January: </strong>Any book published prior to 1990 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus of older publications on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have older books may offer <em>Worship the Only True God. </em><strong>February: </strong><em>Draw Close to Jehovah. </em>If this publication is not available, you may use the <em>Creation </em>book (large or small size) or the <em>Revelation Climax </em>book as an alternative offer. <strong>March: </strong><em>Keep on the Watch! </em>Where genuine interest is shown, offer the <em>Knowledge </em>book, making a special effort to start Bible studies. <strong>April: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on placing the <em>Worship God </em>book. The objective should be to start a home Bible study, especially with individuals who have already studied the <em>Knowledge </em>book and the <em>Require </em>brochure.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Starting in February, and no later than March 6, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Act Wisely in a Senseless World.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Congregations should make appropriate arrangements to observe the Memorial this year on Thursday, March 24, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the emblems <em>should not begin until after sundown. </em>Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. It is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial observance. However, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we would suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from the occasion. Consideration should also be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ A Service Meeting discussion of the video <em>David​—He Trusted in God </em>will be outlined in the March issue of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry. </em>This video is available only on the DVD entitled <em>Noah Walked With God​—David Trusted in God. </em>You can choose from eight languages on this disc​—English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, and Spanish. Copies of the DVD may be requested through the congregation with the next literature request.</p>

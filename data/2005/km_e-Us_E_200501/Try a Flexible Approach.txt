Try a Flexible Approach
Sincere interest in people will move us to try to discern their needs and show them how the Kingdom will provide the complete solution to the problems they face. (Phil. 2:4) A flexible approach that many publishers find effective is to invite the householder to comment on illustrations of Paradise scenes in our publications, such as those listed in the right-hand column of this page. You might do this using one of the following introductions:
▪ “Do you think we will ever see the human family enjoying the kind of conditions pictured here?”
▪ “All of us would like our children to be able to enjoy the kind of world pictured here. What do you think it would take to bring this about?”
▪ “This is an illustration of what the earth will look like when God’s will takes place on earth as it is in heaven. Do you notice anything that is different from life today?”
▪ “Would you like to live under the conditions pictured here? [Allow for response.] Do you think this will happen in our lifetime?”
Listen carefully to the person’s response, and kindly draw him out with an additional question or two. If some respond that they would not want to live under the conditions pictured or that they do not believe that such a thing is possible, do not quickly conclude that they have no interest. Tactfully inquire why they feel the way they do. Their comments may reveal a deep concern over the seemingly unsolvable problems facing mankind.​—Ezek. 9:4.
As you discern the householder’s concerns, adapt your presentation accordingly. Highlight the aspect of the Kingdom message that most directly addresses his needs. Share one or two scriptures that touch on the matter that concerns him. (See suggestions in the right-hand column.) Let him see for himself what God’s Word says. If he shows interest, offer the publication and arrange to call again. Continue to build on your initial conversation.

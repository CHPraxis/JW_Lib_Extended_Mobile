<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN 1999, Jehovah’s Witnesses produced a video especially for youths entitled <em>Young People Ask<wbr />—How Can I Make Real Friends? </em>To date, it has been released in more than 30 languages. “This video has had an impact on all of us!” a congregation overseer in the Ukraine writes. “Some watched it five times, still others watched it as many as seven! Later, many young ones enjoyed discussing the highlights. A number of them were in tears. We all felt Jehovah’s love and sincere care for young people. Now I appreciate the needs of young people more, and I want to help them more, to be a closer friend to them.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Youths from all over the world were moved by this video. For example, 17-year-old Leticia from Uruguay (pictured left) writes: “I was overcome with emotion, not only because of the information presented but also because of seeing how Jehovah and his organization take an interest in us young ones. I cannot find words to express my gratitude for this valuable video. Simply put, thank you very much!”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">An adult Witness in the United States watched the video many times and was able to use it to help a young girl who was living a double life. She writes: “Annette was involved in drinking and bad associations, and she had even experimented with drugs.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> But the video had a strong impact on her. In a short time, she abandoned her bad associates and wrong practices. Six months later she was baptized. Really, this video saves lives!”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sd">▪ In 2004, Jehovah’s Witnesses released another video for youths. It is entitled <em>Young People Ask<wbr />—What Will I Do With My Life? </em>It is hoped that by means of this video on DVD, many young people will be encouraged to put the worship of Jehovah God first in their lives.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33</a>.</p>

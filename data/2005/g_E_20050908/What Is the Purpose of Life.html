<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Philosophers, theologians, and laymen have struggled for millenniums with the above question. Their efforts have been in vain. Many, therefore, have concluded that the question cannot be answered. Yet, there is an answer. Though profound, it is not complicated.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The answer is found in the Bible. A key to enjoying a happy, meaningful life is to learn why God has permitted so much suffering and injustice and then develop a proper relationship with him. But how can this be done? The 32-page brochure <em>What Is the Purpose of Life? How Can You Find It? </em>has assisted many to do this very thing.</p>

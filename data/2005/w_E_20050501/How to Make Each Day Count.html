<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“SHOW us just how to count our days in such a way that we may bring a heart of wisdom in.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:90:12-19:90:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 90:12</a>) This was the humble prayer of the Bible writer Moses. What specifically was he asking for? Should we make a similar worshipful request?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In verse 10, Moses lamented the shortness of the human life span. On another occasion, he recorded the testimony of Job, who said: “Man, born of woman, is short-lived and glutted with agitation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:14:1-18:14:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 14:1</a>) It is evident that Moses was painfully aware of the transitory nature of imperfect human life. Therefore, he viewed each day of life as a precious resource. In directing this plea to God, Moses expressed his desire to live his remaining days wisely, in a way that would please his Creator. Should not we too seek to spend our days meaningfully? That will be our endeavor if we want God’s approval now.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There was an additional factor that motivated both Moses and Job, a factor that should also motivate us. Both of these godly men looked forward to a future reward<wbr />—life on earth under better conditions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:14:14-18:14:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 14:14, 15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:11:26-58:11:26" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Hebrews 11:26</a>) At that time, no one’s good works will be cut short by death. Our Creator purposes that faithful ones will live forever on a paradise earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:65:21-23:65:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:21-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Revelation 21:3, 4</a>) This can be <em>your </em>prospect too if you ‘count your days in such a way that you may bring a heart of wisdom in.’</p>

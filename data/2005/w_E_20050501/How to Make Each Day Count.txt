How to Make Each Day Count
“SHOW us just how to count our days in such a way that we may bring a heart of wisdom in.” (Psalm 90:12) This was the humble prayer of the Bible writer Moses. What specifically was he asking for? Should we make a similar worshipful request?
In verse 10, Moses lamented the shortness of the human life span. On another occasion, he recorded the testimony of Job, who said: “Man, born of woman, is short-lived and glutted with agitation.” (Job 14:1) It is evident that Moses was painfully aware of the transitory nature of imperfect human life. Therefore, he viewed each day of life as a precious resource. In directing this plea to God, Moses expressed his desire to live his remaining days wisely, in a way that would please his Creator. Should not we too seek to spend our days meaningfully? That will be our endeavor if we want God’s approval now.
There was an additional factor that motivated both Moses and Job, a factor that should also motivate us. Both of these godly men looked forward to a future reward—life on earth under better conditions. (Job 14:14, 15; Hebrews 11:26) At that time, no one’s good works will be cut short by death. Our Creator purposes that faithful ones will live forever on a paradise earth. (Isaiah 65:21-24; Revelation 21:3, 4) This can be your prospect too if you ‘count your days in such a way that you may bring a heart of wisdom in.’

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ The 32-page, full-color brochure <em>When Someone You Love Dies </em>provides such comfort. It can help those who are grieving to understand and deal with the feelings and emotions that surface following the death of a loved one. And a section of the brochure discusses how others can help ones who are grieving.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The brochure answers such questions as: How can I live with my grief? What hope is there for those who have died? It presents the Bible’s explanation of death and the condition of the dead. And even more important, it highlights God’s promise, through Jesus Christ, of a resurrection to life on a cleansed, paradise earth.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">By <em>Awake! </em>writer in Mexico</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">WHEN Daniel, a 17-year-old youth, began the new school year, he was determined to make himself known to his new classmates as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. An opportunity arose when his English teacher asked the class to interview a foreigner whose native tongue is English. The idea was to go to places frequented by tourists in Mexico City, conduct an interview, and take a recording of it to class.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Daniel decided to interview an English-speaking missionary who worked at the headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Mexico and, at the same time, make a video in English giving a short tour of the facilities. Additionally, he prepared an exhibit of various brochures in indigenous languages published in Mexico as well as of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>in various other languages. Then Daniel asked his English teacher for permission to make a presentation of the video and the exhibit to the class.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">His classmates and the teacher were astonished at the work being done by Jehovah’s Witnesses in Mexico. Daniel’s listeners were particularly impressed by the Witnesses’ efforts to reach the indigenous peoples of Mexico.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">After the 25-minute presentation, for which he received the highest marks, Daniel offered copies of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>to all, as well as the book <em>Questions Young People Ask<wbr />—Answers That Work. </em>Many accepted the literature, and this has opened the way for further Bible discussions. Says Daniel: “I thank Jehovah that I was able to bring honor to his name through a simple school assignment.”</p>

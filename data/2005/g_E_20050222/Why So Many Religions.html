<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A woman wrote to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Guatemala and described her discussion with a Witness during a bus trip. “We talked about why there are so many religions,” the woman explained. She said the Witness then pulled out a copy of the brochure <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>and turned to the topic “How Can You Find the True Religion?” “The subject surprised me,” the woman wrote. “It wasn’t until then that I realized there must be only one group of true worshipers.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When she had the opportunity to read the brochure, she was deeply moved. So she explained: “I am writing to see if you can help me receive a Bible course using this brochure because I am sure that what it contains is the truth.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The 32-page brochure <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>is the same size as this magazine. In addition to the topic mentioned above, the brochure answers such questions as:</p>

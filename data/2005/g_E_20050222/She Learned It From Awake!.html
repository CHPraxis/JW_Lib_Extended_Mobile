<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">PERLA, an eight-year-old girl, is in the second grade in the Mexican state of Veracruz. One day her teacher asked if anyone knew how long a whale is. At first no one answered. Then Perla raised her hand and said, “The gray whale can be 45 feet <strong>[14 m] </strong>long and weigh 16 tons.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Surprised, the teacher asked, “Where did you learn that?”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“From <em>Awake! </em>magazine,” she replied. “If you allow me, I can show it to you.” Customarily Perla carries recent issues of <em>Awake! </em>in her schoolbag to share with others. By coincidence she had the September 8, 2003, issue containing the article “An Intriguing Encounter with Gray Whales.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Perla’s teacher was pleased to receive a copy of the magazine. Not only did she read it but she wanted to keep it. Other students also wanted a copy, so Perla obtained copies for nine of them. Perla has received much praise from her teacher, to whom she takes a copy of <em>Awake! </em>every two weeks.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Shortly after this experience, Perla attended a district convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Before Perla left, her teacher said that she would be pleased to receive a gift from the convention. So Perla took her a copy of the book <em>Learn From the Great Teacher, </em>which was released that summer.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Later the teacher told some of her students, “Perla sets a good example, as she not only takes an interest in her schoolbooks but also studies other beneficial information and even shares it with us.”</p>

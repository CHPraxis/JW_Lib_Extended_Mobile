She Learned It From Awake!
PERLA, an eight-year-old girl, is in the second grade in the Mexican state of Veracruz. One day her teacher asked if anyone knew how long a whale is. At first no one answered. Then Perla raised her hand and said, “The gray whale can be 45 feet [14 m] long and weigh 16 tons.”
Surprised, the teacher asked, “Where did you learn that?”
“From Awake! magazine,” she replied. “If you allow me, I can show it to you.” Customarily Perla carries recent issues of Awake! in her schoolbag to share with others. By coincidence she had the September 8, 2003, issue containing the article “An Intriguing Encounter with Gray Whales.”
Perla’s teacher was pleased to receive a copy of the magazine. Not only did she read it but she wanted to keep it. Other students also wanted a copy, so Perla obtained copies for nine of them. Perla has received much praise from her teacher, to whom she takes a copy of Awake! every two weeks.
Shortly after this experience, Perla attended a district convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Before Perla left, her teacher said that she would be pleased to receive a gift from the convention. So Perla took her a copy of the book Learn From the Great Teacher, which was released that summer.
Later the teacher told some of her students, “Perla sets a good example, as she not only takes an interest in her schoolbooks but also studies other beneficial information and even shares it with us.”

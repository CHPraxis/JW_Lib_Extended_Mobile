Why So Many Religions?
A woman wrote to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Guatemala and described her discussion with a Witness during a bus trip. “We talked about why there are so many religions,” the woman explained. She said the Witness then pulled out a copy of the brochure What Does God Require of Us? and turned to the topic “How Can You Find the True Religion?” “The subject surprised me,” the woman wrote. “It wasn’t until then that I realized there must be only one group of true worshipers.”
When she had the opportunity to read the brochure, she was deeply moved. So she explained: “I am writing to see if you can help me receive a Bible course using this brochure because I am sure that what it contains is the truth.”
The 32-page brochure What Does God Require of Us? is the same size as this magazine. In addition to the topic mentioned above, the brochure answers such questions as:
▪ Who is God?
▪ What is God’s purpose for our earth?
▪ What is God’s Kingdom?
▪ How can you have a happy family life?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“I AM the light of the world. He that follows me will by no means walk in darkness, but will possess the light of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:12-43:8:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:12</a>) These words were spoken by Jesus Christ. A learned man of the first century wrote about him: “Carefully concealed in him are all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:3-51:2:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 2:3</a>) Moreover, the Bible says: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) Accurate knowledge about Jesus is essential in order to satisfy our spiritual need.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">People around the earth have heard of Jesus Christ. His influence on the history of mankind is beyond question. In fact, the calendar used in most parts of the world is based on the year he is thought to have been born. “Many people refer to dates before that year as B.C., or <em>before Christ,” </em>explains <em>The World Book Encyclopedia. </em>“They use A.D., or <em>anno Domini </em>(in the year of our Lord), for dates after that year.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Yet, there are conflicting ideas about who Jesus was. To some, he was no more than an outstanding man who left his mark on history. Others, though, worship him as God Almighty. Some Hindu thinkers have likened Jesus Christ to the Hindu god Krishna, said by many to be a god incarnate. Was Jesus merely a man, or was he someone to be worshipped? Exactly who was he? Where did he come from? What was he like? And where is he now? As we will see in the following article, the book that has a great deal to say about Jesus gives truthful answers to these questions.</p>

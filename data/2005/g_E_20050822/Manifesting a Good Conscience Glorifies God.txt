Manifesting a Good Conscience Glorifies God
BY AWAKE! WRITER IN UKRAINE
ON THE way home after a Christian meeting, the Chibisov family, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Ukraine, found a purse with valuables inside, including a driver’s license, credit cards, and about $500 in local currency. In this family of five, only the husband had a job. He made about $70 a month. So this money could have been a tremendous help to them. What did they do?
The mother relates: “Our girls immediately began discussing how to return the purse to its owner, who, according to the driver’s license, was a woman. My husband and I were pleased to see how our children manifested their well-trained consciences. The next day I called the woman who had lost the purse. Crying with joy, Olha came and told us that she and her husband own a few small shops in our town. The money in the purse was the monthly salary for their employees. Additionally, one of the financial documents was very important for her business accounts.
“Olha asked us where we found the purse. We told her where and also explained that we were there because we were returning from our Christian meeting. When we offered her some Bible literature, she accepted it respectfully.
“A few weeks later, a fellow Witness in our congregation told us that while she was offering Bible literature to passersby on the street, a woman explained that previously she would never have listened to Jehovah’s Witnesses. Now, though, she was ready not only to listen but also to take literature. This is because, she said, Witnesses had returned a purse to her daughter.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪Many reason that if there is a God, he would not permit humans to suffer so much. A common question some ask is, “Where was God when we needed him?” Throughout history millions have suffered terrible misery, even death by torture.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At the same time, the miraculous order and design of living things give clear evidence of a caring Creator. Why would a God who cares about us permit such terrible suffering? If we are to worship God properly, we must have a satisfying answer to that important question. Where can we find it?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We invite you to obtain a copy of the brochure <em>Does God Really Care About Us? </em>We feel that a careful examination of the sections “Why God Has Permitted Suffering” and “What Has Been the Result of Rebellion?” will provide you with satisfying answers.</p>

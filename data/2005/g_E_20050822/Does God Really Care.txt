Does God Really Care?
▪Many reason that if there is a God, he would not permit humans to suffer so much. A common question some ask is, “Where was God when we needed him?” Throughout history millions have suffered terrible misery, even death by torture.
At the same time, the miraculous order and design of living things give clear evidence of a caring Creator. Why would a God who cares about us permit such terrible suffering? If we are to worship God properly, we must have a satisfying answer to that important question. Where can we find it?
We invite you to obtain a copy of the brochure Does God Really Care About Us? We feel that a careful examination of the sections “Why God Has Permitted Suffering” and “What Has Been the Result of Rebellion?” will provide you with satisfying answers.
To request a copy, simply fill in this coupon and mail it to the address provided or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

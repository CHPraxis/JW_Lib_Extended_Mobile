Precious Memories Awakened
After receiving the book Learn From the Great Teacher, a woman decided to take a copy to her elderly sister. The sister, now in her mid-80’s, suffers from Alzheimer’s disease. For 70 years, however, she had been an avid Bible student and a Bible teacher. But she remembers little of current happenings and rarely initiates any conversation.
“The first day,” the younger sister recalled, “I explained that the book had been designed to help parents instill Bible principles and teachings in their children and that I wished to read it to her. There was no response. However, when I began reading, she became very animated and answered every question posed in the reading. There were times while I was quoting a scripture that she finished it from memory—but according to the King James Version, which she remembered from youth. Occasionally, she grabbed my arm while I was relating a Bible account and said, ‘Oh, I remember that!’
“Toward the end of our visit—after I had read more than half the book to her—she expressed the desire to keep hearing more. Her husband, who cares for her every need, continued to read the rest of the book to her. This experience with my sister helped me to realize the value of reading such publications to elderly and infirm ones.”
This beautifully illustrated 256-page book, the same page size as this magazine, is being enjoyed by young and old alike. Although lessons based on teachings of Jesus Christ are told in simple language, the subject material is for all age groups.

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. As an alternative offer, you may use My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, or You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. January: Any book published prior to 1991 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus of older publications on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have older books may offer Worship the Only True God. February: Draw Close to Jehovah. If this publication is not available, you may use the Revelation Climax book as an alternative offer. March: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a special effort to start Bible studies.
▪ As a reminder, all congregations should notify the branch office of their meeting times as they will be on January 1. If this has not been done, the congregation secretary should immediately submit a Congregation Meeting Information (S-5) form.
▪ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed on the following dates: March 11, 2006 (Gilead graduation); May 12-13, 2006 (spring cleaning); September 9, 2006 (Gilead graduation); and October 7, 2006 (annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania). There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on those dates.
▪ The Memorial invitations for 2006 in the primary language of each congregation will soon be sent. If other languages are spoken in your territory and you would like a supply of invitations in those languages, these should be requested as soon as possible on a Literature Request Form (S-14). A listing of the languages in which Memorial invitations are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed each month. Please request only those languages needed for your territory.
▪ Please note that the Memorial for the year 2007 will be on Monday, April 2, after sundown. This advance notice is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and other facilities must be found. In such instances, the elders should have an agreement with the management ensuring that there will be no disturbances from other activities in the building so that the Memorial observance can proceed in a peaceful and orderly manner.
▪ Because of the importance of the Memorial, the body of elders should select one of the more qualified elders to be the speaker instead of simply taking turns or using the same brother every year. If there is an elder of the anointed who is well qualified to give the talk, he should be selected.

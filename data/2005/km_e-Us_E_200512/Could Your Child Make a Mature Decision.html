<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="qu"> 1. What stand have Witness youths taken regarding the use of blood? Give an example.</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[8]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>A mature decision about what? Blood transfusions. As shown in the article entitled “Walk as Instructed by Jehovah” in the June 15, 1991, issue of <em>The Watchtower, </em>children of Jehovah’s Witnesses have had to take a mature stand to prove that their desire to obey God’s law on blood is as important to them as it is to their parents. Could that also be required of your minor child?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 2. What legal standard did one court apply to a minor who refused blood transfusions, and what do Christian parents and their minor children learn from this?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>What Does the Law Say? </strong>In the United States, the highest court that has ruled on a mature minor’s right to refuse blood transfusions is the Illinois Supreme Court. In reviewing the case of a 17-year-old sister, the court decreed: “If the evidence is clear and convincing that the minor is mature enough to appreciate the consequences of her actions [and] to exercise the judgment of an adult, then the mature minor doctrine affords her the common law right to consent to or refuse medical treatment.” Thus, in assessing whether a child is mature enough to make his own decision, doctors or officials may interview the patient to hear him express his personal objection to taking blood. The youth would need to understand reasonably the gravity of his medical condition and the consequences of his options for treatment and clearly and firmly express his own religious belief about God’s law on blood.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>What Would Your Child Say? </strong>Are your children able to express themselves on this issue? Do they believe with all their heart that it is a divine command to ‘abstain from blood’?

Would they courageously defend their firm decision about blood if doctors believed that their life was in jeopardy, even if their parents were not present? Since “time and unforeseen occurrence befall [us] all,” how can you prepare your children for any unexpected challenge to their integrity?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eccl. 9:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Eph. 6:4</a>.</p>

Has your family watched and discussed these presentations recently?</p>

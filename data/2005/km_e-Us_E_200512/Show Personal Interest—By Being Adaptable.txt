Show Personal Interest​—By Being Adaptable
1 The apostle Paul set a fine example in always adapting his presentation of the good news to the background and thinking of his audience. (1 Cor. 9:19-23) We should endeavor to do the same. With a little forethought, we can often tailor the sample presentations that appear in Our Kingdom Ministry to fit the needs of the people in our territory. As we approach a door, we may notice indications of the householder’s interests and incorporate these into our presentation. However, there is yet another way that we can be adaptable in our ministry.
2 Build on What Others Say: When presenting the good news, we frequently pose a question and invite householders to respond. How do you view the response? Are you inclined to offer a token acknowledgment and just continue with your prepared presentation? Or does what you say reflect that you are taking into consideration the householders’ comments? If you show a sincere interest in what others say, you may be able to use additional tactful questions to find out what is really on their mind. (Prov. 20:5) Thus you can focus on aspects of the Kingdom message that most directly address the listener’s concerns.
3 This requires that we be willing to talk about subjects other than those we had originally planned to discuss. If we begin by commenting on a problem that is in the news and the householder mentions a local or personal issue that concerns him, our genuine interest in meeting the needs of the householder will move us to center the Bible discussion on what matters most to him.​—Phil. 2:4.
4 Tailoring Our Approach: When the householder raises a question, we might find it beneficial to continue the discussion at a later time after we have been able to look up additional information on the subject. We can also offer publications that provide a more thorough consideration of the topic. All of this reflects our sincere interest in helping others come to know Jehovah.​—2 Cor. 2:17.

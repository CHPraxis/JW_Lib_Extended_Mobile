<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE headmaster of Tigoni Academy for Girls in Limuru, Kenya, wrote the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in that country requesting copies of the book <em>Questions Young People Ask<wbr />—Answers That Work. </em>He said: “As you know, dealing with teenagers can be challenging. We have two copies of your book, which have been helpful to both teachers and students. It has enough information and fits our needs and those of our teenagers.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The headmaster then said: “The [school] administration would like to use this helpful book to instruct our girls. They like the book very much. Our parents are very positive regarding all efforts to help their children. For now, we think 25 copies of the book will be sufficient.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The <em>Young People Ask </em>book probes into thoughts and feelings of youth. It stirs healthy discussion on such subjects as: “How Can I Get My Folks to Give Me More Freedom?,” “Should I Leave Home?,” “How Can I Make Real Friends?,” “What Career Should I Choose?,” “What About Sex Before Marriage?,” and “How Do I Know If It’s Real Love?”</p>

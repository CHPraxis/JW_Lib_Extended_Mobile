<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“OUR ability to communicate with loved ones is decreasing dramatically,” reports the Polish weekly <em>Polityka. </em>In the United States, it is estimated that marriage mates spend only six minutes a day conversing with each other in a meaningful way. Some authorities think that half of all separations and divorces are the result of this decline.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">How about conversation between parents and children? In most instances, “it turns out to be, not a conversation, but an interrogation: How was school? How about your friends?” observes the above report. “How are our children to learn to develop emotional relationships?” it asks.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Since good communication skills do not just happen, how can we improve our ability to converse? The Christian disciple James gave us important advice: “Every man must be swift about hearing, slow about speaking, slow about wrath.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:19-59:1:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">James 1:19</a>) Yes, to have an upbuilding conversation, we need to listen attentively and not interrupt impatiently or jump to conclusions. Avoid criticism because it can easily smother a conversation. Moreover, Jesus used tactful questions, not to interrogate, but to draw out what was in the heart of his listener and to strengthen the bond between them.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:20:5-20:20:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 20:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:16:13-40:16:17" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Matthew 16:13-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:17:24-40:17:27" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 17:24-27</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Applying the fine principles found in the Bible, take the initiative to converse and communicate with those dear to you. That may result in a warm relationship that will be cherished for many years<wbr />—even a lifetime.</p>

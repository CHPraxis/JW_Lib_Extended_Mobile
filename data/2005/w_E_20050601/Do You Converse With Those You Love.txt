Do You Converse With Those You Love?
“OUR ability to communicate with loved ones is decreasing dramatically,” reports the Polish weekly Polityka. In the United States, it is estimated that marriage mates spend only six minutes a day conversing with each other in a meaningful way. Some authorities think that half of all separations and divorces are the result of this decline.
How about conversation between parents and children? In most instances, “it turns out to be, not a conversation, but an interrogation: How was school? How about your friends?” observes the above report. “How are our children to learn to develop emotional relationships?” it asks.
Since good communication skills do not just happen, how can we improve our ability to converse? The Christian disciple James gave us important advice: “Every man must be swift about hearing, slow about speaking, slow about wrath.” (James 1:19) Yes, to have an upbuilding conversation, we need to listen attentively and not interrupt impatiently or jump to conclusions. Avoid criticism because it can easily smother a conversation. Moreover, Jesus used tactful questions, not to interrogate, but to draw out what was in the heart of his listener and to strengthen the bond between them.—Proverbs 20:5; Matthew 16:13-17; 17:24-27.
Applying the fine principles found in the Bible, take the initiative to converse and communicate with those dear to you. That may result in a warm relationship that will be cherished for many years—even a lifetime.

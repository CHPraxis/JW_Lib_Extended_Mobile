Her Classmates Changed Their Opinion
▪ Victoria (shown above), an 11-year-old girl in Ukraine, was asked to prepare a report about her favorite book in such a way that all in the class would want to read it. She says: “I decided to introduce my classmates to the book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work. In my presentation I explained the content of the book and the principles on which it was based. At the end I mentioned that the book was available right after class.”
What was the reaction of her classmates? “I placed 20 books that day,” says Victoria. “My classmates had thought that Jehovah’s Witnesses were a sect, but they changed their opinion, and now I have two regular readers of our magazines!”
The Young People Ask book probes into thoughts and feelings of young ones, stirring wholesome discussions. It addresses such questions of youths as: “How Can I Get My Folks to Give Me More Freedom?,” “How Can I Make Real Friends?,” and “What About Sex Before Marriage?” In its 39 chapters, many other subjects are also addressed.

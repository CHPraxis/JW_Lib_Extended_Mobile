<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Victoria (shown above), an 11-year-old girl in Ukraine, was asked to prepare a report about her favorite book in such a way that all in the class would want to read it. She says: “I decided to introduce my classmates to the book <em>Questions Young People Ask<wbr />—Answers That Work. </em>In my presentation I explained the content of the book and the principles on which it was based. At the end I mentioned that the book was available right after class.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What was the reaction of her classmates? “I placed 20 books that day,” says Victoria. “My classmates had thought that Jehovah’s Witnesses were a sect, but they changed their opinion, and now I have two regular readers of our magazines!”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The <em>Young People Ask </em>book probes into thoughts and feelings of young ones, stirring wholesome discussions. It addresses such questions of youths as: “How Can I Get My Folks to Give Me More Freedom?,” “How Can I Make Real Friends?,” and “What About Sex Before Marriage?” In its 39 chapters, many other subjects are also addressed.</p>

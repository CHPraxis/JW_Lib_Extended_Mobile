Preaching Helps Us to Endure
1 God’s Word exhorts us to “run with endurance the race that is set before us.” (Heb. 12:1) Just as a runner needs endurance to compete successfully, so we need endurance to attain the prize of everlasting life. (Heb. 10:36) How can the Christian ministry help us to endure faithfully to the end?​—Matt. 24:13.
2 Fortified Spiritually: Our proclaiming the Bible’s marvelous promise of a righteous new world helps keep our own hope bright. (1 Thess. 5:8) When we participate regularly in the field ministry, we have the opportunity to make known the truths that we have learned from the Bible. We have the opportunity to defend our faith, which in turn helps to fortify us spiritually.
3 In order to teach others effectively, we must clearly understand Bible truths ourselves. We have to do research and meditate on the material. The earnest effort that we put forth deepens our knowledge, strengthens our faith, and refreshes us spiritually. (Prov. 2:3-5) Thus, as we seek to help others, we strengthen ourselves.​—1 Tim. 4:15, 16.
4 Zealous participation in the ministry is a vital part of “the complete suit of armor from God,” which we need in order to stand firm against the Devil and the demons. (Eph. 6:10-13, 15) Our being busy in sacred service helps us to keep our mind focused on upbuilding things and to avoid becoming corrupted by Satan’s world. (Col. 3:2) As we teach others Jehovah’s ways, we are continually reminded of our own need to maintain holy conduct.​—1 Pet. 2:12.
5 Empowered by God: Finally, our sharing in the evangelizing work teaches us to rely on Jehovah. (2 Cor. 4:1, 7) What a blessing that is! Our developing such trust equips us not only to accomplish our ministry but also to cope with whatever circumstances we may face in life. (Phil. 4:11-13) Indeed, learning to rely fully on Jehovah is the key to endurance. (Ps. 55:22) In many ways, preaching helps us to endure.

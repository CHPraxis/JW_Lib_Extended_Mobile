<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“DEPRESSION is the most frequently reported, and arguably the most important mental health problem for young people,” claims Beyondblue, a government-funded agency in Australia. Studies reveal that about 100,000 young Australians suffer from depression each year.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Young Christians are not immune to depression. Faith in Jehovah, however, has helped many of them to overcome negative feelings and to make a success of their youth. In doing so, they make a fine impression on others. How?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Consider the experience of 18-year-old Claire. She and her mother attend a congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Melbourne. When Claire’s father abandoned the family, she became depressed. But her faith in her heavenly Father, Jehovah, remained strong. One day, the family doctor, Lydia, called at Claire’s home to check up on Claire’s mother, who was ill. Afterward, she kindly offered to drive Claire to the shopping center. Along the way, she asked Claire whether she had a boyfriend. Claire explained that as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, she did not casually date boys. This surprised the doctor. Claire then explained how the Bible had helped her to make wise decisions in life. Finally, she offered to bring the doctor a copy of a Bible-based publication that had greatly helped Claire. The book was entitled <em>Questions Young People Ask<wbr />—Answers That Work.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Three days after receiving the book, Lydia telephoned Claire’s mother to say how much she had enjoyed reading it. She then requested six more books for her colleagues. When Claire delivered the books, the doctor explained how impressed she was by Claire’s faith. Claire offered to study the Bible with her, and the doctor accepted.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">For several months, Claire conducted the study during the doctor’s lunch break. Then Lydia asked Claire if she would speak at a seminar on the subject of depression in youths. Although apprehensive, Claire agreed. Over 60 people attended the seminar. Four mental-health professionals<wbr />—all adults—<wbr />addressed the audience. Then it was Claire’s turn to speak. She highlighted how important it is for young people to have a relationship with God. She explained that Jehovah God cares deeply for young people and helps all those who turn to him for support and comfort. Additionally, she expressed her conviction that Jehovah will soon do away with all forms of physical and mental illness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 33:24</a>) What resulted from this fine witness?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Many came up to me after the session to say how impressed they were to hear a young person talk about God,” said Claire. “I placed 23 copies of the <em>Young People Ask </em>book. Three girls in the audience gave me their telephone numbers. One of these girls is now studying the Bible. It was one of the best days of my life.”</p>

They Share Good News With the Deaf
“THEY bring you spirituality!” That was how the director of a home for senior citizens in Navalcarnero, Madrid, Spain, recently described the visits of Jehovah’s Witnesses to his center. What prompted him to say that?
Several of the residents of the Rosas del Camino center are deaf. However, since the Witnesses have made the effort to learn Spanish Sign Language, they can communicate with these residents. The director praised the Witnesses for freely offering their time to teach spiritual values to those in need. He observed the favorable effect the teaching of the good news of the Kingdom has had on the residents. And the residents—especially those with hearing or visual impediments—also greatly value the visits of the Witnesses.
Eulogio, one of the residents who is blind and deaf, is now studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. One day while the study was in progress, an elderly man approached and offered the Witness a poem that the residents had composed as a token of their gratitude. The poem was entitled “To Be a Witness.” In part, it said: “They live a good, well-disciplined life, and from Jehovah they obtain joyful wisdom. They go back and forth to the houses because they trust in Jehovah.”
It is precisely this trust in Jehovah that has led many Witnesses all over the world to learn the sign language of the deaf people in their country. In this way they share with such ones the encouraging message of hope found in the Bible.

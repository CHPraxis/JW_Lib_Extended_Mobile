<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">On Thursday, March 24, 2005, an event will take place that you will not want to miss. That is the day when over six million of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide together with millions of friends will meet locally to recall the last evening meal that Jesus had with his disciples. In accordance with Jesus’ instructions, unleavened bread and red wine will be passed at each meeting, and the meaning of this ceremony will be explained.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:14:22-41:14:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 14:22-24</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">For many people this event is known as the Lord’s Supper, or the Lord’s Evening Meal. Jehovah’s Witnesses call it the Memorial of Christ’s death. It is a vital reminder of the sacrifice that Jesus Christ made in behalf of sinful mankind when he died. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:2-62:2:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 John 2:2</a>) After his final meal, Jesus was arrested and later died on a stake as though he were a common evildoer.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:19:17-43:19:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 19:17, 18</a>.</p>

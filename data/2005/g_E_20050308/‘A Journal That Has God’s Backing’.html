<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A MAN who is studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses in Nigeria attended a seminar organized by the Inter-African Committee on Women and Children. He took along two recent copies of <em>Awake!</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">On the first day of the seminar, the man realized that the speaker was using points from one of the magazines that he had brought with him. Its cover series was entitled “Life is Worth Living.” (October 22, 2001) So he promptly pulled out his copy and began to follow along.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">At the end of the day, a lawyer who was to deliver a lecture the following day saw the cover of the other issue of <em>Awake! </em>that the Bible student had on hand, with the featured series “Help for Battered Women.” The lawyer wanted to borrow it. Overnight, he scrapped his original draft and prepared a new lecture based on the <em>Awake! </em>articles. On the following day, while the lawyer was delivering his part, a woman sitting in the same row as the Bible student took out her issue of <em>Awake! </em>and began to follow along.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Bible student himself was able to make a valuable contribution to the discussions at the seminar because of reading the articles in <em>Awake! </em>‘I have no doubt,’ he observed, ‘that this journal has God’s backing.’</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Would you like to have this journal delivered to your home regularly? Why not ask one of Jehovah’s Witnesses to make an arrangement for you?</p>

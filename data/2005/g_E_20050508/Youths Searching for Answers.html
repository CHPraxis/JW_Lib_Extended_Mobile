<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">When the 17th Catholic World Youth Day was held in Toronto, Canada, in 2002, hundreds of thousands of people came from around the world. Although not part of the event, Jehovah’s Witnesses anticipated an influx of many young ones into the city. How did they prepare for this? In the spirit of first-century Christians, they took advantage of the occasion to speak to them about the Scriptures.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:16:12-44:16:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 16:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Witnesses commended these youths for their spiritual inclination. This led to many friendly Scriptural conversations. When asked by one Witness whether World Youth Day was what she expected, one girl responded: “Well, so far we’ve seen music and dancing, but nothing is making my faith stronger.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Witness then offered the girl the brochure entitled <em>A Book for All People, </em>explaining that it answered many questions people have asked about the Bible, such as “Is it really the Word of God?” and “How can we know that it hasn’t changed since it was originally written?”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The girl answered: “That’s the stage I am at in my life right now. I need to have my questions answered. I want to read this right away. It may be the most important thing that comes out of this trip.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">That was but one of the many conversations the Witnesses had with delegates to the Catholic World Youth Day.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Fraud  </strong>You will never know how much I appreciated the series “Protect Yourself From Fraud.” (July 22, 2004) I run a small business from my home, and I was a victim of fraud. The feelings I had were just like those described in the series<wbr />—shame, guilt, and embarrassment over being so foolish. I did just what the series advised. I admitted my mistake, prayed to Jehovah, and talked to an elder who is my friend. With the help of these articles, I have been able to put the matter behind me. What a blessing!</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Premarital Sex  </strong>The article “Young People Ask . . . What’s Wrong With Premarital Sex?” was a strengthening aid to me. (July 22, 2004) The thoughts expressed by young people quoted in the article were similar to thoughts I have had. The words that especially hit home were those of <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:84:11-19:84:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 84:11</a>, which tells us that Jehovah will not hold back anything good from those who walk in faultlessness.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">As a young person, I have always tried my best to remain chaste in Jehovah’s eyes, but sometimes it is a challenge. This article renewed my determination and reminded me that I am not the only one facing pressures from Satan’s world. Knowing how much Jehovah cares about young people is truly encouraging.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Appearance  </strong>I want to express my thanks for the article “When Concern About Appearance Becomes an Obsession.” (July 22, 2004) I am 21 years old, and I had been really conscious of the fact that I am bigger than other people. Now I want to maintain the glow of the inner person. It is as if the article were written for me!</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Unfortunately, these days we are led to believe that we should have the perfect body. Sometimes it’s a battle, and it often depresses me that I’m not winning it. But I want to keep working on it, and this article is a tremendous help!</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>Post-Polio Syndrome (PPS)  </strong>Thank you for the experience of Jack Meintsma in the article “Once Stricken, Twice Afflicted.” (July 22, 2004) I have suffered from polyarthritis for the past 23 years but have symptoms similar to those mentioned in the article. I want to thank Brother Meintsma for the information he passed on concerning helpful devices and reducing the demand on affected muscles.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">I had polio when I was two and a half years old and PPS at 25. The doctors were not familiar with this syndrome, and they had great difficulty diagnosing it. Before reading this article, I had never found such comprehensive information on this subject.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">My mother was stricken with poliomyelitis when she was six years old. The accurate description of the sickness has helped me to understand her condition.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">I had polio at 18 months of age, and I am not nearly as affected as Brother Meintsma. However, I am somewhat drained of my energy as a result of weak muscles. The article helped me to understand how to conserve my energy. The greatest benefit from the article was to read that Jehovah sees and cares!</p>

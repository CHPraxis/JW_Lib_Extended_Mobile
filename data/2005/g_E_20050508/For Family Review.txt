For Family Review
AMONG the appreciative readers of Awake! are many children. “Thanks for the very good articles,” wrote a nine-year-old boy. “Keep making these magazines so interesting.” After reading an article on dolphins in the January 8, 2002, issue, a young girl wrote: “Last summer when I was seven, three dolphins came up to us and watched us while we were swimming, just as the dolphins did in the article. I love to see the wonderful things that Jehovah has made. Thank you for the articles you print!”

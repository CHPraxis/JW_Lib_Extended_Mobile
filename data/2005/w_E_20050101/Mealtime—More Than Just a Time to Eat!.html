<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">EVERYONE enjoys a fine meal. Add to the meal good conversation and warm association with people you love, and it becomes a delightful event that satisfies more than just our hunger. Many families make it a practice to gather together at least once a day to share a meal. Mealtime gives a family the opportunity to discuss the day’s events or plans. Parents who listen to their children’s comments and expressions get a glimpse of the thinking and feelings of their young ones. Over time, the happy, relaxed association enjoyed at mealtime builds within a family a sense of security, trust, and love that adds stability to the family unit.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Today, because many family members are busy and always on the move, they find it difficult to meet together for a meal. In some parts of the world, local culture frowns upon a family eating together or even talking during mealtime. Other families have the habit of turning on the TV during the meal, effectively robbing themselves of any meaningful communication.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Christian parents, however, are always alert to opportunities to build up their households. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:24:27-20:24:27" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:27</a>) Long ago, parents were told that one of the best opportunities to communicate God’s word to their children was ‘when they sit in their house.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:6:7-5:6:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>) Regularly sitting down together for a meal offers parents a unique chance to build within their children a deeper love for Jehovah and his righteous principles. By cultivating a happy and relaxed atmosphere, you can make mealtime an enjoyable and upbuilding experience for your family too. Yes, make mealtime more than just a time to eat!</p>

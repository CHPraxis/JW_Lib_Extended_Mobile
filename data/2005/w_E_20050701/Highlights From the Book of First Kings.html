<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of First Kings</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“WHEN the righteous become many, the people rejoice; but when anyone wicked bears rule, the people sigh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:29:2-20:29:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:2</a>) The Bible book of First Kings vividly demonstrates the truth of this proverb. It relates the life story of Solomon, during whose kingship ancient Israel enjoys a time of security and great prosperity. First Kings also includes an account of the dividing of the nation after Solomon’s death and of 14 kings who followed him, some in Israel and some in Judah. Only two of these kings were consistently faithful to Jehovah. In addition, the book recounts the activities of six prophets, including Elijah.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Written in Jerusalem and Judah by the prophet Jeremiah, the narrative covers a period of some 129 years<wbr />—from 1040 B.C.E. to 911 B.C.E. While compiling the book, Jeremiah evidently consulted such ancient records as “the book of the affairs of Solomon.” Those separate records are no longer extant.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:11:41-11:11:41" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Kings 11:41;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:14:19-11:14:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:15:7-11:15:7" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 15:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">First Kings begins with an intriguing account of an attempt by King David’s son Adonijah to usurp his father’s kingship. The prophet Nathan’s prompt action foils the plan, and David’s son Solomon is made king. Jehovah is pleased with the request of the newly enthroned king and gives him “a wise and understanding heart” along with “riches and glory.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:3:12-11:3:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Kings 3:12, 13</a>) The king’s wisdom is without equal, his wealth beyond compare. Israel enjoys a period of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Among the building projects Solomon completes are Jehovah’s temple and various government buildings. Jehovah assures Solomon: “I [will] establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel to time indefinite,” provided the king remains obedient. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:9:4-11:9:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Kings 9:4, 5</a>) The true God also warns him of the consequences of disobedience. Solomon, though, comes to have many foreign wives. Under their influence, he turns to false worship in his old age. Jehovah foretells that his kingdom will be divided. In 997 B.C.E., Solomon dies, bringing an end to his 40-year reign. His son Rehoboam ascends the throne.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:1:5-11:1:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>1:5</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—Why did Adonijah try to seize the throne while David was still alive? </strong>The Bible does not say. However, it is reasonable to conclude that since Adonijah’s older brothers Amnon and Absalom were already dead, as was probably David’s son Chileab, Adonijah thought that he had the right to the throne as the eldest of David’s remaining sons. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:3:2-10:3:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Samuel 3:2-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:13:28-10:13:29" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 13:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:18:14-10:18:17" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 18:14-17</a>) Having elicited the support of the powerful army chief Joab and the influential high priest Abiathar, Adonijah likely felt confident that his attempt would succeed. The Bible does not say whether he knew of David’s intent to have Solomon inherit the throne. However, Adonijah did not invite Solomon and others loyal to David to “a sacrifice.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:1:9-11:1:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Kings 1:9, 10</a>) This suggests that he viewed Solomon as a rival.</p>

Though David had not had relations with her, beautiful Abishag was considered David’s concubine. According to the custom of the times, she would become the property only of David’s legal heir. Adonijah might have thought that by taking Abishag as his wife, he could again make a bid for the throne. Interpreting Adonijah’s request as a manifestation of ambition for the kingship, Solomon revoked the pardon.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:6:37-11:8:2" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>6:37–8:2</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—When was the temple inaugurated? </strong>The temple was completed in the eighth month of 1027 B.C.E., the 11th year of Solomon’s reign. It seems that bringing in the furnishings and making other preparations took 11 months. The inauguration must have taken place in the seventh month of the year 1026 B.C.E. The narrative describes other construction projects after the temple’s completion and before mentioning its inauguration, evidently to round out the discussion about the building operations.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:5:1-14:5:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 5:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/11:9:10-11:9:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>9:10-13</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—Was Solomon’s gift of 20 cities in the land of Galilee to King Hiram of Tyre in harmony with the Mosaic Law? </strong>The Law as stated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:25:23-3:25:24" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Leviticus 25:23, 24</a> could have been regarded as applying only to an area occupied by the Israelites. It is possible that the cities Solomon gave to Hiram were inhabited by non-Israelites, although lying within the boundary of the Promised Land. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:23:31-2:23:31" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Exodus 23:31</a>) Solomon’s action could also have been an indication of his failure to comply completely with the Law, as when he ‘increased horses for himself’ and took many wives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:17:16-5:17:17" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 17:16, 17</a>) Whatever the case, Hiram was dissatisfied with the gift. Perhaps the cities were not well-kept by their pagan inhabitants, or it may be that they were not ideally located.</p>

Solomon was quite young when he began ruling, and although he reigned for 40 years, he did not reach an advanced old age. Moreover, he did not completely leave off following Jehovah. He apparently tried to practice some form of interfaith.</p>

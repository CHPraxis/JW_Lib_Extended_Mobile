<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Second Samuel</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">DOES recognizing Jehovah’s sovereignty require our perfect obedience? Does a man of integrity always do what is right in God’s eyes? What kind of individual does the true God find “agreeable to his heart”? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:14-9:13:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Samuel 13:14</a>) The Bible book of Second Samuel gives satisfying answers to these questions.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Second Samuel was written by Gad and Nathan, two prophets who were close to King David of ancient Israel.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Completed in about 1040 B.C.E., toward the end of David’s 40-year kingship, the book is primarily about David and his relationship with Jehovah. This thrilling narrative relates how a strife-torn nation becomes a prosperous united kingdom under a valiant king. The gripping drama is packed with human emotions expressed with deep intensity.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">David’s response to the news of the death of Saul and Jonathan reveals his feelings for them and for Jehovah. In Hebron, David is appointed king over the tribe of Judah. Saul’s son Ish-bosheth is made king over the rest of Israel. David goes on “getting greater and greater,” and some seven and a half years later, he is made king over all Israel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:10-10:5:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Samuel 5:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">David captures Jerusalem from the Jebusites and makes it the capital of his kingdom. His first attempt to transfer the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem results in disaster. However, the second attempt succeeds, and David dances for joy. Jehovah makes a covenant with David for a kingdom. David subdues his enemies as God continues to be with him.</p>

David ruled over Judah from Hebron for seven and a half years. Soon after being made king over all Israel, he shifted his capital to Jerusalem. Hence, about five years elapsed after Ish-bosheth’s death before David became king over all Israel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:2:3-10:2:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Samuel 2:3, 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:2:8-10:2:11" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 8-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:5:4-10:5:5" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 5:4, 5</a>.</p>

It seems that David had the Moabites lie down side by side on the ground in a row. Next, he had the row measured with the length of a line, or a cord. Apparently, two line measures, or two thirds of the Moabites, were put to death, and one line measure, or one third of them, were spared.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of First Chronicles</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">SOME 77 years have passed since the Jews returned to their homeland from Babylonian exile. The temple that was rebuilt by Governor Zerubbabel has now stood for 55 years. The prime reason for the Jews’ return was the restoration of true worship in Jerusalem. However, the people lack zeal for Jehovah’s worship. There is an urgent need for encouragement, and that is exactly what the Bible book of First Chronicles provides.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Aside from the genealogical records, First Chronicles covers a period of some 40 years, from the death of King Saul to the death of King David. The priest Ezra is credited with the writing of this book in the year 460 B.C.E. First Chronicles is of interest to us because it gives insight into worship at the temple and provides details about the lineage of the Messiah. As a part of the inspired Word of God, its message strengthens our faith and enhances our understanding of the Bible.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>A MEANINGFUL RECORD OF NAMES</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:1:1-13:9:44" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>1 Chronicles 1:1–9:44</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The detailed genealogical listing that Ezra compiles is necessary for at least three reasons: to ensure that only authorized men serve in the priesthood, to help determine tribal inheritance, and to preserve the record of the lineage leading up to the Messiah. The record links the Jews with their past all the way back to the first man. Ten generations take us from Adam to Noah, and another ten take us to Abraham. After listing the sons of Ishmael, the sons of Abraham’s concubine Keturah, and the sons of Esau, the account focuses on the line of descent of the 12 sons of Israel.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:2:1-13:2:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 2:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The descendants of Judah are given extensive coverage because they provide the royal line of King David. There are 14 generations from Abraham to David and another 14 to the deportation to Babylon.

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The narrative opens with the account of King Saul and his three sons dying in battle against the Philistines at Mount Gilboa. David, the son of Jesse, is made king over the tribe of Judah. Men from all tribes come to Hebron and make him king over all Israel.

After receiving angelic direction to erect an altar to Jehovah, David purchases a place from Ornan the Jebusite. David begins making “preparation in great quantities” for building a “surpassingly magnificent” house to Jehovah at that site. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/13:22:5-13:22:5" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 22:5</a>) David organizes Levitical services, described here in greater detail than anywhere else in the Scriptures.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AMONG the many thought-provoking parables given by Jesus Christ, there is one about a wealthy landowner. In an effort to make a secure future sure for himself, the landowner made plans to build bigger storehouses. Yet, in Jesus’ illustration, the man is called an “unreasonable one.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:16-42:12:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 12:16-21</a>) A number of Bible translations even use the word “fool.” Why the harsh assessment?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Evidently, this wealthy man’s plans did not include God; nor did he give any credit to God for the land’s productiveness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:45-40:5:45" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 5:45</a>) Rather, he boasted: “Soul, you have many good things laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.” Yes, he imagined that the fruitage of his endeavors would serve as “a protective wall.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:18:11-20:18:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In warning against such a haughty spirit, the disciple James wrote: “Come, now, you who say: ‘Today or tomorrow we will journey to this city and will spend a year there, and we will engage in business and make profits,’ whereas you do not know what your life will be tomorrow. For you are a mist appearing for a little while and then disappearing.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:4:13-59:4:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">James 4:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">True to those words, the rich man in Jesus’ parable was told: “Unreasonable one, this night they are demanding your soul from you. Who, then, is to have the things you stored up?” Like a disappearing mist, the rich man would pass away before he could see his dreams fulfilled. Do we discern the lesson? Said Jesus: “So it goes with the man that lays up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.” Are you “rich toward God”?</p>

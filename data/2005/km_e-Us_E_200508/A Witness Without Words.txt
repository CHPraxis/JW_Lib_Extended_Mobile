A Witness Without Words
1 Without uttering a word, Jehovah’s physical creation speaks volumes about his invisible qualities. (Ps. 19:1-3; Rom. 1:20) Similarly, our fine conduct, Christian qualities, and modest appearance give a witness without words. (1 Pet. 2:12; 3:1-4) It should be the desire of each of us to “adorn the teaching of our Savior, God, in all things” by the way we comport ourselves.​—Titus 2:10.
2 How is it possible for imperfect humans to add luster to Bible teachings? This is possible only through the guidance of God’s Word and the power of holy spirit. (Ps. 119:105; 143:10) God’s word “is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword.” (Heb. 4:12) It penetrates deep within us and enables us to put on the new personality. (Col. 3:9, 10) Holy spirit produces in us desirable qualities, such as kindness, goodness, mildness, and self-control. (Gal. 5:22, 23) Are we individually allowing God’s word and spirit to work in our lives?​—Eph. 4:30; 1 Thess. 2:13.
3 Others Take Notice: When we live by Jehovah’s standards and strive to reflect his qualities, others take notice. Consider, for example, a man who was ridiculed by his workmates because he was short. A sister who worked in the same office always treated him with dignity and respect. This moved him to ask her why she was so different. She explained that her respectful conduct was the result of applying Bible principles in her life. She also shared with him the marvelous Kingdom hope. The man began to study the Bible and eventually progressed to baptism. When he returned to his homeland, his relatives were impressed by his fine conduct, and several of them also accepted the truth.
4 At work, in school, or in dealing with relatives and neighbors, we can by our fine conduct, along with our witnessing, cause others to give glory to God.​—Matt. 5:16.

Special Assembly Day Review
This material will be used on the Service Meeting program shortly before and shortly after the congregation attends the special assembly day for the 2006 service year. The presiding overseer will arrange for this preview and review, as outlined in the August 2004 Our Kingdom Ministry, page 4. During the review, all the questions should be asked, focusing attention on how we can apply the information that was presented.
MORNING SESSION
 1. What does it mean to keep one’s eye simple, and why is that a challenge today? (“Why Keep Your Eye Simple?”)
 2. How do we benefit by keeping a simple eye? (“Reap Blessings for Keeping a Simple Eye”)
 3. What danger do many so-called normal activities pose? (“Keeping a Simple Eye in a Wicked World”)
AFTERNOON SESSION
 4. How can parents and others encourage youths to pursue spiritual goals? (“Parents Who Aim Their Arrows Aright” and “Youths Who Reach Out for Spiritual Goals”)
 5. How can we move ahead with Jehovah’s organization (a) as individuals? (b) as families? (c) as a congregation? (“Focus On Moving Ahead With Jehovah’s Organization”)

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>NOTE: </strong>A month or two after the congregation attends the “Godly Obedience” District Convention, 15 to 20 minutes should be set aside on the Service Meeting (perhaps using a local needs portion) for a review of points from the convention that the publishers have found to be helpful in the field ministry. The special Service Meeting part will give us the opportunity to explain how we are using what we learned at the convention and how it has helped make our ministry more effective.​—See the <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:202005123/1-25$p/E:202005124/1-9">April 2005 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry, </em>p. 2</a>.</p>

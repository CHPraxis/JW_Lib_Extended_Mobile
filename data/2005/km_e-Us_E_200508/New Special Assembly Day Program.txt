New Special Assembly Day Program
The eye is a marvel of design. (Ps. 139:14) Yet, it can focus on only one thing at a time. That is true both literally and figuratively. For our spiritual vision to be clear and in focus, we must center our attention on doing God’s will. In view of the ever-increasing distractions of Satan’s world, how appropriate that the special assembly day program for the 2006 service year will develop the theme “Keep Your Eye Simple”!​—Matt. 6:22.
How can we put ourselves in line to receive blessings from Jehovah? (Prov. 10:22) This question will be considered in the part “Reap Blessings for Keeping a Simple Eye.” Interviews will highlight how we can benefit from applying Scriptural principles. The first talk by the visiting speaker, “Keeping a Simple Eye in a Wicked World,” will warn us of things that can complicate our lives and gradually choke our spirituality. We will also learn what is involved in choosing “the good portion.”​—Luke 10:42.
How can parents and others encourage young Christians to focus on spiritual pursuits? The parts “Parents Who Aim Their Arrows Aright” and “Youths Who Reach Out for Spiritual Goals” will include expressions from parents and youths on this important question. (Ps. 127:4) The concluding talk by the visiting speaker will consider how we can keep pace with Jehovah’s organization as individuals, as families, and as a congregation.
Whether we are newly acquainted with the truth or have been serving Jehovah for decades, it is vital that we ‘keep our eye simple.’ The special assembly day program will help us to do just that.

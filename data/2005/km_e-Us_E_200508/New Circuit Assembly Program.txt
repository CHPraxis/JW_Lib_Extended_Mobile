New Circuit Assembly Program
During the final days of this corrupt old world, it is vital that we maintain our spiritual attire and safeguard our Christian identity. (Rev. 16:15) It is appropriate, therefore, that the theme of the circuit assembly program for the 2006 service year is “Clothe Yourselves With the New Personality.”​—Col. 3:10.
First Day: The first symposium, “Manifesting Aspects of the New Personality,” will highlight how cultivating the new personality benefits us in every area of our lives. How do we cultivate the new personality? That will be considered in the last two talks of the first day, “Discipline Yourself to Meditate Properly” and “Education That Molds the New Personality.”
Second Day: How the new personality influences our use of the tongue will be considered in the second symposium, “Cultivating the Tongue of Wise Ones.” “Are You Conquering the Wicked One?” is the theme of the public address, which will highlight the need to remain alert to Satan’s tactics. The last two talks of the assembly, “Keep Yourself Without Spot From the World” and “Daily Renewing the Man We Are Inside,” will help us to shun attitudes and conduct that conflict with God’s righteous ways and to remain steadfast in our worship of Jehovah.
How we look forward to receiving this encouragement to put on and maintain the new personality!

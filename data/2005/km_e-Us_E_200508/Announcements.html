<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>August: </strong><em>Worship the Only True God. </em>If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the <em>Knowledge </em>book and the <em>Require </em>brochure be studied before the <em>Worship God </em>book. <strong>September: </strong><em>Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life</em>. Before requesting additional supplies from the branch office, congregations should use what is available locally and check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand. <strong>October: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the <em>Require </em>brochure and make a special effort to start Bible studies. <strong>November: </strong><em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>If individuals say they have no children, offer the <em>Knowledge </em>book or the tract <em>Would You Like to Know More About the Bible?</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ On August 26 and 27, 2005, an inventory will be taken of all literature on hand at Wallkill Bethel. Because of this, no congregation literature requests will be processed for pickup during those days.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Since October has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Pages 5 and 6 of this issue of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>should be kept for use in connection with the circuit assembly and special assembly day programs for the 2006 service year.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ The annual inventory of all literature and magazines on hand should be taken on or as close to August 31, 2005, as possible. This inventory is similar to the actual count taken monthly by the literature coordinator, and the totals should be entered on the <em>Literature Inventory </em>form (S-18). The total number of magazines on hand should be obtained from the magazine servant(s). The secretary of the coordinating congregation should supervise the inventory. He and the presiding overseer of the coordinating congregation will sign the form. Each coordinating congregation will receive three <em>Literature Inventory </em>forms (S-18). <em>Please mail the original to the branch office no later than September 6. </em>Keep a copy for your files. The third copy may be used as a work sheet.</p>

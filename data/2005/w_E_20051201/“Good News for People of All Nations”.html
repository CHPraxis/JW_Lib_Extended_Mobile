<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">SHOWN above is a booklet released at the 2004/05 “Walk With God” District Conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses. One edition of it is a 96-page booklet that contains a brief message in 92 languages, ranging from Afrikaans to Zulu, and is designed to help spread the Kingdom good news to as many people as possible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>) The following are typical of the results when the booklet is used.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">• After receiving the booklet at the convention, a Witness family visited three national parks. There they met people from India, the Netherlands, Pakistan, and the Philippines. The husband noted: “Though all these people spoke some English, they were impressed when we showed them the message in their own language, since they were thousands of miles from home. The worldwide nature of our work as well as our unity became clear to them.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">• A Witness showed the booklet to a coworker from India. He was excited to see all the languages in it and read the message in his own language. This led to more discussions about the Bible. A coworker from the Philippines was amazed to find her native language in the booklet and became interested in learning more about Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">• In Canada, a lady from Nepal agreed to study the Bible with a Witness over the phone but was reluctant to invite the sister to her home. However, when the Witness told the lady about the booklet with a message in Nepali, she excitedly invited the sister to come over. She just had to see for herself the message in her mother tongue! The Bible study has been held at the lady’s home ever since.</p>

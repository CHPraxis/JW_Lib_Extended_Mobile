<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Second Chronicles</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">AS THE Bible book of Second Chronicles opens, Solomon is ruling as king over Israel. The book ends with these words of Persian King Cyrus to the exiled Jews in Babylonia: “[Jehovah] himself has commissioned me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, Jehovah his God be with him. So let him go up [to Jerusalem].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:36:23-14:36:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:23</a>) Completed by the priest Ezra in 460 B.C.E., the book covers 500 years<wbr />—from 1037 B.C.E. to 537 B.C.E.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Cyrus’ decree makes it possible for the Jews to return to Jerusalem and reestablish Jehovah’s worship there. However, the long years of Babylonian captivity have taken their toll. The returned exiles lack knowledge of their national history. Second Chronicles provides them with a vivid summary of events under kings of the royal line of David. The narrative is also of interest to us because it highlights the blessings that come from obedience to the true God and the consequences of disobedience to him.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>A KING BUILDS A HOUSE TO JEHOVAH</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:1:1-14:9:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>2 Chronicles 1:1–9:31</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah gives King Solomon the request of his heart<wbr />—wisdom and knowledge—<wbr />along with riches and honor. The king builds a magnificent house to Jehovah in Jerusalem, and the people are “joyful and feeling good at heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:7:10-14:7:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 7:10</a>) Solomon comes to be “greater than all the other kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:9:22-14:9:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 9:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">After ruling over Israel for 40 years, Solomon ‘lies down with his forefathers, and Rehoboam his son begins to rule in his place.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:9:31-14:9:31" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 9:31</a>) Ezra does not record Solomon’s deviation from true worship. The only negative points mentioned about the king are his unwise acquisition of many horses from Egypt and his marriage to the daughter of Pharaoh. The chronicler thus presents the account from a positive standpoint.</p>

Why do the numbers differ? </strong>The difference seems to be in the way the deputies are classified. It may be that Second Chronicles differentiates between 3,600 non-Israelites and 250 Israelite deputies, while First Kings distinguishes 3,300 foremen from 550 chief supervisors of higher rank. In any case, the total number of those serving as deputies was 3,850.</p>

It Prompted a Desire for a Bible
When Russia was under rule by Communist dictators, reading the Bible was discouraged. However, in recent years millions of Bibles have been distributed in that country. A letter received by the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia reveals a reason for the revival of interest in the Bible. Sergei, a husband and father in Volgograd—a large city that was for decades named Stalingrad, after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin—explains:
“Recently people from your society came to my home. They politely asked me if I believed in God. I said that every person, at least to some extent, believes in God. When I said I had a wife and a son, one of the visitors reached into his bag and pulled out the book The Secret of Family Happiness and gave it to me.”
Sergei eventually began to read the book. “I really enjoyed it,” he relates. “It is obvious that the book was written by intelligent, dedicated people. Generally I am skeptical of religious societies, but I think you are honest people. At the end of the book, I found your address.” So Sergei wrote to that address and asked for a copy of the Bible.
The principles for enjoying family happiness outlined in the Family Happiness book are based on Bible teachings. Among the book’s instructive chapters are “Train Your Child From Infancy,” “Protect Your Family From Destructive Influences,” and “Maintain Peace in Your Household.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">When Russia was under rule by Communist dictators, reading the Bible was discouraged. However, in recent years millions of Bibles have been distributed in that country. A letter received by the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia reveals a reason for the revival of interest in the Bible. Sergei, a husband and father in Volgograd<wbr />—a large city that was for decades named Stalingrad, after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin—<wbr />explains:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Recently people from your society came to my home. They politely asked me if I believed in God. I said that every person, at least to some extent, believes in God. When I said I had a wife and a son, one of the visitors reached into his bag and pulled out the book <em>The Secret of Family Happiness </em>and gave it to me.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Sergei eventually began to read the book. “I really enjoyed it,” he relates. “It is obvious that the book was written by intelligent, dedicated people. Generally I am skeptical of religious societies, but I think you are honest people. At the end of the book, I found your address.” So Sergei wrote to that address and asked for a copy of the Bible.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The principles for enjoying family happiness outlined in the <em>Family Happiness </em>book are based on Bible teachings. Among the book’s instructive chapters are “Train Your Child From Infancy,” “Protect Your Family From Destructive Influences,” and “Maintain Peace in Your Household.”</p>

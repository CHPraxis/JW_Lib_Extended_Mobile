Interest in the Bible Appreciated
MARIANNA, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the south of Italy, is 18 years old and in her last year of high school. She attends the same school as some other young Witnesses.
“For a few years now,” writes Marianna, “some of us have been reading the Bible text for the day from Examining the Scriptures Daily during our break. The only place we could do so was in one of the corridors near the staff room. It was not very quiet. Most of the teachers saw us as they passed, and some stopped to see what we were doing. This has often given us the opportunity to answer their questions. On an average, one teacher stopped every day. Several have stayed to listen to our discussion of the Bible text and have expressed appreciation for the interest we Witnesses have in spiritual things. Once, the assistant principal invited us to have our conversation in the staff room.
“After seeing where we were considering the text, my teacher asked the principal if we could discuss it in one of the classrooms, where it would be quieter. The principal gave permission, and my teacher praised us before the whole class for the good example we set. We are all very happy for the great privilege Jehovah has granted us.”

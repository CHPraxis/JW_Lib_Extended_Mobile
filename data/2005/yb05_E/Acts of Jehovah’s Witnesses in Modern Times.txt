Acts of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Modern Times
Tahiti
The islands of French Polynesia, which include Tahiti, are among the most beautiful in the world. Poets and writers alike have portrayed them as paradise. But an even more inviting paradise thrives in these idyllic Pacific isles. Learn how this greater paradise was established and how it continues to produce an abundance of fruitage to Jehovah’s praise.
Guyana
The name Guyana means “Land of Waters.” This fitting designation is reflected in the country’s vast network of rivers, many of which serve as highways to the villages and towns of the interior. Read how Jehovah’s Witnesses have used canoes, rowboats, and steamers to direct the fascinating, multiracial inhabitants of this country, the only English-speaking land in South America, to “living water.”​—John 4:10.
Iceland
Situated just south of the Arctic Circle, far from the tropics, Iceland is a country of great beauty. Glaciers, volcanoes, and mountains adorn this rugged land. Yet, a surpassing beauty is found in the people who serve Jehovah. In this account, you will learn how God’s servants brave harsh conditions to share Bible truth with others.

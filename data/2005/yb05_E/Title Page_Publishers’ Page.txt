“My Help Is From Jehovah.”​—Psalm 121:2.
We are indeed living in “critical times hard to deal with.” (2 Tim. 3:1) When faced with trials and difficulties, to whom do you look for help? No doubt, you share the rocklike conviction of the psalmist whose words have been chosen as our yeartext for 2005. In the pages that follow, you will read the experiences of many who relied on Jehovah to help them to endure faithfully. May their stories strengthen you in your determination always to rely on Jehovah, knowing he is eager to help his loyal ones.​—2 Chron. 16:9a.

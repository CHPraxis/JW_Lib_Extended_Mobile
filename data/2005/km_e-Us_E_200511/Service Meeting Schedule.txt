18 min: Presenting the Good News in December. Talk and audience discussion. In a five-minute opening talk, briefly review the following points from “How to Use Sample Presentations,” found on page 8 of the January 2005 Our Kingdom Ministry: (1) We will usually be more effective if we put presentations in our own words. (2) We must use good judgment and adapt our presentations according to what is acceptable locally. (3) We need to take into account the background and thinking of the people in our territory. (4) We should carefully read the chapter that we plan to feature and look for points that may stir interest. (5) We are not limited to using the approaches outlined in the sample presentations. Then discuss how to apply those points when presenting the literature offer for December. You may use the sample presentations in the January 2005 Our Kingdom Ministry insert or other presentations that are effective locally. Demonstrate one or two presentations.

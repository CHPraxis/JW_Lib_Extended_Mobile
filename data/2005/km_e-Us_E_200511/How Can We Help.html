<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The question “How can we help?” is often raised by Jehovah’s Witnesses when they hear of a disaster that has occurred in some part of the world. As the account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:27-44:11:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 11:27-30</a> shows, Christians in the first century provided a relief ministration to the brothers dwelling in Judea because of a famine that took place.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>In modern times, our organizational charters have permitted money to be used for charitable activity and to provide humanitarian assistance to those suffering from natural or man-made disasters and in other times of need.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>For example, last year many brothers contributed toward helping those affected by the tsunami disaster in South Asia. This heartfelt response in the way of donations to the organization’s relief funds was very much appreciated. However, when donations are earmarked specifically for a certain disaster, it is necessary in some countries to use such funds only for the purpose specified by the donor and within a certain period of time, whether the needs of our brothers have been cared for locally or not.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Consequently, it is recommended that donations for humanitarian and relief assistance be made to the worldwide work. This fund is used for relief efforts as well as for advancing the spiritual needs of the Christian brotherhood. If, for some reason, a person wishes to make a relief donation separate from contributions to the worldwide work, it will still be accepted and used wherever there is a need for relief assistance. However, it would be appreciated if such donations are made without restrictions as to where and how the funds may be used.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Our directing donations primarily to the worldwide work allows for more funds to be available for use in connection with all features of the Kingdom work rather than being held only for future relief needs. This is in harmony with the spirit of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:16-49:4:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:16</a>, that we work together to give what is needed “for the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.”</p>

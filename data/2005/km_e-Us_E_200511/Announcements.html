<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>November: </strong><em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>If individuals say they have no children, offer the <em>Knowledge </em>book or the tract <em>Would You Like to Know More About the Bible? </em><strong>December: </strong><em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. </em>As an alternative offer, you may use <em>My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, </em>or <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em><strong>January: </strong>Any book published prior to 1991 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus of older publications on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have older books may offer <em>Worship the Only True God. </em><strong>February: </strong><em>Draw Close to Jehovah. </em>If this publication is not available, you may use the <em>Revelation Climax </em>book as an alternative offer.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. If a separate checking account is maintained, such as for maintenance or construction, arrangements should also be made to audit this account. When the audit(s) have been completed, this should be announced to the congregation with the next accounts report.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The secretary of each congregation holding title to property should review paragraphs 42-4 in the form entitled <em>Information Regarding Ownership of Kingdom Halls </em>(T-36). Even after real-estate tax exemption has been obtained, an annual filing is required in some states. Check carefully with your local tax assessor’s office to confirm whether any action is required. All taxes and assessments are to be paid within the time provided. If any tax or assessment is questioned, promptly follow through on the matter so that either it is removed or a proper challenge is filed within the applicable time limit.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Donations made by check and put in the local Kingdom Hall contribution boxes for the worldwide work and the Kingdom Hall Fund should be made payable to “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Donations made by check at district conventions and those sent to the branch office should be made payable to “Watch Tower.” The branch office financial address is Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, c/o Office of the Secretary and Treasurer, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ If you are admitted to a hospital and want visiting local elders and, in larger cities, elders serving on a Patient Visitation Group to have access to your name, what must you do? When identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, you should also explain that you are willing to have a minister of Jehovah’s Witnesses visit you. A federal law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), protects your privacy, but with your consent, the law allows for the elders to learn of your admission and provide spiritual encouragement.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ It is necessary for the branch office to maintain an up-to-date record of addresses and telephone numbers for all presiding overseers and secretaries. If there is a change at any time, the Congregation Service Committee should complete, sign, and send a <em>Presiding Overseer/Secretary Change of Address </em>(S-29) form to the branch office promptly. This includes any changes in telephone area codes.</p>

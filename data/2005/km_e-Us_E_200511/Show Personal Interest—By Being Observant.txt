Show Personal Interest​—By Being Observant
1 Jehovah God and Christ Jesus excel in recognizing the specific needs of people and in offering them assistance. (2 Chron. 16:9; Mark 6:34) When we identify the interests and concerns of those we meet in our ministry, we may be able to adapt our presentation of the good news accordingly.
2 Be Attentive to Details: Jesus was observant. (Mark 12:41-43; Luke 19:1-6) Similarly, when we approach the householder’s door and take note of religious decorations, slogans on vehicles, or toys in the yard, we may be able to create opportunities to give an effective witness of the good news.
3 A person’s facial expressions and demeanor may indicate something about his feelings. (Prov. 15:13) Perhaps the loss of a loved one or some other distressing circumstance has left him in need of comfort. Sharing some appropriate scriptures may be appreciated. (Prov. 16:24) Is the householder rushing out the door or holding a crying baby? If so, it may be better to arrange to call at another time. By being considerate and “showing fellow feeling,” we may move the person to listen when we return.​—1 Pet. 3:8.
4 Adapt Your Comments: The apostle Paul observed that the city of Athens had an altar dedicated “To an Unknown God.” This influenced the way he presented the good news, for he said: “What you are unknowingly giving godly devotion to, this I am publishing to you.” Paul’s tactful approach moved some of those present to give consideration to the Kingdom message and to become believers.​—Acts 17:23, 34.
5 In like manner, our being observant helps us to discern a person’s interests and thus allows us to tailor our approach. Use questions that might serve to draw out the householder. Think of scriptures that could be used to heighten his interest. (Prov. 20:5) Our being observant and showing sincere personal interest in others will help us to share the good news skillfully.

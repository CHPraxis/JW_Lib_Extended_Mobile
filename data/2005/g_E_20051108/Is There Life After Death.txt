Is There Life After Death?
▪ Many people would like to have reliable answers to such questions as: Is there life after death? Is the soul immortal? What does the Bible really say about resurrection on earth?
Recently, a woman in France wrote a letter to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses there regarding such questions. She said: “I am always happy to read your brochures, which ring true on all kinds of subjects. Life becomes more bearable with the help and comfort that the Bible offers.”
She explained: “I am writing to you regarding the brochure What Happens to Us When We Die? which brought me great comfort. It made everything so clear and simple.” She added: “I would like to obtain 10 or 15 copies of that brochure to distribute to people I know, so that they may also benefit from your writings.”
We feel that you too will benefit from the fascinating 32-page brochure What Happens to Us When We Die? If you would like to request a copy, simply fill in the accompanying coupon and mail it to the address provided or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

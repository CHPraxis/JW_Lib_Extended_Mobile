<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Many people would like to have reliable answers to such questions as: Is there life after death? Is the soul immortal? What does the Bible really say about resurrection on earth?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Recently, a woman in France wrote a letter to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses there regarding such questions. She said: “I am always happy to read your brochures, which ring true on all kinds of subjects. Life becomes more bearable with the help and comfort that the Bible offers.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">She explained: “I am writing to you regarding the brochure <em>What Happens to Us When We Die? </em>which brought me great comfort. It made everything so clear and simple.” She added: “I would like to obtain 10 or 15 copies of that brochure to distribute to people I know, so that they may also benefit from your writings.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Recalling the first time that she met one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, a woman who had been prejudiced against the Witnesses said: “I really don’t remember what we talked about, but what I remember is how kind she was to me, and how hospitable and humble she was. I really felt drawn to her as a person.” These comments highlight the importance of showing sincere personal interest in those to whom we preach.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Phil. 2:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Love Is Kind: </strong>One way we can demonstrate love for others is by being kind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 13:4</a>) A kind person takes an active interest in the welfare of others, seeking to do helpful things for them. Of course, the preaching work is in itself an act of kindness. But our genuine concern for people will be reflected in more than simply preaching to them. Our entire manner of dealing with people​—our friendliness, our good manners, the way we listen, the things we say and how we say them, even the way we look at others—​will reveal that we really care.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:2-40:8:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 8:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Loving concern for people will also move us to offer help in practical ways. While preaching from door to door, a pioneer brother was quickly dismissed by an elderly widow when she learned who he was. She mentioned that she had been on a stepladder in the kitchen trying to replace a lightbulb when he rang the doorbell. “It isn’t safe for you to be doing that alone,” he said. She invited him in. He changed the bulb and then went on his way. When the woman’s son stopped by a short time later to check on her, she told him what had happened. He was so impressed that he sought to find the brother to express his appreciation. This led to a fine conversation, resulting in the son accepting a Bible study.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>By being kind, we reflect Jehovah’s love for people and beautify the Kingdom message. Therefore, may we always “recommend ourselves as God’s ministers . . . by kindness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:4-47:6:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:6-47:6:6" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 6</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>October: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the <em>Require </em>brochure and make a special effort to start Bible studies. <strong>November: </strong><em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>If individuals say they have no children, offer the <em>Knowledge </em>book or the tract <em>Would You Like to Know More About the Bible? </em><strong>December: </strong><em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. </em>As an alternative offer, you may use <em>My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, </em>or <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em><strong>January: </strong>Any book published prior to 1991 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus of older publications on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have older books may offer <em>Worship the Only True God.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Since October has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The insert in this issue of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>is the “Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 2006” and should be kept for reference throughout 2006.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Beginning the week of April 17, 2006, we will study <em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>at the Congregation Book Study. Congregations should have on hand appropriate supplies of the regular and large-print editions at that time.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ The video program <em>Transfusion-Alternative Health Care​—Meeting Patient Needs and Rights </em>will be considered at a Service Meeting in January. If needed, copies should be requested through the congregation as soon as possible.</p>

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the Require brochure and make a special effort to start Bible studies. November: Learn From the Great Teacher. If individuals say they have no children, offer the Knowledge book or the tract Would You Like to Know More About the Bible? December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. As an alternative offer, you may use My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, or You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. January: Any book published prior to 1991 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus of older publications on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have older books may offer Worship the Only True God.
▪ Since October has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.
▪ The insert in this issue of Our Kingdom Ministry is the “Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 2006” and should be kept for reference throughout 2006.
▪ Beginning the week of April 17, 2006, we will study What Does the Bible Really Teach? at the Congregation Book Study. Congregations should have on hand appropriate supplies of the regular and large-print editions at that time.
▪ The video program Transfusion-Alternative Health Care​—Meeting Patient Needs and Rights will be considered at a Service Meeting in January. If needed, copies should be requested through the congregation as soon as possible.

Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 2006
Instructions
During 2006 the following will be the arrangements for conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.
SOURCE MATERIAL: New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures [bi12], The Watchtower [w], Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education [be], “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” (1990 Edition) [si], and Reasoning From the Scriptures (1989 Edition) [rs].
The school should begin ON TIME with song, prayer, and remarks of welcome and then proceed as outlined below. After each part, the school overseer will introduce the next part.
SPEECH QUALITY: 5 minutes. The school overseer, the auxiliary counselor, or another qualified elder will discuss a speech quality based on the Ministry School textbook. (In congregations with a limited number of elders, qualified ministerial servants may be used.)
ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 10 minutes. This should be handled by a qualified elder or ministerial servant, and it will be based on The Watchtower, Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education, or “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial.” It is to be delivered as a ten-minute instruction talk with no oral review. The objective should be not just to cover the material but to focus attention on the practical value of the information being discussed, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation. The theme shown should be used. It is expected that brothers assigned this talk will be careful to keep within the time limit. Private counsel may be given as needed.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 10 minutes. For the first five minutes, a qualified elder or ministerial servant should apply the material to local needs. He may comment on any portion of the assigned Bible reading for the week. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. The principal objective is to help the audience to appreciate why and how the information is of value. The speaker should be careful not to exceed the five minutes allotted for the opening portion. He should ensure that five minutes are set aside for audience participation. The audience should be invited to offer brief comments (30 seconds or less) on what they have appreciated in the Bible reading and its benefits. The school overseer will then dismiss the students who are assigned to other classrooms.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 2: 4 minutes or less. This is a reading to be given by a brother. The student should read the assigned material without giving an introduction or a conclusion. He should read the superscription when handling an assignment from the Psalms. The school overseer will be especially interested in helping students to read with understanding, fluency, proper sense stress, modulation, appropriate pausing, and naturalness.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 3: 5 minutes. This will be assigned to a sister. Students receiving this assignment will either be assigned a setting or select one from the list appearing on page 82 of the Ministry School textbook. The student should use the assigned theme and apply it to an aspect of field service that is realistic and practical for the local territory. When no references are indicated as source material, the student will need to gather material for this part by doing research in our publications. Newer students should be given assignments for which references are supplied. The school overseer will be particularly interested in the way the student develops the material and the way she helps the householder to reason on the Scriptures and to understand the key points of the presentation. The school overseer will assign one assistant.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 4: 5 minutes. The student should develop the assigned theme. When no references are indicated as source material, the student will need to gather material for this part by doing research in our publications. When assigned to a brother, this part should be given as a talk with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind. When a sister is given this part, it should always be presented as outlined for Assignment No. 3. The school overseer may give a brother Assignment No. 4 whenever he sees fit to do so. Please note that themes with asterisks next to them should always be assigned to brothers to develop as talks.
TIMING: No talk should go overtime, nor should the remarks of the counselor. Assignments No. 2 through 4 should tactfully be stopped when the time is up. If brothers handling the opening talk on a speech quality, Assignment No. 1, or highlights from the Bible reading go overtime, they should be given private counsel. All should watch their timing carefully. Total program: 45 minutes, excluding song and prayer.
COUNSEL: 1 minute. The school overseer will take no more than one minute after Assignments No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 to offer some positive observations on an aspect of the talk that was commendable. His aim is not simply to say “well done” but, rather, to draw attention to specific reasons why that aspect of the presentation was effective. According to the need of each student, additional constructive counsel may be given privately after the meeting or at another time.
AUXILIARY COUNSELOR: The body of elders may select a capable elder, if one is available in addition to the school overseer, to handle the assignment as auxiliary counselor. If there are a number of elders in the congregation, then a different qualified elder may care for this assignment each year. The auxiliary counselor’s responsibility will be to give private counsel, if needed, to brothers who present Assignment No. 1 and Bible highlights. It is not necessary that he offer counsel after each of such talks by fellow elders or ministerial servants.
COUNSEL FORM: In textbook.
ORAL REVIEW: 30 minutes. Every two months, the school overseer will conduct an oral review. It will be preceded by the consideration of a speech quality and highlights from the Bible reading as outlined above. The oral review will be based on material considered in the school over the preceding two months, including the current week. If your congregation has a circuit assembly during an oral review week, then the review (and the rest of the weekly schedule) should be postponed one week and the subsequent week’s schedule should be used one week early. If the circuit overseer will be visiting your congregation during an oral review week, then the song, the speech quality talk, and Bible highlights should be presented as scheduled. The instruction talk (given after the speech quality talk) should be drawn from the following week’s schedule. The Theocratic Ministry School for the next week will proceed with the speech quality talk and Bible highlights as scheduled, followed by the oral review.

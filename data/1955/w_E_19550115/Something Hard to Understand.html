<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> Do you find an occasional article in this magazine that seems a little deep for you, a little difficult to understand? Did you ever stop to think why that material is there? The apostle Paul stated the principle to the Hebrews: “For everyone that partakes of milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:13-58:5:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 5:13, 14</a>, <em>NW</em>) Thus the mature Christian must use his perceptive powers, must meditate upon and discuss difficult matters. So do not ignore an article because it is difficult, but take advantage of it to aid your progress toward spiritual maturity.</p>

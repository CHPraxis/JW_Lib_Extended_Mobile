<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> Many people offer their prayers to “saints,” thinking that, as one well-known religious handbook puts it, this is an “aid and help for obtaining benefits from God.” Yet Jesus said: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me. . . . and whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:6-43:14:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 14:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:13-43:14:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 13</a>, <em>Dy</em>) Since Jesus, of all persons, should have known, and since that is what he said about the matter, then why pray through anyone else?</p>

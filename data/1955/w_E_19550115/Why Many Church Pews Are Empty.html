<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">FOR a month in a certain California newspaper appeared the following advertisement: “WANTED men, women and children to occupy slightly used pews, Sunday morning, 10 to 12, at Armona Methodist Church, corner of 14th Ave. and Hanford-Armona Hwy.” The following experience may throw some light on why the pews of this church were unoccupied Sundays.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I attended this church for twenty-five years and each time a minister asked the question, Why are the churches failing? I would feel more convinced that something was wrong with the churches. A year and a half ago I asked the minister, who had placed the above advertisement in the paper, to explain Armageddon to me and also parts of Revelation. Both he and his wife, who is also an ordained minister, told me they did not know, nor were they interested in Revelation, as we were not supposed to know. I was also told that I would lose my mind if I studied with Jehovah’s witnesses, as they are the worst false witnesses in the world.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I had been studying the Bible for a few months with a young witness of Jehovah who had called at my door and she assured me that I would not lose my mind if I kept studying with her. After four months I was baptized, and it is amazing the progress I have been able to make, starting at the age of fifty-four as a Bible illiterate. Now with the help of Jehovah I am able to preach from door to door and conduct Bible studies. At my very first door I obtained a subscription for <em>The Watchtower. </em>I feel that it has been worth every bit of the tests, criticisms, etc., that I have had to go through. Incidentally, the minister and his wife, who had told me I would lose my mind if I studied with Jehovah’s witnesses, had to leave their church because of friction. P. S. My mind actually has been much improved!”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">No wonder church pews are empty! Why take the trouble to go to church if we are not supposed to understand the Bible? And if we are, it is apparent that we must look elsewhere than to the places of worship where such ministers hold forth.</p>

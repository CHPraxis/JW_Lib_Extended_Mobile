Do You Pray to Saints?
 Many people offer their prayers to “saints,” thinking that, as one well-known religious handbook puts it, this is an “aid and help for obtaining benefits from God.” Yet Jesus said: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me. . . . and whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do.” (John 14:6, 13, Dy) Since Jesus, of all persons, should have known, and since that is what he said about the matter, then why pray through anyone else?

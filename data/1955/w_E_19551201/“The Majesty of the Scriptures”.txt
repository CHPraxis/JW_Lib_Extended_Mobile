“The Majesty of the Scriptures”
 Writing to a friend, the noted French philosopher and author, Jean Jacques Rousseau, once said: “I must confess to you that the majesty of the Scriptures astonishes me. The holiness of the Evangelists speaks to my heart, and has striking characters of truth, and is, moreover, so perfectly inimitable that if it had been the invention of men the inventor would be greater than the greatest heroes.”—The Supremacy of the Bible, page 27.

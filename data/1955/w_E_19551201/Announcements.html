<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In their active service for Jehovah God, his witnesses can truly say, “Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid: for Jehovah, even Jehovah, is my strength and song; and he is become my salvation.” With this assurance and appreciating that the day is here for Jehovah to vindicate his word and name, his witnesses press on in Kingdom service. During December they will offer a volume of the <em>New World Translation </em>of the Scriptures and a book on a contribution of $2.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The report of faithful service to Jehovah God brings joy to persons of good will. During the service year of 1955 Jehovah’s witnesses have piled up an amazing record of theocratic activity because their message, their commission, their work, their doctrine is built on Jehovah’s Sacred Record, the Bible. As compiled in the 1956 <em>Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses, </em>it presents a thrilling picture of a people in modern times fulfilling the commandment of Jesus: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations.” Send 50c for this annual report. The 1956 calendar is also available with the encouraging Bible text of the year beautifully illustrated. They are 25c each, or 20c each if five or more are mailed to one address.</p>

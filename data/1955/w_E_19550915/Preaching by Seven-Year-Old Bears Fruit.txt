Preaching by Seven-Year-Old Bears Fruit
It happened in a country school in Italy. When asked by his schoolteacher to write on a religious theme, a certain young minister of Jehovah would always write about the true worship of Jehovah God. At times he would come home with tears in his eyes because his teacher had torn up his essay. At Christmas time this young minister was required to memorize a poem about Christmas. However, when it came to reciting it in class, before a miniature manger, he stood his ground, giving as the reasons for refusing to do so quotations from Psalm 115 and Exodus 20. The teacher, upon looking up these texts in his Bible, was surprised to note that what this young minister had told him was indeed the truth. Interested in knowing more about this strange religion, the teacher visited the parents, who were only too glad to answer his many questions. He continued to take in knowledge concerning Jehovah and his purposes and as he progressed he overcame the obstacles presenting themselves because of fear of man. Before long he took his stand and dedicated himself to Jehovah and was baptized. Today, not only are he, his wife and his child regular attenders at the congregational meetings of Jehovahâ€™s witnesses, but both he and his wife are zealously preaching the good news from house to house; the fruits borne by the preaching of a seven-year-old.

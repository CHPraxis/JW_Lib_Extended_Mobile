<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Why does </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:9-40:27:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 27:9</strong></a> <strong>attribute the words about the thirty silver pieces for Jesus’ betrayal to the prophet Jeremiah, when, actually, Zechariah recorded the words, at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/38:11:12-38:11:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Zec chapter 11 verse 12</strong></a> <strong>of his prophecy?—N. F., United States.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The name Jeremiah is omitted in some later manuscripts. Some say it was a copyist’s error. Others say it was just a slip on Matthew’s part, saying Jeremiah when he meant Zechariah. None of these explanations seem adequate. We may view as correct the <em>New World Translation’s </em>rendering of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:9-40:27:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 27:9, 10</a>: “Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying: ‘And they took the thirty silver pieces, the price upon the man that was priced, the one on whom some of the sons of Israel set a price, and they gave them for the potter’s field, according to what Jehovah had commanded me.’”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A more probable explanation is this. The order of the prophetic books, as received by the Jews in Matthew’s time, was Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah and the twelve minor prophets. It is so found in the Babylonian Talmud, also at present in the manuscripts of the French and German Jews. <em>The Jewish Encyclopedia, </em>under “Bible Canon,” shows that at one time Jeremiah preceded Ezekiel and Isaiah in the listing of the prophets and that it was later that Isaiah went ahead of Jeremiah. So in Matthew’s time Jeremiah stood first in the listing of the prophets, and since it was the practice of those times to call an entire division of the Bible by the name of the first book in that division, Matthew could say Jeremiah and mean the division that it headed, and which division included the book of Zechariah.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jesus showed that this was the practice, to call an entire division by the first book in that division, when he said, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:44-42:24:44" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 24:44</a> (<em>NW</em>): “All the things written in the law of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms about me must be fulfilled.” When he said Psalms he did not mean just that one book, but all the writings or Hagiographa, of which collection or division Psalms was the first book. And when Jesus said the Prophets he meant that entire division, but sometimes they used the name of the first book in that division to mean the whole section, and then the section would be called just Jeremiah. So in this sense Matthew could refer to Jeremiah and yet mean Zechariah’s words, since Zechariah’s prophecy was in the division that opened with the book of Jeremiah.</p>

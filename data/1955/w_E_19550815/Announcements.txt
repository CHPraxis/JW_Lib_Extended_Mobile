SANCTIFIED FOR THEOCRATIC WARFARE
Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged in a spiritual fight. It is a spiritual warfare to which they are sanctified, being enlisted in a spiritual army and engaged in a sacred conflict. They must, accordingly, partake of the pure truth, render acceptable worship, practice clean living and keep themselves and their surroundings clean. Their “camp” must be holy so that God may see nothing indecent in them, defiling them, in which case he would turn away from them. (Deut. 23:14, NW) Having godly conditions exist among them is essential to their work of bringing the truth to others, commending it by their own righteous and clean course of action. During September Jehovah’s witnesses will present from house to house a book and a booklet on a contribution of 50c. All persons of good will are invited to share in this privileged service.

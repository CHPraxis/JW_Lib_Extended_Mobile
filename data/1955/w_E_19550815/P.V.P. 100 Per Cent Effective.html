<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> The International News Service in March, 1954, reported on the dramatic use of P.V.P. by New York Doctors, which, when put in the veins, “in an emergency, will do the life-saving job of restoring blood volume, fighting shock, and preventing the loss of electrolytes and other precious body fluids just as well as real blood plasma.” Two doctors at two New York hospitals “reported dramatically effective results of P.V.P. transfusions on 224 critically hurt patients. These patients had suffered third-degree burns, lacerated wounds, fractures, penetrating wounds of chest and abdomen, or head injuries. Some had suddenly gone into shock on the operating table or in the maternity’s delivery room. The P.V.P. was transfused, the doctors reported in the <em>New York Journal of Medicine, </em>and ‘prompt and sustained improvement was observed in all cases.’ Of the 224 patients, 220 recovered. None of the four deaths was due to blood loss or shock.”</p>

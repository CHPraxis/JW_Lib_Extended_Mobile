<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">An American archaeologist, Dr. Nelson Glueck, has uncovered an enormous amount of evidence confirming the historical accuracy of the Bible. Of the many scriptures that he has shed archaeological light on, one of the most interesting is the verse that tells of the Jordan Valley in ancient times as follows: “So Lot raised his eyes and saw the whole district of the Jordan, that all of it was a well-watered region before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Jehovah.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:13:10-1:13:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 13:10</a>, <em>New World Trans.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Critics said this was imaginary writing. They said all evidence leads to the conclusion that at the time of Lot, about 2,000 B.C., the Jordan district was an uninhabited desert. No civilization, they said; no irrigation; no farming. “The Valley,” announced George Adam Smith in his famed <em>Historical Geography of the Holy Land, </em>“has never been populous. It has deserved the name of wilderness.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Along came Dr. Glueck, who refused to believe what the so-called authorities said, because his past discoveries had all confirmed the Bible. Into the wilderness to study the wastelands went the archaeologist. There he found shattered pottery and other items that shed light on the wilderness. When he returned he had scientific evidence that startled the critics, evidence that changed the maps of ancient Palestine.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Again his discoveries confirmed the Bible’s accuracy. Declared the archaeologist: “The Jordan Valley was not only one of the first settled sections of the country, but it was also one of the richest parts of all ancient Palestine and Transjordan . . . truly, a Garden of God.”—<em>Coronet, </em>March, 1955.</p>

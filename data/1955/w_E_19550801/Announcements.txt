RECOGNIZING THE THEOCRATIC ORGANIZATION FOR LIFE—1 Sam. 2:30, AS.
Orderly arrangement for the association and co-operative activity of God’s servants is essential to progress in the spreading of the good news of the Kingdom. Such orderly arrangements Jehovah God directs through his theocratic organization. Recognizing his organization, appreciating its theocratic purpose and following its direction will lead to effective service and to life in God’s new world. During August Jehovah’s witnesses will continue putting this principle into practice by working together in bringing people good news of great joy, everywhere. A book and a booklet will be offered from door to door on a contribution of only 50c. Everyone who wants to do this work contact Jehovah’s witnesses in your vicinity.
“THIS MEANS EVERLASTING LIFE”
What can compare with everlasting life? Wealth? Fame? Or personal accomplishment? No, as desirable as may be the attainment of even our fondest imaginations, their brilliance fades as life forces ebb. So, if you would prolong the cherished good things you now know, you must not seek them first; but rather, you must first seek everlasting life. The 320-page book “This Means Everlasting Life” and the 32-page booklet God’s Way Is Love present information of vital import to life seekers. Both will be promptly sent to you, postpaid, for the small contribution of 50c.

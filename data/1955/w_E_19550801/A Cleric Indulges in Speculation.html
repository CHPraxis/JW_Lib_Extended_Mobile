<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> London’s <em>Daily Sketch </em>ran a daily speculation on the subject “If Christ Came Back.” Donald Soper, ex-president of Britain’s Methodist Conference, speculated: “He would have much to say about politics—probably more than about anything else . . . In fact, I believe he would say that his kingdom must first be sought in the political field.” But Christ put his kingdom outside the realm of worldly politics when he emphatically declared: “My kingdom is no part of this world.”</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The sacredness of the Christians’ spiritual warfare demands that each one who engages in it be clean and free from taint. Such personal sanctity will keep the servant of God from bringing reproach upon His name and cause. During the month of September Jehovah’s witnesses will busy themselves in carrying on the right contest of the faith by presenting to the people Bible study aids in the form of a bound book and a booklet on a contribution of 50c.</p>

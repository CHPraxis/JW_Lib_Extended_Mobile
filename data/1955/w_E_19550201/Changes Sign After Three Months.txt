Changes Sign After Three Months
 A full-time minister in the Havana, Cuba, province reports the following experience: “While going from house to house with the message of God’s kingdom, in the town of Jaruco about three months ago, I came to a house that had a blackboard set up with the words: ‘Read the Bible and believe in Christ and your soul will go to heaven. I am a Protestant.’ The householder showed a real interest in the message of God’s kingdom and so a Bible study was started with him using as a textbook ‘Let God Be True’. Yesterday as I came to his home for the study I noticed he had changed the sign on the blackboard. It now read: ‘Read the Bible, learn about the Kingdom of God and live in the New World. I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses.’” Yes, it does not take long for men of good will, lovers of righteousness, to appreciate the truth, and to take their stand and to make public confession of that fact.

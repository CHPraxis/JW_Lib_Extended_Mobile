Which Do You Believe?
 The doctrine of the trinity, according to a noted religious encyclopedia, is that “the Persons are co-eternal and co-equal: all alike are uncreated and omnipotent.” Yet directly to the contrary Jesus said: “The Father is greater than I am”; he called himself “the beginning of the creation by God”; and he told his followers: “I do nothing of my own initiative, but just as the Father taught me I speak these things.” In view of this contradiction, who do you believe knew the most about it, Jesus or the men who developed the trinity doctrine?—John 14:28; Rev. 3:14; John 8:28, NW.

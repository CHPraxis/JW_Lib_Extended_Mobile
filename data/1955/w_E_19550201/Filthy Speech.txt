Filthy Speech
 In today’s world one is continually exposed to dirty minds and filthy speech. Some people cannot listen to conversation without thinking of a dirty story; cannot open their mouths without using vile language. Yet, one cannot revel in smut without getting dirty; so Paul’s instruction at Ephesians 5:3, 4 is worth keeping in mind continually: “Let fornication and uncleanness of every kind or greediness not even be mentioned among you, just as it befits holy people, neither shameful conduct nor foolish talking nor obscene jesting, things which are not becoming, but rather the giving of thanks.” Do you follow this instruction?

Alert to “Incidental” Hunting and Fishing
 Recently the following letter was received from one of Jehovah’s witnesses in Colorado, United States: “Because of preaching the good news of the Kingdom at the place where I work one of my work mates asked if my wife and I would come to his home the following Tuesday evening as he and his wife had some questions they would like to have answered. We went there and answered their questions and they asked us to return the following night, which we did, also the next night. They were so satisfied with our answers that the following Sunday this man turned down his friends who wanted him to go hunting with them and, instead, he and his wife came to the public lecture and stayed for the Watchtower Bible study afterward. Since then they have not missed a meeting. He has already enrolled in the ministry school and is preaching. And all this in only four weeks’ time.

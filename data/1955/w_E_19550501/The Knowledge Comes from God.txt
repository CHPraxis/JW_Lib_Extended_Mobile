The Knowledge Comes from God
 When an Anglican bishop tried to minimize the effect of Jehovah’s witnesses’ district assembly at Luton, England, the local press published both the bishop’s letter and Jehovah’s witnesses’ reply. Among the letters that this subsequently drew from the public was one which read, in part: “I was particularly attracted by the high I.Q. of this vast body of people. Their discipline and organization has to be regarded with admiration. Does this not prove that the organized churches have failed in their duties to the people?” Any knowledge the witnesses might have is not to their personal credit, however, but they say, just as Jesus said when the people marveled at his ability to teach: “What I teach is not mine, but belongs to him that sent me.” (John 7:16, NW) It was the lack of such knowledge on the part of the followers of tradition that so sharply contrasted them with the true worshipers of the first century. The same remains true today.

“Where There Is a Will There Is a Way”
 During the 1955 Watchtower subscription campaign one part-time minister in Michigan obtained 204 subscriptions, and this in spite of the fact that this part-time minister works 75 hours a week in an automobile plant, thus giving him very little time to go from house to house preaching and obtaining subscriptions. However, because of the strenuousness of his job he works at it only an hour at a time and then rests an hour, etc. Instead of resting idly this part-time minister uses the time to preach to his fellow employees all over the plant. And like all mature ministers of Jehovah he is following through with return visits on those from whom he has obtained subscriptions.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>HOLDING FAST THE PUBLIC DECLARATION OF OUR HOPE—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:23-58:10:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Heb. 10:23</strong></a><strong>, NW.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah’s witnesses, having a definite hope, publicly declare what it is and their reason for holding on to that hope. This public declaration is in harmony with the direction of the Word of God, which says, “With the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:10-45:10:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 10:10</a>, <em>NW</em>) The distribution of literature is one form of making this public declaration, while obtaining magazine subscriptions is another. The latter activity will be followed during the month of October as Jehovah’s witnesses and their associates present opportunity to the people at their doors to subscribe for <em>Awake! </em>magazine. With this informative and Scriptural journal new subscribers will receive a premium of three booklets on vital Bible subjects. The subscription rate for one year, 24 issues, is $1. All may share in this activity.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Thirty-six years ago a spiritual awakening began among true Christians that ushered in a “golden age” of blessings and spiritual insight into world conditions.

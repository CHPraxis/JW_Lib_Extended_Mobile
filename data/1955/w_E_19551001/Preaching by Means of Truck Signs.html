<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> In Italy two Christian ministers who are also natural brothers are engaged in a trucking business that requires them to make long trips from one end of the Italian peninsula to the other. Alert to their opportunities to preach they painted on one side of their truck in large gold-colored letters the text at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a> regarding this good news of the Kingdom being preached in all the inhabited earth, and on the other side of the truck the words: “If you want to avoid being deceived and want to know the truth of Jehovah God’s purposes, turn to Jehovah’s witnesses.” On a recent trip from southern to northern Italy they were stopped by four different highway police patrols who had become curious because of these signs. They had opportunity to preach. They enjoy many such experiences.</p>

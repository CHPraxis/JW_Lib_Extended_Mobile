Zeal for Improving Service
 Jehovah’s witnesses’ anxiety to participate in house-to-house field witnessing and their determination to improve their personal abilities in this work frequently amaze people who either have not investigated the truth to see its importance or have not participated in the witnessing work to know of its joys. The determination to improve such service was well illustrated by a 70-year-old brother who is now attending school to learn how to read and write so that he can better present the good news at the doors. At the time of his immersion at a recent assembly he was in the third grade. This zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses for His service continues to illustrate their faith and to warm the hearts of their Christian brothers worldwide.

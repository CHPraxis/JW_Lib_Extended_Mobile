<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> One of Jehovah’s witnesses who works in a factory in France was being continually ridiculed by his foreman because of being a witness of Jehovah. One day the parish priest visited the factory. The foreman lost no time in calling the priest over and saying mockingly, “You have before you a witness of Jehovah, a heathen.” However, the priest replied, “You are mistaken, Monsieur. Jehovah’s witnesses are not heathen. They are Christians like us, and Jehovah is God’s name. You should not make fun of Jehovah’s witnesses, for they have strong faith.” The foreman was stupefied, and promptly walked out. The priest turned to the young witness and whispered, “When I preach, the workers don’t believe me. They say I do it to make money. But you can speak to them. You are a worker like them, and they will listen to you.” Incidentally, from that day on, the foreman has never ridiculed the witness.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> Today’s so-called Christianity is too often a “go and-sit” affair, rather than a “get-out-and-do” matter. Is yours a religion of sitters or of workers? Is your religion strengthening enough that you will take your own time to get up and go out regularly to tell your neighbors why it is important? The Bible says a great deal about strength and zeal and faith. Jesus said in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:7-40:10:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 10:7</a>: “Go, preach”; today’s churchgoers have changed it to: “Sit, listen.” Which do you do?</p>

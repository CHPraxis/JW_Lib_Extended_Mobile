<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> “This good news of the kingdom will be preached,” said Jesus, and a great part of that joyful preaching work is done by the full-time pioneer ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses. At this past summer’s district assembly in San Antonio, Texas, one eleven-year-old vacation pioneer told of thirty-three young publishers from eight to fifteen years of age who entered that service from just one congregation. As he spoke a parade started across the field—yes, the thirty-two others walked in front of the platform. This youngster was followed by a 78-year-old publisher, active in the service for forty years, who described her joys in serving as a vacation pioneer, and reported how the youngsters had broken down prejudice and paved the way for many back-calls and home Bible studies. Many thousands of such people today are living examples of the psalmist’s words: “Both young men and virgins; old men and children: let them praise the name of Jehovah.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:12-19:148:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 148:12, 13</a>, <em>AS.</em></p>

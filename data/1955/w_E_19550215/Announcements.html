<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>WHICH ONES WILL YOU ATTEND?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The 1953 assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in Yankee Stadium, New York, had an attendance of 165,829 persons—an amazing increase of <em>46,000 per cent </em>in the mere 60 years since 360 persons had attended Jehovah’s witnesses’ first modern convention in Chicago in 1893. Why such tremendous growth? Among the many reasons are the facts that this is the time for the restoration of pure worship earth-wide; that such assemblies are outstandingly strengthening to the Christian, and that they are specifically commanded by Jehovah God. There still is time for you to plan to attend one or more of the series of assemblies that will be held not just in North America but also throughout Europe this year. You will be strengthened and encouraged by the zeal of your brothers in other lands, and you can provide that same encouragement for them. Plan <em>now </em>as to which of the following assemblies you will attend:</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">The qualifications of the right kind of ministers are set forth in the Holy Scriptures. Faith, knowledge, diligence, love and endurance are basic requirements. The “right kind of minister of Christ Jesus, one nourished with the words of the faith and of the right teaching” goes to the people, looking for those who are mild-tempered and teachable. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:6-54:4:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:6</a>, <em>NW</em>) He makes diligent effort to help all who have an appreciation of Bible truth and want to obtain a knowledge by preaching to them orally and endeavoring to leave printed Bible sermons to assist interested ones further. In this regard a foremost instrument used by the right kind of ministers today is the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine. A year’s subscription for it with three booklets containing printed Bible sermons will be offered by the right kind of ministers engaged in house-to-house preaching during March for $1, the annual rate. Will you join with the Lord in his work as a right kind of minister?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="ss"><strong>PRECIOUS POSSESSIONS</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The Word of God is one of man’s most precious possessions. Without it we would not know of God’s purposes for mankind, nor what he would have us do to please and serve him. This was pointed out by his Son, who said: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>, <em>NW</em>) To gain knowledge that leads to life requires study of this precious possession. And when studying and reading the Bible, naturally one desires to absorb all the information that he can, realizing how essential it is for everlasting life. Have you obtained the modern-language <em>New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures, </em>Volume I (Genesis to Ruth), and the <em>New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures? </em>You will find them precious possessions, enabling you to read and study your Bible with greater understanding. Cloth-bound editions are available at $1.50 each; leather-bound de luxe editions at $5 each. Send for yours now.</p>

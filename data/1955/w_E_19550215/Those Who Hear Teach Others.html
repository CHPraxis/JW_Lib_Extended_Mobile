<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> An outstanding characteristic of true Christianity, yet one that is very frequently missing in modern-day religions, is that those who learn will themselves go out and teach others. This was especially evident at the district assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses held world-wide last year. In Korea many speakers who could competently edify their brothers had never even been before microphones before. In Indonesia the missionaries in attendance reported being heartened at seeing so many of the local brothers able to deliver the assembly speeches and giving good, mature counsel. And in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia, when an African brother gave the baptism discourse in Cishona another translated it into Cinyanja, and a third rendered it into English for the benefit of the European brothers present. Not the missionaries, but the African brothers themselves handled such duties. Thus, in following the principle of early Christianity, the truths are committed “to faithful men” who, in turn, become “adequately qualified to teach others,” and are zealous in doing so.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:2-55:2:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:2</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>

<p><span class="font2">YEARBOOK</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font8">EHOVAH is the Giver of life. He also gives knowledge to man as to how he can attain life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses have the hope of eternal life and are grateful for the knowledge they have of how life can be theirs unendingly through Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. They want to live, for with life they can worship the Sovereign Ruler of the universe. (Ps. 118:17) The majority of human creatures do not want to die and return to the dust, for in the grave where man goes there is no knowledge or wisdom, nor can the dead do any work. “For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.” (Eccl. 9:5, 10, AS) Life, living in God’s new world, is the hope held out for man. Jehovah’s witnesses have hope in that new system of things, and this faith and hope are based on their knowledge of Jehovah’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s words have power. “For the word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword.” (Heb. 4:12, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font8">With this truth in mind we should want to know what Jehovah says at any time, if it is within our finding out. We should certainly want to study his sayings. When God says something we should listen, because what he says has a tremendous effect on animate and inanimate things. “By faith we understand that the systems of things were put in order by God’s word, so that what is beheld</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">came to be out of things that do not appear.” (Heb. 11:3, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> David, a man who was after God’s own heart, appreciated the power of Jehovah’s word, for he stated: “By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.” (Ps. 33:6, AS) Man cannot conceive the power in the Creator’s words. It is written that “power belongeth unto God” and “the Almighty ... is excellent in power.” (Ps. 62:11; Job 37:23, AS) With all the power in heaven and earth as Sovereign Ruler, he can certainly make his Word to stand and never return to him unfulfilled. Hence he himself says: “So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.” (Isa. 55:11) Words so powerful we should study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Jesus walked this earth he spoke the words of his Father in the heavens. He had faith in Jehovah’s words. His course of life was based on his Father’s promises. It was Jesus himself who said: “The sayings that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. But there are some of you that do not believe.” (John 6:63, 64; 8:26-28, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> It is a fact that the majority of humans who lay claim to being Christian set themselves up as judges of God’s words and they individually decide whether certain texts of the Bible are true and can be accepted or whether they should be discarded. Their wisdom they set above that of Jehovah God himself. They class themselves with those who do not believe. Marginal reading of John 6:63 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(NW)</span><span class="font8"> makes Jesus’ expression even stronger: “The sayings that I have spoken to you </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">mean</span><span class="font8"> spirit and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">mean</span><span class="font8"> life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is no time to push aside the Word of God and say: “I’ll look into that some other time. I have yet many years to live; so I’ll do it later when convenient.” Man reasons that there is so much of importance in this world to care for that he does not have time for the ‘old’ Bible. He wants to keep up to date. He thinks that accumulating riches will make him enjoy life in his later years. But he may never enjoy his savings and he can easily lose out on living eternally. At one time Jesus illustrated this: “The land of a certain rich man produced well. Consequently, he began reasoning within himself, saying: ‘What shall I do, now that I have nowhere to gather my crops?’ So he said: ‘I will do this: I will tear down my storehouses and build bigger ones, and there I will gather all my grain and all my good things, and I will say to my soul: “Soul, you have many good things laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.’’ ’ But God said to him: ‘Unreasonable one, this night they are demanding your soul from you. Who, then, is to have the things you stored up?’ So it goes with the man that lays up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.”—Luke 12:16-21, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To be rich toward God, to hold fast your hope, you must study the precious Word of God and continuously make public declaration of it. Anyone having the hope of life in the new world must boldly and thoughtfully tell out this good news, making it known to everyone who will listen. “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness,” said Jesus, because words so preached would be words of life. (Matt. 24:14, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> Faith in the true God on the part of any individual comes by hearing the words of God. “However, how will they call upon him in whom they have not put faith? How, in turn, will they put faith in him of whom they have not heard? How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach?” (Rom. 10:14, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font8">One who knows the words of eternal life must teach them so that others can hear and so that those who do hear can have faith. Then these in turn will study God’s Word like the teacher. “Preach the word” is the admonition of that faithful follower of Christ Jesus who knew that faith is built on accurate knowledge. (2 Tim. 4:2) To live in the new world one must be filled with the knowledge of God. If you could not be filled with the knowledge of God, then you would have to say that God is not a good teacher. True Christians realize, however, that they will “all be taught by Jehovah.” (John 6:45, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW;</span><span class="font8"> Isa. 54:13, AS) Learning from such a wonderful Teacher you will not want to keep the knowledge to yourself, “for with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.”—Rom. 10:10, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our concern, then, is with ourselves, making ourselves a group of good preachers. Paul urged: “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.” (1 Tim. 4:16, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> Wisely, then, each of us determines to study God’s Word the Bible, thus paying attention to ourselves and assuring ourselves of everlasting life. At the same time, by studying the Bible diligently we are able to pay constant attention to our teaching; we can be sure that that which we tell others is the truth. As Christians we must follow Jehovah’s instruction. “Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life. Enter not into the path of the wicked, and walk not in the way of evil men. Avoid it, pass not by it; turn from it, and pass on.” (Prov. 4:13-15, AS) How much more clearly can it be stated? Here it says instruction is our life! Better, then, that we pay attention to instruction, learning how to live.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>‘A TIME SUCH AS NEVER WAS’</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Ours is a very wicked day, the worst in all history. On every side of us we see hatred, strife, war. Nearly every man’s hand seems to be against his neighbor. The world is filled with selfishness, fear. Such are products of a mad, hateful world whose god is Satan the Devil. Yes, God’s Word says that Satan is the god of this system of things. On this vital subject Jehovah’s witnesses are trying to enlighten the people’s minds. At the same time we hold out to peoples of all nations the hope that Jehovah holds out: His kingdom, the only hope for mankind. This old world’s inhabitants need instruction so that they can turn from the wicked course that will lead to death. &quot;‘If, now, the good news we declare is in fact veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing, among whom the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through.” (2 Cor. 4:3, 4, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> Today as never before the light is shining through in the message that Jehovah’s witnesses regularly take to willing listeners in all nations of the world. Hundreds of thousands are listening. More and more are taking in knowledge and instruction and thus starting on the road to life everlasting. This is the time for the great witness to be given as Jesus foretold: “And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.” (Matt. 24:14, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> Will you share in this great work of “announcing Jehovah’s kingdom”? You can, and you will want to if you make it your business to heed instruction from God’s Word and hold fast to that instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now is the time when those desiring to live in Jehovah’s new world must stick together. Privately studying your Bible is necessary, but jointly studying with those of like precious faith is even more necessary. Since the words of God, as set forth in the Bible, are so powerful that by holding on to their instruction life can be gained, what should a believer in God’s Word do? He should first study, then talk about that which he studies. To gain knowledge one must work. To retain that knowledge he must use it. You will want others to know what you know, therefore you will talk. As Jehovah’s chief witness Christ Jesus preached the good news and brought salvation to mankind. But now he is not with us in the flesh as he was nineteen hundred years ago when he led the apostles and set them the proper example. “We are therefore ambassadors substituting for Christ, as though God were making entreaty through us. As substitutes for Christ we beg: ‘Become reconciled to God.’ ” (2 Cor. 5:20, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> Those Words Paul addressed to the congregation at Corinth. Today Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere are a united congregation of Jehovah God. Unitedly, jointly they have a work to do, that is, to preach to all the world, to show all lovers of righteousness the way to life. Every one of Jehovah’s witnesses must keep alive to the truth as expressed in His Word, because it is necessary for every individual in his theocratic organization to think as Jehovah thinks. He being their Teacher and his Word being their textbook, they will think alike, work alike and worship alike. Hence their sticking together in Jehovah’s theocratic organization means for them their everlasting life. Were any individual in this New World society to try to go alone, he soon would see that he never could succeed or realize his hope in life. That individual never would get into the new world. So individually each one of us must stay in Jehovah’s New World society and at the same time be active as a part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Clearly now Jehovah God through Christ Jesus is gathering together all who are of good will and who love righteousness. (Zeph. 2:1-3) This he is doing before his battle at Armageddon. Those who now lay hold on instruction will flee from this old world and get into the new system of things. With so many of the “other sheep” being gathered into the New World society it is essential that Jehovah’s witnesses must get to know one another, especially within each of their congregations. They must learn of the benefits of that congregation and what it will do for them. Jehovah’s witnesses soon learn that it is essential for them to go to every meeting arranged for them for their education and instruction. To get life they must constantly seek knowledge and learn more of Jehovah and his purposes. They must fully appreciate they cannot get along without his written Word. Also, they wifi learn that they cannot get along without Jehovah’s organization. Their sticking together, their jointly studying God’s Word, makes Jehovah’s witnesses very vigorous. It sets them apart distinctly from all others in this world. They truly are Bible students; they constantly practice the teachings of God’s Word.—John 13:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Let us hold fast the public declaration of our hope without wavering, for he is faithful that promised. And let us consider one another to incite to love and right works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.” (Heb. 10:2325, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> This sound counsel has been talked about many times. Probably all in your congregation have used this scripture, either at service meetings or at the theocratic ministry school, pointing out how necessary it is for every one of Jehovah’s servants to assemble with his brothers, now more than ever because we are living at the end of this old system of things. Let us here examine this text to see what vital force there is in it and how it must affect us in our daily lives.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>“PUBLIC DECLARATION OF OUR HOPE”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">This scripture that says “Let us hold fast the public declaration of our hope” does not mean merely doing this by going from house to house witnessing day by day throughout our lives. Many other scriptures definitely prove we must go from home to home preaching the good news of the Kingdom. That is a point beyond dispute. But what important fact is brought to our mind in this text under consideration? Does its statement —“Let us hold fast the public declaration of our hope without wavering”—apply to our house-to-house witnessing? Have in mind the context. What is Paul talking about here when addressing the Hebrews? He tells them to make a public declaration, but where? The context shows it must be in the congregation of Jehovah’s people. There is a definite reason, too, for making this declaration and coming together in the congregation to do it. It must be a declaration that will incite to love, to help others in right works and to encourage one another in the Christian ministry. By doing these things all will be helped to remain united, to stay in the organization. Our congregation meetings themselves provide positive assistance to others. Yes, it is our public declaration of our hope in the congregation that does much for others of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The New World society consists of many congregations scattered all over the earth. Many are in English-speaking communities. Others are among Germans, French, Japanese; in fact, assemblies are held in more than a hundred tongues in all parts of the world. But regardless of what language is spoken Jehovah’s witnesses must come together in congregation meetings. Every dedicated member of the New World society must regularly assemble with others and get the benefit of his brothers’ knowledge as well as give to his brothers the benefit of his knowledge. Before one makes his public declaration in the congregation of God’s people it is essential for him to engage in private study. But that is not all. After the private study you must meet with the congregation and make public declaration of what you have learned. If one tries to go alone without the organization, it will be only a matter of time until he will be in want; and if he stays away from the congregation too long, he will die of starvation for spiritual food. A Christian witness of Jehovah cannot get out of line for New World living and survive for the new world. After one has made his day-by-day and week-by-week private study he should make his ‘advancement manifest to all persons’ by expressing before the congregation what he believes so that the other members of the congregation thereby may be incited to love and right works and encouraged to greater activity.—1 Tim. 4:15, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Daily reading and study of the Bible are needful. Bible study aids also should be read, such as the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> magazine and books distributed by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society; for every reasonable observer knows there are no other publications like these. All these printed products will help the truth seeker to get a broader understanding of the Word and purposes of Jehovah so that he will be able better to express his hope at the congregation meetings. By filling the mind with divine instruction and truth it will help the witness of Jehovah to prepare his talks for the theocratic ministry school that he attends; it will aid him in sharing in the service meeting and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> study meeting, and it will help him in preparing short sermons to use from house to house. God’s Word says we are to make a “public declaration of our hope.” Ask yourself: ‘How many times have I expressed myself in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> study meeting during the last six months, or the last year?’ It is very important that in these studies each one speak up as he has opportunity, because upon each one rests a twofold obligation. First, you have opportunity to make public declaration of your hope; and, second, the expression affects those who are listening and should incite them to love and the right kind of works. This you can do when you do not forsake assembling with your brothers in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another point: “Keep testing whether you are in the faith, keep proving what you yourselves are. Or do you not recognize that Jesus Christ is in union with you? Unless you are disapproved. I truly hope you will come to know we are not disapproved.” (2 Cor. 13:5, 6, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> Under that wholesome counsel by Paul it is very necessary for each one of us to look after himself. It is not just a matter of saying, ‘I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses,’ or one’s coming to a meeting and there sitting quietly. It really is a matter of inspecting yourself, testing or proving yourself by answering questions in public, voluntarily or when called upon. How can anyone say he is one of Jehovah’s witnesses if he does not attend and participate in the meetings of true worshipers of Jehovah? (John 4:23) How can he say, even to himself, that he believes the truth of God’s Word if he never expresses that truth to his brothers? One might be born a Catholic and be baptized into that religious cult when he is but a few days old and be called a Catholic for the rest of his life. Or he may be born of Protestant parents or Moslem parents or Jewish parents, and the name of his parents’ religion will go with him the rest of his life unless he personally decides to progress. But as for Jehovah’s witnesses, each must make a decision for himself. It is not for any parent to decide for his child to make a dedication to Jehovah God through Jesus Christ. Each must personally prove that he is one of Jehovah’s witnesses through public expression of his faith and hope in Jehovah’s new world before the congregation of Jehovah’s people. It is your active belief that will incite others to greater activity; therefore the knowledge you have gained should be expressed aloud before the congregation for the benefit of all. —1 John 4:17, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Needful it is, then, to keep testing ourselves, keep on proving what we ourselves are, as to our faith. We can make mistakes, we can get out of line with Jehovah’s principles of truth and righteousness, we can drift, think on wrong things; and, not having read and studied the Word of God enough, we can get to forming our own philosophies on life. Individuals may even go so far as to express what they think God himself should be like and what he should be doing. But one knows that he cannot become acquainted with another unless he talks to him or reads about or otherwise communicates with him. No one can come to know God unless he listens to him through his written Word. In private study you can take in much information about God, but by attending congregation meetings your advance study, having equipped you, enables you to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">express</span><span class="font8"> your belief and hope, to benefit others. It is very unprofitable for a Christian witness of Jehovah to forsake regularly assembling with other dedicated Christians. Think of the harm he does to himself and also to others. He is not incited to love and right works, for he does not hear his fellow workers comment and he is not there to give comment to help them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark149"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark150"></a>“WE MAY HAVE FREENESS OF SPEECH”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s visible organization has arranged for weekly </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> studies in every congregation throughout the world. It is advisable to attend these. Other meetings, too, such as the theocratic ministry school and the service meeting, yield a rich blessing and help one to hold on to instructions. Whenever you attend these meetings do not sit back and feel that it is so much better for any other person to express himself. In your simple, pleasant manner and with, probably, hesitant speech, even you can incite others to love and right works. You </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font8"> encourage others by your right expression. Were you ever in a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> study where a brother or sister you have been working with for months spoke up for the first time? It gave you a little thrill to hear this one speak, did it not? After the meeting you very likely complimented that one. To you it was a joy and a real pleasure to hear that person speak. It encouraged you to do greater works, as Paul said; and so, by making public declaration of your hope, you will be inciting and also be incited yourself to love and right works. Why not, then, give the other persons that same sense of joy, that same pleasure you had, by letting them regularly hear you speak in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> study? Without question they will appreciate your comment. You may be older in the truth and so they will be happy to hear what you have to say. Or you may be new in the truth and then they will rejoice to see your progress in understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To express ourselves is both practical and necessary, for to a great extent we really do not know what we do believe until we start talking or start writing, that is to say, communicating. If we never express ourselves, then our thoughts never come into a form to benefit others or even ourselves. Some excuse themselves by saying that if they speak they may give an incorrect or misleading answer. Do you keep quiet because you might make a mistake? Even your making that mistake is to your benefit. How so? Because then someone else will give the correct answer and, additionally, the chairman will express himself and point out the right answer and finally the paragraph will be read to complete the answer to the question. For a moment you may be a little ashamed, but you did express to the congregation what you believe. You found out you were wrong and so by studying along with other members of the congregation and by expressing yourself you discovered your error. By keeping quiet you may never have known of your error. So now you have the opportunity of changing your thinking. You want the right ideas in your head, and now you have changed some wrong thought and have substituted the correct one. No worshiper of Jehovah wants to go from house to house talking about Jehovah’s purposes and telling householders the wrong things. So, then, your brothers helped you to correct the error you made in your public declaration in their hearing. Do not let the error you think you might express hold you back from speaking. Your mistake may sharpen the correct answer in the minds of others. If one did all his own thinking and never consulted anyone else or expressed himself to others, he never would be able to test himself. That underscores the value of “freeness of speech”; and that is why we have the admonition, “Keep testing whether you are in the faith, keep proving what you yourselves are.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We must advance, increase, grow up in Jehovah’s organization; we cannot stand still. Through the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> magazine and all companion publications, as well as through the congregation, circuit and district servants, the Watch Tower Society constantly stresses that we must study. Serious study is hard work. But it does yield happy results. It takes effort to search the Scriptures, but you know that the knowledge gained spells out life. Taking in knowledge of Jehovah God and of his Son, said Jesus, means everlasting life. (John 17:3) One who wants life must listen to the Giver of life, Jehovah, for it is written: “Most truly I say to you, He that hears my word and believes him that sent me has everlasting life, and he does not come into judgment but has passed over from death to life.” (John 5:24, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> Everlasting life is due, then, to hearing the Word and believing Jehovah God, for it was God who sent</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christ Jesus; and by having this faith we are able to pass over from death to life. By assembling ourselves together for making public declaration of our hope we continue learning and growing, advancing to maturity.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark152"></a>‘CONSIDER ONE ANOTHER, TRUSTING IN JEHOVAH’</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Paul, writing to the Hebrews, wanted them to know </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">more</span><span class="font8"> about Christ Jesus. He wrote: “Concerning him we have much to say and hard to be explained, since you have become dull in your hearing. For, indeed, although you ought to be teachers in view of the time, you again need someone to teach you from the beginning the first principles of the sacred pronouncements of God, and you have become such as need milk, not solid food. For everyone that partakes of milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But solid food belongs to mature people, to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” (Heb. 5:11-14, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> A vigorous Christian himself, Paul wanted these Hebrews to advance and use their perceptive powers. In view of the time they were in the truth they should have been teachers, but they did not want to express themselves for enriching others. They preferred to take life easy and just feed on the milk of the Word and just remember the simple things they learned when they first came into Jehovah’s organization without becoming acquainted with the whole Word of God and taking the solid food that belongs to mature people. Any dedicated Christian witness of Jehovah should want to grow up and make advancement in the New World society. When one gains knowledge of Jehovah’s marvelous purposes it should fill him with vigor and give him vitality. Energized, he should want to help others to gain the same valuable information he has. Therefore he should show an aptness to teach, giving out accurate knowledge so that others, too, can lay hold on instruction. When he really grows to love his brothers he will want to make a public declaration in the congregation to incite them to love and right works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A great change must take place in one’s thinking when he becomes a Christian. There must be a making over of the mind. To quit the old way of thinking is necessary. A new form of instruction must be put on. That is why Paul wrote: “Quit being fashioned after this system of things but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and complete will of God.” (Rom. 12:2, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font8">Every one of us has been born in the wicked, delinquent, fearful old world and we have been trained in the old world’s way to think selfishly, as human leaders want their followers or subjects to think. From childhood we have been taught to hate other nations, peoples and races and to fear them and suspect them, thus building up barriers between certain persons and ourselves. This wrong thought was very sharply expressed in one of the popular stage successes (“South Pacific”). In that play, a young army man, distressed because he had fallen in love with a young girl of another race and nationality, sings about ‘your being taught to hate and fear; that you have got to be taught from year to year, having it drummed into your dear little ear—carefully taught to be afraid of people whose eyes are ugly made and whose skin is a different shade; carefully taught before it’s too late, before you’re six or seven or eight, to hate all the people your relatives hate.’ And that is true of the old world. Talk aplenty there is about brotherly love and the brotherhood of man and world brotherhood; but those who have been carefully taught according to this old world’s untheocratic theories prefer segregation, class distinction, the caste system. How necessary it is, then, for a reasonable person to make his mind over, to quit thinking like the old world and, instead, take instruction from Almighty God! God’s Book, the Bible, teaches us to love as he loves. Love casts out fear. “He that docs not love has not come to know God, because God is love.” “There is no fear in love, but perfect love throws fear outside, because fear exercises a restraint. Indeed, he that is under fear has not been made perfect in love. As for us, we love, because he first loved us.” (1 John 4:8, 18, 19, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> When one lives by the accurate knowledge he receives from Jehovah’s Word, how different his life becomes! But with these new ideas, these newly found truths from God’s Word, Jehovah’s witnesses must go forward to teach others so that all who eventually choose to become part of the New World society will think as Jehovah thinks and grow to maturity.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark153"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>HOW VALUABLE IS THE BIBLE?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Every one of us can become alive to the wonderful joys and blessings that Jehovah’s witnesses have if we take the time to receive instruction, associate with Jehovah’s witnesses, express ourselves and advance to maturity in the congregation of God. Sometimes it is said that Jehovah’s witnesses have their own Bible, but when one reads the pages of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> he sees that many translations are constantly cited and quoted from. Jehovah’s witnesses urge that every person read his own copy of the Holy Bible daily. It matters not which version of the Bible is read, whether the Catholic </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Douay,</span><span class="font8"> or the Protestant </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">King James</span><span class="font8"> or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard,</span><span class="font8"> or any other Bible version in German, French, Spanish, Hebrew or Tagalog. No matter which rendering of the Holy Scriptures you read you can learn the truth. None, generally speaking, are so far off from the original meaning expressed in the Hebrew and Greek texts as to sidetrack the reader and send him into error. However, there are good and better translations. Such are available for selection; and when you can get a better one to read and study, it will be to your advantage. It will aid you to gain a clearer understanding, probably a quicker understanding, of the marvelous purposes of Jehovah. His Book, the Bible, is one you should be reading every day throughout the entire year, and year after year. It is an inexhaustible fountain of refreshing water, truth. It never becomes dry. It is always deliciously fresh, tasty. Do not be choosy in your reading, but starting with Genesis proceed through to the last book, Revelation. You will find the rarest gems of truth, marvelous instruction, sound counsel; for all this is the written word of the Supreme Sovereign, the living God Jehovah. For us, dwellers upon this little earth of his vast universe, he provided that Book so that we might be properly instructed and trained as true followers of his Christ.—Eph. 4:31, 32; 1 John 1:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Centuries ago when Pilgrim fathers came to America’s shores the Bible was their principal book. Often now we hear or read of those bygone days when persons used their Bible daily in nearly every home. It affected the upbringing of their children, it broadened their knowledge and understanding, it helped to keep them close to the living God. They did not measure its contents with a yardstick supplied by self-serving, hostile critics or prejudiced scoffers. Indeed, the Giver’s Book, the Bible, is the one volume that has solid food for thought, excellent instruction on living and on proper behavior of oneself. Today the Bible is far more valuable to us than it was to those of past days; for all things written aforetime were written for our instruction now in these days of great trial. (Rom. 15:4; 1 Cor. 10:11) The Bible is for our comfort, and in reading the Scriptures we are able to have hope.—1 Pet. 1:3; 2 Pet. 1:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Do you appreciate that when you hear or read the Bible you are actually listening to, giving attention to, Jehovah God, as he communicates his thoughts to you? He is not going to talk to you in a dream. He will not send you a special messenger, an angel, to give you private instruction. Through his written Word he now is communicating to us. “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.” (2 Tim. 3:16, 17, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> It is useless to look around for advice and instruction from any other source.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark155"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark156"></a>WHY REGULARLY STUDY AND PREACH GOD’S TRUTH?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">No one can be just satisfied with a mere general knowledge of God’s truth. (Psalm 117) In one’s Christian activity he must leave the elementary things and advance to maturity. That is why Paul said: “For this reason, now that we have left the elementary doctrine about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying a foundation again, namely, repentance from dead works, and faith toward God, the teaching on baptisms and the laying on of the hands, the resurrection of the dead and everlasting judgment. And this we will do, if God indeed permits.” (Heb. 6:1-3, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font8">Once we have taken the forward step of being one of God’s slaves, it is not a matter of becoming just a ‘Sunday Christian.’ It must be an everyday affair. The dedicated Christian witness of Jehovah must demonstrate that he is truly an industrious minister and cannot be interested in merely gaining knowledge for himself but he must see the responsibility of maintaining his own integrity through aiding others by sensibly preaching the good news to them. (1 Pet. 3:15) Every additional responsibility should be welcomed by all in the New World society. One should not be satisfied with the idea that he will ‘let well enough alone,’ but, rather, will be progressive and eagerly desire to advance. “For God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name, in that you have ministered to the holy ones and continue ministering. But we desire each one of you to show the same industriousness so as to have the full assurance of the hope down to the end, in order that you may not become sluggish, but be imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.” (Heb. 6:10-12, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> No matter how long we have been walking in the truth, we must continue to preach God’s Word, the Bible, and study the things he has provided for us to study through his organization for his purposes. Otherwise, if we do not keep pace with the organization, sluggishness will overtake us. (1 John 2:6) The Word of God makes us alive, gives us vigor, and we have zeal peculiar to Jehovah’s house. A good Christian witness will always be an industrious person. He will be found regularly at the meetings, at the service centers, and taking the lead in gratefully expressing the truth to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Do you ever feel spiritually weak? Examine yourself. Very likely you have not been going to meetings regularly. You lack association with your brothers. When one begins missing meetings one is withdrawing from Jehovah’s organization, and that is when one begins to become weak. He ceases to express himself or make a public declaration of his hope. In these last days of the Devil’s organization this is no time to take chances. All must be strong in powers of understanding, and the only way we can remain strong is to study Jehovah’s Word and meet with Jehovah’s people. “Brothers, do not become young children in powers of understanding, but be babes as to evil; yet become full-grown in powers of understanding.” (1 Cor. 14:20, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> The godly advice is that as far as the wicked things of this old system are concerned be like children, innocent toward such things and knowing only very partly or incompletely about the evil things, so as to avoid such. Do not associate in such company. But, on the other hand, when it comes to powers of understanding, do not be children; be full grown, mature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One who holds on to the instruction from Jehovah will be a spiritually-minded person. He will think correctly, divinely, like God. Spiritual-mindedness is opposed to carnal-mindedness. To be carnally-minded means to be thinking of the things of this world, to be carrying on the wicked practices of the Devil’s organization. To be spiritually-minded is to be the opposite of carnally-minded. Life and our gaining it are the important things to have in mind. Jesus had these things in mind when he was upon earth and he told his apostles: “Stop being anxious about your souls as to what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your bodies as to what you will wear. Does not the soul mean more than food and the body than clothing?” (Matt. 6:25, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> By far the majority of the people in the world are interested in only these things that pertain to themselves and not how they can benefit others. This is the Gentiles’ or selfish way of looking at it. In his discussion with his apostles Jesus told us that there was a far greater thing to think about, the spiritual thing, the Kingdom. He said: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his [Jehovah’s] righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.” (Matt. 6:33, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> Do not question that Jehovah God does not know our needs. He does, and he can care for them. He does not want us to be worried about them all the time. He wants us to concentrate on the greater thing, Jehovah’s kingdom that will mean life to men of good will. When we follow Jesus, then we will want to “take fast hold of instruction; let her not go.”—Prov. 4:13, 48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Taking in the right kind of knowledge is important to our spiritual-mindedness and our gaining life. Jesus, when praying with his disciples, set forth the formula for happy endless living, saying to Jehovah: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (John 17:3, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> In this prayer Jesus was very anxious to see his followers take in this true knowledge of the Sovereign Ruler of the universe and to understand why he sent his Son to earth, for with this information one can know the way to everlasting living. From this we can see, then, how essential it is for every individual dedicated to Jehovah God to be busy in the congregation of Jehovah’s people. Meeting attendance is a “must.” Meeting attenders must speak up, communicate, express their minds, and they must keep spiritually-minded. This is not difficult, Paul says, adding: “For I am longing to see you, that I may impart some spiritual gift to you in order for you to be made firm; or, rather, that there may be an interchange of encouragement among you, by each one through the other’s faith, both yours and mine.” (Rom. 1:11,12, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> This spiritual gift Paul is talking about seems to be bestowed upon Jehovah’s people just through communication, by one’s expressing himself as others listen, by the individual’s telling out his faith—by Paul’s expressing his faith to and interchanging thought with others. In other words, talking about Jehovah’s truth is rounding out spiritual-mindedness. (Ps. 145:9-12) This fits in with the thought that we should make a “public declaration of our hope without wavering, for he is faithful that promised.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our experiences in the field, our association with the brothers, our discussing the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font8">articles, our going to the theocratic ministry school, our having a part in the service meeting, our attending and participating in the activity of the service center and our attendance at public meetings; all of this is spiritually sustaining, all this discussion, communicating and interchange of ideas is encouraging, spiritually strengthening, upbuilding to faith, as Paul says, “both yours and mine.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society publishes the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span><span class="font8"> during the forepart of every year, reporting the past year’s activities of God’s servants throughout the world. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font8"> also sets forth a text for consideration for each day, with a comment on each daily text. How grand it is for families to read the text each day, discuss it, interchange their thinking about it and thus show to one another their faith, making a declaration of their hope; and then sum it up by reading the published comment on that text! All of this is spiritually upbuilding and helps us hold fast to instruction, for this is life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Spiritual-mindedness is very important in the life of the Christian, but when one does not study or attend meetings of his brothers he will soon feel lost among his brothers when he does come occasionally, and he will even feel out of place when his brothers call on him. Why should that be? It is because he is losing his spiritual-mindedness, because he is no longer making a public declaration of the things he believes. He is letting his faith weaken and die out, and he is slipping back into the old world. The greater part of the congregation that Paul called upon was slipping backward, and so to them he wrote: “Brothers, I was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshly men, as to babes in Christ. I fed you milk, not something to eat, for you were not yet strong enough. In fact, neither are you strong enough now, for you are yet fleshly. For whereas there are jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and are you not walking as men do? For when one says: *1 belong to Paul,’ but another says: ‘I to Apollos,’ are you not simply men?” —1 Cor. 3:1-4, MW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jealousy and strife now fill the old world. Love for God and love for the brothers are the principal teachings of the Bible. (Mark 12:29-31; John 15:11-15) Keeping the teaching of God’s Word does not direct us to be following any man, as did the Corinthians who were following Paul or Apollos, making a choice of an individual visible associate. That is what men of the old world are doing every day, choosing this one or that one as a leader. But Christians must choose to follow and then actually and exclusively worship the Sovereign Ruler of the universe, Jehovah God. Every day will they bless him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For one to become a spiritual man requires time. If he is a person of the world, never having turned to God’s Word, he must first study; and that is where Jehovah’s witnesses have a great blessing and opportunity before them. They call upon the people at their homes and tell them about the things they have learned. They make back-calls and conduct home Bible studies with people of good will. It may take six months or a year before these individuals are able to understand and appreciate what Jehovah’s purposes are, but in time any person who is sincere and who has a sheeplike disposition will turn from his worldly way of thinking and will see that the instruction set forth in God’s Word is of greatest value, and it will not be long until he will be becoming spiritually-minded. All the “other sheep” who have been gathered into the New World society and have dedicated themselves to Jehovah God have become spiritually-minded just like the anointed of God who will be joint heirs with Christ Jesus of the heavenly kingdom. They have become spiritually-minded through the interchange of faith, through communicating to one another about the things they believe. Those who are truly spiritually-minded can help the weaker ones in the organization. It is the responsibility of the stronger ones to speak to those who have shown hesitance in taking up their responsibility. That is why Paul said: “Brothers, even though a man takes some false step before he is aware of it, you who have spiritual qualifications try to restore such a man in a spirit of mildness, as you each keep an eye on yourself, for fear you also may be tempted.” —Gal. 6:1, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A brother in the organization should not be offended when another brother who is zealous and joyful in God’s service calls on him to help him. He should be grateful to God that someone sees his need and that someone with spiritual qualifications is willing to help to restore him in a spirit of mildness. It may be that the one who was slipping away lost his grip and no longer was holding fast to the instruction God had given for him through His Word. Once we lose our grip on the instruction in God’s Word we begin to lose our life. We must seek accurate knowledge, and this we cannot attain by our individually, privately working out our own philosophies and ideas of life. We must seek Jehovah God. (Prov. 3:5-7) We must turn to his Word; we must associate with his organization. We must keep our minds on the right things and in that way we shall be able to attain accurate knowledge and true understanding. It should be the desire of every one to be filled with accurate knowledge, wisdom and spiritual discernment so that each one can walk worthily of Jehovah and thus please him. As a Christian we each must be bearing fruit in every good work, and as we bear this fruit we must increase in accurate knowledge of God. What a wonderful privilege it is for a dedicated person to have made advancement in Jehovah’s organization so as to qualify himself to be a right kind of minister. He feels like the apostle Paul: “Thanking the Father who rendered you suitable for your participation in the inheritance of the holy ones in the light.” (Col. 1:9-12, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> He was glad to see others make advancement and to co-operate with God to render themselves suitable servants so that they too could share in this great work of “announcing Jehovah’s kingdom” in all the world for a witness.—Matt. 24:14, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark160"></a>MAINTAINING INTEGRITY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">There is no doubt about it, we as individual members of the New World society must be interested in ourselves. It was Jesus who said: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.” (Matt. 22:39; Luke 21:34-36, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> We must pay constant attention to ourselves so that we may gain life in the new world. Individually we must look after our own integrity. No one else can take any one of us into the new world by holding our hand and dragging us through the battle of Armageddon. Each dedicated Christian witness of Jehovah must stand on his own feet. (Joel 2:7, 8; Phil. 2:12, 13) He must hold fast to instruction. As Jesus said, it is your taking in knowledge of Jehovah, the only true God, and of the One whom he sent forth, Jesus Christ, that means life. Wisdom and understanding of Jehovah’s purposes are the vital essentials that will ensure your survival. But, remember, you cannot go it alone. While you may do much private study, it is very necessary that you meet with the congregation and there make the public declaration of your hope. Even Jesus did that. (Heb. 2:12; John 13:15-17) By so doing, you, like Jesus, will incite others to love and good works and encourage those who have not forsaken the assembling of themselves with their brothers in these last days. Knowledge you thus gain and dispense shows that you are holding fast to instruction and that you can be assured of everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul loved youthful Timothy and he gave him much admonition in several letters. One time he wrote him at length and, summing up, said: “Ponder over these things, be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons. Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.” (1 Tim. 4:15, 16, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> From this it is clear that every Christian must advance within Jehovah’s organization and never be ashamed to make this advancement manifest to all persons within the congregation. If you respectfully speak up and express yourself and others become aware that you are becoming more mature and spiritually-minded, that makes their hearts glad and it may help them to follow in the same way, for they see the benefit you are deriving from studying and communicating in the hearing of your assembled brothers. They will observe, too, that you are paying constant attention to yourself and that you are keeping yourself in attendance at all the meetings and that you are seeing to it that you are getting out in the field service, both in your private territory and with your brothers at the service center. They may even see that you are advancing to the point of entering the pioneer service and perhaps eventually to going through Gilead School and on to a foreign missionary assignment or into circuit servant work. Not that you are trying to be better than someone else, but simply better than you have been, because you see the great responsibility Jehovah God has placed on each one who has dedicated himself to serve Jehovah God, a responsibility to grow, to increase. You are paying constant attention to yourself and now you want to be sure, too, that you are paying constant attention to your teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To maintain integrity we see how important it is to meet with the congregation, to mingle with and express ourselves among our brothers, so that we can always be sure that our teaching, the things we speak from house to house and in Bible studies, is correct. By meeting attendance we are constantly testing whether we are in the faith and we keep proving or demonstrating what we ourselves are. Results of such conduct are marvelous, constantly bringing joy and gladness to our hearts. Paul adds: “Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.” (1 Tim. 4:16, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> Yes, by taking in knowledge, by holding feist to instruction, by believing the whole Word of God, you can save yourself. By your holding fast the public declaration of your hope those who listen to you in the congregation can be helped and those who listen to you as you travel throughout the old world preaching the good news of the Kingdom can also be helped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses certainly find themselves in a magnificent position at this time. They are not fearful of the things occurring in the old world. They are not disturbed because of the thickening darkness, the encircling gloom that afflicts and perplexes all nations. They are not afraid of the wars or the rumors of wars. The reason: They have hope. They </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">know</span><span class="font8"> the outcome. They have read, yes, studied God’s Word and so feel content and satisfied and sure. Let each of us, then, holding fast the public declaration of our hope, be like that man of whom the psalmist wrote: “He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.”—Ps. 112:7, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">AS.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark162"></a>THEY ARE NOT AFRAID</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are filled with confidence in Jehovah, the living God. They see his direction of them and they observe how he aids them in their service. They appreciate that they are backed up by his holy spirit or active force. They see the strength in the unity of Jehovah’s organization and they rejoice in sticking together in performing his purposes. Knowing that Jehovah is with them, Jehovah’s witnesses are not afraid. The psalmist says: “Jehovah is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? Jehovah is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh, even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell. Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, even then will I be confident. One thing have I asked of Jehovah, that will I seek after: That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of Jehovah, and to inquire in his temple.” (Ps. 27:14, AS) Every one of Jehovah’s witnesses wants to dwell in the house of Jehovah forever. They have dedicated themselves as Jehovah’s slaves and they are fully cognizant of Jehovah’s will concerning them. They know what he wants them to do despite any outside influences. Knowing that the taking in of more knowledge of him and his purposes is the right thing to do and the way to life eternal, and knowing that they want to live so they can serve Jehovah, they certainly will not be fearful of anyone else. So they ask: “Whom shall I fear?” If they fear man, then they fall into man’s snare. If they are afraid of evildoers and any hurt that may come upon them, they will fall into a snare. But by their staying wholly on Jehovah’s side and in his organization and close to the congregation of his people they will continually observe their adversaries falling and stumbling, hurting themselves and eventually vanishing permanently in the battle of Armageddon, now near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even though the entire communistic organization globally lines itself up against Jehovah’s people, as it now does behind its “iron curtain,” the hearts of Jehovah’s witnesses will not fear. As the 1954 report shows, those fearless ones behind the “Iron Curtain” are not ceasing their service to Jehovah God. They still remain his obedient slaves and preach Jehovah’s kingdom, not communism. Even though war were to rise up against them, still they would be confident that Jehovah God would protect them, and they will do what Jehovah has given them to do, for his honor’s sake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Having studied Jehovah’s Word day by day, privately and congregationally, a true witness of Jehovah God will always seek his Father in heaven and worship him and will want to bless him every day. He will not only </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">want</span><span class="font8"> to do it, he </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">will</span><span class="font8"> do it, as Jehovah’s witnesses have been doing for the past many years, and especially so during the 1954 service year of the Watch Tower Society. This you can prove as you study the chart on pages 34 to 39. You do not see Jehovah’s witnesses running for cover and trying to seek safety within the worldly governments of the Devil’s organization. These governments, with their religious false shepherds, their high and mighty political shepherds, and their powerful business organizations cannot give life to man. Jehovah’s witnesses know that, and because of their careful study of God’s Word they see that life comes through knowledge of the Sovereign Ruler of the universe and of his Son Christ Jesus, and that life is a gift of God to them because of their obedience to his commands. Why should they seek anything less than life eternal? With life they can worship their God Jehovah. The Devil’s world is all vanity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">estant religious organizations, who often use the arm of the state to try to cut them off from being a people. They can certainly say as the psalmist:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Mine enemies would swallow me up all the day long; for they are many that fight proudly against me. What time I am afraid, I will put my trust in thee. In God (I will praise his word), in God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; what can flesh do unto me?” (Ps. 56: 2-4, AS) When one reads the report of Jehovah’s witnesses and sees how fearlessly they fight on against opposition, one cannot help but conclude that Jehovah God is with them, for no organization can stand up and hold its position as a ministerial society in this wicked old world unless Jehovah God gives them his backing. Jehovah’s witnesses have hearkened to and “praise his word”; they know clearly that it states they will meet up with persecution and oppression, and that some will be killed for the sake of Christ Jesus and because they worship the Sovereign Ruler, Jehovah. “What can flesh do unto me” but kill the body? Flesh cannot deprive the faithful of a resurrection by Jehovah! So again they turn to God’s Word for strength: “But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, and shall be quiet without fear of evil.” (Prov. 1:33, AS) Thus it is with Jehovah’s witnesses. Regardless of intense Roman Catholic opposition in Quebec, the fighting against them by the Communist organization east of its “iron curtain,” the banning of the Society’s publications and the forbidding of its public ministry in several “democratic” countries, Jehovah’s witnesses joyously continue preaching the good news of his kingdom. When necessary they go underground with their activity—not to do harm to any political or religious organizations, but merely to exercise their God-given right to meet together to study God’s Word and to maintain a congregational organization for making public declaration of their hope one to another and so incite one another to love and right works. Then, too, they will go forward to other willing listeners and tell them the good news of God’s kingdom. No; no matter what the world may do to try to break down Jehovah’s witnesses and the New World society, the organization will unitedly move ahead, declaring that Jehovah’s kingdom is the only hope for mankind. “He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah. His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his adversaries.”—Ps. 112:7, 8, AS.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark164"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark165"></a>THE WORLD-WIDE WITNESS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Knowing the responsibility that rests upon them, Jehovah’s witnesses in the year 1954 (beginning September 1, 1953, and ending August 31, 1954) have continued to advance in the greatest preaching campaign that they have been privileged to share in to this time. All Jehovah’s witnesses have dedicated themselves to Jehovah’s service; hence they are not afraid of man or Devil. They follow Peter’s advice: “Keep your senses, be watchful. Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone. But take your stand against him, solid in the faith, knowing that the same things in the way of sufferings are being accomplished in the entire association of your brothers in the world. But, after you have suffered a little while, the God of all undeserved kindness, who called you to his everlasting glory in union with Christ, will himself finish your training, he will make you firm, he will make you strong. To him be the might forever. Amen.” (1 Pet. 5:8-11, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> In the year 1955 Jehovah’s witnesses will go ahead fearlessly, just as determined as ever to accomplish their work with the entire association of their brothers throughout the world, knowing that no matter where any of them will be there will be suffering and that this suffering will be caused by the Devil and through his organization. (Rev. 2:10) No matter how severe it may be or how light, whether in hard season or in good season, the Kingdom message will be preached and the other sheep will be gathered together. Have a share with Jehovah’s witnesses in this great educational work and bless Jehovah every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This report for the 1954 service year is most encouraging and all people in the world should want to know what Jehovah’s witnesses did. Their report they do not make boastfully, but in humble praise of the Sovereign Ruler of the universe, and they are grateful for their share in promoting the true worship of him and bringing to the people lifesaving Bible education. In this world today there is so little knowledge of Jehovah that his witnesses want to shout from the housetops who the Sovereign Ruler is and what he will do for all those who love righteousness. For the past good year they have had Jehovah’s witnesses are happy, and they look forward to 1955 with great joy, anticipating even larger privileges of service in Jehovah’s organization side by side with many new “other sheep” seeking to do Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During 1953 there was an average of 468,106 ministers preaching God’s kingdom. But for the 1954 service year the average was 525,924, a 12 per cent increase. All persons who are seeking truth and righteousness and who are sighing and crying for the abominations that exist in this world Jehovah’s witnesses are trying to help to come to Jehovah God and worship him with spirit and truth. (John 4:23, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> It is the other sheep they are trying to find, and they are finding them. By the end of the 1954 service year there was a peak of publishers of 580,498, or a 24 per cent increase over the 1953 average number of publishers in the field. These ministers are going to attend meetings. They will not forsake the assembling of themselves together, but together they will grow on to maturity. During 1955 they will keep on preaching the good news, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, and find more of the other sheep. They rejoice in what they have accomplished with Jehovah’s help and under the direction of his beloved Son Christ Jesus, invisibly present and directing his organization. Their rejoicing is not because of the growth in membership of the organization but because they were able to gather together persons who have wanted to get out of the present wicked system of things and now maintain their integrity in wholeness of devotion to Jehovah God; yes, be glad with these people from all nations who want to serve Jehovah with spirit and truth and who want to take in knowledge so that they may live in God’s new world. They were determined to do this, for 57,369 of such “sheep” were baptized in water in symbolizing their dedication to Jehovah’s service. These are no longer afraid; their hearts are fixed, trusting in Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All these ministers together have devoted 80,814,996 hours to the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom. This is not the time they came together to study God’s Word; it is the time they devoted in walking from house to house, making back-calls, conducting Bible studies in the homes of those interested in the Kingdom message. Were we to add up all the time spent by 580,498 ministers of Catholic and Protestant congregations all over the world, would it amount to 80,814,996 hours spent in preaching the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom to people at their homes? But Jehovah’s witnesses made 25,337,026 back-calls on interested people, bringing them comfort. Every month in the year they were conducting 293,341 Bible studies in many languages, weekly, in the people’s homes. Are Christendom’s clergy that anxious or energetic to get their parishioners to understand the Bible? This educational work has been going on in 159 lands under the direction of the Watch Tower Society’s 75 branches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God’s Word says: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” (Matt. 24:14, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> This very thing Jehovah’s witnesses are trying to do. To accomplish it 1,720 graduates of Gilead School have been sent out to all parts of the world. Some are in the district and circuit servant work, others in branch offices, and 910 are missionaries located in 220 homes in 71 different countries and in 205 different cities. From those homes these missionaries work out into small villages and towns and rural sections preaching this good news of the Kingdom. They are not alone in this, because the Society has appointed many local ministers as special pioneers. These are selected from the general pioneer ranks and aided financially to go off into isolated places in their respective countries, to do the same kind of fulltime ministerial work. These missionaries and special pioneers, who try to devote 140 or more hours monthly in preaching the good news from house to house, together with pioneers who try to devote 100 hours a month to the field service, totaled 17,265. Congregation publishers averaged 508,659 every month, making a grand total of 525,924 Kingdom publishers, ministers, joyfully proclaiming the good news every month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Undoubtedly there are millions of persons who believe as Jehovah’s witnesses do but who lack the courage or faith or full hope that Jehovah’s witnesses have; otherwise they too would come forward and take their stand as dedicated servants of Jehovah. To help such, to bring them on to maturity, so that they can appreciate that the only hope for the world is Jehovah’s kingdom, may require many more years. They must take in greater knowledge of this kingdom. That is why Jehovah’s witnesses continually take literature to the people in their own language so that they may read and study. In the service year of 1954, Bibles, books and booklets in total of 17,687,257 were distributed in upward of 100 different languages. Persons that wanted to read the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> magazines regularly in their own tongues were offered subscriptions. New subscriptions for these magazines obtained during the year by the publishers afield were 995,787. They also distributed 29,937,614 individual copies of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> in many languages, which undoubtedly brought great comfort to the readers. It was necessary for the Society to print 43,467,909 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and 29,620,128 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font8">magazines in order to meet the world-wide reader demand. The total increase over last year was 9,386,246 magazines printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What a boundless joy it is to see the message of the Kingdom preached on such a wide scale! Jesus, when upon earth, gathered his apostles and talked to them and gave them accurate knowledge, and they were his disciples or learners. Then he sent them forth to preach to those seeking the truth. So today Jehovah’s witnesses are gathering the other sheep and training them to give sermons at the doors or in the homes of the people or publicly. Those other sheep they invite to meet with them in their congregations. Throughout the world there are 14,531 congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses, and at Memorial time last spring there were 829,836 persons in attendance. Of these, 17,884 professed to be of the anointed, confidently hoping to be joint heirs with Christ Jesus, believing in their heart that because they are begotten by God’s holy spirit they, according to the will of Jehovah, will receive their resurrection to heavenly glory. All the others, well over 800,000, happily look forward to life on the new earth under the permanent rulership of the kingdom of heaven. Jehovah’s witnesses have a big work to bring all of these on to maturity so that they, all of them, can be able ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is very glad to see that Jehovah has blessed and prospered the efforts to organize the work world-wide. With millions afield who have been served we are very grateful, too, for the unsolicited contributions that our brothers in all parts of the earth have sent in to the Society so that this constantly expanding witness can be carried on to the ends of the earth. To care for the work outside the United States the Society spent through its seventy-five branch offices over three million dollars during the year. To sustain missionaries alone and to aid them in their field activity the Society has spent nearly half a million dollars. How it cheers our hearts to see that a work of such proportions can be accomplished with such a small amount of funds! Of course, each local congregation has spent freely, too, to take care of its Kingdom Hall and to put on local public meetings in all parts of its territory; and if to that we were to add what individual publishers themselves spent during the year for transportation, by car, bus, train, plane and otherwise, to get to the homes of their willing listeners, as well as to attend circuit, district and national assemblies for training themselves to do better service in the public interest, it would total many, many more millions. But this is their gift to Jehovah God, an expression of their joy, their thankfulness that they can spend of what they, in fact, have received from him to help their neighbors to learn his truth. That is love in action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Do you find any others on earth who have the delight and satisfaction of living as Jehovah’s witnesses have in serving the Sovereign Ruler of the universe? No wonder it is true that not one of these will be afraid of evil tidings. The reason is that their heart is fixed and they do trust in the living God. As children of Zion, they, to the extent of their capacity, rejoice in Jehovah God and his enthroned and unconquerable King, Christ Jesus. (Psalm 149) The clergy with all their threats, their mob action—the rulers with all their bans and restrictions against “freeness of speech,” their taking away from Jehovah’s witnesses and destroying printed material these use to enlighten others with Bible truths—none of these things frighten them. Conscious is each of them that ‘he has dispersed, given to the needy,’ that “the wicked shall see it, and be grieved” and that “the desire of the wicked shall perish.” (Ps. 112:9, 10, AS) Jehovah’s witnesses earth-wide courageously work on! So </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">unitedly,</span><span class="font8"> as one man, they continue to announce Jehovah’s kingdom, for “he shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.”—Ps. 112:7, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">AS.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark166"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark167"></a>ORDAINED MINISTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses, all of them dedicated to Jehovah God, are Jehovah’s servants. Their works prove their ministerial qualifications. They do not need high-sounding titles or documents from men to prove their ordination. No one will question that Paul was an ordained minister, but he had no certificate of ordination from anyone. The proof of his being a faithful minister of Christ Jesus and walking in his footsteps was the work he did. We read: “Do we, perhaps, like some men, need letters of recommendation to you or from you? You yourselves are our letter, inscribed on our hearts and known and being read by all mankind. For you are shown to be a letter of Christ written by us as ministers, inscribed not with ink but with spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets, but on fleshly tablets, on hearts.” (2 Cor. 3:1-3, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font8">Hundreds, yes, thousands of persons listened to Paul and they indeed were a letter of recommendation of his ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Today Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world have the same kind of recommendation. They go from house to house, they make back-calls, they conduct Bible studies in the homes of the people and they gather other sheep into the congregation of Jehovah. The New World society, as we see it operating under seventy-five branches throughout the world, is proof of the individuals’ ministry. Jehovah’s witnesses can show that they, too, “did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house.” (Acts 20:20, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font8">Just as the apostles in days gone by did, so even now “every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.” —Acts 5:42, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are a society of ministers and servants of God who walk in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. They rejoice in the great privilege of service that is theirs. In order to assist all the hundreds of thousands of ministers now making up the New World society, from among this great group the Society appoints special servants, who serve as branch servants, district servants, circuit servants, members of Bethel families in branch offices, or in some special capacity in some missionary field. With these special privileges of service come greater responsibilities of leadership, zeal and setting the proper example as Christians. The Society is pleased to set out here this list of servants assigned to special duties.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>MORE MISSIONARIES GO AFIELD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The many missionaries who have gone into foreign fields report that they are happy to have taken this forward step in Kingdom service. They have had experiences far beyond their dreams and they are happy that the Watch Tower Society opened the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead in February, 1943, to give special training to pioneer publishers to prepare them to preach this gospel in other lands. During the service year of 19531954 the twenty-second and twenty-third classes of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead graduated. These had been called from all parts of the world, and after graduation they were assigned to scatter abroad over the face of the earth, to carry the good news of the Kingdom to many ears never before hearing the good news. It is a joy to all to know that this is truly an international student body and that the students come from “all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues.” Jehovah is choosing from the nations persons to preach in all parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A new feature was added to the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead during the past year. Two brothers who are professional builders of astronomical equipment gave to the school a large six-teen-inch reflector-type telescope. This enables the student body to observe the beautiful heavens of Jehovah’s universe. Ten members of the farm family at Gilead School have become expert operators of this telescope and they are able, on clear evenings, to pilot their guests through a visual tour of the heavens. These brothers have each volunteered one evening a week for observation duty and have been scheduled accordingly. In the future Gilead students will have the opportunity throughout the school year to have brief periods of observation of heavenly displays under the guidance of these permanent members of the farm staff who are entrusted with the operation of this theocratic observatory. Astronomy is not a course of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, but the Society accepted the gift of the powerful telescope, for to look at the heavens is certainly to observe the handiwork of Jehovah God, the Supreme Creator.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>TWENTY-SECOND TERM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The school’s fall term opened September 2, 1953, with the twenty-second class taking residence. The beginning of this class occurring shortly after the grand New World Society Assembly at Yankee Stadium (July 19-26, 1953) the class reflected the international aspect of this convention, in that it comprised the largest number of foreign students ever to reside at Gilead at any one term. Only ten of the 120 who enrolled for this term were American students, the remaining 110 being from outside the United States. This most international of any of our Gilead classes had students coming from the following lands: Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Burma, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Cyprus, Denmark, Egypt, England, France, Germany, Gold Coast, Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Lebanon, Malaya, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, the Philippines, Scotland, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Trinidad, United States, Uruguay and Venezuela. Their graduation was held Sunday, February 7, 1954. For the Saturday events of the graduation week end 1,379 attended in spite of the wintertime. The Sunday graduation program was attended by 2,137 members of the New World society, who came to give them well-wishes. The local newspapers and the radio gave considerable publicity to this winter graduation. The school’s president, N. H. Knorr, announced their missionary assignment to forty-five different countries abroad. Truly a worldwide scattering of these live coals of zealous ministers of Jehovah!</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark174"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark175"></a>TWENTY-THIRD TERM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This class had the unique experience of being the first to graduate in a country outside the United States. Their graduation was set to coincide with the large district assembly being held at Toronto, Canada, July 21-25, 1954. To publicize this first foreign graduation students sent brief news releases to their home newspapers together with photographs of themselves. The publicity response was considerable. Newspapers to the number of 154 in the United States, Canada and four other countries abroad published 1,327 column inches of these graduation stories. This amounts to nine and a half full pages. Almost all the papers published the individual pictures as well. In preparation for the graduation in Canada this class further demonstrated their excellent theocratic training by executing a well-rehearsed two-hour program of theocratic field ministry and entertainment the evening after their graduation. The Toronto conventioners seemed to be highly pleased with this instructive service performance. For the graduation itself Friday afternoon, July 23, 1954, 14,650 attended at the Toronto Exhibition Park. The weather was perfect, the setting unmatched. Following the addresses by the instructors, the farm servant, the president and the vice-president of the Society, 116 graduates, the same number as matriculated originally, answered their name call for their graduation papers. Forty-seven men and sixty-nine women graduated.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark177"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES’ OPERATIONS WORLD-WIDE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">In all parts of the world Jehovah’s witnesses can now be found, in some sections not in great numbers, it is true, but they are active in 159 different lands, with legal recognition. The headquarters office for Jehovah’s witnesses is located at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York, and from this point the activity and procedure of work are planned in accord with Jehovah’s Word, the Bible, and the dedicated purpose of Jehovah’s witnesses: to serve Jehovah and preach his good news in all the world for a witness. In order for Jehovah’s witnesses legally to carry on their affairs in different parts of the world they have set up organizations. The first and principal organization is the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, a Pennsylvania corporation, with headquarters offices in Pittsburgh. Recently this corporation built a new structure there with a permanent address at 4100 Bigelow Avenue. It is there that the annual business meetings are held, but the general direction of the work takes place from the president’s office in Brooklyn, New York. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, the Pennsylvania corporation, directs the preaching work worldwide and has full supervision of all the branches of the Society and missionary homes, and in general sets the policy of the Society. This corporation, too, through its board of directors sees that the spiritual food is provided for the blessing and encouragement of Jehovah’s witnesses all over the world. It is this Society that arranges for the production of all the publications that Jehovah’s witnesses use, including </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Awake! </span><span class="font8">Bibles and other publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are other corporations that look after different divisions of the work and are separate, distinct corporations, such as the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Incorporated, a New York corporation. This corporation owns and operates all the property in the state of New York, including the radio station, WBBR, and the large printing plant at 117 Adams Street. This corporation has the general supervision of the preaching activity of all Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the United States. In Canada there is another corporation, the International Bible Students Association of Canada, that owns and operates property, all of which is used by Jehovah’s witnesses in proclaiming the good news in that nation. In Great Britain we also have the International Bible Students Association of Great Britain, which has the general supervision of the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom in the British Isles. In other parts of the world where it has become necessary to set up a corporation to own property and do printing for Jehovah’s witnesses, this has been done. But all these different societies co-operate to the fullest extent with the original corporation that was formed in Pennsylvania in 1884. As a body, all Jehovah’s witnesses form a New World society with Jehovah God as their Sovereign Ruler and Christ Jesus as the King placed upon the throne by Jehovah, and they look to Christ Jesus to direct the affairs of Jehovah’s servants at the present time. We believe that Christ is in Jehovah’s temple and that he has received his great authority and has begun to reign. He is present, invisibly, and supervising the affairs of his people through the “faithful and discreet slave” class. We believe that Jehovah God is using the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, the Pennsylvania corporation, through its board of directors to direct Jehovah’s witnesses and provide them with the necessary spiritual food. Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world look to the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> magazine, which announces Jehovah’s kingdom, for much spiritual guidance and edification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Reports of the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in all lands are compiled by the various branch servants, and these reports are sent to the office of the president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society at the close of the service year, August 31. A summary of these reports appears in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span><span class="font8"> The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font8"> is of great interest to all Jehovah’s witnesses, and they rejoice to see the progress made by Jehovah’s ministers throughout the world. They are happy they can share in the fulfillment of Jesus’ words: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth. Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. And, look! I am with you all the days until the consummation of the system of things.” (Matt. 28:18-20, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> All Jehovah’s witnesses know they are sharing in this great world-wide preaching activity and they are happy to go to the ends of the earth bringing comfort and joy to those who are mourning.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark179"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark180"></a>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States of America have enjoyed one of their most blessed years. They have had many rich experiences and it seems that the 1953 New World Society Assembly at Yankee Stadium had telling effects. This should be expected because of all the spiritual food that was provided and because of having a clearer view of what Jehovah God requires of his people. It was thrilling to observe the April report for the United States, for then 169,015 publishers went forth in this country preaching the good news. This was more than a 20 per cent increase in publishers over last year’s average in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The district and circuit servants report, too, that greater efficiency is found on the part of the publishers because of their co-operating so well in assisting one another in the door-to-door ministerial training program. One circuit servant says that it “is gratifying to see some of the weaker growing so much stronger.” Even the pioneers have gained much from working with others and they now have far more joy in going to the doors with their three- to eight-minute sermons. All now feel the responsibility of leaving a very definite thought and message concerning Jehovah’s kingdom with all whom they meet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Despite the fact that there has been such a tremendous increase in the number of publishers in the field in the United States, the average hours per publisher has gone up from 8.9 to 9.7, for the past service year. Having had such a wonderful start in 1954 in this program of helping one another in the field service, we can look forward to 1955 with real enthusiasm. What a joy it is to bring these other sheep on to maturity! It is our responsibility to help all who desire to worship Jehovah God to become mature in this grand witness work. From the branch servant’s report a few excerpts are printed here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This past year has been the greatest year on record for vacation pioneering. From the previous high of 1,807 vacation pioneers, the total for this year jumped up to the grand figure of 4,389, as publishers, young and old, students, housewives, seasonal workers and whole families, took advantage of the new vacation pioneer arrangement. Excellent work has been and is being done by them. Almost without exception, when completing this brief period of pioneering, they express their desire to pioneer again at the first opportunity. We hope to see more share in this joyful feature of theocratic service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Early this year a most interesting letter was received from a 33-year-old man in prison. He was in solitary confinement as a result of being a ringleader in one of the worst prison riots in this country. Manifesting humble, sheeplike qualities, a portion of his letter reads: “I have nearly lost the value of life and all aims, friends, etc. But I have recently learned the value and meaning of prayer, which I hadn’t heretofore been acquainted with. In regards to my person, upon a long and careful personal inventory I find nothing whatsoever outstanding or favorable to recommend as reference in my past life and way of living to gain your interest I so greatly desire. In fact, the only statement I can make is I have found a real interest in the Bible and what I have learned of the Jehovah’s witnesses’ way of life. My interest now is to combine them together, only I am at a loss of how to begin.” The Society wrote him an encouraging letter, sent him several publications for study and arranged for the local congregation servant to call on him. He being in solitary confinement, prison officials allowed the congregation and circuit servants to visit him only once, but correspondence and literature have been allowed. His last letter ends: “How grateful I am to have the time and friends like you to learn and know the many blessings of life. Though I am in prison, I am blessed with so much more than many a poor brother and sister in society. I have time to really come to know and understand Jehovah’s teachings without interferences of worldly obstacles and problems that confront so many. So my man-made prison to me no longer is a prison, but a peaceful time for meditation and knowledge. I am taking advantage of it fully and have learned to love, trust, believe and pray.” Though he may spend the remaining years to Armageddon in ‘man’s prison,’ by continuing to study Jehovah’s Word he will remain free in mind and heart and be privileged to comfort and help others around him whom prison officials—but not so God —may class as beyond help.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>LEGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Society’s legal office has had very few cases to handle involving the distribution of literature from house to house and upon the streets. The road for preaching in the United States is still legally open for continued daily praise of Jehovah. There has been no serious interference from state or local officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “Green River” type of ordinance, which requires previous consent from the householder before calling at the homes of the people, has been resurrected again in different parts of the country. A case is pending in Anchorage, Alaska. Another such case has been taken from the local courts in Cuero, Texas, to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas. That court declared the “Green River” ordinance was not applicable to Jehovah’s witnesses. The judges said that if it were applicable it would be unconstitutional. The court said that no local law could stop the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. That court also declared the &quot;Green River” ordinance to be void on its face under Texas law. A similar case was decided favorably in Winner, South Dakota. There the district court also held the ordinance to be inapplicable to Jehovah’s witnesses and unconstitutional. He said it did not cover Jehovah’s Witnesses engaged in noncommercial preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is evident that Jehovah God continues to bless his people in the fight for freedom of worship in the United States. We thank him for keeping the way open so that his people—old and new alike in the truth—may bless him more and more every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our report on the field service in general would not be complete without expressing appreciation to Jehovah for his provision of the moving-picture film “The New World Society in Action.” Responses to these showings of the one-and-a-half-hour film at various assemblies and congregations have been most gratifying. The great number of people who are seeing the film are being stimulated to think more seriously about Jehovah’s organization. To illustrate this, one of the circuit servants who is showing the film wrote: “A man who has relatives in the truth came to see the picture out of curiosity. He brought his wife with him because they had both heard about the film from his family. He was struck by the greatness of the organization and its love. He stated that he wanted to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” Another report from one of our traveling ministers in Ohio is also very interesting. He relates: “A Jewish manager of a theater</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">in which the film was shown was prompted to tell his Protestant preacher friend, ‘You ought to come over and see this group in action. They have an idea of service that I never saw any place else. They call themselves servants and they really mean it.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You certainly made us all very happy, Brother Knorr, when you announced at the Boston district assembly last June that the Society is arranging to construct a new ten-story publishing plant this coming year, across the street from the present one in Brooklyn. As you pointed out, this new factory is urgently necessary to meet the ever-increasing demands for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines. Surely, as we look over the past years, it is very evident that Jehovah has richly blessed the use of these two magazines in the world-wide spreading of the Word of truth. The following chart gives a very interesting picture of the steady, rapid growth and circulation of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines in the Brooklyn printing plant alone.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Just for this past year alone, there was an amazing increase in magazine production of 8,410,000! Think of it! How thrilling beyond words it is to see such a tremendous increase in the magazines in just one year! We give all thanks to Jehovah and realize that it is tangible evidence of his blessing upon the work of these two magazines. So, to our dear faithful brothers and sisters in the field throughout the world, we would like to say, “Keep up the good work in using these two instruments, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines, in carrying the life-giving truths to spiritually starving mankind. As your demands for the magazines increase, we here in the Bethel family, Brooklyn, will count it a precious privilege to increase our production output.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not only has the magazine production increased, but because of the newly developed arrangement for using the Bible in three- to eight-minute sermons in door-to-door work, the demand for Bibles has increased. Responding to this need we have had the privilege this past year of producing 678,326 copies of the various translations of the Bible. To give you an overall picture of production at the factory during the past year, to compare with the previous two years, you will find the following chart interesting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">It has been a very busy year at the factory, which has been kept “humming” with activity. Yes, literally “humming,” as during the past year, 192 railroad carloads of paper went streaming through the eighteen printing presses at the Brooklyn factory. This is an increase of twelve carloads above the previous year that were brought into the Brooklyn plant to be processed into the printed page and then shipped and mailed out as life-giving truth to make over the minds of many people in all countries of the world. This is indeed a world-wide work when we consider that the above list of literature was published in thirty-seven different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We here at Brooklyn Bethel love and cherish our privileges of serving Jehovah God and our brothers throughout the world. We are thankfully looking forward to working together for another year and to unitedly praising Jehovah every day and enjoying the thrills of seeing the expansion of the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">COUNTRIES REPORTING TO UNITED STATES BRANCH</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font8">In the Society’s effort to get the message of the Kingdom preached throughout the world missionaries have been sent to many places. In some countries, like French Equatorial Africa, where missionaries of Jehovah’s witnesses are not allowed, the local people take up the Kingdom message and preach it themselves. The work in Alaska, Bermuda, French Equatorial Africa, Guam, Iceland and Israel is reported directly to the Brooklyn office. In a few of these lands it has been found rather difficult to reach the people with the Kingdom truth, but in other places the truth is accepted readily. Even though it seems difficult to reach and work with the people in Iceland and Israel, our work will not cease. We feel sure there are still some people who will demonstrate a sheeplike disposition, and Jesus said these must be gathered. There are many islands of the sea, too, that need the witness, and so the Society has arranged to send its boat “Faith” to many of the small islands in the Caribbean area. These islands have no special report made on them but they are covered by the report under the heading Other Islands. All these reports follow.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>ALASKA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The service year started with expansion, when </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font7">brother from Cordova took the traveling pioneers around Prince William Sound in his boat. This was the first time this territory had been covered. Several small Indian villages and scattered persons throughout the area were contacted. Although the trip took just four days, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> total of 66 books, 14 subscriptions and some magazines and booklets were placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During May one of the pioneers that regularly works in isolated sections teamed up with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a new</span><span class="font7"> publisher and both started down the Tanana River from Fairbanks, heading for the Yukon River. They witnessed to the natives in various villages and fishing camps along the way. In some of the places not reached before, the natives were somewhat cautious and reserved, that being their nature. But at Nome where the pioneer had been before many of the people greeted the brothers and welcomed them back in their midst. The change to a friendly attitude becomes more pronounced as return visits are made to these remote towns and villages where </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font7">have been read. During this trip a preacher used his airplane to fly ahead of the brothers and warn the people that they were coming and not to have anything to do with the witnesses. One man asked the brothers where they had been; he had been waiting for them for three days to find out what they had to cause the preacher to do such a thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Alaska is a big territory with much of it yet to be witnessed to. While the interest is scattered, the territory will yield its share of the other sheep that will live in the new world, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark187"></a>BERMUDA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Early in the year we had to leave our hall, but this turned out to be a blessing. We were able to rent a bigger place with more facilities, which has enabled us to get better organized and have a more centrally located, cleaner, brighter hall to which to invite people. Stock can now be stored there and we have a small office for keeping records. We have been overjoyed at the sight of many new faces with us at meetings since the change. This has forcefully demonstrated to us the need of always maintaining a comfortable, clean, bright hall and to be always on the alert to improve our facilities. Although our rent Is now higher, the contributions have increased to more than cover the difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A high light that will long remain in our memory was the showing of the film “The New World Society in Action.” It was especially valuable to us because most of the island’s 40,000 inhabitants who have heard of us have considered us just another back-street mission. The film was a revelation to the viewers of what we are and what our purpose is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The placing of literature, of course, presents no problem here. The difficulty is in determining just how long to call back on those apparently interested. In the past we have undoubtedly spent much time on unproductive studies which could have been used more profitably on first-call work finding, not merely the people willing to study with us, but rather the ones </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">wanting to learn and serve God.</span><span class="font7"> There are surely many sheep here, like a lady contacted just before the showing of the film in July. The brother who called met with an accident before he could make the back-call and asked another brother to deliver an invitation to a showing of the film. There was no one home when the call was made; so the invitation was pushed under the door. The lady attended the showing, enjoyed her visit and has attended meetings regularly since. In 1948 she had been visited by missionaries and had obtained literature from them, and had waited six years for another call.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark188"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark189"></a>FRENCH EQUATORIAL AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Splendid work is being done throughout French Equatorial Africa by mature local brothers, who are putting forth every effort to announce the Kingdom message. Large congregations have been organized in both Middle Congo and Ubangi-Shari, with some interest being shown also in Gabon and Chad. There is much opposition to the work, usually from religious sources, and the Bible study aids of the Society are not permitted free circulation in the territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the high lights of the year was an assembly that was held by the brothers in Brazzaville the latter part of December. An excellent program was arranged with interesting discourses and demonstration that stressed the need of theocratic maturity. The brothers wrote about it, saying: “The morning of the assembly we baptized 70 persons of good will. All of these rejoiced with us that the assembly was so richly blessed by Jehovah. There were over 650 persons attending in perfect peace. We are thankful to our great God Jehovah, who blessed us and made the assembly a success.” Even the irate comments by the priests and the derogatory remarks published by the local paper only served as a further announcement of the truth and as a testimony to Kingdom expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Memorial in Bangui was observed by the brothers out in the open under the palm trees. Of the 584 in attendance not one partook of the emblems, indicating their hope to live on the earth under the righteous conditions of the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers are working hard to improve their ministry. The training program has been organized and every effort is being made to aid the brothers. As the congregation servant writes: “We prepared short texts and commentaries with Scripture quotations for several Bible subjects in the form of a little sermon, for use by the publishers in their native tongue. They can use these in their house-to-house preaching, on their back-calls and even to start home Bible studies. In this way our weaker brothers, the new ones and the majority of the brothers and sisters who are illiterate can be helped greatly. With daily practice they will soon be well qualified and equipped for every good work.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Aside from the local Guamanians, who number about 23,000, the island is very transient. So some of the interest we do find moves on to be watered by publishers in another country. So much money being spent in Guam makes it a boom island and has made the people materialistic and pleasure-minded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The meanest men on the island so far have been the Catholic priests. In Umatac, the southernmost village on Guam, the parish priest attempted to stop our preaching. He met the congregation servant at a home and, after talking to the householder in Chamorro, the Guamanian dialect, which the congregation servant could not understand, the priest then said to him in English, “You better stop preaching to these people. Do you not know they are Catholics?” “Jesus said, ‘preach, say, the Kingdom is at hand,’ and I know these people are Christians and want to hear the message of God’s kingdom,” was the reply. The priest reasoned out and said, “This command was given to the twelve apostles only. You are not included here. So you had better leave now.” He was shown scriptures where all were to engage in the preaching work and there was to be no such thing as a clergy and a laity class. When this proof was produced many people that were looking on and listening shouted at the priest, and he had to depart in a hurry. The sword of the spirit was put to work and it not only defended the truth, but beat back the onslaughts of Satan and his representatives. Even though it is said that most of the people in Guam are Catholics, they are Catholic in name only. They do not fully support the priest in all he does. We hope that many of the local Guamanians will yet come to know of Jehovah and his purposes.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark191"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The prospects for expansion of the Kingdom work have never been so bright as they are at the close of this service year. The past seven years since the first Gilead missionaries arrived have been years of hard plowing and preparing the soil with very little fruit. Many have come in contact with the New World society, progressed to a point, and then withered away. The few who did advance to maturity were foreigners, who later returned to their home countries. Our ever-present problem was how to get the Icelander himself to take an active interest and a firm stand for the theocracy. “So let us not give up in doing what is right, for in due season we shall reap by not giving out.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our rural campaign this year got away to an early start at the end of April. Weather was good after a mild winter, so why begin later? Results have been very gratifying. We have been able to spread our fine new instrument What </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font7"> in Icelandic in towns and villages around the entire country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our experiences as pioneers working in the outlying districts are often quite thrilling. A pioneer sister traveled alone more than two hundred miles by bus over bad roads to visit a group of flords. Upon arriving at 9 p.m. she was told that the guesthouse was now closed up. With small boys carrying her cartons of books and bags, she found a coffeehouse, witnessed to the lady and was invited to stay with her. After the sister witnessed to all the village, this kind young lady inquired where she intended to go next. “To the next village in the next fiord.” To which she replied, “There is no guesthouse there either, but I will phone to my mother, who lives there, and you must stay with her.” In this way 190 books were placed in three villages in nine days’ witnessing with two days’ traveling. This is an example showing how Jehovah will open up the way if the witness goes out in faith and seeks first the Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>ISRAEL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">While the disturbances have not particularly interfered with our work, some people are beginning to see the hopelessness of permanent peace through the U.N. and, in fear of what they see coming, a few have shown increased interest. Also there have been some who were looking to the church missions for comfort, but have not found it, and among these there are ones that are now seemingly turning to the true fountain of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year some of the brothers in Tel Aviv commenced going from house to house, becoming more literature-conscious, and this will undoubtedly bear fruit. Although one sister moved out of the country, another began publishing, so that the report for Tel Aviv remained the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just at the close of the service year, a visit was made to the two groups in the Galilee, the first in over a year, contacting also isolated publishers and good-will persons en route. The brothers expressed great appreciation for the visit, as they are restricted in their travel, being Arabs in a military zone. The one group had reported most months, but the brother in the other place had gotten so discouraged that he had not sent in a report for over five months, although it was evident he had been preaching. Some of his back-calls showed good interest. There is hope that soon travel restrictions will be lifted, and this will be a help, as then these brothers can go to nearby Arab villages, since they have worked and reworked their own little places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The last month of the service year a young brother, who was quite a religious Moslem, put in his first report, and one could see that he took real pleasure in it. He works in a hospital operated by orthodox Jews, and so has opportunities to speak to them. They would listen to a Moslem speak about Messiah although they would not listen to a Christian, as they seem curious that one they had looked upon as a Mohammedan should be teaching from the Bible, and not the Koran. On the Moslem new year he was given holidays; so he took along some literature to his village, and distributed what he took.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fight against missionaries of all religions has been intensified during this year, with resultant pressure on the Department of Immigration to refuse renewal of visas. One Gilead graduate couple were told that they were being given their last extension. A visit was made to the Department of Immigration to one of the higher officials and he said to contact the Ministry of Religion. Two visits were made and they suggested a compromise, that one couple go and they would do what they could to get a resident visa for the other, but this was not accepted. Literature was brought to show the purpose of the organization, and it was made very clear that Jehovah’s witnesses do not buy people with material help, as is done by many missions, but are here to build the people up spiritually, mentally and morally, making them God-fearing and law-abiding. Over one month after applications were put in, there still had been no reply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The year has been one beset with difficulties that have seriously affected the forward movement of true worship, evident in the decrease. It is to be hoped that soon it will be possible to clear this up, so that a united shout of praise can go up to Jehovah’s name, and the assemblies, so necessary to strengthen the brothers, can be held.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark193"></a>OTHER ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The missionaries who operate the boat under the Society’s direction left New York on October 29, 1953, after fitting the vessel for its work in the West Indies. In five days we reached the Bahamas, where the Society’s president had arranged for the branch servant and some of the local pioneers and missionaries to travel on the boat to the out islands to enable many good-will persons to take their stand before the end of this old world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first stop in the Exuma Cays was at Bell Cay. How many houses would we find on this lonely island? Six publishers went ashore to find out. The sum total —two homes. Placements? One </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens”</span><span class="font7"> book and a magazine. Two very isolated families now have the chance of survival. Six days later the capital of Great Exuma, Georgetown, was reached. It was then November 18. The branch servant gave a public talk to a crowd of thirty-five under the trees. During the talk the Anglican priest rode by in his jeep, eyeing his flock, and on Sunday night he told his audience that the Bible did not teach of a new world. Three of his staunch members knew better because they had made a personal study of it with the witnesses, and news has been received that one is definitely standing for the Kingdom. To cover this island it was necessary to walk as much as nine miles out. One brother went three miles to an isolated home and found little interest at first. Then one woman in the home brightened up and said, “Let me feel the book.” Strange but true, the only interested woman was totally blind and she took the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth&quot;. </span><span class="font7">Then at night she with two others walked the three miles to the public meeting. The night was very dark, but they went home enlightened. At Simms, Long Island, we were greeted on the wharf by a minister of the Brethren religion. All smiles, he shook hands with us, but when we told him of our mission he dashed away to warn his flock of the ‘false prophets’ who would be coming to their homes. One poor woman was so impressed by the man’s conduct that she came to our public meeting and expressed her disapproval of her minister’s action. Here it was, too, that a man apparently suffering from cancer of the face was contacted. He was told we were Jehovah’s witnesses. He reflected, “Jehovah’s witnesses, Jehovah’s witnesses—they’s the only true people.” And, springing from his chair, he went across the room and picked up an old book, well thumbed and eaten by insects. “It’s in this book, Jehovah is in here, Jehovah’s witnesses.” The book? </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation.</span><span class="font7"> We left the new book with him as a gift and his appreciation was touching indeed. The local Brethren minister had not given him much hope, but Jehovah, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">His</span><span class="font7"> people and their publications have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we anchored at Clarence Town, long distances had to be covered on foot. Two of the pioneers, one 75 and the other 54 years old, with one of the missionaries, all women, walked out twelve miles one day, witnessing all the way and returning about 9 p.m., tired, of course, but happy in the knowledge that they had carried the Word of life to many for the first time in history. The whole of Long Island was worked from three anchorages, only so much walking had to be done throughout its sixty miles. On December 7 we returned to Nassau to report our first month’s work. We had covered 43 settlements, placed 255 books, 294 booklets, held 19 meetings and traveled 362 miles on foot and 240 miles by other means, while the vessel did 586.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Other islands were visited, such as Cat Island, Spanish Wells, Harbour Island, Eleuthera, San Salvador and Crooked Island. Then a trip was made down to the Caribbean and good interest was found everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This past year, including our visit to the Bahamas, we have covered 135 settlements and small towns on 27 islands. The time spent in traveling was 27 days and the mileage, 4,755 by sea. The total anchorages made was 91. The crew placed 728 books, 922 booklets, 32 subscriptions and 642 magazines, and made 1,092 back-calls and conducted 183 studies and 135 public meetings in 4,042 hours. They also put in 170 hours of repair work on the boat.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark194"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">When one’s heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah, a tremendous work can be accomplished in his name. Certainly our brothers in Argentina are not afraid of the evil tidings or the trouble that exists, but they move on with Jehovah’s witnesses in other parts of the earth, reaching new heights month after month. The brothers there have had nine peaks in publishers during the past year. Additions have been made to the special pioneer ranks, circuit servant arrangements have been improved, the isolated publishers are being met and assisted and the other sheep are being gathered. It certainly must make a circuit servant feel happy when he meets a person, isolated from the Society for years, who says he has received a letter from the Society’s branch office saying that the circuit servant would be coming. Perhaps this will be the first one of Jehovah’s witnesses he has spoken to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What a joy it must be to see the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True”</span><span class="font8"> all dog-eared and practically worn out from study. Then when the circuit servant talks to the person about service, pointing out that the people in the neighborhood should be spoken to about the Kingdom, and the isolated person says that he has already done that, what joy the circuit servant must feel! With that attitude among the other sheep the work of Jehovah must go on. It is our pleasure to gather them together into the New World society, and this is being done at a good pace in Argentina. The branch servant there sends in a splendid report of the work done during the service year of 1954, and excerpts from his report follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In five different cities where no work was being done we now have 25 publishers working. In one case two special pioneers were assigned to a very weak congregation that was reporting only three publishers and, after three months of work by these brothers, 20 publishers are reporting. We hope to see greater increases through the work of these pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The general pioneers are doing a very good work, and at the end of this year we shall have to take only two off the list for not making their time. Vacation pioneer work under the new system has been taken up by 20 brothers during this year, and 20 are on the list for the months of September and October. The comments of some of these brothers are: “It has been a great joy for me to take advantage of this provision of the Society so that congregation publishers can be pioneers some time during the year.” “As a congregation publisher I had no studies, but after one month as a vacation pioneer I have so many that I have to turn them over to other publishers.” Reports coming in from the circuit servants show that many more are planning to engage in this service during the summer months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The long-waited-for visit with you and Brother Henschel finally came in December. Arrangements were made to visit almost all the country as has already been reported in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> This visit has proved to be a great aid in further preparation for a better and cleaner organization. The counsel given and instructions to divide the country into nine circuits with nine servants visiting the congregations, isolated publishers and interested ones every four months has proved to be a great aid in getting the training program in working order, thus helping the brothers to maturity. This can be seen in all congregations and the regularity of the reports in the last few months. The circuit servants have visited people who before had contact with the organization only through the mail. They have all been visited and shown in a practical way what to do, and since then many of these interested people report regularly to the office. At the beginning of this service year there were 25 isolated publishers reporting and, in the month of August, 61 did so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Following out the instructions that you gave, we had 12 circuit assemblies during the year. I visited these assemblies and gave the same talk that you gave when here. The organization has improved 100 per cent in almost every way. Reports are coming into the office in very good condition. This is due to the good work of the circuit servants. One point that was emphasized at the assemblies was a clean organization. The marriage problem was taken up in a talk showing what must be done, how and what the congregation had to do with these cases. This has caused quite a stir in some of the congregations but has brought results. More than 20 couples that we know of who were living in common-law marriage have gotten married. The brothers are still commenting on these talks. They have set a proper example before those who are coming into the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The placement of more magazines was emphasized after your visit, and for several months we were able to pass the quota of eight magazines per publisher. Taking into consideration the average of 2,939 publishers, we have placed during the year 7.6 magazines per publisher per month. We are pleased to report 2,211 more new subscriptions than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not all has gone so well. It was necessary to take one special pioneer and four general pioneers off the list, three in the same congregation and one in another, because of rebellion against the organization. Two were disfellowshiped by the local congregations. In the case of Rio Cuarto that you know about, these that have gone against the organization have taken about 40 more with them, but this has not affected the zeal and spirit of the faithful brothers. They are going on and are having many blessings from Jehovah for their faithful service. This clearly shows that one cannot stray from the organization and hope to continue on. It is as Jesus said: ‘The branch cut off from the trunk will dry up.’ So it is in the case of these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The film “The New World Society in Action” has been received as a wonderful provision from Jehovah through his visible organization. We have shown the film 54 times and 2,805 persons have seen it. The comments of most are as follows: “Organization not only in the United States but in Africa too!” “It is the spirit of Jehovah that makes it possible.” “How the brothers work! I feel ashamed!” Others cannot find words to express their thoughts. A person that was visited after seeing the film was found talking about how the directors of the Society work, even making ink! In several cases people seeing the film have started in the service. Others have asked that the publishers come and study with them. We still have to show the film about 150 times before we cover all the congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The field is big, but we are determined by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness to reach every last sheep in the territory and to bring them within the bounds of the New World society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark195"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The work of Jehovah’s witnesses has once again made fine progress during the service year of 1954 in Australia. The year was full of many new things, which proved to be an impetus to the brothers. Like the brothers in other parts of the world they received the new releases from the Yankee Stadium assembly and were delighted with the training program that was there outlined. Our Australian brothers were indeed pleased with the magazine campaign that was inaugurated. The use of the film “The New World Society in Action” has stimulated the servants of the Most High to greater action. Great work has taken place, not only on the mainland of Australia, but good reports also have come from the outlying territory of American Samoa, Fiji, Papua, Solomon Islands and Western Samoa. All the experiences are heartcheering and will stimulate Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the rest of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As an echo of the New World Society Assembly held in New York city the Australian brothers held an assembly in Melbourne. This was the greatest assembly of Jehovah’s people ever held in Australia and truly mirrored the joy and magnitude of the Yankee Stadium assembly. The branch servant sends in a very interesting report, and excerpts covering all parts of their territory are given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For example, the training program as outlined by the Society’s president was launched. Circuit and district servants got a grip on the role they were assigned; publishers gladly accepted the part they were to play. The stage was set and the organization went into motion. Now, after months of diligent application, the stamp of improved quality appears on the presentation of interesting sermons as publishers skillfully execute the command to preach. Over a thousand more persons became house-to-house preachers of the good news during the year, a big forward step indeed! It means that 87 per cent of the total associated are now going from house to house! Considering that 879 were immersed, the highest number for any one year to date, we have a good reserve to draw on for stepping up the training program, aiming for a progressive turnover to augment the ranks of trained personnel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Melbourne convention also set the pace for opening the public relations field on a wider scale. Both press and radio gave the national assembly good coverage. Since then, publicity given to circuit and district assemblies has followed a similar pattern. At one city the district servant was interviewed twice in the same afternoon by the local radio station, the first interview covering high lights of the New York world assembly and the second giving listeners information about the purpose of the local circuit assembly. One newspaper editor voiced warm appreciation in behalf of the assembly, since it provided such an excellent news source, and then complimented the brothers on the interesting style of their news releases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Vast stretches of unassigned territory have again been covered. Two full-time servants covered 5,500 miles while working a stretch of territory taking in the coastal and inland areas of the sparsely populated northwest part of Australia. In nine weeks they placed nearly seven cartons of books, over a thousand booklets and magazines and obtained 127 subscriptions while calling at sheep stations, lighthouses, oil fields, road workers’ camps and many towns and villages. At a whaling station the manager gave permission to witness to the men during working hours, provided a guide to show the brothers around, suggested that a union representative announce the talk to be given that night and arranged for the brothers to be furnished with meals and a cottage for the night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At a sheep station, while having tea with the manager and his wife, the publishers read scriptures and pointed out features of the books being offered. At the conclusion of the presentation the manager took the books and two subscriptions; then his wife commented: “Two weeks ago we had a Salvation Army captain here but we didn’t like his attitude. When a minister visits us we expect him to say a prayer ... or read some of the Bible to us, as you have done, but he only talked of how big the checks were that other stations had given him as donations and fished to see how much we would give.” It is not difficult to see the difference between the ‘lovers of money’ and those who really ‘love their neighbor as themselves.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Everywhere the publishers are becoming magazineconscious. They are taking the quota seriously and obtaining subscriptions at every opportunity. Such an attitude helped to make our </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> campaign the best yet, 30 per cent more subscriptions being obtained, to compare with the previous year. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> subscriptions showed a 48 per cent better figure. Growing appreciation is manifest for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> which is outstripping all other magazines in the field of vital knowledge. In one isolated area an interested woman who had read the Society’s literature before subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> as soon as the offer was presented. Pointedly she observed: “When there is a magazine like this about, who would ever want to read a newspaper?” Right! There is literally a world of difference between the two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A single copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> packs more than enough truth to start one on the narrow road, depending on whether it is placed or not. As the following experience shows, a single copy did its work after being placed by a publisher with a woman as they traveled together. “After some time we were surprised to receive a letter from her stating that she had carefully read the magazine, checked the scriptures in her Bible and was particularly interested in the article ‘Christ’s Second Presence No False Alarm.’ She asked for a subscription and requested a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’ </span><span class="font7">and mentioned she was going to T---in a few weeks,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">so wanted to know the address of the witnesses there. In our reply we told her of the circuit assembly to be held in C----about the same time as her visit, and if</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">she wanted to attend we would arrange accommodation for her with one of the sisters. Imagine our pleasant surprise to receive a telegram from her which read: ‘T--- trip postponed, please arrange accommodation</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">in C---Although the assembly was 300 miles from</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">her home she made a special effort to attend. Though she arrived at the assembly city with some misgivings as to how she would like it, these soon disappeared. She joined in house-to-house witnessing and really enjoyed herself. Now she is planning to attend the district assembly next month.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before the service year ended, the showing of the Society’s film began here. Astounding has been the effect! Repeatedly, people marvel at the magnitude of the organization’s activity. One lady remarked: “What a lot of trouble you people go to in order to help others understand the Bible. That’s real Christianity/’</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark196"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark197"></a>AMERICAN SAMOA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In this small territory the message of God’s Word spreads like a bush fire fanned by a stiff breeze. Daily the people love to discuss Bible topics. When approaching a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">fale</span><span class="font7"> (Samoan house) a generally hospitable type of native invites you inside to take a seat on the floor and tell him why you are there, what Bible you use and whether your teaching is according to the Samoan Bible. Frequently a very lively discussion will commence there and then, perhaps to refute a false rumor spread by the clergy, or maybe the person will listen attentively and then ask questions. The people have been taught the usual false doctrines, so these come up for discussion. But no topic appeals so much as the blessings of the Kingdom rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the new publishers just starting out is a schoolteacher. His friends were amazed at the knowledge this man had gained from the Bible since taking up his “new religion,” as they called it. Once he was not quite able to answer all the questions propounded to him, so he called on the pioneers for help. There was a nice little audience of teachers eagerly waiting when the pioneers arrived. That night many of their troublesome questions were answered and, when scriptures were referred to in support of the witness being given, the entire group would check their Bibles to make sure of the correctness of the message. On the next visit the principal of the school said to the pioneer: “You know what happened the day after you were here last time? Well, we just had to know more, so I called that teacher preacher of yours and we studied the Bible for almost the whole day!”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>FIJI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Once a settlement of true worship is established firmly it can grow and spread out. The work in Fiji has grown and is now spreading out. For several years the brothers concentrated their activity in the principal city of Suva, for the most part. During the past year they have been able to spread out over the length and breadth of the main island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The training work is under way here too, and the Bible is being used to good advantage. A young pioneer sister took along a less experienced publisher in the work to demonstrate how to witness with the Bible. At one Fijian home they were invited inside. While they read aloud from God’s Word, the occupants in the adjoining room came in, making up a group of nine who were listening. After the sermon and placement of several Fijian booklets the pioneer asked if anyone had any questions. One of the group replied: “What else can we say? That is the plain truth from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Vola Tabu </span><span class="font7">[Bible].” The two publishers were invited to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Visitors come to Fiji from other Pacific islands and are often contacted by the publishers. A pioneer brother working unassigned territory met a schoolteacher from one of the far-flung islands of the Fiji group and writes concerning his experience. “I was surprised when the schoolteacher told me he already had the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’,</span><span class="font7"> as he had been in Suva only a few weeks. He told me it was a very good book, but asked for more information about the soul. As I explained the subject his face beamed with joy to hear the simple truth. After dealing with other topics he said: ‘Your Society’s explanation of the Bible is the truth and far in advance of any religious teaching I have ever heard. This is the most important kind of study.’ We arranged to start a study the following week. Before leaving him I asked where he had read the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’. </span><span class="font7">Away out on his little island he had come across the book on a shelf in a preacher’s home. Truly none of the sheep will be missed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among Fiji’s mixed population there are inhabitants from other islands of the South Pacific area, such as the Gilbert, Ellice and Union groups. Sometimes, after having studies in their homes here, some of these folks return to their own islands. From letters received by local relatives and friends in Fiji it is apparent that there are people in the Gilbert Islands who are talking about the Kingdom and coming together for study. One person of this group gives an account of how he had to appear before a government official to explain the work and organization of Jehovah’s witnesses because of the mendacious accusations made against them. The official being a fair-minded man saw nothing harmful about the peaceful Christian work that this person of good will was doing and told him that the work could continue and, if any future trouble should arise, he should report the matter. The seed of truth is being sown abundantly in this scattered field, much of it has been watered and Jehovah has given the increase.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark199"></a>PAPUA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The chapter on “The New Earth” from the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> was translated into Motu and mimeograph copies made up. This provision has been received with great delight, and it is surprising how much good has already been accomplished in teaching the people with the two hundred copies that have been placed. Our hope is that more translating can be done in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first baptism of Jehovah’s people in Papua was held at the Laloki River, about 17 miles from Port Moresby. A jeep, car and utility provided the mode of transport used to convey the brothers close to the immersion place. The villagers cut a pathway through the lush jungle growth to the river. Everything seemed just right for the occasion. The day was glorious, the surroundings fresh and clean, only the call of the various birds and the soft song of the water breaking the peaceful silence as thirteen persons symbolized their dedication to Jehovah. The immersion took place at high noon, a time too hot for the crocodiles to interfere. The day’s events were thrilling and showed the fruits of the work that had been produced in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another high light during the year was the Memorial celebration. There were forty-flve in attendance, to compare with eleven a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A study is conducted with the Karema people; theirs is a very difficult language, but they understand enough English and Motu to enjoy learning of the new world. Sometimes five languages are used at this study, which is also attended by the Chimbu people of good will. Only for a few years have the Chimbu natives had many dealings with the Europeans, but now some of the men are learning the truth. One man particularly understands quite well and translates from pidgin English into the Chimbu language.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>SOLOMON ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Tracts have been an excellent means of getting things started. One day a native called in to see a brother and tell him he had read the tract </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a New World. </span><span class="font7">More Bible truth was thereupon explained and the publisher pointed out interesting items from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Report</span><span class="font7"> of the New World Society Assembly. The native was greatly impressed and took special note of a picture showing a colored brother baptizing a white person. All this led to further discussion and the placement of a new Bible and a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In addition to the work being accomplished by this lone publisher the branch office keeps in touch with interested persons located in other parts of this group of islands who write in from time to time requesting literature. For the benefit of one such good-will person seeking to understand the Bible, arrangements have been made for him to correspond with a publisher in Australia. The Australian brother is confined to a wheel chair in his home, but he puts in pioneer hours writing hundreds of letters and sending out literature to isolated persons. In this way a Bible study can be carried on through the mails to help the individuals in the islands.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>WESTERN SAMOA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">A fine spirit of appreciation for the organization was manifest during the branch servant’s brief visit early in the service year. For three consecutive evenings, servants and publishers assembled to receive valuable and practical information at the time of this visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even though the publishers making up the congregation are relatively new, their preaching is effective. One day a Seventh-day Adventist follower was contacted. On hearing the message he went to the Bible for proof, just like the noble-minded Bereans of Paul’s day. Later a Bible study was started and it was not long until he became a happy and zealous publisher. When sent for by the Seventh-day Adventist pastor, this new publisher just forwarded his resignation from the ‘church,’ informing the pastor that some day he would be able to understand this action better if he was humble enough to hear the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Four of the tracts have been translated into Samoan and printed. So the publishers now have something to leave with the native population, although quite a few in the territory understand English.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark203"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s Word says: “For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.” (Rom. 10: 10, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> Our brothers in Austria have faith and they express this faith to others by continually preaching the Word. Good results have been attained, too, because they have had an 11 per cent increase and 564 symbolized their dedication to Jehovah God by water baptism during the year. They are paying attention to themselves and trying to improve their service by attending meetings and helping one another in the field service. Those who are the more able ministers are helping the weaker ones. The branch servant gives us a few experiences as to how this is being accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The training program brings good fruits as the report from a circuit servant shows: “The last time when I visited this small place with only 2,500 inhabitants, there were 30 active publishers. Because the servants and mature brothers worked in harmony together, encouraging and admonishing the irregular publishers and taking them along in the service, the number of publishers increased month by month, and at my following visit a new peak of 51 publishers was reached. In six months there was an increase from 30 to 51, and 50 of these are house-to-house publishers! This certainly proves the zeal and joy of the brothers, all of whom meet regularly in the Kingdom Hall although their homes are scattered in the rural territory and they have to walk long distances.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How a well-trained publisher is able to assist sincere people to find the way to life can be seen by the experience of a sister who works as a missionary near the border of Yugoslavia. When climbing up the hills to visit the small mountain farms, she found a vinedresser surrounded by some farm workers. The priest had just warned against us, but now they heard the good news of the new world. “One is lying,” the vinedresser said dryly, and to the surprise of the others, as he never liked reading, he took the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”.</span><span class="font7"> Pointing at the sister’s Bible, he said: “And the large book I must have too. I don’t have the money now, but will later.” At the following back-call he had already read half of the book and wanted the sister to explain what the figures meant. When she showed him how these point to the scriptures, he was really happy to get a new Bible from her. At the next visit she helped him again, studying the book by looking up the texts in the Bible, and when he was able to find them alone he enjoyed it like having received a great treasure. On the third visit he had finished the book and was going to lend it to one of his workmen who also was interested. He said: “Everything in it is good, and imagine, last Sunday the priest said we should turn you out when you came again. This made me really angry. But I know, he is only afraid that soon we shall know more than he does, if we get acquainted with the Bible.” After a study about the name of Jehovah, and an explanation about the first chapters of the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind 1</span><span class="font7"> he gladly took this book also. He really wanted to come down to the next public talk, and he was the first in the hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Good training also enables us to give an intelligent testimony and to arouse interest for the truth on different occasions. A brother described what joy and blessings resulted from this. He had been sitting in an office waiting for an official and watching for an opportunity to speak about the Kingdom. It soon came, when the clerk there began to complain about the weather and the many catastrophes. As the brother had the Bible and some literature with him it was easy to comfort the man, showing him in Matthew 24 and other scriptures what these signs meant. All at once the clerk took the telephone and called on the officials and directors of different departments, asking them to come with those working in their department, because there was a Bible student in his office. In one minute the room was full. They listened for a while, then began asking questions, one after the other, so that the brother had quite a job to keep up with them. The interest was so great that he placed what he had, namely, three books and several booklets besides a number of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font7">and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines, and he was asked to call at least every second week in the office to spend with them their two-hour lunch time, in order to teach them more about the Kingdom. Of course, he is only too glad to use this splendid opportunity.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark204"></a>BAHAMAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Many persons in the Bahama Islands recognize that Jehovah’s witnesses are teaching the truth; but many of the individuals, while believing we have the truth, do not want to follow it, because they must make too big a change in their way of life. It has puzzled some of the brothers to find that, even after studying with some persons for a long time, the persons will not take up the work of preaching the good news. One of the big reasons is that the step is too great. It is necessary for them to change their moral conduct; also they are afraid of what people will say. Certainly fear is a snare to these people. But despite this there are some who are beginning to come forward and become ministers of Christ Jesus. One thing that gave these islands a great stimulus was the visit of the boat “Faith” and another boat owned by some pioneers. A great witness has been given in these islands this past year, and this will undoubtedly be reflected in next year’s reports. Many islands were reached where the truth has seldom been preached and the missionaries hope to get over the whole Bahama group before the next year is over. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences, which show how differently the work can be carried on in these islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year much of our Out Island territory was covered. The working of it came about this way: The Society’s boat Faith came to spend a short three months with us here and was accompanied by a boat owned by a brother from Canada. Twelve islands were worked and four others partially covered. This left eight yet to be covered, including the Turks and Caicos, which were recently added to our territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many heartening experiences were had as the island folk were called upon. To advertise a public meeting all that was necessary was to step ashore and announce to the curious bystanders that a Bible talk would be given that evening, and the news was heralded to the far corners of the settlement. Public meetings were delivered under large shady trees, in breezy schoolrooms, on public thoroughfares, in churches, in private homes, in an American Air Force recreation hall, from the boat and on beaches under the palms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While working a settlement, a pioneer sister was continually asked when the “sermon” was to be. So at 3:45 p.m., when the two missionary brothers returned from working a settlement farther away, they were asked about it, and it was decided to have an early talk in the schoolyard at 4:30 p.m., because of the long journey by dinghy back to the boat. The teacher opened up the school for the talk and an audience of 45 strangers listened to the Bible’s wise counsel on marriage. These people were reluctant to let the brothers go, and about twenty persons followed them to the dock, asking questions all the while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Faith moved on to its assignment farther south while the other boat stayed. It is of great assistance in working the islands. Many publishers traveled on this boat to a circuit assembly on the island of Eleuthera. This assembly did much to stir up interest in the truth because of the Christian love evinced by the brothers. The clean habits, the quiet pleasantness of the group, the peace and unity admittedly existing in no other organization, the assembly program, the film “The New World Society in Action” and the unaffected brotherly love shown between the two races, colored and white, were all commented on by the inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Assemblies are important in our way of life, for they assist others to see the truth and the New World society blessed by Jehovah. When Brother Henschel was in Nassau for the assembly in May, many good things were laid before us and, as a result, two young men have taken a strong stand for the truth. One had been drifting along, coming to meetings seldom, not really caring much for the service of Jehovah. Now a difference is manifest: he has a keen appreciation of the organization, comes to all meetings with his lessons prepared and attends group efforts when possible. The other young man had worked with one of the brothers who had spoken to him concerning true worship. He attended a few meetings but had had no Bible study. After attending the assembly he decided this was the only organization to be with and so became a regular attender of meetings and began accompanying the brothers in the field service. This stand is not without opposition, for both the Anglican canon and his parents loudly register their disapproval. One day he had an hour’s session with family and priest. Finally the priest asked how it came to be that he knew so much, having been associated with Jehovah’s witnesses for such a short time. The young “service companion” replied that Jehovah’s witnesses do not waste time but are busy studying.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark205"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Those in the New World society in Belgium had another joyful year in theocratic service. The newly elected government does not show prejudice against Jehovah’s witnesses. One of the government ministers sent a fine letter to the Society, saying that as long as we carry on a charitable and nonprofit work our placing of Bibles and Bible publications will not be considered as peddling. This has helped the brothers in pushing forward in their activity, for now they have less opposition. The branch office in Brussels looks after the work in Belgium and also Luxembourg. It is good to observe that both of these countries had an increase in publishers during the year. More persons have been baptized during the past two years than is shown by the publisher increase, so the responsibility falls upon the witnesses in Belgium to follow through and give proper training and instruction to these new ones and thus bring them on to maturity. This is a responsibility resting upon all Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world. Let us see what the branch servant has to say in his report for the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Belgium in the same year we always have two district assemblies because of the two languages that are spoken by the Belgians. In 1953 we started a new thing—going from door to door to obtain rooms. We hope, if possible, to eliminate having brothers sleep on straw in halls and such places, because by staying in the homes of the people a greater and more effective witness can be given, more people come to our conventions and more people prove to be other sheep. New experiences were had as a result of this special house-to-house work. One family contacted in this work hesitated to offer rooms, thinking that perhaps Jehovah’s witnesses would not be nice people. On Saturday of the assembly, this family, together with their “roomers,” were at the assembly. After having been asked if their “roomers” were nice people, they replied with much joy: “We have been very fortunate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A wonderful occasion was offered at the Flemish-and French-speaking district assemblies for showing the Society’s film “The New World Society in Action.” This was a nice opportunity for the brothers to invite their landladies. New peaks of attendance were obtained. The film is very encouraging for all who see it. More people realize that Jehovah’s organization is not an organization like those of the old world. All are amazed. Our branch sent a circuit servant to congregations to show the film in his free time. One congregation, which, in 1949, had an average of 77 at their weekly </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study had, in September, 1954, an attendance of 372 to see the film. Three units now exist in this town. Two towns in which no congregation exists but in which special pioneers are working reached an attendance of 38 and 30 for the showing of the film. One Sunday, when the film was scheduled to be shown for two congregations, the morning was spent in the house-to-house work. A brother placed a book with a widow and she was invited to see the film. The brother suggested coming to call for her, but she did not agree that he come, because of the neighbors, but, if a woman would call, then she would come. Arrangements were made for a sister to call for her. The widow rejoiced to see the film and, perhaps encouraged by the fact that so many subscriptions are handled in the Brooklyn factory, she subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> Arrangements were also made to visit her regularly for studying our publications with the Bible. In another congregation a stranger who saw the film exclaimed: “Never did I think that Jehovah’s witnesses had such an organization!” Jehovah knows what we need and that is why he gave us the film. This film can be seen two, three, five or ten times. It never becomes monotonous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So we are now looking forward to another year of service with greater prospects of service, the 1955 assemblies, the visit of Brother Knorr and our foreign brothers, new people, and new opportunities to preach the good news. We are sure that, if we look intently toward Jehovah and his visible organization, then he will give the increase.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark206"></a>LUXEMBOURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">One may wonder how the Kingdom publishers learn of the truth. Here are two experiences by the missionaries working in this land. &quot;We studied the Bible for a while with a woman, but her husband did not have the desire to interest himself in the truth. One day an acquaintance told the missionaries that this woman’s husband had told him, ‘There must be something about these Jehovah’s witnesses. They have been studying the Bible for a while with my wife and now she is becoming more and more content. In the past I brought only a little money home—now she doesn’t complain any more!’ The man now attends the meetings. Who knows but that this woman, by her Christian conduct, can fulfill what is written in 1 Corinthians 7:13, 16?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A missionary couple relates: “While we were witnessing from door to door, a busy lady was met who took the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Way Is Love,</span><span class="font7"> with the promise to read it carefully. One week later my wife and I made a back-call there and soon were taken into the drawing room. The lady had read the booklet and had found that there is a great difference between our beliefs and hers. But, said she, ‘I must confess that yours is a very intelligent religion.’ She listened attentively to our witness and wished to hear and read more, so some copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> were left. At our second call she ordered a ‘good’ Bible and the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’.</span><span class="font7"> This book she read through in less than two weeks. ‘I can’t pray any more the way I was taught as a Catholic. I know now that this has been wrong and that’s why I was never satisfied. I start to pray to Jehovah,’ she said, and wished to see us regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“These regular visits developed into a vivid study. We showed her how to study the chapters of the book in order to be prepared for our weekly meeting. Our study runs fast now and most of the answers are given by heart. In less than three months she read the whole Bible through, besides her study of the book and the regular reading of our magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Truth is powerful when it is taken to heart. It changes the whole life and casts out many sorrows and fears. It cleanses a person. So it was with this lady. She, for instance, wondered why we do not smoke when a cigarette is offered to us, and whether all Jehovah’s witnesses do not smoke. As it happened, I had a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> in my bag which shows why Christians do not smoke. She read it and herself stopped smoking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Relatives that observed the change in her and her growing joy of life think it would be good if others of their family would get that ‘news’ too. They do get it if they just like it, because that sheep’s heart begins to overflow with joy.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark207"></a>BOLIVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The brothers in Bolivia have real cause for rejoicing in the growth of the New World society, for they see its growth in their land this year. High in the mountains of the Andes we see many ‘fleeing to the mountains’ for security. They are not hiding in the Andes but rather turning to Jehovah’s organization. Many of the other sheep have been helped this year, and Bolivia has had its finest increase, reaching a new peak of 177. The Society has 31 missionaries working in the land and these are doing everything they can to help these other sheep become mature and also to keep on gathering others who are sighing and crying for the abominations they see. The branch servant sets out some interesting experiences that our </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font8"> readers will enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As in other countries Bolivian school children have their vacations, and a missionary from Cochabamba tells how some of the young publishers “made wise use of their time.” “The children wished to use their time in field service, so special arrangments were made to go out in the nearby ‘campo.’ Not only did the children come along but also many adults. Indeed it was a successful day. One lady offered her home for public talks, which have since been put on with many of the neighboring people in attendance; but the real thrill was to have 26 publishers along for a full day of service. This was a great joy to us missionaries, as last year our peak of publishers was only 17.” This year the peak for Cochabamba was 47 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the high lights of theocratic activity during the year was the New World Society assembly with the visit of Brother Henschel to La Paz, in early December. Following the notice sent out to the various congregations and isolated persons of good will, arrangements got under way for what was to prove the largest and best assembly yet in Bolivia. A greater number of brothers from the interior towns attended than at any previous assembly, swelling the attendance Saturday to a peak of 120. On Sunday 160 heard the public talk “After Armageddon—God’s New World.” The brothers thrilled to hear the truth-packed discourses and particularly those of Brother Henschel, which encouraged them to become expansion-minded. Several with hearing ears and an honest desire to serve Jehovah filed pioneer applications after the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But as the service year progressed and we had our circuit assembly in Cochabamba in June, even greater theocratic expansion was manifest. Due to experience gained from our previous assembly we were better able to organize the various departments and features for smooth running, which made quite an impression on the brothers in attendance. Upward of 130 persons attended the earlier sessions of the assembly and an all-time peak for public meeting attendance was reached when, on Sunday, 195 persons packed the hall to hear the talk “Is Civilization’s End Near?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The circuit servant relates an interesting experience from his visit to an isolated tin-mining town to contact an elderly brother who at one time was associated with the La Paz congregation. This brother now endeavors to help a number of persons of good will to study and come to an understanding of the truth, and several are even accompanying him in the field service. When the circuit servant arrived inquiries were made about using the local hall of the syndicate of mine workers for a public talk. The young man in charge obtained the hall for the hour talk and also arranged to have it broadcast by the syndicate’s radio station. Handbills were quickly printed and distributed around the town. That evening some fifty persons attended and listened attentively to the talk, and it is hoped that the elderly brother will find much more interest now in his efforts to aid others in serving Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Bolivia is very happy to be one of the countries reporting theocratic expansion for this past service year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark208"></a>BRAZIL.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The business of Jehovah’s witnesses is preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. The advice from God’s Word is: “Do not loiter at your business. Be aglow with the spirit.” (Rom. 12:11, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses were not loitering in Brazil during the past twelve months. Almost a thousand more persons were making Jehovah’s business their business by being diligent ministers. In looking over the Brazilian report it was observed that when there was a lack of capable men available to serve as circuit servants the work in the neglected sections suffered. There is always a real need for mature brothers to take up the full-time service and to accept the added responsibilities that go with the privileges of being a circuit servant or congregation servant. The committee in the congregation, too, must be on the alert to see that the congregation is kept clean and those within the congregation are kept busy. It was observed that 45 brothers were disfellowshiped in Brazil because of wrong action, but this proceeding strengthened the organization. Of course, such action does bring pain and difficulties to the congregation, but when all realize that what is being done is Jehovah’s will and that the very life of the organization depends on its spirituality, its cleanness and its devotion to service, then such things can take place with profit to the congregation. Despite the difficulties within the congregations and the great stress within the country itself, Jehovah’s witnesses have shown neighbor love to all who will accept it. Excerpts from the report of the branch servant show the zeal and action of our fellow workers in Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the high lights of this year was your visit with Brother Henschel, which has already been covered in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> It added new impetus to expansion. In spite of a slow start and not reaching our 10 per cent increase of average publishers until April, four months late, the publishers individually did their part to reach a 15 per cent increase over average and a 29 per cent peak, which brought the year to a climax with 7,438 in the field. August also brought the total baptized to 1,220. By following through on your suggestions to increase the size of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> and by encouragement through the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font7"> the demands from the field taxed our printing facilities to the limit as monthly magazine production jumped from 33,700 to 57,760 in eight months. Our subscription campaign was the best yet. Some congregations have set up their own delivery system, thus not letting the obstacle of poor mail delivery service stop theocratic progress. We are thankful for the new linotype machine and anxiously await other equipment to facilitate our work. Correspondence handled here in the office has increased tremendously in the last few months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We attribute the progress shown to various factors: a wave of circuit assemblies, a full-time district servant, new literature, the new film “The New World Society in Action,” a cleanup in the different parts of the organization and sending missionaries out into unassigned territory. Our lack of greater progress seems to lie in weak congregation book-study organization, much illiteracy and the lack of a full team of mature circuit servants in the field month after month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The office felt that it would be well to have an assembly in the interior in a river city, isolated territory without publishers. A huge tobacco factory, closed four years ago, was transformed before the eyes of the 11,000 local inhabitants as if by a miracle. From a ruins came forth a huge, beautiful Kingdom Hall painted inside and out with whitewash. A close-by building was also given a face lifting. Sisters slept on the third floor, brothers on the second and the assembly departments were on the ground floor. One visitor said, “So you folks are making installations to stay indefinitely, huh?” On receiving a negative answer, he shook his head in wonderment. “Spend that much money for only three days? I guess I don’t understand.” He did not know that it was not so much the money; it was really the zeal and faith of the brothers that caused them to remove about ten truckloads of old rotten tobacco mixed with dust. It was their love for Jehovah and their neighbor that caused them to pipe in water, wash the floor, install toilet facilities and electricity, make a huge primitive-type cookstove and paint the building inside and out. Brothers to the number of 250 arrived by chartered river steamer. Another 250 brothers came by regular boat and train. Field service was not forgotten as the small army of 440 publishers went out to bless Jehovah’s name each day. Gog’s local religionists were filled with his envious spirit and the loud-speakers of the church began to say: “Be careful with these people that have invaded our city! Don’t listen to them.” All this to no avail. Attendants at the public lecture numbered 898; and guess how many turned out to see “The New World Society in Action”? One thousand? one thousand five hundred? Oh, no, but a total of 2,500 people filled the hall, overflowed onto the sidewalk, onto the cobblestone street, blocking the traffic; and most wonderful of all is that 217 persons gave their names to be visited at their homes. Is this not surprising? Yes, thanks to Jehovah for his pleasant surprises! Be assured that the new film has done much to bring some into the truth and to strengthen yet more those that already know about the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font7"> vacation pioneer said: “Here is something that makes my heart glad. A deacon in the Pentecostal church with whom I had studied for a year invited me to attend a prayer meeting in his house, after which he presented me to the local minister, saying, ‘This fellow, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, asked me a question on the trinity which I haven’t answered yet. Would you like to answer for me?’ The shepherd of the flock did not say anything, but listened, and a little later invited me to give a talk in his small church, which I gladly did. After a series of talks a number of studies were started, including one with the pastor himself. The deacon has come right into the truth as a house-to-house publisher. The preacher did not show such rapid progress, but found himself unable to preach to his small congregation and offered to let the brothers take over his small chapel for use as a meeting place. The offer was accepted and the hall is already dedicated to Jehovah’s service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then, too, it seems important to preserve the mission</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ary </span><span class="font7">spirit that meant so much to the primitive Christian congregation. We have gladly followed your suggestion to move the missionaries out into the interior towns. After only two months in the new assignment a sister writes the following: “A dentist took a book and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font7">the mention of a possible return call requested that the missionary come to his family residence. Two weeks later a home Bible study was started by demonstrating how Jehovah’s witnesses study the Bible. ‘Look,’ they said, ‘if it’s too much trouble to come here every week, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font7">can go to your missionary home to study.’ They are or, rather, were Methodists, pillars in the local church. After a few studies they began to take up every free night by taking us to visit their friends and relatives. Studies resulted as he, his wife and two children went along. Imagine how pleased we were to hear him say to his brother-in-law, ‘Did you know that Christ had a beginning? Do you know what God’s name is?’ Yes, until this day, they are still coming around to ‘take </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">us</span><span class="font7"> out in the service.’ ”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark209"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">No matter where anyone in the New World society finds himself he does not feel isolated. Whether located at a remote riverside, on a farm or in a small village surrounded by Moslems, Hindus or others, one of Jehovah’s witnesses still feels very much a part of the New World society. He knows he does not stand alone. The publishers in British Guiana have had some very fine increases during the past year and there has been good reason for it. The work was more tightly organized and the Society’s film “The New World Society in Action” was shown with very telling effect on the people in British Guiana. Undoubtedly we shall see healthy advancement in the years to come in British Guiana and more people will be practicing the true worship of the Sovereign Ruler. The branch servant gives us some interesting items, which are reported here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That Jehovah’s blessing was upon the many recommendations made by Brothers Knorr and Henschel during their four-day visit in January is evident by the far-reaching effects we now see. This was reported upon in the August 1 issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> which, incidentally, was given a circulation in the colony of three times the usual number. The organizing of three circuits instead of one allows for many isolated brothers to be visited every four months by a Gilead graduate, and they can also arrange to get to two circuit assemblies annually. But one of the greatest contributions to expansion has been that many brothers, by giving constant attention to their teaching, have let their advancement become manifest to all persons. Instead of depending so much upon the missionaries there are many others who take the oversight as all-round theocratic servants and thus more congregations can be established. An example is Georgetown, the capital, now increased to three units, and from 156 publishers a year ago to 220 publishers now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is encouraging to see the faithful activity of publishers in remote places who, although not yet able to receive the encouragement possible through larger congregations, still come right in step with the New World society. To do this one pioneer regularly cycles twenty miles to conduct studies. A sister in her sixties is patiently learning to ride a bicycle so she can ride instead of walk the seven miles to conduct studies. Others have recently done the same thing. Some paddle canoes to keep in contact with the newly interested. At a circuit assembly in unassigned territory an interested man remarked: &quot;I have often read of the love that binds you people together and of the out-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">standing zeal you have for your work. Well, I have certainly seen it manifest at this assembly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Unassigned territory work holds many thrills, and this is often arranged for prior to a circuit assembly. So when publishers finally converge on the assembly, after a week of such experiences the enthusiasm can be well imagined. Two missionary sisters spent their two-week vacation like this and they say it was the best vacation ever. Going from one island to another, one of them met a man and, before being given a chance to explain, was told: “I am with the Watch Tower.” He forthwith cross-examined the sister on all the doctrines he had learned and seemed nonplussed to find that she agreed. It turned out that his </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> subscription had lapsed over a year, but he still had the expiration slip, which he could not renew. However, he then renewed it and is now becoming equipped to preach. Other publishers report that complete strangers act as guides, showing publishers how to reach homes hidden away in creek and bush, and all because they want to help. One Methodist preacher was found using the books to prepare his sermons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Within the space of just a few weeks the opinions of thousands of people here have been changed with regard to Jehovah’s witnesses. The film “The New World Society in Action” is in constant demand everywhere. Sometimes there are four showings a week and theaters are packed to capacity. People who would not normally attend a lecture come for two hours and enjoy it. Theater owners usually have one night when there is no regular show and then their facilities, along with screen advertising, are loaned to us without charge. Imagine the effect this has in communities where there are but two or three publishers and we are considered an insignificant group. At this moment we are receiving many inquiries from people who now want to know more about us.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark210"></a>BRITISH HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">For the past two years the report from this country has shown the number of praisers of Jehovah’s name to be standing still. It is a real pleasure to note that this year they have made a 21 per cent increase and have reached a new peak of 106 publishers working as members of the New World society. They have done good work, too, as far as the field is concerned, for they have spent nearly 7,000 more hours in the field service than they did the previous year. More subscriptions were obtained, more magazines were placed, many more back-calls were made and there was a fine increase in home Bible studies. All of this reflected itself in the number of new ministers preaching the good news. The report from the branch servant gives us a few high points of the happenings there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A visit by the Society’s vice-president, Brother Franz, was a helpful stimulus to start off the year. His enlightening talks and greetings from the neighboring countries helped all to appreciate better the love and unity that now prevail in the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After several years of training and example from the missionaries the local brothers are now beginning to shoulder their own responsibilities. They are now giving more of the public talks, filling servant positions and leading field-service groups. A great aid in attaining this status of more mature ministers has been the three- to eight-minute sermons. By preparing these all are able to give effective presentations and increase their placements. This contributed to a good increase in book placements over the previous year. The younger are not the only ones among the local brothers who are showing maturity, but in the Belize congregation an eighty-two-year-old sister regularly attends the group contacts and an eighty-three-year-old pioneer still faithfully engages in the full-time ministry, thus setting a fine example for the whole congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A publisher in the house-to-house work here called on a nearly blind man who desired to see. After a few months’ study in one of the Society’s publications he began getting his eyes open to the truths of life and to the privileges of serving Jehovah. He soon began to attend all the meetings and is so happy he can see with his eyes of understanding that he desires to be immersed. Another brother in the same congregation who is totally blind could also see the need of changing his life to fit Jehovah’s standards. Though in his eightieth year he was not too old to bring his common-law wife to the Kingdom Hall and be properly and legally married so his efforts could be counted. With such spiritual foresight the eyes of these brothers will soon open literally in a perfect new world with paradisaic conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To contact persons in unassigned territory often means much inconvenience and hardship, but since it is Jehovah’s will that all hear the message his spirit goes with his people. To reach one village it was necessary to travel fourteen miles by motorcycle, then board a small river boat for an eight-hour journey over rapids, up creeks and across lagoons; but upon reaching our destination in Crooked Tree the people were happy to see us. We, too, were happy to see as many as 175 persons of good will in attendance at the public talks that were given. In another instance on the first visit to an isolated community nearly everyone there came to hear the talks, including the Catholic schoolteacher, who later obtained a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth”.</span><span class="font7"> For many it was their first contact with the truth; so when the speaker finished, the crowd would stay and ask many questions. The only religious services conducted in many of these out-of-the-way places are by schoolteachers, who, in most cases, have little knowledge of the Bible but follow traditional, routine services. This has served to leave the people very open-minded and eager to learn, and Jehovah’s ministers take great joy in carrying the waters of truth to anyone thirsting.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark211"></a>BRITISH ISLES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are making steady progress in the territory under the jurisdiction of the British Isles. They fully realize, as did Timothy, that they must keep at their missionary service and accomplish their ministry. Paul said: “You, though, keep your balance in all things, suffer evil, do missionary work, thoroughly accomplish your ministry.” (2 Tim. 4:5, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> There is a lot of work yet to be done in Britain. During the service year of 1954 the door-to-door Bible sermons were featured prominently. The training program was developed, the circuit and district work was reorganized, and everyone was happy with these advances. Some have made outstanding progress in the house-to-house work and they certainly did appreciate the valuable assistance they received from the more mature publishers. It is certain that, if all the publishers in the British Isles share in the house-to-house work and use the three- to eight-minute sermons, a big change for the better will be the result in Britain and the other sheep will be found much more rapidly. This is the same as in any other country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The report sent in for Eire is most encouraging, for we find a tremendous increase in the number of publishers there despite the many years of hard work and slow going. The pace of the gathering work has certainly quickened in Eire and very likely the new booklet they had to work with during the year has been an aid in breaking down prejudice. Malta is another little spot on earth that comes under the jurisdiction of the British office and it is good to see increase there. The report from the branch servant is most interesting and encouraging. The brothers there are looking forward to the great conventions to be held in Europe in 1955 and especially to the one for London. If it is Jehovah’s will, many thousands of brothers from other countries will enter Britain there to join in singing praises to Jehovah. Certainly none should be afraid of the evil tidings that may arise in the land, but hearts should be fixed on Jehovah, trusting in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A circuit servant’s wife, using the doorstep sermon, interested a young woman in the Bible’s description of world conditions today. She subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and was given the issue containing the article “Rearing Children in the New World Society” and an invitation to the public talk. The lady remarked that she would come if her husband were home to mind the children. On the Sunday, however, she came to the talk, children and all, explaining that she had read in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> that parents should take their children to the meetings. At a home Bible study she has since learned many other Scriptural principles, to her delight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The 1954 district assemblies were certainly a treat. Never has a program been more enjoyed. It was rich and nourishing indeed! The publicity given the assemblies in the press was more effective than ever and it served to draw some of the clergy out into open conflict. At Nottingham a local parson publicly warned the people against having Jehovah’s witnesses in their homes, but many resented such tactics and went out of their way to offer rooms. At Luton the Anglican bishop wrote around his diocese in similar vein and had the letter published in the local paper, which also published a reply. Among the letters that subsequently appeared was one that bade the people of Luton to observe the discipline, organization and mental alertness of Jehovah’s witnesses, in contrast with the obvious failure of the orthodox religions. The bishop later called on this woman, but found that he had only succeeded in turning yet another person toward the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among the high lights of the year was the first stage in the legal battle for the recognition of our full-time ministry. For forty years the authorities have refused to recognize us as a “religious denomination” or any of Jehovah’s witnesses as ministers. The claims of those who have devoted their entire lives to the ministry have been rejected and, as a consequence, they have suffered imprisonment. During the years a few cases have been taken to the courts, but with the exception of one or two minor cases they have been unsuccessful. Upon your determination, Brother Knorr, that we ought to press our claims again in the light of today’s facts, two cases have been launched in Scotland. One is that of a pioneer congregation servant and the other of a pioneer only. The legal argument on the first case was heard last February under Brother Covington’s oversight. The judge declined to agree with our opponents and reject the case as irrelevant, and ordered that it “go to proof,” meaning that he now wished to hear the evidence. We look forward to this next important stage and are glad that directors of the Society will be coming over to give evidence in their official capacities. Our prayers daily ascend for Jehovah’s guidance and blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the intensified house-to-house work has come increasing opposition from the clergy. Parish magazines from one end of the country to the other have been carrying articles that try so hard to strip us of honesty, morality and sanity. But all they succeed in doing is to reveal that the shoe is pinching. Householders frequently inquire, “Why is it that the clergy are so up against you people?” and that, of course, is a question that any publisher likes to handle. Occasionally a parson will sally forth with the sword instead of the pen. One such case was at Lymington, Hampshire, where a visiting parson put pressure on a hall committee to stop a public meeting just half an hour before it was due to begin. The three members of the committe were highly indignant and informed him that instead of going to his service that afternoon they would attend the Watch Tower lecture. They did and said later, with appreciation, that as long as they had the say we would always have the hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At another town a cinema manager, refusing to bother with a contract, had given his word that we could use his cinema for the Sunday sessions of a circuit assembly. The Town Hall was booked for the Friday and Saturday. The clergy put pressure on the Town Hall people, who, wondering what to do, phoned the cinema manager. He said that he would not dream of going back on his word and that they could not do so either since they had actually signed a contract. So the assembly went on. Meantime the clergy sent an amplifier around the streets telling the people not to co-operate with us. This highly amused the cinema manager, for the clergy had not shown such life for years. On the Saturday he received an anonymous letter threatening to blow up the cinema with a time bomb. The police placed a guard all night, and next day the assembly concluded without incident. The local people, whose curiosity had been aroused as much by the clergy’s antics as by our own advertising, came along in goodly numbers, and so a fine witness was given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As we step into 1955 we contemplate the thrilling prospects of the international assembly in London. Already the contract for an ideal location has been signed and preliminaries are under way.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark212"></a>EIRE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers are learning to use the three- to eightminute sermon with the Catholic Douay Bible and are finding that they are able to get a better hearing than ever before. The tactful use of the Bible enables the brothers to witness now from house to house in areas where there was violent hostility and mob action in past years. But, of course, they still need to use tact and care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two sisters were working in such an area in Cork recently when a mob began to form. The situation looked ugly, so they decided to go elsewhere. As they were moving off a man overtook them. They thought that he was going to make trouble, but, instead, to their relief, he asked when they were going to call on him again as he had read the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Way Is Love</span><span class="font7"> and wanted to know more. There and then they placed </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> with him and arranged a study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Until recently the special pioneers in Eire have been concentrating on covering the ground and leaving booklets everywhere, especially </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Way Is Love. </span><span class="font7">Now, however, we believe they can do most effective work by staying in the larger towns and trying to find and gather together the interest there. A few years ago this was well-nigh impossible in most towns, and many of those who tried it knew what it was to be turned out into the snow late at night with the whole neighborhood in an uproar. Now, however, the pioneers know more about tact and how to use it. As a result, they are getting on much better and more effectively too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the weapons used by the priests to put the people against us is to tell them either that we do not believe in the virgin Mary or that we are Communists. A Dublin missionary encountered the former when a lady explained that that was why the priest had forbidden her to read our literature. The missionary showed her in the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Way</span><span class="font7"> Zs </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Love</span><span class="font7"> the quotation from Isaiah 7:14. This so surprised the lady that she took the booklet to show the priest, saying that she had never known him to tell lies before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another person at the door had read </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Way Is Love</span><span class="font7"> and enjoyed it all right but did not believe that the quotations were actually from the Catholic Bible. The missionary proved from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Douay Version</span><span class="font7"> that they were, whereupon the lady agreed to having a study of the booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MALTA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark213"></a><span class="font7">Malta is tightly in the grip of the Catholic Church. Her servants are not above tampering with mail and even purloining Bibles that pass through their hands. But Jehovah’s people there are being fed with spiritual food and are using the energy derived in his service with commendable zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the little group there is so new they do value the visits that have been made to them from time to time by experienced brothers passing along the Mediterranean. Thus, with their brothers throughout the world, they enjoyed the blessings of association and service and the tender care of Jehovah through his organization. For this they frequently express to us their heartfelt appreciation. Their hope and ours is that in 1954 it will be time to form Malta’s first congregation of modern times.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark214"></a>BULGARIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s work progresses very slowly in this country of Bulgaria. The conditions are bad throughout the entire nation. They do not have the freedom that is enjoyed in other countries, and so it is difficult for them to preach the Kingdom and contact people from house to house. But there is no stopping Jehovah’s people; so in spite of the difficulties they preach to individual people secretly and without any literature. The brothers can meet only at night, except in one town where they are able to meet in the daytime because there are only ten to twelve persons associated with the study group. However, in another vicinity the publishers are scattered around in nine different locations, all doing farming work, and so these have to meet under cover of the darkness. Even under these adverse meeting conditions, though in several villages, they were able to celebrate the Memorial on the date indicated. The people there earnestly desire freedom and so are looking forward with joy to the new world and the privilege they will have at that time of associating with their brothers in the New World society. The brothers there are holding fast to the truth and are doing Jehovah’s work in the best manner they can, and the reports that have been coming through recently during the past service year show that there has been improvement in their organization and in the availability of the spiritual food. The brothers in Bulgaria have an interest in our prayers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark215"></a>BURMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">We find the majority of Jehovah’s witnesses in Burma residing in the capital city of Rangoon. This is necessary because of the internal strife that is tearing up the land. But they often move from place to place and even go up to the northern sections of Burma, and so the truth reaches out even to those troubled areas. A number have accepted the truth in these outlying points and reports come in to the branch office to the effect that many are showing interest and congregations are being formed. While there has been no increase in publishers in Burma during the past year, still those who are in the organization are becoming more mature and they form a very happy group of preachers of the good news. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences in his annual report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Karen girl who worked as a housemaid in the home of a family in the truth in Rangoon became very much interested. Later she left for her home in the jungle a hundred miles from Rangoon, much of which area was controlled by insurgents. From time to time the brothers wrote to her and encouraged her to stand fast. A year later she made the rough and difficult trip back to Rangoon and asked to be baptized. During the whole of the past year she had been spending all her available time preaching the good news to the villagers in her neighborhood. A happy little group of four of Jehovah’s witnesses splashed through the flooded, leach-infested paddy (rice) fields in the pouring rain at Insein, a Rangoon suburb, to a suitable pond. There she was immersed, to return afterward to her home in the jungle and keep up the good work of announcing Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After studying the Society’s special letter calling for vacation pioneers, the parents of some of the school children discussed the matter at home with their children and then stated that the children (who, although publishers, had not yet been baptized) wished to be immersed and then enter the vacation pioneer work. To meet the occasion, a special baptismal service was held in the Kingdom Hall at Rangoon, following which five children were baptized, and then enrolled as vacation pioneers, some for one month, others for two months during the school holiday season, which in Burma takes in March and April. It certainly thrilled and stirred all the brothers to see young children take this all-important step. Since most of these children speak Burmese fluently, they were able to give a good account of themselves in the field, and we surely hope that in the future years this early training will help them to make up their minds to enter the regular pioneer service. Several older publishers, observing their younger brothers and sisters putting forth such a selfsacrificing effort, also began to reconsider the matter and they too arranged to serve Jehovah God fulltime for a month or two. The result was that by the end of the service year nine brothers and sisters, with ages running from 12 to 65 years, had entered and shared the joys of the vacation pioneer service for a month or two. We have great hopes for the future vacation pioneer as well as regular pioneer work here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CANADA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark216"></a><span class="font8">Canada has enjoyed a very fine increase during the service year of 1954. The new training program has shown good effects in that land. The number of house-to-house ministers has increased by over 2,000. The three- to eight-minute sermons have proved to be most effective and the publishers are beginning to appreciate more than ever the need of regularity in the field. The situation in Quebec has held prominence during the year because of the difficulties that have arisen there, but the hand of Jehovah has not been shortened and he has poured out a rich blessing on those who are working in that territory. It is planned to send more special pioneers into Quebec to give that province a wider witness, because the people of Quebec need the comforting message and there are many other sheep there who will still be gathered. The branch servant sends us an interesting report and part of it is published here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On October 6, 1954, the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the censorship case involving the city and province of Quebec was handed down. This was widely publicized by special distribution of thousands upon thousands of copies of the November 22, 1953, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> throughout the whole country, including reprints in the French language. This decision had the effect of setting back Quebec’s Mr. Duplessis. Next followed the introduction of his notorious and unjust Bill 38 in the Quebec Provincial Legislature, flouting the Supreme Court’s verdict and aimed directly and specifically against Jehovah’s witnesses. The bill quickly passed the required readings in the Lower and Upper Houses and became provincial law. There was probably a feeling of satisfaction in the camp of our enemies, but it was short-lived, for by a swift move in the courts a case for an injunction against Duplessis and his bill was launched, and that is still pending. The desired effect has been obtained, for the bill at the present lies inactive and the Kingdompublishing work goes on apace throughout his province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The missionaries and special pioneers continue to work hard at the gospel-preaching, mainly in Quebec. Fifty-six missionaries at 19 places in Quebec Province reported at the close of this year and from their reports we can see that excellent service is being done by firmly establishing theocratic bridgeheads in that part of the field. From time to time mob violence and interference by local officials threaten to flare up, while threats and intimidation are brought to bear upon those who dare to show hospitality to the missionaries. Many honest-hearted ones, however, are standing firm for the truth. There is the example of a man who called at one of the missionary homes in search of proper shepherd’s care. He had been overseas for five and a half years, and doubted even the existence of God. On returning home he found his sister studying the Society’s publications with the Bible, sat in on the study, started to attend meetings, refuted the arguments of a monk, saw his children suffer in behalf of the truth at a Catholic school, all in the period of one month. One of his boys, seven years </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font7"> age, on refusing to say the catechism in school was turned over to “Father” R---, who whipped him with a strap on</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">an already injured hand and told him he would have to stay on his knees all day long for this. So he did until 5 p.m. that night and when he arrived home he was exhausted and his little hand was badly swollen. A warning to the priest prevented any further similar tactics. When the father told the boy: “You know M--- that was a hard thing to do, but you did that</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">for Jehovah. Do you know that?” He replied, “Yes, Papa, I know and I wouldn’t mind doing it for another day for Jehovah.” So, there are genuine sheep still to be found in Quebec and a need for more willing workers to find and tend them. Another call for pioneers to serve in Quebec has been responded to by some fifty brothers and sisters to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Vacation pioneering has been taken advantage of by over 400 individuals during this year and we feel sure that their appetites for future full-time privileges have been whetted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The film &quot;The New World Society in Action” has proved to be a most effective instrument. All together, it has been shown 59 times, with a total attendance of 12,552. Expressions of appreciation have poured in from publishers and persons of good will alike. One newly interested woman said: “I want to tell you that I really appreciated seeing the film. What impressed me so much was the vastness of the organization and the fact that it is world-wide. Another thing was the peace and unity of Jehovah’s witnesses. You will see more of me at your Kingdom Hall.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now that the new service year has begun, Jehovah’s people in Canada can confidently look forward to continued joys and blessings. The keynote is still ‘regularity in the house-to-house preaching work, aided by the companion program and the three- to eight-minute sermons.’</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark217"></a>CEYLON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The Ceylonese people are kindly and very respectful to visitors who call at their homes. The Kingdom publisher is often invited to sit down in the home and explain his mission while a cool drink is brought out. This tolerant attitude and pleasant disposition of the people have been a great help to the publishers on this island. The increase that has come in Ceylon has been from those who have been previously professing Christianity, Catholics and Protestants. It has been rather difficult to convince the Buddhists and other religious groups of the truth contained in the Bible. However, the report from the branch servant in Ceylon shows that the Hindus and Buddhists are paying some attention to the truth and some are taking their stand. By having such people taking up the message it may be that they will know what appeals to their own people and more success may be seen in the future. To get a picture of the work carried out in Ceylon, excerpts from the branch servant’s report are published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are a few Buddhists and Hindus gradually breaking the centuries-old bonds of tradition that hold them. One sister writes of her husband who was a Buddhist by birth: “Although my husband was not actually practicing his Buddhist religion, he developed more and more antagonism toward the truth. However, soon after I returned from the Bombay assembly last October, he became very ill, and, while he was laid up, my brother had opportunity to help him distinguish between the true religion and the false. Since then he has been reading the Society’s publications with growing interest. During July, I persuaded him to accompany me in the unassigned territory work, which he did and joined us in the house-to-house work. He is now attending the congregation </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> studies and service meetings frequently and has begun a study of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font7"> in our home with one of the missionaries. . . . With grateful heart toward Jehovah for his undeserved kindness to us I am looking forward to living forever in happiness on the earth with my husband.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A young Hindu couple was contacted some months ago. A missionary reports: “After hearing about the New World society and its functions they expressed real interest and said this was something they had never heard of before in their lives. Since then each back-call has been more and more interesting. The young man has become very interested in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font7">magazine. They came along for our first circuit assembly in May; later they took in ‘The New World Society in Action' film and made excellent comments about it; they have attended the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> studies at the Kingdom Hall also. We have completed the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Basis for Belief in a New World</span><span class="font7"> booklet with them and have begun a study of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’,</span><span class="font7"> as they are now very desirous to learn about the Bible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Street magazine work is most interesting in Colombo, for almost every Saturday there are ships in port plying on the route from England to the Orient and to Australia. Of course, the reaction of the tourists is mixed. It makes a deep impression on them all, whether they will hear or forbear. One businessman from New Zealand, who was on his way home from an extensive world tour, approached one of the missionaries and marveled at the fact that wherever he had been he had seen Jehovah’s witnesses and “their </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Wake-up</span><span class="font7"> magazines,” as he put it. A Melbourne (Australia) tourist remarked: “I’ll bet at this very minute there is someone standing on Bourke Street with these same two magazines.” And so the unity of the New World society is being imprinted on the minds of the people as they travel to and fro throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The local circuit servant made his first trip around the island during the year. Besides his interesting experiences in the field, he tells of his experience while traveling from place to place on his motorcycle along roads that go for many miles through virgin jungle. Here toward evening it is not uncommon to see dozens of monkeys, many jackals and even an elephant from time to time. Although it is rare that any of the jungle animals attack, it has been reported that the elephants show great resentment to the noise of a motor, so the brother reports that when an elephant is sighted it is far wiser to open up the throttle rather than slow down to take a closer look.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The training program was instituted during the year and is now getting well under way. We feel that it is largely due to this excellent arrangement of “companions in service” together with the organizing of as many different small study-service groups as practicable that the brothers here have shown such remarkable progress in growth toward maturity and in regularity in the field, resulting in one new peak after another and in the healthy over-all increase in average publishers each month.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark218"></a>CHILE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The apostle Peter said that we should be “always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you.” No matter whether you are a missionary, a pioneer or a congregation publisher, you have to be prepared to meet any objection that is brought up to you, and that is why it is so necessary to grow on to maturity. The publishers in Chile are becoming more mature year by year and they are reaching out into all kinds of territory. Chile is a long narrow country, only 100 miles wide by 2,600 miles long. During the year many of the congregations were made to stand on their own feet because missionaries were transferred to other assignments to open up new fields in this vast land. Even though these changes were made, a splendid increase was found in the preaching of the good news in Chile during the 1954 service year, and the branch servant gives us an interesting report of what occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although there was still plenty of work in this territory, the isolated cities were receiving very little attention, due to extreme distance. How could these be reached? You quickly arranged that. It was time for the congregations to accept more responsibility, thus freeing many missionaries for work in isolated territory. But who should be sent and where? That answer came readily also. Twelve said, “Here am I; send me.” Six requested territory 600 miles to the south where they are now preaching and aiding the new interest developing in the two southernmost missionary assignments in the world. The others requested territory to the north, making an even distribution to new sections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With so many special publishers leaving for new assignments, the new publishers left behind had to learn to “walk alone,” that is, to the congregation meetings and out in the field service. In February and March the number of publishers dropped, even below last year’s report. This brought down the year’s average increase to only 7 per cent over the previous year’s service. But just as a child learning to walk may fall a few times without greatly hurting himself so it seemed with the publishers learning to carry their own responsibilities. They came back more steady on their “own feet” during the Memorial activity with 926 publishers for a new peak and, like the growing child that keeps on trying and progressing, they reached their new peak to finish the service year with 1,018 publishers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While the number of books and booklets distributed this year was lower than last year, owing to a shortage due to excessive departmental controls on importations, the publishers did put out many thousands more copies of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines. Commenting upon their distribution as reported a year ago, your observation, Brother Knorr, that every publisher should strive to place 100 copies this year, would mean well over 80,000 placed for 1954. The placements total 116,898 copies! What would the publishers have done without these two magazines?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many times the missionaries have thought, “Oh, if the brothers here could just see how the Society operates, if they could just attend an international assembly once!” Just imagine yourself living in a desert region all your life, never having been to even a circuit assembly, due to extreme distance; you might not even be acquainted with more than a few persons devoted to preaching Jehovah’s established kingdom. Then a circuit assembly comes to your city for the first time. You attend and see the film “The New World Society in Action.” How do you think it would impress you? Well, you might be moved to tears of joy, too, as your vision of the new world increases and strengthens; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">seeing</span><span class="font7"> for the first time what theocratic action at its best is accomplishing even right now and what blessings are in store for all faithful witnesses when the “earth shall yield her increase.” (Ezek. 34:27) What a blessing the film is proving to be!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CHINA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is indeed a pleasure to say something about the service work in China. While our brothers move ahead there in preaching the message of the Kingdom it is not an easy task. They enjoy a measure of freedom but it certainly takes courage to take advantage of that freedom and go to the people and preach the message of the good news of the Kingdom. Most of the people are inclined to think this is not the time to do the work Jehovah’s witnesses are performing. However, those who have studied the truth in China are bubbling over with the words of life and so they preach the good news. They have found that working in twos and helping to train one another has greatly aided them in reaching a new peak of 38 ministers during the year. There is very little work done outside the city of Shanghai, but the reports we have about our brothers in that country are very encouraging, and the branch servant tells us a few very interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark219"></a><span class="font7">One experience concerns two men reared in Buddhism from birth. A foreign sister contacted one of them in house-to-house work and had some discussion with him on the truth. Later he moved away and contact was lost. Two years later a Chinese sister found him and aroused his interest to have a home Bible study. He did, with his brother-in-law, and both began attending Kingdom Hall. Progress was made, but it was not until the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Basis for Belief in a New World</span><span class="font7"> was received and studied that their faith in the Bible became solid. Now they saw that the Bible was accurate and founded on fact, and that the new world it promises is sure. They had a basis for belief now. This was the turning point. Their attitude toward life and their old beliefs changed. This was expressed during a home Bible study when the old mother, a lifelong Buddhist, tiptoed into the room to offer lighted incense to the idol in the corner. Both now felt such disgust that they exclaimed: “Oh, go away! it is so foolish to worship wood and clay.” They have been anxious to get their families to see the truth and have done much preaching to them, but mostly they have met with opposition. They asked the sister: “What shall we do? These womenfolk are so stupid, they want to hold on to their idols; they would rather die than believe in the only true God, Jehovah.” Now both of these men have turned away from the worship of wood and stone to the worship of the living God. Both have been baptized and have started preaching the good news from house to house as well as to friends and relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To maintain integrity at this “time of the end” requires great faith. This was demonstrated in the case of a brother who worked in a factory. He had previously withdrawn from the factory union because it violated his conscience before God. Shortly afterward there was a political movement among the factory workers for thought reform, designed to eliminate capitalistic ways of thinking from the mind. The brother refused to participate, on Christian grounds, although he suffered much for his stand. One night over a hundred workers surrounded his machine, some threatening him, others appealing to him, saying: “We need you. The union needs the support of wholehearted men like you.” The brother was not afraid of such a crowd. He told them: “I have studied God’s Word and learned that I should obey God above man.” There were many angry shouts, but no one laid hands on him. When they found they could not break down his stand, they gradually dispersed to their machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At home his neighbors related the story to his wife, saying that he would lose his job and bring trouble on the family. The wife, thinking that a full bowl of rice was all important, joined others in reviling her husband. The brother showed patience and tried to show his wife that he was taking the right course and that God would support them. At night the wife could not sleep for fear and worry; yet her husband slept soundly without a care. The wife began to notice the power of God’s Word in the life of her husband and how he had changed, and now showed her love and consideration, realizing that evidently God was taking care of him. So she asked for a Bible study for herself. Although illiterate, she was eager for knowledge and made good progress. As she began to understand the truth her fears and worries gave way to joy and happiness, to the amazement of her neighbors. After six months of study she dedicated herself to Jehovah and was baptized and has started out serving Jehovah from house to house. So this brother now has peace at home and his wife is in the truth because he maintained his integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mostly the Kingdom work has been carried on here in Shanghai. We have not been able to join our brothers elsewhere in assembly, so for us the Memorial assembly was our outstanding assembly of the year and was attended by 87 persons. One baptism was arranged and eleven persons were immersed in symbol of their dedication to Jehovah. The only tragedy that marred the year was the sudden death of one of the three missionaries, Brother Lew Ti Himm, who died while active in the service. The remaining two missionaries are continuing to work with the brothers and assist them as far as they are able.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark220"></a>COLOMBIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">It was certainly a pleasure for the president of the Society to visit Colombia during the past year, following a visit by Brother Franz in September. A number of changes were made and arrangements were made so that a wider witness could be given. More special pioneers were added to the list and new territory was opened up. The results proved to be most satisfactory; they had an increase in publishers of 30 per cent. At the present time they have a peak of 523 publishers of the good news going forward throughout Colombia. The branch servant sent a very interesting report and a few items are published here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">January 28 saw the issuing of the first of two national decrees forbidding the carrying on of nonCatholic evangelical activities publicly and allowing only announced meetings in established homes or churches. Protestant activities were suddenly hampered and in some parts even their schools were closed. What would Jehovah’s witnesses in Colombia do in face of all this? What </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">did</span><span class="font7"> they do? The following report proves that they did not close shop. Personal visits with greater use of Catholic Bibles were stressed, together with the goal of more home Bible study meetings and intensified public meeting campaigns. The year’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font7">sults were gratifying, namely, a 50 per cent increase in hours in field service and in public meetings held, a fine advance in home Bible studies and a 30 per cent increase in publishers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Investigation of the government decrees revealed that an agreement had been made with the “Holy See” and now certain sections of Colombia were to be considered as “mission territories,” meaning for the development of only Catholic missions. Later experience proved to us that other religions not previously established could not even hold a meeting, much less have a public baptism or carry Bible helps. A sample of conditions existing in “mission territory” here follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A pioneer couple spent a week’s vacation witnessing in English-speaking, 85 per cent Protestant San Andres Island. On the way the captain of the boat took a subscription and offered the use of a church building for a public lecture, which was attended by 160 persons voicing their approval with “Amen!” Tracts were distributed to all, and the couple returned to their hotel only to be notified by the visiting inspector of police that such Bible meetings were prohibited and that unless all preaching activity ceased they would be jailed and expelled from the island. Nevertheless, in spite of close scrutiny, two more Bible talks were given and a carton of Bibles and Bible helps was placed with the many persons of good will, who expressed a desire for the couple to remain and teach them the Bible. They were privileged to aid the only brother, who, although infirm, conducts a school for 35 children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Note that even in large cities not listed in limited &quot;mission” areas difficulties are encountered. In the first month in their new assignment the four missionaries placed 312 bound books and started several home Bible studies. The second month found a priest out to enforce a church-inspired government decree against non-Catholic activity. An accusation was made by him against two of the missionaries at a police station. Then followed an excommunication warning to all persons reading Jehovah’s witnesses’ literature and even to those greeting them on the streets. Public reaction has been widespread against such fanatical action by the priest, and numerous Catholics have voiced disgust at the excommunication. Similar experiences have been had throughout Colombia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although the publishers work against odds, the work grows rapidly in some spots. To begin the year three new special pioneers went into their virgin territory assignment. Finishing the service year found them with an organized congregation of twenty publishers and a new local pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When four missionaries received a new assignment after several years in Bogota, the small congregation was confronted with the question of where to hold meetings, since the Kingdom Hall had always been in the missionary home. A poor brother said if the congregation would build him a lean-to on another part of his lot, he would vacate his carpenter shop and meetings could be held there. A week’s work by volunteer help completed the lean-to and the new Kingdom Hall. A cement floor had to be laid and a partition erected to divide the hall from the brother’s living quarters. Resulting was a neat Kingdom Hall with a seating capacity of over eighty persons, at a total cost of 300 pesos ($120).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After three years of existence one unit of the Barran-quilla congregation, due to ever-increasing meeting attendance, was obliged to tear down the third partition to enlarge seating capacity in their Kingdom Hall. Their servants are known as zealous campaigners for regular attendance at the congregation meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Following Brother Knorr’s suggestion, the branch sent out a letter showing the necessity for publishers to legalize common-law marriages. A local brother working at a notary public office volunteered to handle all such cases free of charge. Since then he has given his services for some twenty-four couples.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark221"></a>COSTA RICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Our brothers in Costa Rica nearly reached their 10 per cent increase, although they had considerable to make up because of a loss of publishers in the previous year. They regained that loss and a little more. Some of the publishers were giving very little time to the service, and they realized that it was necessary for them to become more efficient workers in the congregation. The brothers were losing real joy because many of them were failing in their preaching work. They further failed to attend the congregation meetings and were thus not equipped for the door-to-door work, nor were their minds sharp enough to conduct home Bible studies with the people. This happened to quite a few, but during the year the training program was put into operation and many of those who were lax were aided by the more mature ones and the zeal of the organization is manifested this year in their field service report. Every effort was put forth to help the brothers, and, to show that benefits were derived from this effort, note these excerpts from the branch servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In order to reach one of the congregations a circuit servant must do some international traveling. He has to leave Costa Rica by river, cross a lake in Nicaragua, and re-enter Costa Rica by another river. All of this involves at least two days’ traveling by motor launch and on foot. After going as far as possible by boat the circuit servant is met by some of the brothers, who will guide him the rest of the way on foot. Much of the trail is covered by water and several hours of walking are required to reach the Kingdom Hall. On his recent visit there he reports the following: “No noisy interference here, for the Kingdom Hall is almost completely alone in the wilderness. But well ahead of time brothers and sisters begin to arrive, many of them covered to their knees with mud. But, are they happy! Their singing, their friendliness, their conduct and their eager questions all show them to be members of the New World society. They must travel long distances on muddy trails and in rainy weather, but the message is being carried to the people and the work goes forward. We had over forty at our public lecture.” In another congregation this circuit servant and several congregation publishers traveled on foot three days and nights in order to reach some of the congregation’s territory. They would stop overnight at the home of some isolated publisher or person of good will and have a study or talk for the neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Last year we reported the burning of a Kingdom Hall by some fanatics. This congregation has built a new hall, better than the one that was burned, and the preaching work continues in this territory without letup.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1950 the brothers in Port Limon had tried to obtain a hall for an assembly, but they were refused. So they decided it was time to build their own. They did! Undoubtedly that assembly made a greater impression on Port Limon than the international assembly did on New York city. One woman who is ordained as a preacher in one of the religious organizations attended and said that she had never in her life heard anything like that before, and it was the pure truth. She is now preparing herself to become a door-to-door preacher of God’s kingdom. On Sunday morning one of the local preachers talked to his congregation about Jehovah’s witnesses and, among other things, said that ‘they didn’t have any church suppers or bingo games or sell chances in order to build a “church,” ’ and he wanted to know what his congregation was doing with its money. Many new studies have been started and the attendance at meetings has increased about 50 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the things that brought great joy and happiness to the brothers is the new film. Although there are still many congregations to visit with it, more than 3,000 persons have already seen the picture and thrilled at seeing how God’s organization operates in all the earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark222"></a>CUBA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Our brothers in Cuba are looking well to the interests of the Kingdom. They have had continuous increases every year and have reached new peaks. This year, however, they did not reach their hoped-for 10 per cent increase. The 9,958 publishers on that island have wonderful prospects ahead of them in the way of meeting together with others of like precious faith, advancing in knowledge and maturity and then taking this knowledge they have gained to others. Without question they do trust in Jehovah God and look to him and his organization for guidance. They are pressing on, that they may become more able ministers of the good news, thus being able to gather more of the other sheep. The branch servant tells us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This year the branch initiated a reading and writing campaign for the 20 per cent or more among the brothers that are illiterate. The school servant holds two classes a week in a textbook based on the Laubach system. Favorable results have already begun to appear and many are expressing their appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The problem of consensual marriage in this Catholic country has long affected the work in Cuba as well as in other Latin-American Catholic countries. The new-world standards based on the Bible principles of the Christian marriage were strongly emphasized this service year. Many negligent and indifferent ones were dis-fellowshiped. While this affected the service report in one way, yet it is having a very wholesome and unifying effect on the organization. Many letters are at hand from brothers who have legalized their marriage after living twenty or more years consensually. Such ones are meek. One couple writes in, expressing their joy on being married legally after living thirty-seven years in common-law marriage. Their oldest son is 36 years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society’s continual stress of placing two magazines per publisher weekly is beginning to take effect, and many who formerly were merely standing mute on the street corner holding up a magazine now actually find that placing several magazines in an hour from door to door is easy by following the instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One splendid feature of service that has had excellent results is the film “The New World Society in Action.” We obtained a projector and immediately started showing the film after receiving it from Brooklyn. From the middle of May to the end of August there were 39 showings, with a total attendance of 10,539. One theater owner in Pinar del Rio said it was the finest film ever shown in his theater. The district servant took the film to the Isle of Pines where a new congregation of five publishers was recently organized. A theater was rented for $5, and with not too much advertising an unusual attendance of 420 filled the theater! Only eight of these were witnesses. Three other showings on the island raised the attendance to 768 in one week. On leaving the hall where the film was shown in Havana one goodwill person was heard to say, “Truly we can’t do without Almighty God and life in the new world, and this picture is proof that this is the true organization of God.” It is also clearly evident that this new feature unifies the brothers and gives them a deeper appreciation of the global new-world activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This annual report would certainly not be complete without mentioning the conventions held during the year. We were privileged to have Brother M. G. Henschel visit us during April and attend the two district assemblies at Camagiiey and Havana. Much good instruction from the platform and in the circuit servants’ meetings was received. Several good radio and television interviews were obtained and much newspaper publicity had. The combined attendance at the public talk was above 5,700. Then in August we received the pleasurable information that the Society’s vice-president, F. W. Franz, would tour the island of Cuba, visiting several congregations and also attending two district assemblies in Holguin and Havana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yes, Cuba has had a very busy year. Our prospects for 1955 are even greater. With a Memorial attendance of 16,343 this year and with over 1,000 newly baptized brothers it can be appreciated that a tremendous amount of planting and watering is yet to be done.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark223"></a>CYPRUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The psalmist said, “Let the multitude of isles be glad.” Cyprus is one of the islands where people of good will are being made glad even though they have been brought up under the Greek Catholic Church. It certainly is puzzling to see that as Jehovah’s witnesses call on the people to educate them in the Bible and God’s purposes they meet concerted opposition from the orthodox clergy who want to keep the people in complete ignorance not only of Biblical matters but of all other things as well, so that they will have no education. After all these years the Greek Catholic Church, which was supposed to have come forth from the ‘cradle of democracy,’ delights in keeping its people in ignorance so that they cannot read themselves, nor may others read to them. Most of the people of Cyprus are under the control of that religious organization, but some are breaking away from it and seeking truth and righteousness. We are happy to consider the report of the branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The witnesses in one congregation had made two visits to one large village with good results, both as regards the placement of literature and the interest found. But the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses cannot be tolerated by the Greek Orthodox Church. On the third visit the two village priests got busy as soon as the witnesses made their appearance. A crowd of school children was gathered together and under the direction of the priests the witnesses were interrupted at the doors of the people. At one home the priest reprimanded the householder for listening to Jehovah’s witnesses and took upon himself the liberty to close the door. The witnesses made their way to another part of the village to avoid the mob, but they were told to leave the village at once. The children were armed with stones in order to get the witnesses out of the village. The other village priest had also gathered a crowd together and molested other witnesses, and when the witnesses reached their car about a hundred howling children surrounded them. The priests, when confronted by the local police, said that the archbishop had given instructions that Jehovah’s witnesses were to be driven out of the village. Such priestly representatives of false religion do not want to learn the truth themselves and hinder those who have a desire to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In another isolated territory, 5,000 feet up in the mountains, a brother some time ago was confined to a sanatorium there. After recovery he continued to work at the sanatorium as a carpenter. The sanatorium being isolated, his witnessing instead of being from house to house was from bed to bed talking to the patients. He continued for a long while without seeming result. A theologian of the Greek Orthodox Church visited the sanatorium and was informed that one of Jehovah’s witnesses regularly witnessed to the patients. The brother was sent for, the theologian thinking that the witness would be put to shame in front of the patients. But it turned out in reverse. The so-called wisdom of the theologian was put to nought by clear Bible reasoning on the part of the witness. As a result several patients manifested interest. The first to learn the truth was a crippled Moslem patient who was later baptized. During the past year these two brothers continued to preach, with the result that a congregation was formed. Their report for August shows eight publishers, two of whom were formerly Moslems. During a visit of the district and circuit servants to this isolated group, two were baptized in a bath of warm water, and others have expressed their desire to symbolize their dedication in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the town where we held our district assembly the village priest thought he was going to lose his flock. At the entrance to the meeting place he stationed one of his faithful parishioners who had the duty of writing down the names of the villagers who attended the assembly. Those who persisted in attending would be denied the services of the church, such as baptism, marriage and burial, he said. However, this threat only served to make some even more determined to attend the sessions. The attendance of around 400 at the sessions was the best we have ever had. At the conclusion of the assembly the village priest expressed the view that, if Jehovah’s witnesses ever held another assembly in the village, he feared that the whole village would become Jehovah’s witnesses!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark224"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere have keen interest in what is going on in Czechoslovakia. Living behind the Iron Curtain is hard and it is all the more difficult for those who have taken their stand for Jehovah God and his kingdom of righteousness. Despite great limitations and restrictions on a person’s time and equipment the brothers go forth in the educational work and help many receive the truth. Again there has been a splendid increase in the number of those coming into the organization. There have been 442 baptized in symbol of their dedication to do the will of Jehovah God just during the past service year. Thousands of interested persons have come together at Memorial time to celebrate the death of Christ Jesus, just as God commanded through his Word. The communistic government is very much disturbed because these people refuse to fall in line with their ideologies and because they keep on worshiping Jehovah as God. All sorts of measures are taken against Jehovah’s witnesses in order to intimidate them, but still they stand firm for true worship. Reports have come through to this effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In March of 1953 the leading brothers were given long prison sentences. Most of them are in Jachymov in the uranium mines. When someone is released from the mines the brothers throughout Czechoslovakia receive news from time to time as to how our brothers are getting on. The reason for the release of some was an amnesty decreed by the government. Even though they received devilish treatment the brothers have been able to survive. The communistic organization has gone to great extremes trying to force the brothers to forsake the truth. In the coldest weather they have made some of the brothers walk back and forth to work without food and thinly clad for ten consecutive days. Starving and exposed to the cold they were marched every day, yet they survived and refused to break their faith. Finally they were sent to the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the brothers are trying to find new interest by working one house on one street and then another house on another street. It happened that one of the Slovakian brothers working in this way called on a man who worked in the town administration. He was a “comrade.” The “comrade” said to the brother: “Now I have you here, you are one of those who are inciting the people!” With this he put on his coat and started for the police. But the brother answered him: “If I had known you were such a hardened comrade I would have made a big detour and avoided you.” The man replied: “Do you mean we are so bad?” The brother then made an effort to witness to him about God’s purposes. The man listened with interest, took off his coat, and his animosity began to pass. He said: “This is something quite different. I was misinformed about you. I see your mission is a noble one. I wish you would visit me again when you come into this neighborhood.” Today a regular Bible study is being conducted in this man’s home and three other interested persons are joining in with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was reported that some “comrades” were having a meeting and a priest was with them. A question came up about Jehovah’s witnesses. The priest warned them that Jehovah’s witnesses were dangerous and should not be believed, except, “if you want to know absolutely what God’s name is, well, it is right to call him Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is most interesting to note, too, that the brothers there support the work by making contributions so that the necessary things, like a typewriter and some paper and traveling expenses, can be cared for. Some brothers who have become sick are also helped through these contributions. Our fellow workers in the New World society are certainly happy to be able to carry forward the work and they have had remarkable experiences in the service. A splendid increase has been seen in the number of persons associating with Jehovah’s organization. Jehovah’s blessing is upon them and undoubtedly when the brothers in Czechoslovakia learn about the 1955 yeartext they will rejoice greatly, for they can truly say as did the man the psalmist was writing about: “He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.”—Ps. 112:7, AS.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark225"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in Denmark have worked hard and shown that they definitely are a part of the New World society in action. They have followed through with the training program to aid the new and inexperienced ones to improve in their service to Jehovah God. They have worked hard to develop better presentations of their three- to eight-minute sermons at the door. This has been beneficial to our Danish brothers because it gives them more territory; not that they have expanded their boundaries or more people are living there now, but it takes them more time to cover their territory. When they go to a door now a publisher can stay there and do a little preaching. This is proper and will help the people of good will to get a fuller understanding of Jehovah’s purposes. When we think of the good news being preached in all the world for a witness we must consider Denmark, for here we have a nation where there are probably more Jehovah’s witnesses per capita than in any other European country. We rejoice with them and are happy to read the report the branch servant sends in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the year began to pass, Jehovah’s witnesses continued to advance and face their problems with action. One such problem in Denmark has been meeting attendance. But, knowing that attendance is vital to all who would mature in Jehovah’s service, one congregation with a scattered territory went into action. They purchased an old bus and put it in order. Now, on meeting nights the brothers walk out to the main road; and the bus, keeping to a definite route and schedule, picks up the brothers and takes them to meetings. Result: meeting attendance increased one hundred per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Action has been noted in getting into the less developed areas as well. While there is no isolated territory in Denmark, there are some less developed areas with weaker congregations. In Copenhagen there are more than 3,000 publishers for a population of one million people, or about one publisher for each 330 persons, but the over-all average in Denmark is one publisher for each 500 persons. One of the larger progressive congregations in Copenhagen had many very capable brothers as servants and publishers, and thus their territory was well cared for. So the congregation servant gave up his job and apartment in Copenhagen and he and his family moved to Jutland, where he located a new home and new work. Here his experience will be most helpful to the little congregation in its meetings, training publishers and working territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Continual action is noted in the churches, or rather </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">from</span><span class="font7"> the churches. As many persons learn of the truth, they now wish to leave the church, into which they automatically became members at birth, and to associate with the New World society. In contacting the local priest so that the proper procedure required in Denmark might be followed for this change there have been many interesting experiences. In one instance the brother and his wife were told by the priest, “This little matter we can soon have in order.” When he was finished he asked them for the first time why they were leaving the church. The couple answered: “We have started to study our Bible and have found that the teachings of the Scriptures do not agree with the teachings of the church.” “Naturally,” replied the priest, “we have to follow the state. We can’t follow both.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another priest asked to visit the family before they made the move. He later appeared with his Bible full of markers. After the new brother got the priest involved in points of the Hebrew Scriptures, the priest brightened up and said, “Well, we can’t follow the Old Testament in everything.” Then, when the brother began to show a conflict between church teaching and the statements of Jesus and his apostles, the priest closed his Bible and said, “Well, you know one can’t rely on the entire Bible any more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But, then, there was the priest who shook hands with each of a family of four and wished them well. He then amazed them by saying, “I too subscribe for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Vagttaarnet” (The Watchtower).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The climax of the year for Jehovah’s witnesses in Denmark was their national assembly in Copenhagen. Here the brothers realized a desire of many years, to hold an assembly in the Forum, the largest indoor hall in Denmark. For the public talk 13,800 persons overflowed the Forum, 5,000 more than there are publishers in Denmark. At this assembly there were more than 500 baptized, bringing the number baptized this past year to a total of 1,014.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our work here is not without problems. An effort has developed from the ministry of commerce to require the Society and Jehovah’s witnesses to obtain licenses under trade laws, and to restrict their literature distribution to the hours authorized by law for operation of commercial shops. But Zion’s gates are to be open day and night, and Jehovah’s witnesses, knowing the vital part in Bible education played by distribution of literature, are carrying this matter through the courts. The case has been presented in the superior court and at the time of this writing we have just received the ruling of the court in favor of the ministry of commerce. We are not dismayed, however, but will continue right on with all our work, and fight the case through the supreme court of Denmark. We confidently look to Jehovah for victory, but regardless of what he allows we know that with the good training of the organization we can always continue from house to house using our Bibles and giving talks, extending the knowledge of the truth in this way, for there are yet thousands of persons in Denmark who want to learn to live forever.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark226"></a>FAROE ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">We are happy to see the work increasing here with improved organization. Beginning in May, two special pioneers were assigned here and have done very good work. The people are scattered, involving much traveling by boat, foot and other means to reach them. Now there is one congregation organized on these islands and an average of five publishers have reported since May. We look forward to seeing further increases here during the coming year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark227"></a>GREENLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This, Denmark’s isolated territory, is the world’s largest island, with 827,000 square miles; 80 per cent of its area is ice and 95 per cent is uninhabitable. But there are more than 20,000 Greenlanders living here and Jehovah’s witnesses have the desire to acquaint these with the New World society. Until recently religion there has been under a monoply of Moravian and Lutheran missions, and no one could go to Greenland at all unless he would take a job essential to the local economy. A publisher did spend a few months here in connection with a job and we understand some oral witnessing was carried on. Now it is possible for anyone to get into Greenland, and we hope to arrange for some organized work there next summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With this in mind it amuses one to note the concern of an evangelical Pentecostal society over the work Jehovah’s witnesses are doing world-wide. In the July, 1954, issue of their magazine, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Evangelisk Tidsskrift,</span><span class="font7"> a writer stated: “With the opening up of Greenland, we must recognize the great danger which lies in nonevangelical societies trying to carry on a work. . . . Yes, it is a fact that the Adventists have already worked for a year in Greenland, and Jehovah’s witnesses, who possess the missionary zeal we so often feel the lack of, are also planning to work up there, so it is a question for us to get ahead as quickly as possible.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark228"></a>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Persecution continues in this land, but then Jehovah’s witnesses know that such things will exist. They know they will be called before rulers and kings and be given the opportunity of testifying to the name of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. Despite the difficulties in the Dominican Republic Jehovah’s witnesses continue to preach. In July they reached a new peak of those associated with the New World society, namely 353, and we rejoice with them. The ban in the Dominican Republic is very complete, not only against the Society but also against the “propaganda work of the organization.” So the ban covers the meetings, the preaching work and the use of the mails for transmitting literature, and the publishers are not even supposed to talk to their neighbors. But you cannot prevent talking and you cannot prevent Jehovah’s witnesses from sharing the wonderful good news of the Kingdom with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was possible for some representatives of the Society to call on our brothers in the Dominican Republic and they brought them great joy and happiness. A report comes to hand about the work being done and some excerpts are taken from the letter written by the one in charge of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We received the film of “The New World Society in Action” and there are very few publishers in the country who have not seen it. This film has been very encouraging to us all. The comments after a movie session ran something like this: “That was wonderful. We thought we were alone in this work, but now we see we are only a small part of a great multitude.” To date we have shown it seventeen times to a total audience of 643.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our experiences in the field are many and varied. One zealous sister on her way home from work one night passed the “Assembly of God” church as the people were coming out. One group was discussing the ‘talking in tongues’ and was puzzled about it. This sister entered the conversation and briefly explained that ‘tongues’ here meant languages. The group saw the point and asked where she learned so much and if they could learn too. A study was arranged. Five books were placed at the first study and they quit going to the church. The pastor did not like that one bit, so he sent messengers over asking them to come back, and finally he himself came. He pleaded, begged, cried and prayed until the group said they would go back to his church. They discontinued the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But that taste of pure truth water was too good to lose, so after a few weeks they asked again for a home Bible study. Again the sister started the study and during one of the studies the “second” pastor stopped in front of the house. He was a cripple and had to be brought in a cart. The study was over, so the sister was going to leave, but the group said, “No, don’t go. Let’s see what he will say.” The “segundo” came in and began cursing Jehovah’s witnesses, saying they were against the government and the government was against them and if the people continued they would all get into trouble. Then he wanted a Bible and read Romans 13 and applied it to earthly governments. The sister told him to read what Satan said to Jesus in the wilderness about who the governments of this world belonged to and how it was Satan’s right to offer them to Jesus and so Satan was the possessor of them. Then he began jumping to “soul” and other doctrines, shouting and ranting. In the midst of all this one of the neighboring ladies who had been sitting in on the study got up and commanded silence and said: “I’m a Catholic, but we were studying the Bible here in peace and harmony until this so-called pastor came along and all he brought was confusion. He has the spirit of the Devil in him.” Then the one that brought the cripple in said: “That’s right. We have brought confusion and argument to this home. We should leave.” With that he picked up the reprimanded “segundo” and left. Now the group is certain they have the truth and have left the “Church of God” for good, sending in a letter asking that their names be taken off the books. Three of them want to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two publishers from the capital were visiting brothers in the country and ran across a schoolteacher in one sector. She was opposed to the truth, but the brother spoke very freely to her, perhaps too plainly and she turned into a first-class opposer. She made a list of fifteen persons who she thought were witnesses and turned it in to the police, with the statement that they were witnesses and were holding illegal meetings. The police picked up all fifteen. When one said he was not a witness he was let free, but the others were jailed without trial or a chance to defend themselves. Twenty-two days later the five women were tried and sentenced to thirty days in jail. Some of the brothers were tried and given three months, but a few have served three months and have not even had a trial. It is supposed that they will have some kind of hearing and be given three months, but since they already have served that time they will be set free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We recognize, as a small group, small and few in number, we could do nothing under the existing conditions; but with Jehovah’s spirit and protection we are maintaining integrity and pushing forward with the witness work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark229"></a>ECUADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Many cowardly attacks have been made by Catholic-trained groups upon Jehovah’s witnesses in Ecuador. Though some try to break up the work, reports come to hand showing that other people will take a definite stand for Jehovah’s people and will come to their aid. One example of this was a university professor who came to the aid of a sister doing street work after a priest had organized a mob against her. It is interesting to note, too, that after the police took the priest away the sister placed all her magazines. The Ecuadorians are for freedom, and a crowd of university students, on seeing that the sister was allowed to keep preaching, cried out, “Long live freedom of worship.” Many such interesting and encouraging experiences have been enjoyed in Ecuador and the branch servant tells us of some others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the beginning of the service year we set a quota aimed at doubling the number of new subscriptions obtained during the previous year. Many of these subscriptions were obtained by two brothers who own a small tool and hardware store. They do not let the fear of losing business stop them from talking about the glorious New World society. Theocratic literature is continually on display in the store, and if a customer leaves without receiving a witness it is because he was in a big hurry. As a result of the good work that these brothers have done while selling nails, hinges and door handles more than eighty subscriptions were obtained right in their store and many of these have already been renewed several months before the expiration date. And, of course, the brothers have more business than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another brother who talks as he goes is one whose work takes him out into the “bush” about 300 days out of the year. On horseback and on foot he reaches the home of countless </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">campesinos</span><span class="font7"> (peasants) that the other publishers could never And. When he began to publish he just carried his own books with him and held family meetings in the evening, when he would read and explain the truth, but now he takes a considerable stock of literature every time he returns to the city and he finds no difficulty in placing it. His placements for any one month surpass those of most of the city publishers for the entire year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some fine work was done this year in a number of the small towns in unassigned territory. This is done mostly by individuals, because the need for much more work in the cities does not permit the congregations to leave home often. Three of the missionaries spent part of their vacation visiting some small towns, and they found more interest than they had time to take care of. In less than 50 working hours they placed 240 books, 480 booklets and distributed more than 3,000 tracts. Taking out traveling time did not leave them many vacation days in which to relax, but they saw a bit of the world that they had never seen before and they helped many others to see a bit of a new world that they had never seen before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One thing worthy of mention is the way in which the brothers are learning to take care of Kingdom interests materially. Every congregation needs to have a place to meet for the worship of Jehovah, and it must be able to maintain that place without the aid of brothers who belong to other congregations. The largest congregation in the country used to have a fine Kingdom Hall, but the contributions were not sufficient to pay for the rent. So it was decided that the hall would be closed when the contract ended in the month of April and that the meetings would be held in small groups in the homes of the brothers. As the months went by the publishers longed more and more for the association of all of their brothers and sisters, they felt sorely the restriction of not being able to sing at meetings and to stay and visit with one another for too long. So each family considered the matter to see what could be done to provide the material things necessary to take care of a great spiritual need. The result is that they have ended this service year by renting a new Kingdom Hall, where they will pay $40 monthly for rent.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark230"></a>EGYPT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The past service year was an eventful one for Jehovah’s people in Egypt. Opposition arose from both the political and religious elements against the New World society. But despite these difficulties the message of the Kingdom continued to be preached. Great pressure was brought to bear against many individuals to get them to stop preaching and to compromise. Outstanding in opposition is a so-called Christian religion, the Coptic Orthodox Church in particular, which through its agents caused mob action. It is not infrequent for them to try to run people out of town, for the peaceful message preached is hard on their hypocritical ears. The branch office in Egypt looks after the work in Sudan as well, and here the message is being preached under conditions that require much faith and perseverance. The workers are few and many more publishers could be used in this part of the world if we could get them in to preach. The ones who are there rejoice and continue to proclaim the good news. The report from the branch servant for these two countries is interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Toward the beginning of this service year the council of state court rejected the complaint that the three missionaries, assigned to Alexandria, had made the year before against the ministry of interior, asking for the cancellation of the deportation order. This meant the missionaries had to leave the country, which they did. Soon after that the government issued an order to stop all the activities and meetings of the Watch Tower Society and Jehovah’s witnesses. With the exception of the Cairo congregation, it became impossible for the brothers to meet at their Kingdom Halls. They were threatened with deportation and were asked to sign a paper stating they would stop all activity as Jehovah’s witnesses. Severe measures were taken to prevent the brothers from exercising pure worship, but these all proved unsuccessful. They continued their meetings and Kingdom service through the congregation book study arrangement, with a zeal even greater than before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In one instance the police authorities arrested a pioneer working in an isolated territory, after breaking into his room and confiscating all his literature. To get it back he had to promise he would cease all preaching. He was also demanded to sign a declaration by which he had to state he would stop all activity in connection with the Society. As the brother refused to comply with this demand, he was threatened and told that “the government does not recognize your Society and it is not allowed to operate.” To this he said: “You don’t recognize it, but I do.” Unable to intimidate the brother, they let him go free after he had explained to them about God’s kingdom and its proclamation as done by the Society. Next, they arrested a good-will person with whom the pioneer was studying and, after dealing with him as they did with the pioneer, they asked him to stop all connections with the work. However, exercising faith in Jehovah and seeing the pioneer’s firm stand, he refused to submit to their demand and declared he was always ready to receive the pioneer. This he did, was later baptized and is now an active publisher taking the lead in the little group of five publishers that has been formed in that locality. This caused the so-called Christian sects to get together and set a day for fasting and prayer to ask their God to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses, who troubled their town with Kingdom-preaching. But it seems that their curse has turned into a blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The giving of three- to eight-minute sermons at the doors has been proved to be indispensable for effective house-to-house preaching. People expect a minister to give sermons, as shown in this experience. Doing house-to-house work, a publisher knocked at a door and explained to the young lady who opened to him that he was a minister. As soon as she knew she was dealing with a minister, she asked him in and told the several ones at home: “The gentleman is going to give us a sermon.” Good thing the publisher did have a sermon to give! The people were impressed and a back-call was arranged. In another instance a Jewish lady, after hearing a sermon on the Kingdom hope, asked the publisher: “I’ve never thought of changing, but after hearing your words supported by the Bible, I want to ask: ‘What must I do to become a Christian?’ ” Yes, it is a fact that sermons are effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Special pioneers have many things to contend with. To develop good-will interest into Bible studies and then into Kingdom publishers, not only do they have to withstand hatred and opposition, expulsion by the authorities and attack by priest-led mobs, but they also have to build up the interest against family opposition and against ‘Satan’s birds.’ But how great is their joy when the truth lovers join them in blessing Jehovah! It was amid such circumstances that a special pioneer was working. She met a young man in her house-to-house witnessing, literature was placed and a back-call arranged. Soon his family began opposing him strongly, burned the literature he had, threatened him with disinheritance and expulsion from the home and even from the town. His parents threatened the pioneer and demanded that she stop calling on him. Nevertheless, the good-will person persisted, arranged to continue his studies elsewhere than at his home, confronted family opposition, and before four months had passed he was preaching from house to house. Since then he has been a regular house-to-house preacher and he now has his own Bible study in progress with good prospects of starting a new house-to-house preacher.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark231"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark232"></a>THE SUDAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Sending a missionary to the Sudan to help the brothers in organization and efficient Kingdom service was very timely. In four months’ time the publishers increased in number from six to nine and showed a deeper appreciation of the ministry, so that two of them took up vacation pioneer work. One of them arranged to pioneer for two months without neglecting his school studies. Speaking of his vacation pioneering, he wrote: “I enjoyed many blessings and nice experiences. It was the best time I ever had in my life. I am looking forward now to the next vacation, but before this I will try my best to pass the class and, if it is Jehovah’s will, to finish school as soon as possible, so that I may enter the regular pioneer service forever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The cold indifference of many and the opposition of others do not discourage the witnesses. All the homes visited on a certain morning had rejected the message, but how about the next one? A man is contacted and not only does he show interest in our message, accept the offer and subscribe for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> but he thinks, too, about his relatives and directs his son to take the publishers to his sister’s home a few blocks farther. There a good opportunity was afforded for presenting the good news, more literature was placed and a new subscription was obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Still continuing in spite of the dizzying sun rays and terrific heat, the publishers make another call; and what a blessed experience! The householder and his friends are interested in our work and they have many questions that keep the two publishers busy for an hour answering them from the Bible. Satisfied with the clear explanation given, they obtain literature, subscribe for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> and take a copy of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures. </span><span class="font7">“It is the first time in my life I met people so sincerely believing and knowing their Bible,” said the householder as he accompanied the departing publishers to the door. He then ordered his driver to take them home in his car. This was greatly appreciated, the time being 1:00 p.m. and the heat simply unbearable. Extra time in the service really pays off.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark233"></a>EL SALVADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses who live in this little country are very zealous in praising Jehovah’s name. Their report shows good increase in the distribution of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> magazines. They know the value of these magazines and want to give them still wider distribution in 1955. The new film has caused considerable interest in the country and great work is being done by it. With a new all-time peak of 323 ministers of the good news the publishers are happy and look forward to the new service year and its blessings. The branch servant tells us some of their experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The 1954 service year started out wet. It had rained for three weeks, day and night, just before Brother Franz stepped off the airplane last October bringing with him warm, dry, sunny weather. The occasion was a national assembly in San Salvador, and the brothers were thrilled to hear Brother Franz’ Yankee Stadium talks, which he freely poured out upon them tirelessly, in easy, forceful Spanish. Also, he was able to address a public attendance of 1,225. It was also broadcast on a local radio station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Brother Knorr authorized the appointment of Salvadoran special pioneers, who during the year were able to effect a good increase, and they contributed much to the organization’s growth to maturity. One of the brothers thus assigned starts his workday at 6:30 or 7:00 each morning, and therefore he is able to report up to 200 hours each month. This brother was somewhat discouraged during the first few months of his special pioneer assignment. The small town where he worked was determined that he should get out. The Catholics did not bother him, but the radical, Pentecostal elements were the ones who openly opposed him and his free Bible work. Huddled in their noisy </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">capillas,</span><span class="font7"> variously named “Church of God” and “Church of Christ,” they listened to their pastors rage against Jehovah’s witnesses; and these simple, Pentecostal hill folk would show later what they had learned in “church” by promising to shoot our brother if he did not leave town. But he stuck to his work, and his perseverance and constancy paid off. By tactfully witnessing to the people on the subject of the Kingdom and by answering harsh words and threats with kindliness, he is now able to report nine isolated ministers working with him. The people have learned to respect him and his work. He is no longer threatened, but instead he is greeted pleasantly even by his former opposers. This pioneer was himself once a Pentecostal preacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another of the special pioneers has done good work in a coastal section including one of El Salvador’s busiest port cities. When this brother first started to read the Bible and decided to quit being a Catholic, all enthused, he traveled a great distance to tell his mother of his change. So as not to shock this very Catholic lady, he broke the news in what he considered to be a very tactful way: “Mother, imagine: I’ve given up throwing my money away on loose women, I have given up drinking, and I am not going to carouse around any more; no more swearing or rough ways for me; no more. . . .” At that the startled woman cut him off with a horrified cry and groaned, “May the virgin help us! My son, you’ve ruined yourself; you’ve left the holy mother church!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, outstanding during the year was the Republic-wide exhibition of the thrilling film “The New World Society in Action.” This was of limitless benefit to the brothers, whose hazy, mental conception of the tremendous scope of the New World society was enhanced a thousand times. In the port city of Acajutla a kindly person of good will offered her theater with its projector and all facilities free so that we could show “The New World Society in Action” to her </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">pueblo</span><span class="font7"> (town). For one whole hour prior to the showing we were able to use her PA system making announcements and inviting the public up and down the water front to come to see this wonderful Bible film. Needless to say, the place was packed out; 400 well-mannered, appreciative persons saw the film. Afterward, one family shyly thanked us and said: “We live about two kilometers down the road. We liked the film very much, and we do not have any inconveniences whatsoever in becoming Jehovah’s witnesses; so will you please come to visit us?”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark234"></a>ETHIOPIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Legend has it that the king of Ethiopia is a descendant of the “queen of the south” and that the present-day kings of Ethiopia are all descendants of Menelek, the alleged son of Solomon and the queen of Sheba. But it is a joy to know that “something more than Solomon is here.” Today the Greater Solomon, Christ Jesus, has taken up his power and begun ruling in the heavens, and he is directing his people throughout all the world. The past year has been a year of progress for Jehovah’s witnesses in Ethiopia under the direction of the Greater Solomon. There have been trials and difficulties and setbacks, but great joy has been felt here by those who are gathering together the other sheep. The Society tried to get more missionaries into Ethiopia during the last year, but without success, and we even had some difficulty getting permission for those already there to remain, due to pressure brought by other missionary groups working through the government. However, we are still there, moving ahead strongly and with good increases. The branch servant makes a report on Ethiopia and also on some new territory that has opened up in Eritrea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the past very little house-to-house work had been done due to government restrictions upon the missionaries, which prevented them from taking a lead in this feature of service. However, during the year a training program was instituted to teach the publishers how to preach as Jesus and his apostles did. As a result of this program the end of this service year found the majority of the publishers house-to-house preachers. The increased house-to-house preaching also resulted in a rise in meeting attendance and in several new peaks in publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For the first time, too, younger publishers took advantage of the opportunity to do vacation pioneer work. From one Congregation alone, one that had been newly formed at the beginning of the service year, eight young brothers became vacation pioneers. Desiring to expand their ministry, three of these brothers continued as general pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While the missionaries are unable to do any preaching in the towns of the interior, the work is steadily expanding throughout the country. From time to time we have studied the truth with persons who have later moved to interior villages where none of Jehovah’s witnesses lived. In many instances these newly interested persons have begun to preach and conduct studies of their own in these scattered places. These brothers have done their best, although in many cases their knowledge has been somewhat limited, since they had studied only a short time before moving away. As a result of this work, though, we now have 19 publishers preaching in 13 different villages in the interior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The great need now is for pioneers to go into these places to take care of the interest. The results obtained m one little town where two special pioneers were sent show the possibilities for the work in the interior. After six weeks these pioneers were visited by one of the missionaries and at that time 42 people came to listen to his talk. He found that between the two pioneers they were conducting thirty home Bible studies, and ten people of good will had joined them in the preaching work. Nov/ a congregation has been established and with Jehovah's blessing we can look for continued increases.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark235"></a>ERITREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During the past service year two publishers from Ethiopia moved into an Eritrean town for their secular work. After becoming established they immediately started preaching the good news to all who would hear. Good reports of field service were received from these brothers during July and August, in addition to several letters from persons of good will from different parts of the country. Future prospects for the spread of Kingdom truth in Eritrea look very good at this time, and it is hoped that the Society may be able to send some good Tigrifia-speaking pioneers into this new field to aid in the expansion work during the coming service year. Yes, the gospel of the Kingdom will yet be a witness to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7"> nations, including Eritrea, before the accomplished end of this system of things.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark236"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Our brothers in Finland are very grateful for the spiritual “meat in due season” they have received through the theocratic organization. Shortly after the assembly in New York’s Yankee Stadium they also had a gathering and were quite happy to have many new releases in their own language. They are especially happy with the arrangement of the new training program and they are putting it into effect by helping new ones and showing them the way they ought to go. The branch servant in Finland gives us a number of interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One family in Kuopio had been studying with Jehovah’s witnesses but had not taken their stand firmly. But when the district assembly came to their city three fleshly sisters of this family became enthused. Some of the Bethel family stayed at their home during the assembly. Each night they had long discussions on Biblical questions before going to bed. Baptism was also discussed. They listened attentively to all talks but were not baptized at the convention. However, a week later they traveled to Tampere, where all three of the sisters were immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One pioneer had just finished giving instructions for field service at an assembly when a young man came up to him and said: “May I come along and hear how you witness from door to door?” This man’s parents were witnesses, but until this time he had not taken much interest in the work. Now he wanted to find out how it was done. The pioneer took him along from house to house, and that morning was a decisive time for him. A Bible study was arranged to give him more knowledge. His brother and wife joined in. The young man was so enthused that he started a study with one of his friends. They all came to congregation meetings and started associating with the witnesses. In just six months all four of these newly interested ones were ready to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Service work in unassigned territory has brought good results. In one isolated woods some literature was placed with a woman last year. Since the congregation was unable to care for the territory regularly in winter, the name and address was forwarded to the branch office, which later sent the name to a pioneer sister who moved into the territory. She found the woman very religious but interested in the truth, so a home Bible study was started. Although this place is quite isolated still the pioneer sister regularly went to hold the study with her. It was a great joy to see this isolated family take their stand for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In some unassigned territory the priests have resented Jehovah’s witnesses’ activity and have warned the people not to go and listen to these ‘false prophets.’ This has made the people all the more interested. In one church the priest preached a sermon saying that the witnesses were so clever that no one should start talking with them. He said that you have to be a theologian to be able to cope with them. At the close of his sermon many of the people came directly from the church to the other side of the road where Jehovah’s witnesses had arranged a public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the publishers left the village after the public meeting a man who had been at the meeting accompanied them in the bus back to town. The publishers witnessed to him and left literature with him. Later he obtained copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font7">from other publishers. One witness later explained to him about our meetings, and he started to attend regularly. On coming to the meetings, he asked how he could get literature to offer to the people he meets. Since that time he has been a regular publisher. His wife also has become a publisher. This has been one of results of contacts made in unassigned territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A pioneer sister was witnessing in isolated territory one cold winter day when she met a woman outside the house. After finding out the purpose of her call, hurriedly the woman called the witness inside and told her husband that now someone has come with the information they have been waiting for. They had read a booklet sometime before where an announcement was made of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine. Now they wanted to subscribe for that magazine. They were so eager to receive the truth that they took all different kinds of literature the sister had in her bag. A study was started with the people showing so great interest that the cows had to wait for their milking that night. The study continued, with neighbors joining in each time. This last summer the husband and wife were both immersed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark237"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">This country has been the center of anxious diplomatic activity for the past year. In Tunisia and Morocco there have been many bloody riots, and France has been in a state of worry with its war in Indochina stretching into eight long years. On top of that there was a terrible earthquake in Algeria. The rulers of the nations have their problems and their worries. Jehovah’s witnesses, though, are not afraid of the evil tidings; their hearts are fixed, trusting in Jehovah; so they move forward preaching the good news of the Kingdom and patiently trying to gather the other sheep into the New World society. There have been difficulties in regard to literature for France, and obtaining licenses to import Bible helps has been most difficult. But our brothers are continuing in the service and not halting. Throughout all this territory of France, Algeria, Indochina, Morocco, the Saar, Senegal and Tunisia, which comes under the jurisdiction of the Paris branch office, progress is being made. Excerpts from the branch servant’s reports on these countries follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The need for patience and perseverance is shown by the following experience. A pioneer in Paris writes: “While working from house to house I placed a booklet with a lady. I called back several times but was never able to contact her. At the time of our circuit assembly I slipped a handbill under her door. The week after the assembly I called again and this time I saw her. She said that she and her husband had attended the public talk and enjoyed it very much. She regretted not having taken the three bound books from me. However, I told her she could have them right there and then. She eagerly took the three bound books. I invited her to come to the public talk in the local Kingdom Hall the following Sunday. She came along with her husband, and a Bible study was arranged for the week following. After only a few weeks’ study the lady said: “I know that I, too, should go from door to door, but what can I do? I am 67 and I cannot climb from floor to floor, as is necessary here in Paris.” (On the average one has to climb ninety steps to reach the seventh floor!) The pioneer replied tactfully: “Of course, Jehovah does not expect you to do as much as a younger person, but the effort you will make will be pleasing to him.” A few weeks later they were invited to have a share in the house-to-house work. The husband came alone and worked with a congregation publisher. Shortly afterward they both came along and engaged in the work together, the husband taking the lead. They attend the meetings regularly and have now been baptized.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Work in the unassigned territories has brought forth fruit, as the following experience shows: “While working from house to house in unassigned territory I contacted a family of nine who showed much interest in the Kingdom message. The head of the family already had a Bible and readily took three bound books, and requested that I call back when in that neighborhood the next time. This I did in company with my husband. We discussed the truth with them for a considerable time and discussed how to study the Bible with the Bible helps they now possessed. After returning home we maintained contact with this family by correspondence. It was a great joy to note the salutation of each letter. The first: “Dear Friends,” the second: “Mr. and Mrs. C----, friends in Jehovah,” and so on. Then there came</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">a two-month silence. And now here is their reply: “Dear Brother and Sister: Please excuse the long silence, but we know that you will rejoice to learn that my wife, my daughter and my son and I have been baptized. We hope that this year, too, my mother-in-law and my other daughter will also be baptized. We have just returned from the circuit assembly in Epinal. ... I would be grateful to you if you could give us the names and addresses of the persons who took publications from you in the village of Pure. Please accept the brotherly love of a family in the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another publisher writes: “Although I was a Catholic I always thought that there was something lacking in my religion. I wanted to know what was in the Bible and so I asked my priest to get me a copy. But he never did. Finally I was obliged to go and find one myself. I soon saw that for one who reads the Bible for the first time it is very difficult to understand, and I didn’t know how I could get to understand it. One Sunday I was visited by a gentleman who said he was a witness for Jehovah and a Bible student. He talked to me about the truth and this pleased me very much, but I wanted to prove what he said by an interview with a Catholic priest. The interview was arranged and we went to see the priest with another gentleman who happened to be the circuit servant. After three hours of discussion and refuting of the religious doctrines and dogmas of the Catholic Church I saw that I had been kept in ignorance of the truth. Wanting to know more from these two gentlemen, I asked them to come to my home that same evening to give my husband an account of this interview. I was stupifled by all the things I had learned and still had to learn. When they suggested a home Bible study in our home we gladly accepted.” This couple and their two children are now active publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We, in France, are grateful to Jehovah for the progress made thus far and we rejoice at the thought of the great feast that our heavenly Father is preparing for us in company with thousands of our brothers who will be coming to Paris from America, Canada, England and many other parts of the earth. The brothers here in France are looking forward with great enthusiasm to the 1955 conventions and are determined to move forward in step with the onward march of the New World society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark238"></a>ALGERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In Algeria the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is concentrated mainly in the city of Algiers, which has a population of over 500,000. Two thirds of this population are Arabs and the rest is cosmopolitan, practicing the most diverse customs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The congregation servant reports that as a result of persistent theocratic activity 81 persons of good will attended the Memorial service. This activity has not passed unseen. The clergy bewail such activity when speaking to their parishioners and also from the pulpit, showing the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”,</span><span class="font7"> and pronounce a curse on the book, on those who distribute it and on those who read it. Long articles appear in the newspapers saying that the city has been invaded by Jehovah’s witnesses, whereas there are only five pioneers with whom there are now associated more than forty publishers. A very fine spirit reigns among the pioneers and the congregation publishers, making for increased praise to Jehovah, who sustains them by his spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The congregation book studies play their part in the ingathering of the Lord’s other sheep. Five such studies are organized in Algiers and the average attendance is fifty. At one of these studies a person of good will attended and invited her sister who was on vacation in Algiers. During and after the study this young woman asked many questions concerning events and particularly concerning the Messiah, because she is a Jewess. She attended the study the following week. When announcements were made concerning field service and the Sunday Bible study she asked if she could attend the Sunday study. “Why, of course!” was the reply, “the study is open to all persons of good will.” She attended the Bible study and was so delighted with what she heard that she asked the wife of the study conductor if she could participate in the field service with her. Thus the following week she engaged in field service and after the congregation book study made further arrangements to continue in this service. It was in this way that she spent her vacation—attending theocratic meetings and working in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When she returned to her home, which is 400 miles away, she made known the good news to her family, but her father was opposed. However, her mother and sister are anxious to learn the truth and are being taught unobtrusively by this sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> is a powerful weapon that Jehovah’s witnesses use to open the eyes of honest persons. A publisher writes: “Recently I placed a copy of the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font7"> with a fervent Catholic lady. On reading that statues and objects of this kind are nothing but vain idols, she became very cross. She immediately went and found her confessor and confessed her sin of having read a book proscribed by her religion. The priest replied: ‘The statues are not idols. The individual who sold you the book is a demon. Burn the book and, as for the witness, when he comes to your home, kick him out.’ This manner of speaking did not please this lady. She replied: ‘Even so, the gentleman had nothing about him that resembled a demon.’ She returned home turning over in her mind the words of the book and those of the priest, who some time ago had insulted her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“At the appointed time I called back to see this lady, who told me what had happened since I placed the book with her. Of course, the question of idols was discussed thoroughly. The next day she made a package of all her idols and took them to the person who had sold them to her. When the seller asked her why she was doing this she replied by giving him the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’,</span><span class="font7"> and then went and visited her friends, with whom she placed two more copies. Since then she accompanies me regularly in the field service, several times a week. She ‘cries from the housetops’ that before knowing Jehovah’s witnesses she did not even know the name of her heavenly Father, let alone his purposes. She zealously invites the people to come out of the captivity in which she herself was a victim for more than sixty years.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark239"></a>INDOCHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There was a little witnessing done in Indochina for a period of three months last year. It would be a grand thing if we could get some publishers to go into this country to preach the good news of the Kingdom. Here the people have gone through wars and trials for many years, and so there must be many who need comfort. To have a few publishers there full time would give these people that grand opportunity of hearing the comforting news of Jehovah’s new world. The way may open up for others to enter that land and carry on the grand work. It is our prayer that this will be Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark240"></a>MOROCCO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">One publisher writes: “My dear friends in the truth, Are there any Jehovah’s witnesses or friends of the truth in Morocco in general or in Casablanca in particular? If so I would be very grateful if you could give me their names and addresses so that I could get in touch with them. Perhaps we could form a congregation and work effectively for the vindication of Jehovah’s name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The congregation servant in Algeria was appointed to visit the isolated publishers and interested persons in Morocco. After a visit to three interested persons the visiting servant writes: “These three persons of good will were very much encouraged by our visit and, when the time came for us to leave for Casablanca, we were very sorry to leave them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To visit five addresses in Casablanca it was necessary to cover nearly seventy miles in the city and its surroundings, the extent of the city is so great and the communications so difficult. However, two persons were really interested and one of them asked for the addresses of the persons with whom we had left publications during our work in the city so that he could follow up the interest. He also invited us to stay with him the next time we are in the city. The house-to-house work is very much the same as elsewhere, the witness often being the object of mockery. The people are very suspicious, due to the speculation and extortion carried on there. Nevertheless, it is certain that there are some people of good will mixed in with this unbelieving crowd. And besides all this, riots are frequent. During a recent riot nearly 4,000 people were killed. Isolated assaults occur every day.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark241"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark242"></a>THE SAAR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The circuit servant reports: “While working from house to house I passed a tract through a tiny window to a lady who said she was very busy. Imagine my surprise when visiting the congregation six months later to see this same person in the congregation! She had been brought along by an interested person. Arrangements were made to help her make progress in the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The distribution of the magazines is a part of the service that all can engage in, young and old, new publishers and the more experienced. A congregation servant reports: “Two sisters in our congregation have been particularly blessed in this feature of the work. Although they are both over seventy years of age they have placed between them during the past service year 600 magazines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following experience shows the blessing that comes from patient effort on our part in conducting home Bible studies. A congregation publisher writes: “Over a period of time I conducted a home Bible study with a young man who lived at a distance of twenty-five miles from my home. A few weeks before our district assembly I invited him to attend and he accepted this invitation, even though it would mean interrupting his vacation in Germany to do so. At the time of the assembly he left his parents in Germany and came to the assembly, where he stayed two and a half days. I had convention work to do and could not spend time with him. When I called at his home the next week he greeted me with these words: ‘I will never go to spend my vacation with other people, for now I see the difference between the spirit of Jehovah’s witnesses and that of the people of the world. All your friends received me very kindlily and took care of me.’ He even took part in the house-to-house work and now desires to continue in this service. He has only studied half of the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark243"></a>SENEGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">A brother writes: “It is not the case of our searching out the people of good will, but rather the people of good will are looking for us. And there are many of them. At our home Bible studies it often happens that other persons of good will are present and manifest good interest. At some of our studies there are as many as eight or ten persons present. There is a great amount of work to be done here and we sometimes wonder how we can do it ah. For the past two Sundays the attendance at our Bible study has been seventeen and eighteen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Among the colored population it is more difficult because of their morals and Mussulman practices. They are pretentious fanatics and even wicked, for they would not hesitate to avenge themselves against those who would reveal the great mistakes in their Koran. Their religion has a powerful grip on them and keeps them in fear and ignorance. As soon as the Marabout learns that one of his adepts is having a study with one of Jehovah’s witnesses, he goes and menaces the interested person, and thus many of the interested ones fall into the trap of fear. It will be very difficult to do much with the Mussulmans. However, with the help of Jehovah, perhaps we shall be able to bring along five of the colored persons with whom I have studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A recent report says: “We have now organized three study groups with an average attendance of twenty. During the house-to-house work I have contacted several inhabitants of the island of Goree with whom I placed several books and booklets. The majority of the natives, after having read our books, have declared that the contents are the absolute truth and have already made this known to their coreligionists, the majority of whom are learning the truth. I can say that, without even ever having witnessed on the island of Goree, that island has already been witnessed to.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark244"></a>TUNISIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The first organized congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses has just been formed and the congregation servant writes as follows: “It is with great joy that we see the service year close with such grand results. Beginning in September, 1953, with only six publishers, we finished the service year with 23, a maximum of singers of Jehovah’s praises. Of these, nine have been immersed, one of them being of Jewish descent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is true that the majority of them are only “children” as concerns knowledge of the truth, but they have much enthusiasm, and their desire to grow to maturity is manifest, and therefore our aim for the new service year will be to bring them to maturity. May Jehovah help us in this noble work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In spite of the difficulties, the excessive heat, the many languages, the execrable mentality of the people in general, due to the mixture of nationalities, and also the great mistrust fostered by the untenable situation in Tunisia, we are able to meet quite a number of people of good will who are thirsting for the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark245"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark246"></a>WESTERN GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The work in Germany continues to make excellent progress. The country is divided into two sections—Western Germany, where there is freedom of speech; and Eastern Germany, which is under totalitarian domination. Our brothers in Eastern Germany are certainly suffering and our hearts go out to them and our prayers ascend to Jehovah in their behalf. We are comforted by the words of Paul, the apostle: “No temptation has taken you except what is common to men. But God is faithful and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but along with the temptation he will also make the way out in order for you to be able to endure it.” (1 Cor. 10:13, W) To know that Jehovah is with us and a very present help in time of trouble is truly comforting. Whether our brothers are on the eastern side or the western side of the border, they all put their trust in Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Society has an office and printing plant in Western Germany, and there we were able to print 296,684 bound books during the year, 729,996 booklets and 6,433,010 magazines (4,460,000 of these were </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower).</span><span class="font8"> The Society’s printing plant in Germany has been kept very busy, and we do look for a greater distribution of magazines during the coming year because of the wonderful message contained therein. The report of the branch servant who looks after both the eastern and western divisions of Germany has been sent in and some of the experiences of our brothers appear here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the conclusion of our district assemblies and of the Bethel vacation for this year another service year has passed, and we look back thankfully, richly blessed with the many joys that it brought us in the service and worship of our God. There are certainly not fewer obstacles in our land than the others, but by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness we were able to meet all of them and to press on in the battle for the freedom to preach. Our increase in publishers amounted to almost 11 per cent and we reached a peak of 47,977. The number of pioneers, which, due to the many economic difficulties and the relatively low living standards in Germany, had sunk to less than 800, took a magnificent swing upward to nearly twice the original number as a result of the new provision for vacation pioneer service, so that again close to 1,500 pioneers are active in our land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is no lack of religious opposers here in these parts, those who fret about the irresistible increase of the New World society and who foolishly express their indignation. For the supposed protection of the Catholic people, a Catholic professor has desperately endeavored to write one booklet after the other in which he most urgently warns against the message of Jehovah’s witnesses, and sharp opposition on the part of the church is announced. But the actual depth of his Biblical convictions and his knowledge of the Bible can be better estimated when a person knows that in 1934, at a Catholic convention, he said: “We Catholics see in the swastika the emblem of righteousness, heroism and chastity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Catholic Bavaria, especially in the vicinity of towns where Catholic bishops reside, the attempt was made to suppress our field service activity, the magazine work on the streets in particular, by means of traffic regulations. They claimed the religious population felt that they were being annoyed. The props were knocked from under these attempts, however, as the provinces of Bavaria and Hesse issued a regulation to all police departments that the ministerial service of Jehovah's witnesses was not subject to any legal restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Joyful anticipation is already welling up within us as prospective participants in the European conventions in less than twelve months, and every brother and sister in our country has begun to prepare for the large assembly in Nuremberg in order that each one might be there, in any case and at any price, when the name of Jehovah and his reigning King are glorified in this land as never before.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark247"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark248"></a>EASTERN GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Every tenth of an hour, on an average, of increased preaching counts twice as much as usual when we consider the increased pressure of the enemy, who make strenuous efforts to silence the message of Jehovah’s righteous new world. Around 400 new arrests were made in this service year alone, thereby completely breaking up several congregations. Most of those arrested were sentenced to long prison terms. In all, 1,346 publishers have been arrested up to this time. The number of years to which Jehovah’s witnesses in the East Zone have been sentenced since the ban of the work by the Communist authorities has already reached 9,071 years and nine months, without mentioning the thirteen brothers sentenced to life imprisonment. Since their arrest 28 of Jehovah’s witnesses have been killed. Not only that, but the publishers are methodically fired from their jobs, deprived of their pensions, and their possessions are seized, causing severe economic difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In spite of these things, the house-to-house publishing work was successfully advanced. New territories were reached. Many publishers took up this feature of the service anew, since, for quite some time, they had limited themselves to occasional visits and witnessing among those well known to them. Although the publishers are not able to conduct the training program in its fullest sense, since it is not possible to work publicly, still they put forth efforts to follow the principles of the program. With love, patience and warm interest the servants and experienced publishers spent time supporting the beginners and the weak and irregular ones to break the band of fear of man and to wield skillfully the ‘‘sword of the spirit,” God’s Word. As the Benjaminites once did, they are learning left- and right-handed fighting. But all of this is with the friendliness and goodness known only to the house of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another publisher reports on his time spent in prison: “When I was thrown into prison, I, being new, had the grand privilege of reporting much to the others about the convention and the latest </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> articles. That was a glorious service. Then I was put in an overcrowded cell with many fellow witnesses. These eleven months were spent in intensive Bible study. I learned the Acts of the Apostles almost by heart. From time to time we came in possession of several </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font7">articles. We studied from morning until evening, beginning with the daily text. This gave us practice in ‘sharpening’ one another and in patient endurance. Finally I was transferred to another crew, a group of worldly persons. There I had much opportunity to witness and enjoyed it very much. In one month I was able to work 50 hours preaching.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By their entire conduct Jehovah’s witnesses show their persecutors that they are true members of the New World society. Although they hate Jehovah’s witnesses, still they are continually forced to admit that they are an example of order, peace and cleanliness. One fellow prisoner expressed it this way: ‘All uncleanness and disturbance stop at your door.’ One woman guard praised the cell block where the sisters were located by calling it ‘doll-room.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to the report of one brother, they tried by ail possible means to force Jehovah’s witnesses in prison “X” to eat blood sausage. In obedience to God’s law concerning the eating of blood, they very decidedly and with determination refused. It created such a sensation, offering many opportunities to give a witness, that hardly any of those imprisoned have not been acquainted with Jehovah's purpose. A fellow prisoner said: “Yes, if I had known that when I was still free, I would not have slammed the door in your face as I did.” And an imprisoned woman expressed herself to a sister as follows: “Now at last I know why I had to come to prison; otherwise I never would have had a longing for righteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“What I hold especially worthy of notice,” a released brother said to us, “is the joyful and determined appearance of all the brothers, and the many greetings they all asked me to deliver to everyone, with the words: ‘Not as we will, but as Jehovah wills, that long may we endure. We would like to admonish all those, however, who still have the privilege of enjoying freedom, to raise their voices even more intensively than up till now to the praise of Jehovah.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are two girls, Inge and Leni, 12 and 10 years of age. They experienced all the horrors of the World War, their father fallen in battle, their mother shot by the Russians in their very presence. They were living in an orphanage until they were adopted by a childless couple who were Jehovah’s witnesses, and then reared in the nurture and admonition of Jehovah. At the beginning of September, 1950, the brother was arrested and, because of his faithfulness to God, sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment. As the sister continued with the two children to worship Jehovah without compromise, the anger of the local Communist residents was aroused and the communistic-minded teacher urged that the girls be taken from their believing stepmother “because of the danger to their upbringing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One day a large vehicle drove up in front of the house and two officers of the state security service got out. On their demand to turn the children over to them, the sister refused. Loudly pleading and crying, so much so that it caused a great stir in the entire neighborhood, the girls were forcibly dragged to the car. The officers called the driver of the car to them, but he refused to take part in this indecent show of force. Finally, with the greatest amount of effort, the officers dragged the children into the car and drove off. The entire population of the little village had congregated without being able to help the children in any way. The larger of the two girls openly declared during the trip, ‘her father was not a spy, he had been arrested because he preached the gospel; their stepparents had been very good to them and all the people in the village knew it.’ This moved the benevolently disposed driver so much that he stopped the car and refused to drive farther. They picked up another driver and the children were driven to a Catholic educational home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There they were to be turned away from the worship of Jehovah. At their reception a cross was drawn on their foreheads with water. Vain attempts were made to feed them blood sausage. As a nun appeared by the bedside in the evening to say Catholic prayers with the children, Inge answered: &quot;I worship only Jehovah and no one else!” Since even here in the Catholic home the children did not stop fighting for their belief, they were picked up one day and taken to a political educational home. There the same attempts of force in political matters took place, with the same results. In order to break the resistance of the two young witnesses, they were separated from each other. But now less could be done with them than before; they continued to fight until they were finally reunited. Their brave fight lasted fifteen months, until in view of the hopeless outlook of success through these cheap acts of violence, a kindly disposed man was permitted to accept the guardianship of these children. He took them into his family and there they continue further to praise Jehovah joyfully and thankfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The children are known in the entire neighborhood as the “courageous Jehovah’s witnesses” and many persons are happy over the girls’ determination and encourage them to continue.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark249"></a>GOLD COAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The preaching of the good news of the Kingdom has made many people happy. Surely the scripture has been fulfilled, “Happy are your eyes because they behold, and your ears because they hear.” Many persons have come into the truth in the past year in the Gold Coast and an efficient organization is being built up. Many more </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> magazines are being distributed, now that it is being published in their native language, Twi. Some interesting experiences are related by the branch servant who also looks after the territory in Gambia, Ivory Coast and French Togoland. There are many obstacles to overcome. The people are superstitious and taught to worship fetishes. The religionists who have gone there purportedly to teach Christianity have failed and now try to block the efforts of true Christian missionaries. Despite this, Jehovah’s witnesses are doing a good work and are gathering the other sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brother Invited his aged mother, who was a high-ranking fetish priestess, to attend the national assembly. Surprisingly, the invitation was accepted. After seeing all that took place and understanding what was said, she gave up her fetish practices and dedicated herself to Jehovah, much to the astonishment of her former friends and followers. Later this sister became ill, and, to terrify the people as to the power of this fetish, the chief of the town and many people said that because she had forsaken the fetish it was killing her. But the elderly sister made a complete recovery and with renewed strength continued in her preaching from door to door, resulting in a powerful shaking of this superstitious belief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A special pioneer contacted a person of good will who obtained </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True’’.</span><span class="font7"> This same man told the pioneer of the coming of five &quot;Reverends” to help the few Wesleyans get organized. The “Reverends” arrived (four African, one European) at the office of the goodwill man, but upon finding out that one of Jehovah’s witnesses was active in the town they decided that it would be useless to carry on their activity, so they quit the town that same day and left for another territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A circuit servant tabulated his activity over a threemonth period and reports that, out of the 1,044 miles covered, 218 were on foot. Thirty-two public talks were delivered, with a total attendance of 6,920. Some he contacted had never known about the Bible, while others, like a chief he met, had purchased </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Photo Drama of Creation</span><span class="font7"> several years ago and were ready to subscribe for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and listen to a public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers very much appreciate having </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> in Twi published semimonthly. Subscriptions and distributors’ copies have continued to increase as the magazine reaches into many more homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Several minor court cases involving opposition to the truth have been fought with success during the year. Some young brothers were dismissed from school by prejudiced teachers because of their stand for the truth, but after reporting the matter to the education department they have been reinstated. One such case is now under consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are glad to report that 29 have already written in requesting passage to be booked to Europe to attend the 1955 international assemblies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark250"></a>GAMBIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">We are glad to know that the Society has arranged for one of its representatives to make a special sevenday visit to this territory. We pray that this service visit will bear rich fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Both the missionaries, who worked in Bathurst back in 1951, and the brother in charge of the work now report that the people in the country’s capital are indifferent toward the preaching of the Word. However, it appears that the people in the interior of this small country are much more interested in the truth and we hope it will be possible to reach them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark251"></a>IVORY COAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus declared: “My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.” At a congregation meeting a stranger walked in and listened attentively. After the meeting the congregation servant welcomed him and asked how he knew where Jehovah’s witnesses met. The stranger replied that a friend directed him and that what he had learned had convinced him this </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font7"> the truth. That was the start. Today he is calling on all who will listen to take flight to the mountains for safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After presenting her three- to eight-minute sermon while in the door-to-door work a sister was asked by the Catholic householder, &quot;Which is the true religion?” The sister replied, &quot;Let us consult the Bible.” So the man brought out his Catholic Bible. After reading many passages he came to Matthew 23:8-10 and decided that he would ask the &quot;Father” to explain this to him. Later, when questioning the “Father,” he was given the reply: “I cannot explain it to you. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Monseigneur</span><span class="font7"> is there; go and see him.” Surprised, he went along to see </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Monseigneur.”</span><span class="font7"> Instead of greeting him with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Bonjour, Monseigneur,”</span><span class="font7"> he said </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Bonjour, Monsieur.”</span><span class="font7"> The bishop replied, “What is wrong with you!” The man replied, “Nothing is wrong, but I want an explanation of these scriptures.” After reading the passage through, the bishop exclaimed, “Are you out of your senses? Why should you come and ask me such a question?” The man replied: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font7"> am now in my senses; that is why when I read the Catholic Bible I want to understand it, to be a good Catholic. But if you do not want to explain it to me I am going back to my village and teach the people how I understand it.” Later he told the sister, “So, Madam, what I found is that you people are teaching the truth.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark252"></a>FRENCH TOGOLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Whenever it can the Roman Catholic Church uses the sword of the state to ban and oppose the honorable work of preaching the kingdom of heaven. The government seat for this territory is situated in Lome and from there the decree has been sent out forbidding the circulation of the Society’s publications, and if any should be found in your possession you would be subject to a fine ranging from 10,000 to 15,000 francs. Upon the least possible grounds the French police will arrest an individual, cross-question him and search his person and personal effects. Under these conditions and also with much political tension throughout the country the preaching work continues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A special pioneer tells us of a back-call on a Presbyterian minister who wanted to buy a Bible. The pioneer took along with him some people of good will who were members of the Presbyterian Church. When they got to his residence he was in conversation with several other ministers. One of the ministers asked the pioneer if he was the man preaching throughout the town. He replied that he was and proceeded to give a witness. Whereupon the minister stopped him, saying that, as they were ministers, they need not be preached to, for they knew everything. The pioneer pointed out that the priests in Jerusalem were learned in the law but Jesus preached to them also, so he should be allowed to continue. Taken back by the pioneer’s reply, they allowed him to continue. When he finished his presentation they asked him about the correct manner of baptism. In replying the brother started referring to certain scriptures in support of his presentation, but the Presbyterian ministers wanted him to answer without using the Bible. In reply the pioneer said that he should not say anything without referring to the Bible, for it has been written that no other gospel should be preached besides what is written, referring to Galatians 1:7-9. This was just too much for them, so they left the room. The people of good will, astonished at the attitude of their priests, were convinced after this experience that they must keep close to God’s Word.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark253"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The circumstances surrounding Jehovah’s work in the country of Greece have not shown any improvement. There are still great difficulties in the gathering of the other sheeep. The obstacles impeding importation of literature from the United States and distributing it through the mail are still present. Jehovah’s witnesses are forbidden to meet together and the local authorities break up meetings regularly at the instigation of the local clergy. Jehovah’s servants in Greece are trying constantly to devise means whereby they may gather together without interference. They know and appreciate the importance of coming together and declaring their hope to one another. They want to meet together, for in their association they find strength. Jehovah’s blessing is poured out upon his united organization. The branch office in Athens looks after the work in Turkey also, and the servant relates some experiences from both lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this fortieth year of the Kingdom, Jehovah’s organization has acquired its own Bethel home in Athens. Late in October, 1953, we broke the ground for erecting the new Bethel home, and now a wonderful three-story building is almost ready to house our printing plant, the office and the whole Bethel family. Our printery has already been installed on the ground floor of the new building, and we hope that very shortly the whole Bethel family will be moved in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brother in northwestern Greece was sentenced to one year’s police parole for speaking of God’s kingdom. He was sent to serve this penalty many miles away from his home town. But he did not stay inactive there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He continued his work at that place of “exile” and the result was that a good witness was given in that remote territory, and many people showed an interest in the truth. So that isolated territory was covered without the brother’s incurring any expense of his own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One brother working from door to door was arrested and taken to the nearest police station. There he was under arrest overnight. They put to him several queries, which the brother answered, recommending the policemen to procure the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font7"> and learn about the true form of worship. One policeman replied, “We don’t read such books.” Finally they set the brother free. Next day another policeman of the same section called at the brother’s home and told him, “I heeded what you said in the section. I want to procure the books you talked to us about. I have two cousins, Jehovah’s witnesses, and wished neither to see nor to hear them. Now I shall go in search of them and ask to learn more about Jehovah’s witnesses.” Indeed, all experiences of Jehovah’s people result in a blessing when we fully trust in Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Note now a point characteristic of the lack of religious freedom in our land: Jehovah’s organization sent us a motion-picture projector and a copy of the film “The New World Society in Action.” The brothers’ joy was unspeakable upon seeing this wonderful film. During a projection of the film in a house of the Athens circuit, the police rushed in, broke up the projection and took all attendants, 80 in number, to jail. They finally kept nine brothers under arrest and committed them for court trial on the charge of proselyting. They also retained the projector, the film and the electriccurrent transformer used. In order to see the kind of film it was, they projected it at a cinema hall and invited in about 200 persons, among which were clergymen, professors and police officers. A tremendous impression was caused by the film’s projection; all newspapers commented thereon. Now the case is referred to the ordinary courts, and we await the outcome to be given by Jehovah. Yes, in the land that boasts of having been the cradle of freedom, peaceful and law-abiding people are arrested because of attending the projection of a blameless and educational film at a friendly home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are particularly thankful for the new Bethel building provided by Jehovah and now, with our forthcoming gathering of the branch’s personnel under one shelter, we look forward to a greater increase and expansion of the New World society in Greece. I also wish to express the brothers’ profound gratitude for the rich spiritual food provided during the year through the columns of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> All of these make our hearts glad.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark139"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark254"></a>TURKEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In Turkey, as in many other lands, there is a very strange conception about democracy and freedom. Much is said about human rights and the democratic way of living, but actually there is no freedom, even on matters of divine worship. Our brothers in that land carry on the work and conduct their meetings practically underground. The preaching of the good news is done with greatest caution, owing to the cruel reaction manifested by the authorities against any new “religious propaganda,” as they consider the religion of Jehovah’s witnesses. Yet it is greatly encouraging to notice that the New World society is increasing in Turkey also. Amid the many different nationalities forming the population of Istanbul, it is interesting to note that Turks, Armenians, Hebrews and Greeks unite in one array to bless Jehovah’s name every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two sisters in Turkey write: “Although the difficulties continued to be the same as in previous years, we are happy to see that Jehovah’s Word, his spirit and his organization have helped many persons of good will to get in contact with the truth, to appreciate it and to share in imparting it to others. Thus 19 new sheep were seen dedicating their lives to the service of the Almighty God. Their immersion took place at three different excursions which we made to some lonely spot on the seashore, where first an appropriate talk on baptism was given by a visiting brother. On two occasions this speech was translated into Turkish so that all candidates were able to understand. These new brothers and sisters are of three nationalities: Greek, Armenian and Italian. These latter ones, a mother and daughter, have realized very quickly that Jehovah’s witnesses are representing God’s earthly organization and that this alone can be the true religion pleasing to the Creator. Catholics by birth, they had not been very fervent recently, but when a local publisher came to their door and they heard the message of everlasting life in a righteous new world, they immediately responded and were eager to learn more about this way. When the excursion for baptism came along, they were so overwhelmed by the love, unity and joy reigning among Jehovah’s people that they could not possibly keep back their lives from being dedicated to the one Almighty Jehovah God and to the righteous cause of his kingdom. Now they are happy to be Jehovah’s witnesses themselves, and we feel sure that Jehovah’s spirit will help them progress even more and to become mature servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are firmly convinced that many other sheep will associate themselves with Jehovah’s people and will conscientiously walk on the way to life.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark255"></a>GUADELOUPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Splendid progress was made by Jehovah’s witnesses during the past year in Guadeloupe. Some big things took place as far as the New World society was concerned. A branch office was organized to look after new territory in the Caribbean, namely Guadeloupe, Martinique and St. Martins. Last winter a special assembly was arranged at Pointe-a-Pitre. Brother Henschel was sent there by the Society, and also the crew of the Society’s boat, “Faith,” arrived at the same time, and these together with some French graduates of the twenty-second class of Gilead arranged for a convention. The brothers on the island were very happy to receive these visitors and to join in the festivities Jehovah God had arranged for his people there. The other islands were also visited, and the branch servant now makes a report on what has taken place recently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The whole assembly was a great success, a fine gathering for the brothers, 19 taking the step of water immersion. The motion picture “The New World Society in Action” was a big surprise as well as a delicious dish, and many were inquiring if it was to be shown on the other nights. One good thing was coming after the other. Brother Henschel announced the organization of a branch, which includes the territory of the islands of Guadeloupe, Martinique and St. Martins. What a delightful time! On Sunday, the greatest attendance ever had in Guadeloupe, namely 355, listened carefully to our visitor in order to know why “It is time to consider God’s way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some years ago a lady got the truth in France and was baptized, but after a while stopped associating with the brothers. She came over to Guadeloupe, and a little time later a publisher presented the message of the Kingdom at her home in the regular door-to-door work. What a shock! A second opportunity was offered her by Jehovah to leave this old world! She took hold of that opportunity, although she said later on, “I felt at the moment as did Jonah in the belly of the big fish.” Now she is back to her assignment, giving Jehovah’s warning to the modem Ninevites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Urged by the fact that the Bible has been put more and more into the hands of the people, the Roman Catholic clergy said that Bible reading is lawful and people should read it. But the priests are not going to use even their little finger helping the people to do so. Rather they will fight against anyone teaching others how to feed on God’s Word. In the catechism published in Basse-Terre, page 99, Jehovah’s witnesses are pointed out as teaching a false religion; Catholics must not mix with them nor read their literature. It sounds like “weeping and gnashing of teeth.” The local congregation reported a 38 per cent increase for the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yes, we are very grateful to Jehovah for this service year and we will keep looking to him as the Provider of every good thing for his New World society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark256"></a>MARTINIQUE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">By the 10th of July a couple of special publishers settled in Fort-de-France, the main city, with 66,000 inhabitants. People are aware of their spiritual needs and accept literature with eagerness. They love reading and pass on to their neighbors what they have read. Low morals and idle religions make them wonder about true religion. Jehovah’s witnesses have it and will help them get it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A man asked a publisher: “Should we observe a sabbath day?” No, was the answer, and the Bible was opened to prove the end of the Mosaic law, Christians being under a new system of things. Greatly excited, the man walked around for a little while and said: “I had always in mind that something was wrong with the sabbath.” It appeared that he read the book “Let God </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Be True”</span><span class="font7"> several years ago and understood the truth concerning the sabbath. Now that honesthearted man has changed his whole spiritual feeding program. With two other members of his family he is getting “meat in due season” at Jehovah’s table.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark257"></a>ST. MARTIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Three languages for 8,000 inhabitants living on the same small island! That is St. Martin. The partition of the island between Dutch and French took place on the 23d of March, 1648. But although Dutch and French are taught at school, English remains the common language of the island. Usually the Kingdom publisher has to speak English. He will meet Catholics and Methodists, both of them generally quite satisfied with their religion. People feel as if they were lost from sight by this old world, and they do not have an accurate picture of the plight in which men are now struggling. So it takes patience and endurance to take care of the little interest found until now. But Noah and his family kept preaching and endured down to the time of the end, for years and years. The brothers in St. Martin are willing to do so, as they see the New World society growing, and maybe there are still some other sheep to be found here before Armageddon.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark258"></a>GUATEMALA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Even though there was great disturbance in this land during the past year with internal political strife, these troubles did not slow down Jehovah’s witnesses, for they reached new high peaks in the numbers associated with the organization and a greater witness was given than ever before. Their circuit assembly was delayed for some time due to the troubles but when it was finally held there were 751 in attendance for the talk “God’s Love to the Rescue in Man’s Crisis.” Unusual interest is being shown in many parts of the territory and the branch servant gives us some fine experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A special pioneer witnessing on a train found a woman who seemed interested, although she did not take any litertaure. He made a note of her address for a possible back-call. Several months later he received an assignment to the town where this woman lived. Calling back on her, he saw that she seemed interested, although it was not possible to start a study with her because not only was she married to a Presbyterian minister but she was a firm believer in the local Pentecostal church. In spite of these obstacles, the pioneer continued calling back on her, giving her good Scriptural comfort, because her personal affairs were very unsettled. He invited her to the local meetings, but after many, many invitations managed to get her to attend only twice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This might have been enough to discourage most people, but finally after five months of casual back-calls the woman began to talk about the terrible division that existed in her church, worse even than the terrible political differences that helped produce the recent civil war in Guatemala. She wanted to have the answers to</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">some questions in her mind; so a study was soon arranged. The first week four were present, the next week seven, the following eight. After two weeks she insisted on having the congregation meeting in her home, which was larger than the Kingdom Hall. At the end of three weeks she was going from house to house in group work, and at the end of five weeks she was effectively silencing religious fanatics who deplored how “she had abandoned their church.” Her friends began to congratulate her for becoming one of Jehovah’s witnesses, because she certainly deserved such a “clean religion.” She was so happy that after two months she asked the pioneer to teach her to read, and in less than thirty days she was able to read a little and was making comments in the weekly </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Atalaya</span><span class="font7"> study. She has now expressed the desire to be baptized as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In one small town a person of good will, after studying, saw the importance of properly arranging his domestic affairs. It is the general practice to live in common-law marriage without ever bothering to legalize it; so when this person got married, it was the subject of much discussion, everyone in town being present at the ceremony. Shortly thereafter, this new publisher desired to be baptized, but could not be immersed during the day because of work. So about ten o’clock one night, with most of the town once again present, a missionary baptized him while people on the bank trained flashlights on the water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Realizing the importance of increasing the distribution of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines, a group of five brothers began to visit the bus and train stations of the capital, Guatemala City. On the long trips many of the passengers had nothing better to do than simply look out the windows. Shortly after starting these visits the brothers reached the impressive average of 80 magazines apiece per week. As regular visitors aboard the trains and buses, they aided many persons to redeem time that would otherwise be lost, and also scattered the Kingdom message to many remote corners of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The civil war in Guatemala caused much sorrow and turmoil. While things are fairly settled, there is still much unrest. In Zacapa, where the decisive battle was fought, the congregation increased from 13 publishers to 24 in only two months after the arrival of two new missionaries. The missionaries now report more interest than ever, so much that another pioneer had to be assigned to help care for them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark259"></a>HAITI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The New World society in Haiti enjoyed their finest assemblies this past year. It was possible for directors of the Society to visit Haiti on two different occasions and wonderful public meetings were arranged along with the conventions. The film “The New World Society in Action” was shown at one of these assemblies and Brother Henschel had a public meeting attendance of 1,263. In August, Brother Franz, the vice-president of the Society, made a visit to Haiti, and the attendance at his public meeting was 1,679. The people in Haiti are paying attention to the words of life, and the responsibility now rests upon the local brothers to follow through and bring these people to maturity. The branch servant here relates some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a southern congregation three brothers took on two weeks of pioneering. They mounted horses and went up to mountain towns on rocky paths that were steep and sometimes covered by streams. All the pioneers we have listed so far in the vacation pioneer work have met the quota; only one came as low as the required 75 hours. One brother enrolled the same day he was baptized and worked 93 hours during the two weeks alone. At the request of the Haiti </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font7"> editor, we submitted an article dealing with a local missionary who came back to Haiti after a serious cancer operation. We soon recognized that editors do not like preaching. So the branch blended a reasonable witness into the article in such a way that an editor would have difficulty “lifting” it out without ruining the story. Then, too, tact must be used in doing this in order to carry the reader to the end of the article even if he does not like religious material. The introduction and a photo of the missionary hit the front page in the “Personality of the Week” column. Some copies were sent to friends abroad, and, as a result, the same article appeared in at least two Canadian newspapers. An American woman in northern Haiti, though opposed, told us that she had read the article. So a newspaper testimony can get into many homes where personal entry is refused, and thereby made an introduction for the next publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Haiti </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font7"> also accepted a lengthy article about Brother Franz. It took up more than one page and showed a picture of the vice-president taken from a convention photo. In the title of the article the editor took the liberty of calling him “the big little missionary” and under the picture they called him “crowd-holder Franz.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A department of the government controls press and propaganda. This agency permits the radio stations to read anything that appears in the newspapers. Several times the radio stations took one of our brief articles right from the newspaper columns and read it over the air. This was especially so of our convention news. So “advertising always pays.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Showing the film “The New World Society in Action” certainly brings crowds. Three missionaries joined two special pioneers in the northern town of Gonaives, where we just started the witness work, to put on a public talk and show the film. Friday night they put on one roll of the film only, in order to draw a small crowd. Then they told the crowd that the entire film would be shown the following Sunday night. This little crowd became the publicity agent. They went to all their friends to tell them of the event that would take place on the square. By asking the proper authorities for permission we got a special group of guards to help control the crowds. The attendance exceeded 1,200, so a good witness was given by these few workers in using the film.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Though we do not have much of an increase in Haiti this year, we can say that the message has been brought to the attention of many more people by means of the new branches of service instituted by the Society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark260"></a>HAWAII</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The Hawaiian Islands in the broad Pacific have a population of almost 500,000 made up of many races—Hawaiian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Filipino—and they speak many dialects. The majority of them, however, can be reached with the English language. The New World society has gathered 826 publishers for the Kingdom, a new high peak for the Hawaiian Islands, and they are having a very enjoyable time preaching in all the islands. Great is their joy in ‘blessing Jehovah’s name every day.’ They have received of his undeserved kindness and they want to praise his name forever and ever. The branch servant gives a few very encouraging experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A study was started with a fireman, a strong Catholic. After just three studies he was so impressed with the truth he had learned that he started telling all of his fellow fireman at the fire station about these things. One of his fellow workmen was taking catechism lessons and began to question the priest about the things he heard from J---. Becoming very much annoyed, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">priest said: “Bring J---- down and let me straighten</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">him out.” J--- was contacted and in turn contacted</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">his study conductor, who readily agreed to go with him to the parish house. An enjoyable two and a half hours were spent defending the truth and upholding Jehovah’s name. The priest was unable to defend such doctrines as trinity, hell, purgatory, Peter as the first pope, and resorted many times to the familiar saying, “It’s a mystery.” J---- listened to the discussion with undi</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">vided interest, and is now completely convinced that he was in the wrong religion for thirty-three years. Later J---was quoted as saying: “If I had been that</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">priest and could not defend what I believed any better than that, I would have torn that black coat off and walked out of the office and never returned.” He also stated, “If that priest can’t stop Jehovah’s witnesses, then nobody can. They have the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> readers will remember the article in the March 22, 1954, issue on “Hawaii’s Mystery Isle.” Until just a few months ago, to our knowledge, the message had never penetrated this island. Since then a schoolteacher who had been studying with one of the witnesses and was going to go back to this island requested ten Hawaiian </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True’’</span><span class="font7"> books. We are looking forward to the growth of this seed there as well as on the other islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Readers of the 1954 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font7"> will recall the prison here in the islands that was allowing Jehovah’s witnesses in to study. These studies helped some of the inmates until their course of conduct improved beyond the fondest expectations of all concerned. The following experience was written by a person that attended the baptism of three of these brothers behind barbed wire and concrete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Come with me behind Oahu prison walls to view another chapter in Blackie’s life. At one time he was one of the worst inmates in this prison. For two years now, since he began to study the truth, he has been a model prisoner, and is now an “OP” (official prisoner), the highest position of trust an inmate can attain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On July 11, 1954, twelve of Jehovah’s witnesses were invited to attend an immersion. The huge iron-barred gate was opened for us. We were met by Blackie, who took us through another locked gate, across the court, through a barred gate, past the recreation area and behind the laundry. Under a canvas canopy to protect us from the sun and rain, we were seated in an area enclosed by potted palms and with a red carpet on the speaker’s stand as ten inmates joined us besides the three brothers to be immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the talk was given, one brother got into the tub and slid down as far as he could; then three brothers lowered him under the shallow water, followed by the second and the third. When they had changed clothes four of the brothers gave impromptu talks from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”.</span><span class="font7"> Following this, the inmates asked questions, which were discussed by the entire group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was a most unusual and thrilling occasion for all of us, as the prison officials had stopped our Bible studies three months previously due to pressure placed on them by the other churches who claimed we were getting special privileges. That was quite a blow to the brothers who are incarcerated, but Jehovah has well cared for them. The inmates are permitted to conduct their own studies and have their service meeting as well as the ministry school. These brothers realize that they must preach if they want to be a part of Jehovah’s New World society and live. Therefore they are regular publishers, distributing magazines and books among their fellow inmates and making back-calls, inviting them to their studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The workings of Jehovah are very strange to the eyes of the world, but not so to his witnesses. They understand that he provides many opportunities to enable his servants to gather his sheep, especially in these “last days,” just as Jesus said: “My sheep will hear my voice and they will follow me.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark261"></a>HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The 1954 service year was the greatest yet for the servants of Jehovah in Honduras. They made their 10 per cent increase over the average number of publishers and also a 20 per cent peak increase; so they rejoice at the wonderful prospects that are ahead in the 1955 service year. As other countries, they also have the problem of getting deep into their isolated territory, but they helped work out a solution to this problem by adding another circuit servant and cutting the circuit down into two smaller ones and then seeing to it that all the isolated persons were cared for. This is what the branch servant has to say about the matter, and he tells us some experiences as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During past years most of the activity has been carried on in seven or eight of the larger towns. But the question was, How could the people be reached in these dozens and dozens of towns where no witness has been given? Only one circuit servant was working in the country and he was kept busy with the fifteen congregations and visiting isolated publishers, all this mainly on the north coast of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just at the right time a Cuban brother, a graduate from Gilead, was assigned to Honduras. He is a young, healthy brother who had years of experience working with Latin people. He was immediately assigned as circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This circuit servant now visits towns where a witness has never been given. As a result he places a great deal of literature and gives many public talks each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To show the effect that this work is having, we have this report from a small town: “A nice group of twenty-five or thirty persons is meeting regularly here in this town. As a result of their study and desire to serve Jehovah and be a part of his clean organization, six couples decided that they had been living out of harmony with God’s righteous standards long enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“They immediately made plans to be legally married. They presented the necessary papers and all six couples were married the same day. They had been following the custom of the country and had never bothered to get married, but now, after coming to an understanding of Jehovah’s purposes, they realized they must measure up to his righteous requirements. A few days later these twelve persons symbolized their dedication to the Almighty God by being baptized.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The outstanding event of the year was the showing of the Society’s film “The New World Society in Action.” When plans were being made to show the picture to assembled congregations, we thought that if 1,500 persons saw the picture it would be wonderful, since our total attendance at Memorial was 1,325.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Congregations were notified of the dates of the showing of the film in their towns and small assemblies were arranged. After showing the film nine different times in five towns to Spanish as well as English audiences, what was the final number of attendance? A total number of 3,790 persons had seen the picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Would you walk twelve hours through jungle to see the film ‘The New World Society in Action’? If not, you should be ashamed, your appreciation is not as keen as it should be,” writes another congregation servant. He continues: “By chance a man of good will came to the missionary home and was invited to attend the showing of the film. He was delighted, but seemed somewhat reluctant about staying, as he lived far back in the mountains over rocky trails. Upon being pressed, he revealed that he had a son at home who was also a person of good will and who should see the film. It would not be right for him to see this film alone. So he had to get him at once. They arrived eight hours later, half an hour tardy. But their joy at seeing this fine film more than offset physical discomfort, for they had to return to their home in a pounding rain, but with hearts warmed by the unity of the theocratic organization. No doubt his small </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘pueblo’</span><span class="font7"> of 17 families still hears about it.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark262"></a>HONG KONG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">It is very interesting to see the excellent increase in the work in Hong Kong. More persons are associating with the New World society and they rejoice in the great opportunity they have of preaching the good news in this land near China. During the year there was very little rain in Hong Kong, which is unusual, and water rationing was instituted, so that there was running water for only three hours a day. Later in the year around Christmas Day a roaring fire broke out, which forced 60,000 people into the streets. Now there are squatters all over the city, which makes another problem. But Jehovah’s witnesses go from place to place and from house to house even from squatter to squatter and preach the good news of the Kingdom. The branch servant in Hong Kong sends in an interesting report, and a few of the experiences are related here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two of the big events of our local New World society took place in the main hotel in Kowloon. We were given the beautiful and spacious ballroom at a gift rate, and it was a strange experience for us to be able to spread out when we are so used to packing every corner at our usual public meetings. The Memorial drew an attendance of 252. As we looked on this bright crowd we were thrilled to remember that it was in this same hotel that Brothers Knorr and Henschel had had to celebrate the Memorial privately back in 1947, a year or so before the Society sent out missionaries to organize the work in this teeming gateway of the East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here, too, at the end of August you would have seen signboards showing that Jehovah’s witnesses were in session, enjoying their district assembly. For the first time there was a steady attendance at the normal sessions of about a hundred and it was pleasingly evident that our Chinese brothers are learning to appreciate assemblies and to catch the spirit that goes along with these theocratic gatherings. The program was balanced equally between English and Chinese; in fact, the Chinese brothers proved that now they are well qualified to discharge their assignments with zeal and enthusiasm. Dangerous typhoon winds kept us locked up in the hall for one day of the assembly, but this turned out a blessing, for it drew us all closer together and there seemed added enjoyment in listening to the talks while the wind whipped and surged outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On our return from the 1953 assembly at Yankee Stadium the time seemed due to divide into two units, so a new center was opened on the island of Hong Kong and an energetic unit is now growing up there. With a population of well over a million pressed into a mere ribbon of territory that skirts the sea front on one side and hangs perilously on the mountain slope on the other, there is a density of population as high as any in the world. It is a big job to cover this section even for the first time. As a break from this solid stair-climbing, the holidays have been utilized to witness in the villages around the back of the island, finishing up the day with a public talk. Such outings are relished by all the brothers and the program usually includes songs and a quiz from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are glad to report that sound progress is being made. Among the Chinese people a steady period of convincing is required before a true move is made. Some will study out of pure academic interest; others covet a knowledge of English, but as these are sorted out there is a residue of pure metal that can stand up to the heat of opposition. This past year has been characterized by severe testing of individuals: husbands have straitly forbidden their wives from associating with us, intimating that the husband should be regarded as the god; parents have tried to sever their children from the New World society. Some opposers are expert in wearing-down tactics and seem to have no occupation other than thinking up ways and means to perplex and upset. A few have wilted under the strain, but the others have conquered and come out resolute. A case in point is the brother who does our translating. Impervious to wiles and lures, he set his face toward the goal of becoming a good translator for the Society, and it was a happy day for us when this brother was invited to join us in the home, where he keeps up with the translation, teaches us the language and accomplishes pioneer hours in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brother who started pioneering this new service year came from a Buddhist home where it was forbidden to have a European come to teach. He has shown the quality of steadfastness, and early made up his mind that nothing would turn him aside from the truth and from service to Jehovah. This brother also conquered another bugbear, and that is the unearthly respect that the eastern youth attaches to school examinations, an unbalanced terror that calls for the dropping of everything when exams are in the offing. He set himself a schedule which included attending meetings, doing service, and sufficient regulated study to ensure passing the examinations.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark263"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">It is only by the undeserved kindness of Jehovah God that the work continues on in Hungary behind the Iron Curtain. Under Communist domination our brothers find it almost impossible to work, yet they do not stop preaching. A report came through at the close of the year saying that the work progresses and that the witnesses rejoice in their privileges of service. The people in Hungary are bitter because of the depressing conditions that prevail, but they find in Jehovah’s witnesses a people who will give them comfort and a hope with a solid foundation. Truly in that nation ‘every man’s hand is against his neighbor.’ If only the people could learn and practice God’s wonderful principle of love as outlined in the Bible, they would not be hating one another and the rest of the world. The Society is able to get literature through to the brothers there once in a while, and they put forth every effort to get it translated to bring the heart-cheering message to those who can be reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Their problems are great. Not all the information can be reported, but some of the experiences can be told and what you read here will show you the strength of your brothers in foreign countries. They are declaring their faith and hope among themselves and to the people. It is most cheering to know that in Hungary there are more publishers today than there were a year ago and these have almost doubled the time spent in preaching the good news of the Kingdom, all of this under the most difficult conditions. What zeal! Here is some information that has just come through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the yearly field service report shows, there were 530 brothers in prison at the end of the service year, sentenced to a total of 2,800 years, whereof 500 were sentenced by military courts for conscientious objection and 30 by other courts for preaching the gospel. Among these are also some circuit servants. One brother who had been serving in this capacity practically since the end of World War II got a ten-year sentence. We also know of some sisters who were sentenced to four years’ imprisonment during the year for preaching the Kingdom message. In the course of the past service year 261 brothers were released after having served a little more than two years each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following case shows how the police act in order to hurt the brothers and the work: A circuit servant was in touch with a policeman who he believed was interested. He was so interested that he put his uniform off and offered to help the brothers. They trusted him, but when the “collaboration” was at its best the policeman called his colleagues and the circuit servant was arrested and sentenced to seven years in prison. Because of the inside knowledge of the congregations thus gained by the police, many brothers were arrested along with the circuit servant, and the work was dealt a damaging blow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the other hand, in one of the working camps where the brothers are imprisoned, they asked permission to celebrate the Memorial in April this year. This was granted, but a policeman was to be present, ‘so that the other prisoners would not disturb.’ As the brothers work in two shifts, the Memorial was celebrated twice, one group assembling soon after 6 p.m. and the other after midnight, at 1 a.m. Two brothers gave the discourses. The first meeting was attended by 120 brothers and the second by 60. In another working camp 200 brothers attended the Memorial celebration.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark264"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in India have been praising Jehovah God every day, and our Father in heaven has blessed their efforts. The increase is excellent: we find a 25 per cent increase in the average number of regular publishers. It is also noted that the majority of the New World society in India have come from the various “Christian” communities with only a very small sprinkling of Hindus and none at all from the other religious groups. Our brothers in India understand that their service is not just a matter of going around and placing literature; rather they are being trained to present three- to eight-minute sermons, and this certainly transforms what the world used to call “book sellers” into real witnesses for Jehovah. This calls for each individual to put forth an energetic effort to improve his ministry. The report the branch servant sends in discusses the work in India, also a brief statement regarding the work in Iran.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An outstanding case is reported from southern India where a young brother, a farmer, began talking to his farm hands about Jehovah and the Kingdom. These men were mostly illiterate Hindus who knew no English. After some months of instruction these men began to go out to neighboring villages on week ends and tell others what they had learned. Unlike other preachers they refused alms and offers of material sustenance but demonstrated that they had something to give and were glad to give it freely. The circuit servant visited this farm and to his great surprise found 24 men asking for an immersion service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An interesting case also is reported from Delhi where an elderly brother, employed in a large government office, witnessed to his office staff while waiting for the bus each day. This led to some sarcastic comment from many, but it also led to some investigation by others. The result was that a Hindu began to study the Bible. He attended some meetings at the Kingdom Hall. Now he is enrolled in the ministry school and engages in field service regularly. Not only he but also his nephew and an elderly aunt (Hindus) now attend meetings regularly and are glad to be identified with the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some interesting experiences are reported illustrating the importance of sowing seeds of truth outside one’s regular field of service. Two brothers went to work on some cultivation in a new district. Of course, they preached. They wrote to the Society’s office about the new interest they were finding, and the circuit servant was sent to visit them. Public meetings were arranged and some training given in organized field service, with the result that a new congregation has been formed there. Another similar experience comes from a brother who had to return to his village home from a city office. He preached in his village and was not long in finding some hearing ears. Now he has returned to his city office work, but has left behind the nucleus of a congregation of which the circuit servant is now taking supervision and aiding to maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I must tell you how a dead baby opened up quite a large new field of interest. A special pioneer was sent to help a group of village people who were showing interest, but who were greatly handicapped by local prejudice. Very soon after the pioneer arrived at the village one of the newly interested families lost a ten-day-old baby. Now the frequent question, “Who will bury me when I die?” is one of the commonest excuses made by Roman Catholics and Protestants alike when confronted with the truth, and the death of this baby caused quite some speculation as to what Jehovah’s witnesses would do about it. The local church would not pennit burial of a Jehovah’s witness in its cemetery. The pioneer got busy. The local authorities granted a plot of ground for Jehovah’s witnesses to have their own cemetery, and the baby was buried in the proper way. The pioneer gave such a fine sermon at the burial that hundreds of people got to hear about it and much interest was aroused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I would like to mention the importance of the example set by missionary homes. In one town where a missionary home is located there is a family consisting of mother, daughter and some sons. Some of them enrolled as pioneers, including the mother. They took the missionary home way of life as their example, reading the daily text and comments along with a report from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font7"> and offering prayer at breakfast. Then the daily housework was scheduled, each having an assignment. The result was a better organized home and more time for field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">IRAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brother in Iran has done a little witnessing during the year and sent in reports on three occasions. The branch office has written him from time to time, and so has his brother who is here in Bombay. He appreciates the truth as far as he has knowledge of it and certainly wants to be associated with the New World society, but being alone he lacks the incentive of companionship, which would enable him to keep up a regular schedule of Kingdom activity.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark265"></a>INDONESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The country of Indonesia takes in a great amount of territory. This year the reports are from each of the five main islands where publishers are working. The island of Java is the world’s most densely populated place with fifty million people crowded on its shores. Many are seeking after righteousness, but there are not many laborers to take care of all the good interest. It is a joy to see the increase, however, on the island of Java, not only in the number of publishers, but also in the number of hours. The Society sees to it that all these publishers are called on during the year. The circuit servant has a big job because his circuit covers an area equal to that of the United States. In the branch servant’s report he relates a few experiences on the islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Sumatra and Timor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Brother Tan, on returning from Gilead, brought with him the film “The New World Society in Action,” and this film has done a remarkable work in arousing interest in the work and message of Jehovah’ witnesses. We immediately had the manuscript translated into Indonesian and Dutch and have shown the film with commentary in both those languages. So far 915 persons have viewed the film.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark266"></a><span class="font7">A Pentecostal minister who has a church in one of the villages has become interested in the truth. He told us that one of his flock had hanged himself because he had no hope in this life. This distressed the minister very much and he began wondering if he had the truth. After getting the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font7"> he knew he was not preaching the truth, and so he got in touch with the Surabaja congregation. After further discussion with the brothers he could see that the only hope was the Kingdom and that people do not hang themselves when they have that hope, so he invited the brothers to come to his village and preach in his church. Twenty publishers in four cars went to the village and made a rural campaign out of the trip. After a brother delivered a talk on the new-world blessings to the assembled audience, the minister took the publishers on to another bigger town where he had previously arranged for the Pentecostal congregation of that town to be called together to the church. He introduced the speaker and a good witness was given to the assembled group. Afterward questions were entertained and answered. The minister concluded the meeting by urging all to study and get more knowledge about the new world. Many of the congregation stayed for a couple of hours afterward, asking questions and showing good interest in the message. In the two places the brothers spoke to a total of 230 persons. These persons are anxious for another visit of the brothers. So the message is reaching out to Java’s millions and many are hearing with a good and right heart and are accepting the life-giving message.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark267"></a>KALIMANTAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Until the end of the service year there was one lone publisher working in the town of Balikpapan on this east coast of Kalimantan, but at the end of the service year he returned to Holland. He sent in reports during four months of the year, and through his work he was able to locate several persons of good will, who we hope will grow to maturity and carry on the work of the brother who has left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We also received a letter from an interested person in the interior of Kalimantan. He wrote to the office, saying, “I have read the little booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Escape to the Kingdom,</span><span class="font7"> written by J. F. Rutherford, and in that booklet it says that one can write for further literature. Because of that I am immediately sending you this letter to ask you to please send me more literature, as much as you like. I would like to witness, spreading the message or the books that teach the way of salvation for life for mankind.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark268"></a>SULAWESI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Age is no obstacle to preachers of the truth. Two brothers, both over seventy, were recently baptized and are regular publishers. One of these was formerly a Pentecostal preacher, now a preacher of the truth, and he prides himself on walking from his distant home to all meetings and field service activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The publishers make frequent trips into the rural districts and place much literature, but this whole area is still in need of pioneers and mature publishers to care for the interest. One month during the service year a number of brothers took vacations and enrolled as vacation pioneers. During that month they worked outlying villages together with the two regular pioneers and placed 611 bound books, 1,796 booklets and 996 magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Much of the territory is semirural. The people live in villages, departing for their gardens early in the morning and returning at sundown when the chores must be done and the evening meal prepared. Consequently Sunday is the one day when most of these people can be contacted, but Sunday is also the day when everyone goes to church at least once and the afternoon is considered the one time during the week for visiting, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">kumpulans</span><span class="font7"> (social-religious gatherings) are also the custom every Sunday. This is one of the big problems that the publishers have to contend with, the difficulty of being able to meet the people at a convenient time. The people of the Minahasa are hospitable and friendly, but also set in their religious ways and customs.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark269"></a>SUMATRA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In Palembang, as the result of fearless testimony and discussions by her husband with some of the clergy, a woman and another person of good will took their stand for the truth. The woman was attending Bible study classes conducted by the Protestant clergyman, who had several debates with her husband. The clergyman severely scolded those of his flock who were attracted to the weekly Bible study groups of Jehovah’s witnesses, and scolded the woman for continuing to listen to her husband. Thinking to frighten her, he demanded angrily before his study group, “You will have to decide whether you are going to remain with my study group or attend the meetings of these people who are undoing all my hard work.” Whereupon she boldly replied: “I am making my decision now. I am not coming back here any more. From now on I am associating only with Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Isolated publishers are now reporting from the towns of Medan in North Sumatra and Padang in Central Sumatra and there are subscribers and interested persons in other towns as well. The New World society is getting established in Sumatra.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark270"></a>TIMOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The circuit servant described his first visit to Timor as follows: “The brother had obtained a remarkable knowledge of the truth by personal study, as he was the only witness on this island. I journeyed by bus as far as the bus went and then continued my journey to his primitive village by pony. He was anxious to be baptized, and the baptism discourse was delivered in a bamboo building that also served as a school. The talk was translated into the local Timorese dialect before an audience of scores of children. Amid a procession of grown-ups and children we proceeded to a turbulent little stream where the brother was baptized in the presence of awe-struck onlookers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The circuit servant continues: “The Timorese are a friendly and teachable people who readily listen and take literature when they can read. That many hunger and thirst after righteousness is evidenced in such typical remarks: We are glad you have come; we need capable spiritual leaders to look after our spiritual welfare.’ One man requested, ‘You must come to the neighboring island of Roti. The spiritual neglect of the people is terrible.’ This is a condition that exists throughout Indonesia in the ‘Christian’ sections. With the change-over of sovereignty, the state-supported Protestant clergy, finding themselves without financial support, left the country. The Roman Catholic Church continues to obtain converts through their school system. But the people’s spiritual welfare is sadly neglected. One cannot help feeling as Jesus did when he felt compassion for the multitude, for they were as sheep without a shepherd.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark271"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">A very interesting work is going on in Italy. In that country where the Catholic Church has had control for so many hundreds of years many are now listening to the truth and turning to the Bible, but not without opposition. We recall the words of Paul: “For a large door that leads to activity has been opened to me, but there are many opposers.” (1 Cor. 16:9, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> Certainly Jehovah God has opened the door in Italy and the witnesses have gone forward there. There are missionaries, special pioneers, general pioneers, congregation publishers and circuit servants. All these persons are co-operating together to make a public declaration of their hope in the congregation and to the peoples of the world. The branch servant’s report on Italy and Libya is interesting and it shows what some of the problems are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Abruzzo, an agricultural region of Italy, there is a proverb about its people that has proved true as regards their reaction to the good news. It says, “Abruzzo strong and kind.” More people have accepted the truth here than in any other region of Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The greatest problem is caused by the limited amount of territory available to the high number of publishers found in the area. Many congregations are only three or four miles apart, so that the publishers of one congregation must often pass over another congregation’s territory in order to have territory to work. Many congregations are growing at such a rate that they have had to extend their activities to the distant virgin region called Marche.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Due to poverty, the problem of transportation had to be solved by some congregations’ hiring buses and forming groups to go up the Adriatic Coast into new territory. The time traveling to the territory passes swiftly as the congregation servant calls on different publishers to practice their oral sermons of three to eight minutes, thus giving all the opportunity of going directly from demonstrations to practical application in the field as soon as the bus reaches the territory to be worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then, like a swarm of locusts, these bus loads of Kingdom preachers descend upon the towns and villages of Marche, one group at a time being left off to cover each village or town along the way. The happy return trip is then occupied recounting interesting experiences to one another and joining together in singing songs of praise to Jehovah. The extension of the good news of this new territory by this army of locusts did not go unnoticed, for one priest warned his parishioners: “Look out! Jehovah’s witnesses have filled Abruzzo with their doctrine and now they have invaded Marche also!”—Joel 2:2-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the other hand, scattered throughout Italy is a large and ever-increasing number of isolated persons practically begging to be visited and other millions who have never heard anything about the truth. Over a thousand names of isolated interested persons to be visited are in the hands of the circuit servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Illustrating the prospects is a recent report by a circuit servant. He told of visiting an isolated sister who walks three hours through the mountains every Saturday to hold a book study with a group of interested persons. She stays over Sunday and works in the area all day and then returns home on Monday to care for her household duties. When the circuit servant called on her and gathered together her interest, about thirty persons were present for the talk given. Some have now expressed the desire to be baptized, and a congregation should soon spring up in this isolated area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A 75-year-old man who lives in an isolated area heard of the truth and sent word to a pioneer to visit him. Arriving there for the discussion, he found thirty persons waiting who, after hearing the talk, took literature. Some returned the following morning to ask more questions and to have their thirst for the truth satisfied. The 75-year-old man happily exclaimed: “I’ve had a Bible for the last forty years, but in all those years I have never learned what I’ve been able to learn in just two hours.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The service year closed with a wonderful assembly in Naples, having 1,260 in attendance. All enthusiastically expressed their determination to make the service year of 1955 outstanding with more new servants of Jehovah, so that a large number will be able to attend the 1955 assembly in Rome.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark272"></a>LIBYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In October the Libyan police made a raid on the meeting place of Jehovah’s witnesses in Tripoli and seized all the literature in sight as well as personal Bibles. But this action against the brothers did not cripple the work nor cause them to shrink back to destruction. It only made them all the more determined to lay hold of increased privileges of service offered by the pioneer work. Four more publishers enrolled in the ranks of the full-time ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact that practically all the congregation’s Bibles and Bible literature were confiscated by the authorities did not put a stop to the preaching of the good news. In fact, not only have the publishers pushed ahead in the witness work, using whatever literature and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font7"> could be sent into the country, but they have also increased in all features of the service, extending the truth to other parts of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The opposition of the clergy to the preaching of the good news is certainly nothing new. In Tripoli the Jewish and Catholic clergy have taken the same position and are urging their followers not to read literature distributed by Jehovah’s witnesses. The Catholic priests have even started going from house to house, not to preach the good news, but to try to counteract the effects of the house-to-house activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. One priest excitedly shouted from the pulpit to his paid pew-sitters: &quot;The persons that study the Bible in this city are about 700. Be careful not to fall into this trap also.” The zeal manifested by Jehovah’s servants in Tripoli is causing the clergy to see much more than double.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Spurred on to greater zeal by attending the Italian district assembly in Naples, the Libyan brothers are determined to continue expanding the preaching of the good news so that the priest’s calculation of 700 persons studying the Bible in Tripoli may not remain merely a vision but become a reality.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark273"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Most Jamaicans have respect for the Word of God, and this makes the witness work very pleasurable in this island in the Caribbean. It appears that some of the politicians in this country have respect for Jehovah’s witnesses, for at one time they were to use the courthouse for an assembly and the local politician was permitted to use the steps of the courthouse as a platform for another public meeting to be held at the same time. But, hearing that Jehovah’s witnesses were to use the inside, he said: “First things must be first; we will cancel our public meeting.” Then he proceeded to tell his companion the value of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> magazines. Also when discrimination had risen to the point that entry of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> magazines was forbidden, the elected ministers of the government took action and stopped such clergy-inspired activity. Now our publications again have free access to the land. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences, a few of which are set forth here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Expansion comes from carefully putting into practice the suggestions received from Jehovah’s organization, as is shown by the following: By increasing the number of congregation book studies from two to six and using these as service centers, as the Society has suggested, one of the Kingston units experienced an almost immediate increase in publishers from 70 to 90. The congregation at Montego Bay jumped from an average of 60 to 86 publishers simply by putting the book study arrangement into practice, having approximately 15 assigned to each area. New ones are appearing at these centers not only for study but also for service. In Kingston a Catholic lady was invited to attend one of these studies. She came and asked several questions at the first meeting. The following week she was back and answered two questions, and within two weeks she was out with one of the missionaries in house-to-house work, calling on her astonished former church associates! Since then she has been a regular publisher—regular every week!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Engaging regularly in Jehovah’s service brings not only results but also the happiness of finding and feeding these ones who are sighing and crying, helping them become strong so they too can engage in this joyous shepherding work. A congregation publisher who is a schoolteacher desires to be a pioneer, but since she has family obligations she spends all her available time in field service as a congregation publisher. She managed to get a job in a small town where only a small amount of preaching had been done. The local clergyman endeavored to keep her from getting a permanent appointment, but the school headmaster refused to cooperate with such Pharisaical action. The clergyman eventually engineered the dismissal of the headmaster of the school but was unable to have the publisher dismissed. There were “sheep” in this town and the clergyman did not wish to have them found and fed; he preferred that they should come to him for his religious fodder. Soon a Bible study was started with a shopkeeper, using </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font7"> For the third study one Wednesday evening the shopkeeper invited others —twenty-five in all—so he closed the shop to avoid any distraction. Since then this study has been held regularly. Attenders have already begun to preach and bring in still others to hear the message of truth. One of those attending recognized the ring of pure Bible truth and asked if he could change his religion just once more and be one of Jehovah’s witnesses, as he had been previously mixed up with “Pocomania” (local revivalist group) and the Salvation Army. How happy he was when it was explained to him just what was required to be a real follower of Jesus Christ! The latest reports from this town show an increase in Kingdom publishers and also that the persecuting religious clergyman was fired from his post of duty for practicing “Obeah” (local term for black magic).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One pioneer sister worked a district known as “Iniquity Ridge.” She writes, “The name speaks for itself.” There she started a study with a young woman. The husband was away most of the time gambling; however, he sat in on the study when the subject of “Marriage” was being discussed. (Theirs was a common-law arrangement. ) Following the study the woman said, “This is different, for I want to serve God. We must either separate or get married! for I cannot go on living so.” Soon the man stopped gambling and attended every study. As they were poor, only one could attend the circuit assembly, and so the husband went. That did it! At the assembly he made arrangements with the Society’s marriage officer to legalize their marriage. At the district assembly, which followed shortly after, their marriage was legalized and both were baptized! The Bible study attendance on the Ridge has jumped from two to ten as a result. The Society’s marriage officer is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> busy man, having solemnized scores of marriages during the past service year, some for young couples, others for couples whose grandchildren are there to witness the event. Jehovah’s organization must remain clean and free from reproach, and so many have been aided to straighten out their affairs and become legally married. Many more could be publishers if they were legally married. So, to help these and others who wish to get married, six additional marriage officers have been applied for.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark274"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in the country of Japan have had one of their most outstanding years for the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom. Not only have they placed more books and booklets than in the previous year, but, when you look at the number of individual magazines distributed, to compare with the number of publishers, you find that each publisher placed a little better than 250 magazines during the year. That means more than 20 a month. No wonder </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> has such a wide circulation in that country! It is doing a wonderful work of paving the way for the witnesses when they call at the homes of the people. Japan is a country filled with shrines and images, and although the people worship at these places, they do not know why. Many of those who are priests in Buddhist temples are now listening to the truth, and the branch servant has some very interesting experiences to relate in this regard. The branch office in Tokyo looks after the work in Okinawa and Taiwan and a report is made on these countries, too, which all of you will enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why, even the priests are studying the Bible! A young Buddhist priest took a magazine in the street. A few days later he recognized the publisher in a bus and came to him for the next issue. A Japanese pioneer sister called at a Buddhist temple and was surprised when the priest brought out a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font7"> He had bought it in a secondhand bookstore, and had read it from cover to cover. He immediately subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and contributed also for every back issue he could lay hands on. One day two missionaries witnessed at the priests’ houses at a temple of the Buddhist “Nichiren” sect. One high-ranking priest received the witness very kindly, invited the missionary inside and readily took </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”. </span><span class="font7">At further back-calls he admitted dissatisfaction with his religion, though he has been a priest for 39 years. Taking an image of Nichiren from the high ornate altar in his house, he unceremoniously turned it upside down and said, “This is not God!” It was pointed out to him from Acts 17 that the Athenians of Paul’s day also worshiped an unknown god, but the God that made the world does not dwell in handmade temples. To help him learn of the true God a weekly study was arranged, and he subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> He attended the district assembly and thoroughly enjoyed the talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Buddhist population is also learning the truth. A Buddhist housewife commencing to study the Bible at first apologized for her complete ignorance of Christianity. However, she proceeded avidly to devour all of the Society’s literature, and both she and her neighbor soon became Jehovah’s witnesses. When a man called selling paper decorations for a religious festival, she exclaimed, “Oh no! My religion is different!” His response, “But it is a custom that everyone follows,” was to no avail. Refusal to follow pagan customs has been a demonstration of the real faith of the many new Kingdom publishers in Japan. They thank Jehovah for the strength of purpose he provides with the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A new congregation, under the guidance of four missionaries, grew from 11 to 39 publishers in just one year. Then came August, but by midmonth, when the missionaries went on vacation, only 32 publishers had been in the field. So the congregation publishers got busy and prepared a surprise packet for the missionaries when they returned: A new peak of 42 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here is an example of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower’s</span><span class="font7"> doing its work: Two magazines were placed with the man of the house, but </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> back-call revealed that it was the housewife who was interested. She had recognized again the message that she had read more than twenty years previously in the Japanese </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font7"> book. At that time she could not find the organization, but now she is rejoicing to associate regularly. Shortly after resuming her studies she read the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> article “How True Christians Serve God.” Without consulting anyone she worked her own neighborhood from house to house, and then went down to the railway station for an hour of street witnessing. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> had motivated this new Kingdom publisher into action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is how another new publisher obtained her first study: On her way to the magazine work she stopped to have her shoes shined. She tried to witness to the shoeshine boy, but found he was deaf and dumb. She carried through </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> conversation with him by writing and invited him to the showing of “The New World Society in Action.” He came with </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> friend, was greatly impressed and a study was arranged at the deaf-and-dumb hostel where he lives. This is a silent study, with the seven or eight participants answering up by writing down their comments, and the publisher making her explanations in writing. The new publisher has shown herself “apt to teach” in this, her very first study, and she was baptized recently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No report on Japan could be complete without mention of the rapidly expanding pioneer service. A young lady learned the truth in Tokyo and later returned to her home in the southernmost tip of Japan, where she arranged her affairs to pioneer. There she is aiding a new and thriving congregation of four publishers, who average more than 20 hours each month in field service. Another young pioneer was returning from an assembly in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> crowded train. She placed literature and then proceeded to conduct a Bible study with the person sitting opposite. When this person left the train and another took the seat she placed more literature and commenced another study, and so on to the end of the five-hour journey. We rejoice to have back our first two Japanese graduates from Gilead, and these are already having fine results in the service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark275"></a>OKINAWA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Great Interest in the Bible is being manifested by the humble island folk. When a Gilead missionary visited from Japan, the nine local publishers gathered in 165 to the public meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A sister from Okinawa visited Japan for the October assembly. Later she entered the pioneer service and has found Okinawa such a wonderful pioneer Held that she simply cannot stop working. Even during the tropical summer she worked 172 hours in one month, making 246 return visits and conducting 15 home Bible studies each week, as well as placing more literature than any of the pioneers or missionaries in Japan. This widowed sister takes good care, too, of the training of her nine-year-old son, who also publishes zealously and takes part in the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For several months Jehovah’s witnesses were given free time on “The Voice of the Ryukyus,” being granted one broadcast a month. Other religions took the broadcasts other weeks, but in December these apparently got so busy preparing for the pagan “Christmas” that they omitted to prepare broadcasts. The manager asked Jehovah’s witnesses to step in and do the entire month’s religious broadcasting. Multitudes heard and enjoyed these Japanese-language broadcasts.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark276"></a>TAIWAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In Formosa (Taiwan) the fight for freedom goes on! The government says to Jehovah’s witnesses, “You must not preach until you register as a religious organization.” In recent years Jehovah’s witnesses have made seven applications for registration, and have been refused seven times. Now the eighth application is dragging slowly through the departments of government. It all makes Nationalist China’s loud professions of democracy and religious freedom sound very hollow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, Jehovah’s witnesses of Formosa follow the unflinching example of Christ Jesus and the apostles with regard to worship, in ‘obeying God rather than men.’ They are natural talkers, and when they get the truth they become very zealous talkers. They are not always able to get reports through to the free world, but we know that they had an average of 1,432 publishers for the first ten months of the service year, to compare with 934 last year, and a peak of 1,771, which is an increase of 90 per cent over last year’s average.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They are not allowed to meet for the celebration of the Lord’s evening meal, but the report shows that 2,226 recognized this event on April 17 by their attendance in obedience to Jesus’ command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The faithful witnesses in Formosa talk early and late, in season and out of season. Did you ever start preaching at 2 a.m.? Jehovah’s witnesses of Formosa often do to neighbor housewives who rise about that time to prepare food for the workers to take to the fields. And how these brothers love to obey Jehovah’s command to “assemble yourselves,” as conditions permit! One isolated congregation is even able to meet in a mud-and-bamboo Kingdom Hall. When a visitor asked the congregation servant what nights they held Bible studies there, he looked surprised and said, “Why, every night, of course!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why should a government that claims to be part of the free world, and whose leaders profess Christianity, persecute the humble Christian witnesses of Jehovah? That persecution even stooped to a new low during the past year in confiscating copies of the Bible itself! The government says the people may not have the Bible in Japanese, but must read it in Chinese or English, which, in effect, denies the Bible to the common people of Formosa, the class that ‘hears Jesus gladly.’ Formosa’s rulers are treading on dangerous ground; to prohibit the free circulation of the Bible is to fight against God. But all their trampling on the Bible and on Jehovah’s witnesses has not impeded and cannot impede the increase of that Government of which there will be no end.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark277"></a>KOREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The work is going ahead in Korea by leaps and bounds. In 1953 there were 312 publishers; in 1954 they averaged 688 and jumped up to a peak of 1,065. That shows how fast they are advancing and gathering the other sheep. Seven new congregations were organized, making fourteen in all. Of course, all this is very disturbing to the officials and especially to the religionists who try to influence the officials to get them to stop our work. The Society in Seoul has been investigated a number of times to see what we teach and what we are doing and what our purposes are, but the principal investigator of the Political Culture Bureau finds that our religion is sound, reasonable and, as he puts it, the doctrines of Jehovah’s witnesses are the most reasonable he has heard in eighteen years of investigations. There is certainly no reason, then, to put any restrictions on the work, even though the clergy are objecting terribly because a number of Catholics and Protestants have left their organizations. They want to live in the new world. The branch was organized in Korea this past year and now the branch servant sends in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> fine report. You will enjoy the experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">New opportunities for service have opened up to some of the Korean publishers this year. Our first Korean Gilead graduate returned and is now doing missionary service in Seoul. The rapid growth of the work also necessitated the use of a Korean brother as a part-time circuit servant. One sister was appointed as a special pioneer in Pusan to assist the congregation of comparatively new ones there. All these events are evidence of the gradual march toward maturity in knowledge and service on the part of the Korean publishers. Much still needs to be done in this respect, however. The training program lacks complete effectiveness, due to the absence of enough mature brothers to spend sufficient time in training the newer brothers. Time and diligence on the part of those given these responsibilities will strengthen the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fully two thirds of our publishers were immersed and became active in preaching during this service year. These newly dedicated ones represent many interesting experiences on the part of the publishers who took the truth to them. At the beginning of the service year the wife of the then prime minister was baptized and has since shown a zeal for Jehovah and for his work that is amazing to behold. For one who had perhaps the second-highest social standing in the country amonp; the women to show the degree of humility and devotion she has shown in becoming a mature publisher meant many changes in her life. The greater portion of her time is now spent in studying God’s Word and teaching it to others. She being particularly active in worldly social affairs before coming into the truth, her friends accuse her of taking her religion too seriously. She Is fully aware that life comes through service to the new-world King, Christ Jesus, and not from this old world. Her eldest daughter has taken her stand along with her mother. The daughter anxiously waited out her six months as a congregation publisher so she could become a vacation pioneer in August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Beginning with the January issue of the Korean </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> the magazine is printed instead of being mimeographed. Now the brothers rejoice in being able to place the magazine in door-to-door work in much greater quantities. It has put real meaning into Magazine Day in Korea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Outstanding during the service year was the district assembly held in Seoul in August. Because it was to be the first assembly of any kind for Jehovah’s witnesses in Korea, it was looked forward to with keen anticipation. There were times when it appeared as though the convention could not be held, but finally the necessary documents were obtained. Knowing that arranging travel to Seoul would be a major problem for many attending from the other cities and towns, we did not know how many to expect. But where there is deep determination Jehovah’s spirit shows the way, so all were happily surprised to find 1,043 on hand the first day of the assembly, and 1,245 attended the public lecture. Perhaps the greatest surprise was to see one third of the audience present on Saturday morning stand as candidates for immersion as 284 were baptized that day. The spirit of co-operation and unselfish service was present in the volunteer work even though it was the first experience. The cafeteria was well supported, with more than 5,000 meals being served. Truly it was an unforgettable experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Individual brothers and groups in America continued to send relief clothing to the brothers in Korea during the year and this helped many very much. The Korean brothers wish to express their gratefulness for this help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As we look forward to the next service year we see no reason why the present rate of increase of those fleeing into the mountains of Jehovah’s organization will not continue. The total number of 927 were baptized during the year, and all of these must become regular praisers. If opposition is increasing, the number of people of good will is also. Looking to God and his reigning Son for guidance and sustenance, we go into the 1955 service year with full confidence.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark278"></a>LEBANON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The Watch Tower Society has a branch office in Lebanon that looks after the work in Lebanon, Aden, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Syria. In many of these countries there is considerable opposition against the preachers of the good news of the Kingdom. In some instances this comes from the political leaders, other times from the rulers who want no religion but their own in the country. Like the apostle Paul, the witnesses report: “We are pressed in every way, but not cramped beyond movement.” (2 Cor. 4:8, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font8"> There are many of Jehovah’s witnesses all over the world and when they move from one place to another for business or other reasons they take the Kingdom message with them. The branch servant in making his report shows how this spread of the truth through congregation publishers has caused work to be started and developed in some of the countries under his jurisdiction. Excerpts from his report on these countries are set out here for your enjoyment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">More than thirty years ago a massacre of Armenians took place in Turkey. Thousands escaped and took refuge in Lebanon. It is estimated that there are 70,000 Armenians in the city of Beirut alone. By far the majority have never taken the time to learn Arabic but speak only Armenian and Turkish. How would the Kingdom message reach them? Jehovah made provision for these people, too, by assigning two missionaries to learn the Armenian language, work among them from door to door and live right in their midst. Now there are 15 to 20 meeting regularly for Bible study, and some are beginning to take their stand for Jehovah and his kingdom. Many are becoming acquainted with the name Jehovah for the first time, even though it occurs many times in the Armenian Bible. One man, learning there were Bible studies held in the Armenian language, sought out the meeting center. After attending a few times he found that his Bible questions were being answered, and so decided to have a study of his own in the privacy of his home. He has constantly invited his relatives and friends to attend and now he participates regularly in the ministry and is one of the first Armenian publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From June to the end of October the preaching must be done in the mountains. The greater portion of the Lebanese population from the coastal cities makes a general exodus to the mountain villages and resorts to escape the sweltering heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The publishers find it very interesting indeed to be working among all the various types of people. Publishers have met and witnessed to Arab princes (emirs), Moslem sheiks, diplomats, ministers with cabinet rank, and men of many professions. Some wealthy Arabs have listened to the Kingdom message and have contributed generously for the publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One manager of a large hotel after obtaining a subscription for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> himself, then invited the publishers to call on every room in the hotel and present the message to them. This resulted in the placement of much literature and the obtaining of more subscriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Lebanon we have an open door through which the Kingdom proclamation resounds and echos forth throughout all the Arab East. Whereas it is next to impossible to reach the Moslems from door to door in such places as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Yemen, yet when these oil-rich Arabs and other Moslem dignitaries of high station come to Lebanon for the summer, they come within the hearing of the Kingdom message. As long as Jehovah keeps the door open, the warning and witness will continue to be delivered to all these Moslems as an expression of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness and mercy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While making a back-call on an employee in a metal industry plant, two publishers were ushered into the office of the owner. They explained the purpose of their call and offered him the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”.</span><span class="font7"> Seeing an Armenian booklet in the publisher’s hand he asked if he could have some to distribute to his Armenian employees. He was told he could have as many as he wanted, so he asked for twenty of them. Besides that, he said he was Greek by origin; so he wanted four copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> in the Greek language. Then the publishers showed him the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine and briefly explained its contents and purpose. Being pleased with what he saw, he said he would subscribe for that for one year also. Then he inquired if the brothers had anything else with them in English. He was shown the books </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”, “New Heavens and a New Earth”,</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font7"> After looking them over carefully he said, “I’ll take these also. You see I have many friends and some in particular that I want to read these books. I am very much interested in the Bible, and my father was exiled from Greece many years ago because he was associated with a Bible society and distributed Bibles there.” He was told that that is just the type of reception one gets from this world, as the Bible predicted, if we endeavor to spread the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A beauty operator who calls at the homes of the people to fix hair and give manicures made several such visits to the home of one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The sister witnessed to her, of course, and succeeded in placing a book with her. A day or two later the girl was back to tell the sister that she had shown the book to her priest and had found out all about Jehovah’s witnesses : that they did not believe in Christ or the saints, not even the virgin Mary, and that furthermore she would not work for people of such sacrilegious beliefs. She left without giving the sister a chance to explain that these things were not true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One day, more than a year later, she came back and said she would like to study with Jehovah’s witnesses. Why? Well, she had come to see the hypocrisy of the priests who had told her about Jehovah’s witnesses. A bishop had gotten so angry with a small boy who had asked him a simple question that he had given him a thrashing, and then got into a fight with the boy’s father and half the congregation as well. All this was accompanied by such blasphemous talk and conduct that she decided the priests were certainly not fit ones to be teaching the people about Christianity. Since they spoke against Jehovah’s witnesses, then Jehovah’s witnesses must have the truth. Thereafter when she called on the people she not only fixed their hair and fingernails, but told them of a coming new world as well.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark279"></a>ADEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">For the first time regular studies were established in Aden, and a goodly number of booklets and magazines were placed. The brother and good-will persons are workers for one of the oil companies. In his letters he had this to say regarding the Kingdom service: “Due to the scattered nature of our camps and the working hours on this construction project it will not always be possible for us to meet on any given days of the week, but we have arranged to meet twice weekly as convenient to us. We are all very enthusiastic, and with Jehovah’s blessing we believe we shall start something worthwhile in this barren place. There are seven Lebanese attending the study. I have two other Indian boys who join in these studies; so you see we seem to have started off well. I believe these Indian lads will soon leave their old religious ideas and will want to</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">become witnesses. We are now studying </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brother was able to carry the good news to some of the small towns near the camp where he was working, and thus acquaint outsiders with the Kingdom message. There are a few magazine subscribers now. and thus some seed has been planted.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark280"></a>IRAQ</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Two missionaries continued to do good work during the year, placing much literature and finding people who are interested in the Kingdom message. Formerly it was rare for the missionaries to meet anyone who had heard of Jehovah’s witnesses, but now, notwithstanding the territory’s being vast and virgin, they are becoming known and people are learning of the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the hottest months they start their witnessing at 8 a.m. and end at noon, for about that time the heat of the sun becomes unbearable. During the afternoon the people rest and do not wish to be disturbed, so witnessing is resumed again after 6 p.m. The missionaries in Baghdad find the work very interesting, because they are well received at almost every house, whether Arab, Armenian, Assyrian or Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the first persons of good will here was a young man from Palestine who came to Baghdad looking for work and brought with him our address from the brothers in Jerusalem. He joined in our regular study for the public as well as a personal book study for himself. In a few short weeks he wanted to help us in our work and become a regular witness for Jehovah. He is growing in maturity each week and is a great help to us because of his knowledge of many different languages. He speaks Arabic, French, Italian and English and really enjoys the door-to-door work. At first he was rather shy, but after a few doors he was talking fluently and explaining the Kingdom message, just as all witnesses do. At the first of the summer he was transferred to the north of Iraq on another job, but he writes that he is witnessing there and he is being supplied with literature to assist him.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark281"></a>JORDAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Enemy opposition to the good work of Jehovah’s witnesses in the Jordan did not subside but continued and gradually increased throughout the country during the year. The enemy was not satisfied even though they succeeded in having all the missionaries expelled from the country. Without doubt they are intent on stopping the work completely, and this they have shown by intensifying their opposition against the organization and the brothers. All year long the organization was assaulted and steady encroachments were made on the brothers to stop them from preaching. But the brothers have not been intimidated, even though it has become increasingly difficult to carry the Kingdom message to the people, and during the year more sheep were found and brought into the one flock under the one Shepherd. The brothers are now using mainly their Bibles in the witness work, and are developing sermons with appropriate texts to read from the Scriptures. The instruction of the Society to the publishers all over the world to use their Bibles more and more in their witnessing is very timely for the brothers in Jordan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the most active brothers, a special pioneer, received anonymous threatening letters warning him to desist from his activity or else suffer the awful consequences. Another brother who has used his home for years as a meeting place for Jehovah’s witnesses, and is well known in that area as an active minister, was called into the district governor's office in Bethlehem and was told by the governor himself to stop his preaching. In Jericho the police searched the home of the brother where the meetings are held and confiscated all his literature, even to the extent of taking his songbooks. He was called up to the district governor’s office in Jerusalem and told in no uncertain terms, &quot;Stop your preaching. Do not distribute literature or invite people into your home.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">KUWAIT</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark282"></a><span class="font7">Kuwait is a small sheikdom; but, due to the oil companies, its population is increasing rapidly. Many persons from other Arab countries are going to Kuwait for employment and among them have been some of our brothers. For that reason we were able to report one publisher who only recently arrived in the country. He has begun to witness during his hours off from work and we are looking forward to the results he will obtain during the new service year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark283"></a>SAUDI ARABIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Kingdom message is continuing to be preached to the inhabitants of this solid Moslem country. One of the publishers of Italian descent who was working for an oil company did fine work during the year in preaching to his fellow workers. He placed many books</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">and booklets, but reported: “These Orthodox are very deaf people and I learned that it is easier to preach to Moslems about the Kingdom.” This country has very strict rules regarding religion and is strictly a Moslem theocracy. This makes it difficult for this brother to preach. Yet, even though isolated and in contact with the organization only by correspondence, he continued to prove his integrity and never once missed an opportunity to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SYRIA</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark284"></a><span class="font7">Syria is primarily a Moslem country. Though Syria is outside the realm of Christendom the witness must still be delivered there. Even though very few Moslems have taken a stand for the Kingdom, the opportunity is always before them to do so. The field is large and needs to be worked. No doubt there are still many sheep in the so-called “Christian” denominations who recognize their bondage to Babylon and want to be freed. They are in urgent need of spiritual help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An experience was received from the city of Aleppo where two special pioneers are working. A little over two years ago the good news of the Kingdom was hardly heard in that city, but now there is a nucleus of about twelve persons who are praising the name of Jehovah. A brother calling at the homes from door to door placed </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> with a family. When making the back-call, he was told by the mother that the son hid the book. Why? Because it rejected the trinity doctrine as false and anyone of the family reading it would commit a grave sin. Learning the son would be at home the following evening, the publisher returned. Immediately he engaged the witness in discussion on the trinity. It was not long till the witness found out that the son did not actually believe that Jesus and God were one in substance and power. And to the surprise of the son, it did not take him long to find out what the trinitarians really taught about their doctrine. That same evening he was convinced the doctrine had its roots in paganism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An appointment was made to have a regular study with him, and in a few weeks he was telling others the things he was learning. The bishop, upon learning the son was studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses, visited the home and induced the family to turn against the young man. The father then told his son that if he wanted to continue his study of the Bible, he could do so, but it would have to be in private and by himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He did not want Jehovah’s witnesses to call any more. The son then told his father that the people who were coming to study the Bible with him were his brothers and if they could not come to the house any more, then he would have to move out of the house himself. Loving his son and realizing the seriousness of the situation, the father began conversing with his boy. The boy witnessed to his father, and soon the father was seen reading and studying </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True&quot;</span><span class="font7"> himself. Now there is a regular Bible study going with all the family participating; in fact, the home is a regular meeting place for all the brothers in Aleppo, for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study is held there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A woman of Danish extraction married to a Syrian Moslem went to Denmark to visit her relatives, where she learned that her sister had become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. While staying with her, she became very much interested in the truth, attended the weekly study in the home and went to the congregation meetings. She returned to Syria with a knowledge of the truth and a collection of books and booklets in the Danish language. In the city of A---- she tried to locate the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">brothers but was unsuccessful. Finally her sister in Denmark forwarded her name and address to the Society, and the brothers found her, for Jehovah knows those who belong to him. When the brothers called she was thrilled to receive them, and immediately began relating all the things she learned in Denmark and how members of her family were in the truth there. She requested to be put on the subscription list for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines in the French language and wanted more literature to distribute to her friends and neighbors. Besides that, she gave the brothers names and addresses of people she knew for them to call on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Though the brothers have encountered many obstacles, primarily not having the freedom to proclaim the good news publicly, and in a number of places not even being able to meet together for Bible study, yet the truth is still being made known, and Jehovah’s name is being declared. We pray for Jehovah to strengthen the brothers further by pouring out on them more of his holy spirit, that they may speak boldly and fearlessly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark285"></a>LEEWARD ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">While the old world with its wicked system of things increases in woes and sorrows, those who have fled that organization and have come into the New World society have increased in joy and gladness. In the Leeward Islands there are nine islands under the jurisdiction of the branch servant in Antigua. This branch was newly formed during the past year to aid the individuals on six of the islands who report regularly. We find now that there is an average of 181 publishers in the service preaching the good news every month. This is a 13 per cent increase over the previous year and they also had a twenty per cent increase for their peak of publishers. Islands reporting service to the Leeward Islands branch office are Anguilla, Antigua, Dominica, Montserrat, Nevis and St. Kitts. From the experiences the branch servant sends in from all these islands the following are taken, which show that the work goes on to the praise and glory of the Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the picturesque, mountainous isle of Dominica, which is predominantly Catholic, and where there are religious shrines and statues at every crossroad, many people are seeing the futility of trusting in these, and are readily responding to the preaching of the pure truth of God’s Word. In the house-to-house work a French-speaking lady was contacted. As she said to the publisher, “I have a French Bible and have also listened to some evangelistic meetings,” for some minutes she was read various scriptures on the blessings of the new world. A back-call was arranged to bring her some French literature, of which she obtained three bound books and a booklet. After reading some of these, on the second call she said: &quot;Your organization explains the Bible better than any other. I would like to attend your meetings. Where are they held?” So overjoyed was she at the message that she expressed her desire to contribute to the work of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">People of honest heart recognize in Jehovah’s witnesses a people they can trust, a people who are sincerely interested in their spiritual welfare and who stand for clean worship. One clergyman visited a lady with whom a Bible study was being conducted and made many charges against Jehovah’s witnesses, but, when confronted and asked to give Scriptural proof for his statements, he failed. In desperation he spoke to the husband of the lady to do something about the matter to stop her from studying with these terrible people. The husband retorted, “You never come to give us any spiritual food, so we must go where we can get it.” A priest who asked a person why he had not attended church lately was told, “If I go anywhere in the future, it will be to Jehovah’s witnesses, for I believe in them. They have the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Public meetings have contributed their part to spreading the good news, as 201 were held this year. Held anywhere people gather, one never speaks to just two or three people of good will, but always to an attentive audience of hundreds. In many cases, on visiting the little villages scattered throughout the mountains on these islands, the entire village attends. The circuit servant reports that, while visiting a congregation of nine publishers on the island of Montserrat, four public meetings were held with 400 people of good will in attendance; on another island a congregation of five had 200 in attendance. While visiting the island of Nevis the district servant put on a public meeting in an isolated village. Two publishers walked through the village and called out to all the people that Jehovah’s witnesses would be holding a Bible lecture at 8 p.m. The result was a crowd of 130 people. However, while many listen readily to the message preached, they do not use their perceptive powers to distinguish between true and false religion. They do not take time to study God’s Word thoroughly, so our big work seems to be organizing these people into study groups and conducting more home Bible studies with them, so that they can clearly discern the true religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At a circuit assembly held at Roseau on the Catholic isle of Dominica, pressure was brought against the owner of the hall to break his contract. He pleaded with us to release him of his contract if he would arrange for us another hall, a school nearby. As this was a better hall and would accommodate more we agreed to this. However, we continued to advertise the public lecture for his hall, as all the advertising material was printed. When the time came for the public lecture, the people were re-directed to the nearby school. The result was an increased attendance, with the hierarchy completely unprepared for this sudden move. Belatedly, the Catholic newspaper asked next week: “We would like to know who gave Jehovah’s witnesses the right to use the public school?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, the outstanding event of the year was the visit of Brother Henschel to Antigua from March 30 to April 1, with a three-day district assembly. The brothers really appreciated this visit of one of the Society’s directors from headquarters. The timely counsel given in the discourses was of great encouragement to all. Imagine the joy of the brothers when it was announced that a film entitled “The New World Society in Action” would be shown. As one sister expressed herself: “Words cannot express what I have seen. It was like being in the new world.” The formation of a new branch in Antigua, and also the coming of two more missionaries to help with the work, all added to the joys. The brothers now all ask, “When will Brother Knorr visit us?” We trust this will be possible some day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LIBERIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The regular visits by the circuit servant to the congregations and the isolated persons in Liberia have proved to be very fruitful. The circuit assembly also proved to be splendid for gathering together all of Jehovah’s people so that they were able to meet one another for the first time. About sixty brothers, representing thirteen tribes and nationalities, conducted themselves with such friendly zeal that one of the townspeople exclaimed: “Everything is true; you people are really one people!” It certainly is a pleasure to see the congregations increasing from 70 publishers last year to 100 this year with a new peak of 124. The work moves grandly on in Liberia, and some of the experiences the branch servant relates are very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A missionary reports: &quot;The new brothers have pressed on with vigor the best way they knew. Did not Psalm 145:2 urge daily praising Jehovah? In sincerity the new brothers determined to carry this out. Daily after working long hours they tramped and preached from house to house throughout the camps week after week, month after month, the entire year, until many people asked in amazement, ‘How is it you can’t miss even one day?’ The reply, ‘When you miss one day from your job what happens?—no pay!’ Others, ‘How is it you never tire of preaching?’ The answer, ‘If people do not tire to do wickedly every day, why should one tire to do good?’ ”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark286"></a><span class="font7">This daily praising Jehovah and talking about his kingdom has produced fruit as the few publishers have grown to ten, twenty and on to forty. The spread of true religion has a hammering-down effect on false worship. People have brought scores of jujus to have them destroyed or disgracefully junked into a dung pit. What miserable, helpless gods! Hundreds of people who never knew of anything but their fetishes have come to know Jehovah to be the worthy name of the true God, even though they have not taken up his worship. The vigorous advance of true worship has forced many of Christendom’s false prophets, who made regular visits to the camps on payday, to scatter and flee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One woman of good will had attended several meetings at a Kingdom Hall, then one Sunday while she was in church the pastor said if any one had literature from Jehovah’s witnesses he should destroy it—take it to the w.c. She was shocked to hear </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> “man of God” say such a thing. Her heart changed; she no longer wanted to return to church. So in earnest she began to attend the meetings. During the circuit servant’s visit she attended all the meetings and went out into the service for the first time. The battle to face her relatives made her ill, but she soon began overcoming her fear of man, gaining happiness through fear oi Jehovah. Next she took another publisher and went to her lover (a married man) and said all that was past; now she was a witness for Jehovah. She preaches daily, endeavoring to devote three hours a day. All this because of a false shepherd’s warning!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Putting the Kingdom first in the day, an average of fifteen persons congregate weekly at a missionary home at six in the morning for Bible study. And they are prompt about it too. With such love for the truth many more Liberians will yet daily bless Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark287"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">It is a joy to see how Jehovah God guides his people in all parts of the world including Mexico. Here as his people assemble together in congregations they grow to maturity and express their appreciation to Jehovah God for the knowledge they have received from his Word by being very active in the field. They know the value of the Society’s publications and they know the need of going to all parts of the land to preach the good news of the Kingdom. The branch servant sets out some very exciting experiences from this Latin country, and all will enjoy reading them, for they show how persistent the publishers are in preaching the good news of the Kingdom. The New World society is on the march.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We had a very nice assembly in the new Kingdom Hall just built by the brothers. It is well constructed and attractive and has been noticed by everyone. The former hall in the same place was an old dilapidated wooden structure. Last year the archbishop with an entourage of devout Catholics stopped in front of the hall and through a short ceremony with some Latin words and certain gestures put a curse on the hall. He was very much surprised to see the nice new hall when he passed this year with his group, returning from the 4th of May religious festival in a nearby town. One look was enough. He did not even stop. His curse had turned into a blessing.—Neh. 13: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A member of the Bethel family tells us of his experiences during his two weeks as a vacation pioneer: “Traveling on horseback, a general pioneer and I visited a town where we had advised the brothers beforehand and met a group of 18 who had taken the three days off from their work to go out in the service. There has been some opposition here, but Jehovah blessed our efforts and the first night there were 29 gathered to hear the message about God’s kingdom. The second night there were 39 and the third 64, among them several of the foremost citizens of the town. They even formed a committee to protect Jehovah’s witnesses, with arms if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The next town we visited is among the mountains and is the center for a sect called ‘Los Libres’ (Freemen). They refuse to be identified with religion and will use no literature except the Bible. We stayed with a person of good will, and when we were about to leave for the work the first day, a committee from the church met us and asked us to speak to their congregation that night. We gladly accepted. The house as well as the patio was packed. As the talk on ‘The Great Sign of the Times’ developed by the light of a kerosene lamp, the eyes of the audience seemed as if they would pop out. They were amazed. Never had they heard anything about modern-day events’ fulfilling the Bible prophecy concerning the time of the end, since there is practically no means of communication and they refuse to read newspapers. One of the ministers exclaimed: ‘How Jehovah’s witnesses can use the Bible! We had been told they use nothing but literature.’ The next evening, our last in this town, everyone came to the house where we were staying, the house of the one they call the ‘spiritual harlot,’ since she receives anyone who talks about the Bible. We continued explaining Bible truth and Jehovah’s purposes, ending up with our question to these people of good will, ‘Do you know how Jehovah’s witnesses have learned so much about the Bible?’ and our own answer, ‘By the use of the Society’s literature which we are now going to offer you.’ With that we placed all the literature we had with us. They continued asking questions until 2 a.m., but no one even thought about it being late. They wanted to know everything all at once. Now I hope to spend my next vacation the same way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A congregation reported mob violence in a town in its territory and said: “When the publishers arrived by bus to have their studies, the bells of the Catholic church began ringing, which gave the prearranged signal for the people to form the mob. Armed with clubs and machetes, they blocked the way to the homes of the people of good will, mistreated the brothers and finally stoned them out of town. Two days later the congregation servant accompanied by two other brothers returned to see the presidente municipal (mayor); and upon our arrival in the bus about 10 a.m. the church bells again began to ring and, while the brothers were putting their case before the presidente municipal, a mob of about 1,000, almost the entire populace, gathered in front of the Palacio Municipal requesting the brothers be released to them so they could kill them. Telephone lines had apparently been cut so no contact could be made with federal authorities to send in the army and only two policemen held back the crowd at the palace doors. The presidente municipal favored the brothers and saw the injustice being done and was aware that the priest was the one stirring up the trouble. Similar to Gamaliel, he took the part of the brothers and fearlessly warned the mob that if any harm was done to the brothers it would be over his dead body. Then he put the brothers in his own station wagon, and, with four newly sworn deputies as policemen, he started through the mob to take the brothers to safety. But they stopped the car, yelled for the blood of the brothers. ‘Death to the “evangelistas”! Long live the Apostolic Roman Catholic religion!’ were their battle cries, and with that they tried to get at the brothers to take them out of the car. The presidente municipal told them the army was on its way, and with many persuasive words they managed to get out of town. The priest kept ringing the beiis all the while, trying to whip the crowd into a frenzy so as to have the brothers put to death. ‘We were like the three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace and like Daniel in the lions’ den,’ the brother reports, ‘but Jehovah was with us, and, thanks to Him, we are well and ready to continue with the important assignment we have to teach the people the truth and the way to life in Jehovah’s new world.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“After counsel from the Society a proper report was made to the governor of the state, presenting the facts and names of those involved, including the name and part played by the local priest. About that time the governor of the state was traveling through this town where the trouble occurred, so he stopped and got firsthand information from the presidente municipal. He thereupon ordered the priest to leave town and not come back. When the archbishop intervened on behalf of the priest, he was rebuked and the order stuck. So now the brothers can continue to feed the sheep they have found in the work of daily praise to Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An outstanding event of the year was the national assembly held in Mexico City while Brother Franz was here. This was the first such assembly in many years. Brothers came from every state in the country and from almost every one of the 378 congregations, to make an attendance of over 7,000. The new publications released in Spanish were greatly appreciated as well as the three one-hour talks by the Society's vicepresident.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark288"></a>NETHERLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">There has been plenty of action in the Netherlands during the past year, not only in the association of our brothers together at assemblies, but also on the part of the opposition who do not want minority groups to have freedom to speak the good news. Whenever Catholics are in the majority, then the minority must be silent; but should the Catholics be in a country where they are a minority, then they put up a loud hue and cry for freedom of speech. How strange! Do they not know that Christ Jesus taught that “the truth shall make you free”? Jehovah’s witnesses know they are free from the bondage of this old world. Therefore they press on determined to do Jehovah’s will and to comfort those who mourn. The branch servant sets out a very interesting report, and a few of the experiences are related here. These show that the great division work is going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Religious opposition to the work in the Catholic south of the Netherlands has continued to flare up during 1954. Since circuit assemblies stir up so much interest in the Kingdom message and are the source of much publicity, religious opposers have singled these out for their attacks against Jehovah’s people. But the net result of their opposition has been a circuit assembly as successful as any and more publicity than ever. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font7">of July 22, 1954, carried an article on one of these incidents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As soon as this incident was over, another similar one was in the making. In the fall of 1953 a contract was signed for a hall in Geleen, in the province of Limburg. The contract plainly stated that it was for the purpose of holding a Christian assembly by Jehovah’s witnesses. The owner of the hall seemed to be very happy to rent the hall and, likely, he was genuinely happy at the time. As preparations for the circuit assembly gained momentum during the few weeks remaining before the dates, foul rain began to fall out of what till then seemed to be clear, blue skies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under religious pressure the owner of the hall feverishly sought ways and means of rendering the contract null and void. But the terms of the contract were unequivocal, the case was airtight. Then one day the the circuit servant was presented with a summons to appear in court under charge of “deception.” What could that be? The charge was to the effect that, as the hall was obtained for the holding of a Christian assembly and since it could be proved that Jehovah’s witnesses are not Christians, it follows that Jehovah’s witnesses obtained a contract under false pretenses. The case was to be brought before court the day before the circuit assembly was due to begin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The case was a laugh! Weakly, counsel for the hall owner presented his case and then presented evidence in the form of booklets written against us by certain clergymen, which evidence the judge laid aside as being incompetent after a brother from the branch office presented our side of the matter. The judge did not render his decision then, but made it clear that the contract was valid until the decision, which was to come 14 days later. In other words, he gave us the go-ahead sign. That same day the district and circuit servants paid a visit to the hall owner who made it plain that, “court decision or no court decision,” we were not going to get the hall. When the brothers arrived at 9 Friday morning, they were stopped by the closed doors of the hall. It was then plain that another meeting place must be found. The only thing available was an open field in the outskirts of nearby Sittard. The grounds for the new assembly site were surrounded by a canvas “fence” about six feet high and the assembly site was fifteen yards away from the road, as required by law. It was not possible to hold a meeting Friday evening, but Saturday morning the assembly for field service was held without incident. Saturday afternoon the immersion talk was broken up by police, and the sound equipment was confiscated. The rest of the talk was delivered by another speaker as the original speaker was arrested, and the immersion took place as scheduled. That evening the program had to be held without the aid of sound equipment. On Sunday all went along normally, including sound equipment that had been procured in the meantime. Nearly 800 enjoyed the public lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The branch office was able to collect thirty-five separate newspaper articles on the incident, as it provoked much comment. The articles totaled 276 inches of printed column. We quote one of them: “The Catholic clergy makes assembling an impossibility for a small minority of our people; by command of the Catholic clergy the owner of a hall is incited to breach of contract and hospitable people are put under pressure to renounce their hospitality. And when one finally should happen to succeed in renting a pasture, the police are present with their Black Marias to intervene if one speaks too loudly. I wonder how our Catholic friends would react if their right of assembly were impinged upon in a place where they are in a minority. Should tolerance always come from one side? Therefore should there be an exemption made for Catholics in the Sunday Observance Act?” Incidentally, in the Sittard case, the judge quashed the charge that Jehovah’s witnesses are not a Christian society and made the hall owner pay the costs of the proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The year 1954 brought many blessings to his people. Jehovah provided us with still another means of building up the brothers and increasing their appreciation of the organization by means of the film “The New World Society in Action.” Until the end of the service year this film was shown 42 times to 10,649 people, and the enthusiasm was great among those seeing the New World society in action!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brother from a circuit assembly city where the film was shown writes: “I rang the doorbell and a lady opened the door. I asked if I could speak to her as I would like to thank her for the hospitality she showed to our delegates. I was immediately invited to come in and she did not waste any time in telling me that she had had a study earlier but, due to circumstances, this study was discontinued. Even before I could suggest it, the woman requested me to hold a study with her out of the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Means Everlasting Life’.</span><span class="font7"> Now this request did not land on deaf ears. That you can understand. I was a bit astounded but gladly said, ‘Yes!’ I was happy to be able to conduct another study, and my joy grew when she asked me if I could come the next day. This person did not waste any time about the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘‘And do you know why this lady was so anxious about starting her study again? She had seen the film about the New World society! She saw the world-wide </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">activity</span><span class="font7"> of Jehovah’s witnesses, and she understood at once what we understand and know. So as a result of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">action, </span><span class="font7">came </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">action!”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark289"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark290"></a>NETHERLANDS WEST INDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Good work is being done under the direction of the branch office in Curasao. The people on the three islands of Curasao, Aruba and Bonaire have shown real interest in the Kingdom message. Many have taken their stand and now are going forward preaching the good news. In Curasao a new congregation was formed just of Papia-mento-speaking natives. The natives have been deceived for a long time but now they are turning to the Bible and learning what Jehovah God has in store for them. Their knowledge of Jehovah’s Word will bring them life. Excerpts from the branch servant’s report on these three islands will prove to be very interesting; and what has happened in Aruba in connection with the use of the film “The New World Society in Action” shows what can be done with this film in all parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not long ago a man was contacted in the house-to-house work who said he had been studying with the Adventists for about a year and had many Bible questions he would like to discuss. A back-call was arranged and at the first back-call a study was arranged for the following Sunday. The publisher, seeing how well-mannered the man and his family were, left the June 15 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> for him with the suggestion that he might enjoy reading the article on “The Best of Manners.” He did, but after reading that he continued reading the main article on “The Revelation of Jesus Christ.” The man was so impressed with the explanation given on the presence, manifestation and revelation of Jesus Christ that he was convinced that we, not the Adventists, have the truth. He took his stand at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although he had been smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for a long time he stopped of his own accord. He carried four cigarettes around in his pocket a long time to convince himself he was stopping because he really wanted to and not because he did not have a cigarette handy. It was quite a battle, but after one week the worst was over and after a month he was not troubled again. The money he saves on cigarettes is now going into the “Your Contributions Prospects” fund. Needless to say, he is one of the most zealous publishers we have and, after a few months in the truth, is talking about when he was “new in the truth.” He says he has every hope of living in the new world, but even if he might not make it he is getting a lot more out of the present life in the meantime than ever before, a contentment he never knew before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have always had good success placing literature in this territory and the past year is no exception to the rule. We have averaged above the quota of two magazines per publisher per week and are happy about that. We are also pleased that four out of the hundred-odd publishers here signed up for vacation pioneer work and have done wonderfully well. A couple of them have decided to continue in the pioneer work, since they like it so much.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark291"></a>ARUBA, N. W. I.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The high light of our work this year in Aruba has been the film “The New World Society in Action.” Before we began to show it, it was necessary to appear before the censors. These included a Catholic priest and five others. The head of the board was the minister of the Dutch Reformed Church. After viewing it one of them remarked, “It just shows what unity can do,” and wished us success. The minister requested that we show it to his members (which we did at a later date), not because he believed in our doctrines, but because he wanted his church members to see the “zeal and activity of Jehovah’s witnesses,” a fact that he mentioned both in introducing the picture and also after it was shown. Before showing it we gave it wide publicity in the form of news items released to most of the newspapers. The items mentioned that we would show the picture free for any club or other organization which would offer its premises free if the public also could enter free. This brought a good response and some of the clubs showed it twice when they were packed out the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On one occasion it was shown in a theater in a solid Catholic district at the same hour that a religious parade was in progress, and we had an attendance of over 270 although only about thirty of these were brothers. Some people saw the film at one club and then begged the board of their own club to let us show it. This happened at a club that had refused us their premises for a circuit assembly; it was shown and enjoyed. After seeing the picture one of the ladies upon whom a publisher is calling and who usually keeps her books in a cockroach-infested cupboard remarked, “We must take better care of our books, those people go to such a lot of trouble to make them.” Since sending the film to Curacao, requests are still coming in to show it at other clubs. We look forward to showing it again later.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark292"></a>BONAIRE, N. W. I.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The main event of theocratic interest in Bonaire during the past service year was the circuit assembly held there in May. Not only was this the first assembly we ever had in Bonaire, but it was the first all-Papiamento assembly we ever held, as our assemblies previously have been conducted in both the English and Papia-mento languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the whole the Kingdom work is going quite well in Bonaire. In times past the local brothers had the idea that they could not place magazines. But they were encouraged to try, and now they are surprised to find that during the last year they have averaged almost two magazines per publisher per week although Bonaire is considered a poor place, to compare with other countries. It just goes to show what can be done if an effort is made. Nothing is gained if nothing is ventured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At present a special pioneer is doing well in Bonaire and we are looking forward to continued progress in Kingdom activity there to Jehovah’s honor.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark293"></a>NEWFOUNDLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">More than a hundred brothers from Newfoundland attended the New York assembly in Yankee Stadium in 1953. They heeded the wise counsel given and returned home to do all they could to help those who wanted to come into the New World society. The brothers in Newfoundland had a wonderful increase during the year, reaching both their 10 per cent and 20 per cent goals without any difficulty at all. House-to-house preaching became the theme of the activity in Newfoundland, and efforts were put forth to assist the brothers to see the importance of this work and how by it they could effectively carry forward their ministerial activity. What they had learned in the congregation of Jehovah’s people they now wanted to put into effect by telling others of good will. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">House-to-house preaching has shown a marked improvement. At the beginning of this service year only 30 per cent of an average of 224 brothers were taking part in house-to-house preaching. With the encouragement received from Jehovah’s organization to improve in this part of the activity, our records reveal that, by April 18, 100 per cent of the brothers took part in the actual work of preaching from door to door. Recognizing the theocratic organization has brought forth the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Without question increased house-to-house ministry on the part of all publishers was reflected in our obtaining 801 new subscriptions during the campaign. One congregation reported more than 100 per cent increase in number of subscriptions and the reason given for this outstanding improvement was increased house-to-house visitation along with three- to eight-minute sermons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The new training program has assisted greatly in the progress achieved during the year. The month after the circuit servant visited one of the congregations it was noted that many more publishers were active in field service. The congregation’s report jumped from 42 publishers to 58 in just one month. Wholehearted support and co-operation on the part of the servants and publishers was responsible for this remarkable increase. This example should strongly encourage all congregations to give the training program their full support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before the service year came to a close we were to enjoy the most important event for 1954, the district assembly. All the brothers in Newfoundland would like to express their appreciation for the wonderful counsel and admonition received from Jehovah through his theocratic organization. They are determined to use the instruments Jehovah has put into their hands to deliver the message against Gog of Magog and continue to announce Jehovah’s kingdom as the only hope for mankind. In addition, they want to be loyal ministers of Jehovah, recognizing the theocratic organization. A goodly number have already advised us that they are going to do everything in their power to read the entire Bible through once each year. How thrilled the brothers were when they were informed that Jehovah’s organization was making preparation for international assemblies during 1955! All are eager to make this the big thing in their lives during 1955. It is a real joy to observe the friendly family spirit among those who belong to Jehovah.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark294"></a>NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The New World society has made great strides in New Zealand in gathering the other sheep during the 1954 service year. Jehovah has crowned the year with his goodness, and he has bestowed upon Jehovah’s witnesses in this land his undeserved kindness. The Devil is enraged at the world-wide expansion of Jehovah’s organization, and he is using false religionists to attack Jehovah’s witnesses. Recently one of the clergymen there condemned the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font8"> in his sermon. It was advertised that he was going to expose Jehovah’s witnesses; so the circuit servant went to the sermon. After the sermon the circuit servant asked the clergyman if he had ever seen or read a copy of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font8"> to which the clergyman was forced to admit that he had never even seen a copy of it. Many other embarrassing questions were asked the clergyman, but the clergyman had very little to say now that he was cornered. Strange—the clergy do not want to enter the Kingdom themselves and neither do they want anyone else to enter. The branch servant in New Zealand sends us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A young married pioneer couple wrote us concerning their happy experiences in building up a congregation. Activities were centered on training irregular publishers, both by studying with them and by aiding them in house-to-house witnessing. Before long, four of a family of eight became publishers; and about the same time they were thrilled to learn that relatives in anothei<sup>-</sup> city, whom they had not heard from for some time, had accepted the truth and had started publishing with the congregation there. When one of his vestrymen resigned and started proclaiming the Kingdom message, the Anglican clergyman attacked the organization. An elderly Anglican lady, whose usual practice had been to shut the door in the face of every witness of Jehovah, also began publishing last month. Four other interested persons, three of whom have started publishing, regularly visit these pioneers for a Bible study, which is unusual for New Zealand. During the year the sister gave birth to a fine son, but this did not prevent her from reporting her full quota of pioneer hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Immorality is rife among children in New Zealand and so alarming is the situation that the government appointed a special committee of investigation. Three teen-agers have recently been involved in two brutal murders. It is therefore refreshing to hear of the godly behavior of children brought up in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah. A young sister, whose desire is to enter pioneer service as soon as she leaves school, rejoices at the many opportunities she has of witnessing. She has won respect for Jehovah’s organization from many in the high school where she attends. At the end of the first term she was congratulated by various teachers on her stand for her religion, her appearance, deportment and her conscientiousness. At period breaks and during the lunch hour she is the center of interest among all the teachers in the school, a circumstance which brings Jehovah’s witnesses under notice. The principal said that she was the only child she had met that could converse intelligently about her religion and that, for her age, she had the widest range of general knowledge in the school. Teachers she witnessed to told other teachers what she said. One remarked on her Christian conduct in the face of ridicule and spite displayed by fellow pupils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In preparing assigned talks she gathers material from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> and usually earns “excellent.” The science teacher received </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Basis for Belief in a New World</span><span class="font7"> to read. With another teacher evolution was discussed from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Evolution</span><span class="font7"> booklet, and, when pressed, it was admitted that the school textbooks are out of date and inaccurate, but, because supplied by the education board, they must be used. Recently three-minute talks were arranged, with each student choosing her own subject. Our young sister spoke on “The Best Seller of All Time—The Bible,” and was awarded highest marks, just one below the chief prefect of the school. The talk was given before 500 pupils and was a good witness. Vacation pioneering and other theocratic activities, school studies and home chores leave this happy young witness little time for being sidetracked into the immoral course of this old system of things.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark295"></a>NICARAGUA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses had a good start in Nicaragua for their 1954 service year because Brother Franz made a two-day visit there. He outlined the principal work of the New World society and explained how, in order to bring in the desirable other sheep, Jehovah was shaking all the nations, including Nicaragua. Many more of these other sheep would come out of Nicaragua, he said. Nicaragua now reports at the end of the year that the shaking work went on and the New World society has increased 20 per cent this year. The publishers have also become more magazine-minded and now are placing about 700 more magazines every month than they did at the beginning of the service year. The work advances at a good pace, and the branch servant gives us a few interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The house-to-house training program was put into effect and undoubtedly had a lot to do with our increase. To illustrate, a missionary sister arranged to help a new sister, working with her every Tuesday afternoon. Up to this time the new one had been rather indifferent toward the work; but when she began to be trained and really could preach, giving a three- to eight-minute sermon and seeing the division the message caused between the sheeplike ones and the goatish, well, her joy knew no bounds. She is a regular attender at the congregation meetings and conducts several of her own studies. Now on these same Tuesday afternoons she is still going out in the service with the missionary, but they take </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">two other</span><span class="font7"> new ones to train. Her husband, her mother and her sisters are studying also so that they can witness too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From a small congregation the local servant reports that a young couple with several children wanted a Catholic Bible, but before they could obtain it they were robbed of all their savings and left almost penniless. Yet they still wanted a Bible, and after being shown that the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Moderna</span><span class="font7"> and the Catholic </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Ndcar-Colunga </span><span class="font7">Bibles are almost identical, they took the cheaper </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Moderna</span><span class="font7"> and borrowed a Catholic Bible to compare them extensively. The local priest heard of such prohibited research and threatened excommunication and boycott. Most of their friends turned against them and even the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">monsenor</span><span class="font7"> heard of the case and warned everyone in his weekly sheet: “The activities of Jehovah’s witnesses can no longer be tolerated in [this Catholic town].” But this young couple have become very active members of the New World society and two of their children, ages 12 and 14, became vacation pioneers. Their diligent activity has resulted in several persons’ hearing of the truth and associating with us. A young carpenter took a Bible from the little pioneer; now he has taken his stand and gone out in the witness work too. The activity here has more than doubled since the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">monsenor</span><span class="font7"> said he could not tolerate any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the Society made the new arrangements for vacation pioneering, five brothers have been able to pioneer, some who would not have been able to before. It has really given some a taste of what full-time service is like and the spiritual health it brings one. During the time they are pioneering their general attitude, their attendance at meetings, their comments, everything about them is more aglow with the spirit. Really, pioneering is the ideal way of forming your life pattern in conformity with Jehovah’s new system of things.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark296"></a>NIGERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Everyone who has dedicated himself to the service of Jehovah God remembers the wonderful thrill he felt at first learning of Jehovah’s purposes and how the Sovereign Ruler of the universe will bless his people with life and happiness. Jehovah’s witnesses remember their first joy and how they transformed their whole life pattern. This keeps them going forward now with great enthusiasm to tell others of the hope that is within them. Knowledge brings great enjoyment, peace of mind and eventually life. Our brothers in Nigeria are receiving knowledge of Jehovah’s kingdom in great measure, and they are responding with real zeal, wanting to have others enjoy the same things that have meant such happiness to them. The work in Nigeria, Cameroun and Dahomey is reported by the branch servant in Lagos. He sets forth some experiences that show how our brothers are determined to preach under any and all circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The unassigned territory campaign was announced for the montns of May, June and July. At first some doubted if the choice of these months was a wise one, since that is the season of heavy rains, which would make the traveling difficult. However, it was pointed out that since most of the brothers are farmers and this is their slack season they would be able to devote much time to the unassigned territory work. Furthermore during the rainy season many more people are to be found at home, so that, although it might be out of season for some publishers, it would be in season for the sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many congregations were simply told to start working along a certain road or down a particular river or creek and to go as far as they could. The brothers prepared for the campaign with great enthusiasm, arranging to make long trips of several weeks’ duration. In some cases the congregations divided into two groups, each going in turn to unassigned territory while the other group kept the studies going at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One congregation reports: “As we reached our unassigned territory we saw the primitive condition of the people and we doubted the possibility of any of them being reformed. Each family has its own god in the form of a tree, a rock, sticks, roots, bones or clay pots. Cows, goats, fowls and dogs are offered continually to these lifeless gods.” In the course of witnessing the brothers met a very interested man, who eventually asked them to come to his house and destroy his idols. This event was well advertised throughout the village, and a public talk was given on the subject of idol worship. The local witch doctor heard the talk and was amazed to know that there were people who had the courage to defy the idols. All the people of the village showed interest and acknowledged the truth of the message, but they were still afraid to witness the destruction of the idols. So the brothers went right ahead and cut down the sacred poles and broke the pots and burned them all. Since then both the man of good will and the witch doctor have become publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An interesting example of theocratic tactfulness comes from the village of Ikot Akan. When the brothers arrived there they looked for some place to lodge. They were directed to the very poorest house in the village. It had no doors, the roof leaked badly and was altogether in a rough condition. It was hoped that this would discourage the brothers and cause them to leave quickly. However, the brothers stayed the night and in the morning they set to work to repair the house. They worked all day, and the owner of the house was so glad he came to help them. Soon the whole village was buzzing with the news that the house was being rebuilt, and when the brothers gathered for their service meeting in the evening there were 64 of the village people in attendance. Next day much witnessing was done and many people came to see the house and stayed to get literature. In the evening a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study was held, with a hundred strangers there. A public talk was also given with 293 in attendance. All this interest sprang up because of the tact and determination of the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It became commonplace during the campaign to find lost sheep, but one party of brothers enjoyed the unusual experience of finding a lost congregation of sheep. In one very isolated area of the Niger delta, where they had never witnessed before, the publishers met a joyful group of about a dozen people who were regularly studying the Society’s publications and witnessing, although they had never been in touch with the organization. It appears that some years ago a brother was transferred to that area on government service. As a result of his preaching a small group was formed. When he left they continued to preach and study, although no one knew of their existence until they were “discovered” during the unassigned territory campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the campaign started, more than twenty congregations have been enrolled and many scores of groups of isolated persons formed. The only obstacle to forming many more congregations is the difficulty of finding mature brothers to act as congregation servants.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark297"></a>CAMEROUN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The isolated town of M’Banga is the circuit servant’s home, and concerning it he says: “The day of my arrival at M’Banga I organized a service meeting with an attendance of 64 persons and the following day we had a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study. My father worked here as postmaster, but he has just been transferred to a distant place. He has left me all his possessions and his house, and we are now using this as a temporary Kingdom Hall. My uncle is a landowner and I have asked him to give us a piece of land where we can build a good hall. There is only one mature brother as yet. He was in the Catholic mission but left there two years ago and was baptized. He cannot obtain any regular secular work here and feared he would have to leave; so to enable him to stay and look after the young lambs I have put him to work on a plantation left by my father. With these arrangements I believe there will soon be a congregation here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The religious opposition that raged here some years ago has now ceased. It appears that the opposers despaired of ever stopping the preaching work, chiefly because the majority of the local population is anxious to hear the message and the priests find it difficult to whip up any enthusiasm for their campaigns even among their own followers. At one Catholic town, N’Kong-samba, the brothers arranged for a public meeting using their own public-address system. The priest strenuously opposed it, but the administration took the side of the brothers and gave permission. This stirred up great interest and the talk was attended by over 4,000, which just about emptied the town.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark298"></a>DAHOMEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The situation in Dahomey has steadily improved during the year. The bitter opposition of the Catholic Church has almost died away and the brothers are now free to go from house to house without hindrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Early in the year a brother was sent to prison for failing to pay a fine imposed on him for possessing the Society’s literature. While in prison he was diligent to preach to the other prisoners. This displeased the prison governor, who had him transferred to another prison. At the new place he received better treatment and was able to preach to all the other prisoners without hindrance. The head warden became interested and two other prisoners accepted the truth and began publishing there in the prison. During the day the brother was sent out of the prison to work as a carpenter at the home of the superintendent of police. The man proved to be of good will, even allowing the brother to go home during the day to get literature, the very same literature for which he was sent to prison. The policeman took literature from the brother before and after his release and was instrumental in getting his sentence shortened.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark299"></a>NORTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">It is a pleasure to receive reports from Northern Rhodesia again and from other countries under its jurisdiction. It is observed that there is still much need to bring the brothers on to maturity, but all of us appreciate that this will take time, especially with the backward brothers in the primitive parts of the territory. Everything is being done to help these good people get a clearer knowledge of the truth. All look to Jehovah for wisdom and understanding and Jehovah brings the increase. When there is an attendance of 80,983 at Memorial, one knows that there is interest in the land. The branch servant in Northern Rhodesia looks after the territory of the Belgian Congo, Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda. Brief reports are sent in on all these countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The expansion has not gone on without opposition. The Church of England, for instance, organized a special mission in one area to try to counteract what they called “the false teaching of the Watch Tower.” Part of the remedy was described as “the reciting of the Glorious Mysteries of the Rosary, each ‘Hail Mary’ being interspersed with an appropriate verse of Scripture.” The bishop of Northern Rhodesia warned a meeting of the Church of England Synod that the Watch Tower was one of the chief 'enemies of the church.’ In other areas religious fanatics used violence against the Kingdom publishers, and several cases were reported of brothers’ having their Bibles seized and tom up. In a number of such cases the ones assaulting the brothers were ordered by local chiefs or district commissioners to pay fines and reimburse the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The continued lawful and peaceful activity of the brothers has served to answer the misrepresentation and false charges of the opposers. The cry that Jehovah’s witnesses are back of industrial disputes is now seldom heard, and certainly not from any knowledgeable person. The African witnesses have kept themselves apart from such worldly wranglings, and this has been noted by many. The way, too, that so many Africans come together to prepare for assemblies, building such excellent sites, has caused many officials to exclaim: “Any organization that can get people to work together that way—voluntarily at that —must have something good in it!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The film “The New World Society in Action” has been shown to enthusiastic audiences. Africans are spontaneous in their reactions, and, when we were showing the film to the African brothers, the commentary was time and again interrupted by applause. In many instances, halls and cinemas were put at our disposal free or at a nominal charge. The brothers were thrilled with the film, and there is no doubt that it has given the brothers who have seen it a much better appreciation of the New World society and the theocratic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The outstanding feature of the work that has shown increase has been magazine distribution. The number of new subscriptions obtained this year was more than double the figure for last year, and there was also a good increase in the distribution of single copies. One unit in a large mining town took 1.500 copies of the Cibemba </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and now, following the admonition on magazine distribution given at the district assemblies, has requested its supply to be increased to 4,000 of each issue!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A big event was the moving of the branch from Lusaka to the Copperbelt, and this put us closer to the center of the country from a theocratic viewpoint, for we are now nearer to the majority of the publishers. We are now caring for the work of the branch under much more congenial conditions and with facilities that enable us to give more efficient service to the brothers. We are indeed grateful for this added provision, and we are determined to use it to advance the interests of the New World society further in this land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark300"></a>BELGIAN CONGO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The ban continues on the work in this land with little prospect that it will be lifted in the near future, but this has not dampened the zeal of those who love and serve Jehovah. The many imprisonments and deportations of brothers during the past year have not caused them to slack the hand, and during the year there has been a good increase, as the report shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Under the existing conditions house-to-house work is not possible, so back-calls and home Bible studies are conducted. As one congregation writes, the publishers would like to share in the public declaration of the good news also, although “we do not know if Jehovah will permit us to preach the good news from house to house in this land before the battle of Armageddon.” But if the way does open up, then there are some willing to take up this public proclamation for the benefit of others.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark301"></a>KENYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">When one is isolated as a New World outpost in a land slightly larger than France in the midst of the African continent, a visit by someone of ‘like precious faith’ is like finding a wellspring in the desert. So it was to the brothers at Nairobi to have a Gilead graduate and his wife spend ten days with them to serve their congregation with the first circuit servant’s visit. A goodly number of magazine subscriptions were obtained during this period of activity, enabling the brothers and sisters to keep busy making return visits after the circuit servant left. Back-calls are therefore a strong feature of their report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The great need in Nairobi is for mature brothers to take the lead in the congregation, in meetings and in field service. The sister who is at present caring for the congregational arrangements is keeping the matter of increase before the brothers, using the chart at service discussions and doing what she can to keep the group together.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark302"></a>TANGANYIKA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">We have had another fine increase in Tanganyika during the past service year, reaching a new all-time peak of 336 publishers in June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Though up till the present the government of Tanganyika has refused to allow the Society to send in missionaries on a permanent basis, nevertheless the work has gone along during the year without any difficulty and with little interference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Several publishers have gone farther into the interior in connection with their secular work and have become isolated. There they have begun witnessing to their work mates and have continued their regular preaching of the good news. In one isolated area the circuit servant visited a brother and found two persons of good will he had been studying with sufficiently advanced in knowledge to be able also to share in the preaching activity. While making this visit the circuit servant was called before the manager of the estate on which the group worked in order to explain the purpose of his visit. After two discussions the manager showed much good will and donated 50 shillings (about $7) to the work. He also arranged for the brothers to have a place in which to hold their meetings regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers in Tanganyika, like the brothers all over the world, are anxious to get to assemblies, and fifty of them traveled to the nearest district assembly in Northern Rhodesia, where nineteen of them were immersed. The special pioneer in Tanganyika made a trip of 180 miles in two days on his bicycle to get to this assembly and felt that it was well worth it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark303"></a>UGANDA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The report from a congregation servant speaks for itself. “It has been a happy year, with considerable interest being manifested both among the Europeans and among the Africans. Though the interest is here, it is a problem to get the people to realize the urgency of the times and to flee out of modern Babylon for refuge under Jehovah’s kingdom.” Both sections of the population are now being served with a regular weekly study of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> The benefit from these regular congregation studies is reflected in the new peak of ten publishers for the Kampala congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the interest of expanding the Kingdom work in Kampala, it was suggested to the brothers that the new ones now becoming mature in their knowledge of Jehovah’s Word be encouraged to conduct home Bible studies with other persons of good will. Since this suggestion was put into operation, two more studies have been started, with five persons and two persons attending respectively. This will correct a weak feature of their report and will no doubt bring its rich increase of more New World associates.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark304"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Because Jehovah’s slaves are so active, in time they are able to reach out to all parts of the inhabited earth. Jehovah’s witnesses in Norway have much isolated territory, but every effort is being put forth to reach it. The vacation pioneer service has helped the branch to cover some of this territory. There were eighty-seven who filled out applications to go into the vacation pioneer service, and a number of fine experiences were sent in to the office. The branch servant here reports some of these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While working isolated territory we had to cross a large lake to reach several houses. The wind was blowing very hard, driving a heavy rain before it. The first place we came to was an abandoned farm on an island. My wife went up to the buildings to see if perhaps there might be some one living there. She contacted an elderly lady who was spending her vacation there. Before my wife could present the literature the lady clasped her hands together with the remark, “We left Notodden to get away from Jehovah’s witnesses, yet here to this isolated island they come. It appears that I am supposed to take the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’.”</span><span class="font7"> So without another word she turned into the house to come back with the exact contribution and promised to read the book carefully to really learn what Jehovah’s witnesses taught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A man and his wife serving as vacation pioneers in an isolated town with many different religions were well received and enjoyed many wonderful Bible discussions as they placed 62 books, 318 booklets, 104 magazines and two subscriptions in the ten days there. Surely many of these people are really of the good-will class we are seeking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The usual case in this country is that people are slow to make their minds over and accept the truth. However, the following experience from one of the Bethel brothers is most interesting and encouraging. “We were just ready to start our congregation book study when a knock was heard at the door. The young man standing outside asked if this was where the man lived who sold </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> He had read one of our books and wanted to investigate further. He was invited to attend the study and gladly accepted. After the study he excused himself for not having studied beforehand, so that he could have taken a share in answering the questions as the others had done; but next time he would be prepared. He obtained </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘The Kingdom Is at Hand’, ‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font7"> and a Bible. He was in attendance at the next study and took part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Three days after he attended his first study we were engaged in street work with the magazines. He came along and asked what we were doing. After we had explained the magazine work to him he asked if he could not do likewise. So he was given two magazines, and crossing the street he placed them at once. The next Magazine Day he was back with a brand-new brief case. His explanation was that he had to have one, now that he was starting in the ‘field service.’ ”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark305"></a>NYASALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">There is still a tremendous amount of work to be done in Nyasaland to bring the brothers to maturity. If the Society could get more European brothers into this land it could accomplish that, but up to the present time the government has not allowed additional missionaries to enter. However, with the few we have we try to enlighten their minds and bring the publishers to a clear understanding of Jehovah’s purposes. Recently it has been found advisable to build Kingdom Halls in the larger villages and to amalgamate a number of congregations. This has made the congregations stronger and has made it possible, too, to arrange better meetings. The brothers have had many interesting experiences in the jungles of Africa, and the branch servant tells us a few of them, also giving a report on Portuguese East Africa, where it is very difficult to preach the good news of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The authorities have welcomed the applications for the building of these Kingdom Halls, although many religious leaders of the various denominations have been busy trying to put every obstacle possible in the way to prevent the brothers from obtaining the necessary permission for their halls. The circuit servants, who have done much to straighten out the difficulties and get the building of the halls going, all agree that the reorganization that has taken place is all to the good, and they are pleased to have stronger servants working with them in the congregations. The feeling is that things are now on a more solid basis and that a good building-up work is on the way. We look for Jehovah’s blessing to make it a grand success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A circuit servant writes in: “We were holding a public meeting when the local </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">bumbo</span><span class="font7"> [father] of the Roman Catnolic mission came along to tell the Catholic people present that they were to leave the meeting at once. Silence greeted this announcement and the talk went on. When the priest saw that he was being ignored, he came to me and tried to take away the copy of ‘Mthenga Wabwino’ [the Roman Catholic Cinyanja translation of the Gospels and Acts! that I was using in the talk: ‘You’re deceiving these people,’ he cried. I told him that as I was supporting my discourse from the Bible I could not be doing that. I started telling him what I had been preaching, and every time I made a point he would ask me what scriptures I had in support and I would tell him and he would read them aloud and so on until he was silent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A special pioneer tells how a certain village headman refused to permit him to call on the people in the village in the house-to-house witness work. The brother took him before the big chief, and on the set day the headman (who is also a church elder) turned up with a large crowd of fellow elders and deacons to give him some support. Before commencing proceedings the chief called the brother to him and suggested that he go around offering his literature to those in attendance. This the brother did, placing five books and twelve booklets. Then the chief allowed the headman to explain why he refused the brother the right to approach the people in his village. When he had finished the chief said: “I am a Mohammedan and I’m surprised to see you who profess to be a Christian opposing another in the preaching of your message. I order that you leave him alone to continue with his preaching wherever he wants.” The chief then invited the brother to hold a public meeting at his own court, thereby putting a stop to any further opposition from his village headmen. He helped to advertise the meeting himself; so it was well attended and the brother placed an additional fourteen booklets with the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark306"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark307"></a>PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In September, 1953, the police at Luabo rounded up five brothers from their homes and sent them to Lou-renco Marques, where they remained in jail until August, 1954, with no charge ever being brought against them. While in jail those of them who knew only a little Portuguese soon improved in that language and were able to join in giving a good witness to the seventy other inmates there. Songs, Bible discourses and discussions went on almost daily, and now that the brothers have been deported to San Tome Island off the east coast of Africa they will be able to do even more witnessing to the people there. Correspondence addressed to the authorities in the territory is never replied to, so there is nothing that can be done to alleviate the lot of our brothers under these conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Elsewhere in that territory literature sent to some brothers was seized and the brothers were questioned for three days on the Bible. Eventually, the responsible officer told them that he was keeping their literature but letting them return to their homes, where they are still preaching.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark308"></a>PAKISTAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The economic situation in Pakistan is very serious. Famines were caused as widespread floods washed out the rice fields; but those in the truth in Pakistan recall the words of Jesus: “So never be anxious and say: ‘What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?’ or, ‘What are we to put on?’ For all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing. For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things. Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness.” Our Pakistani brothers have done this, and the past year has shown excellent progress in the gathering of the other sheep. It is hard going, and you will appreciate this in the experiences the branch servant relates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of being a Moslem country, Pakistan presents problems peculiar to such lands. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Purdah,</span><span class="font7"> or female segregation, gives birth to the immense problem of how to contact persons of good will among Moslem women. How would you feel, for example, to receive the following letter. “Sir, I am an Muslim girl and I don’t know well English. I am a matric student so please don't laugh at my English. I am much interested in Christianity. I don’t even know why I like English New Testament and Bible. I thing you don’t mind to send me these four pocket-size tracts. Sir, don’t show anyone that an Muslim girl send a letter to give these tracts, as you know this is Pakistan, and I am an Muslim girl.” Yes, we found a way to contact her. But what about millions of her sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is almost as difficult for Moslem men, for, while they are more easily approached, yet for them to show sympathy for Christianity and to begin to change their views means at best a religious boycott, at worst death at the hand of some ignorant fanatic. It is difficult, but not impossible, as demonstrated by a Moslem youth recently. A sincere love for Jehovah can make a man endure anything with smiles. And Hussain, as we shall call him, is a great smiler. As a mere lad he was searching for the truth, and having become dissatisfied with Islam was investigating Christianity. He went into the local Bible house, and was being tutored in the mystery of the “trinity,” when a Watch Tower missionary came in and began his sermon. Very soon the missionary was refuting all arguments in support of the “trinity,” and Hussain, impressed, arranged for a study. There the trouble began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">His father, learning of his interests, whisked him away to another town, but, soon after, he met another witness of Jehovah there and resumed his studies. This resulted in his being turned out of his home. Now came a series of experiences that would have quenched a less valiant spirit. With no possessions but a bedding roll, a cycle and a few changes of clothing, he set out for Karachi. With little money and fewer friends, his home became the pavements. He knew the Society’s branch office address, but for fear of being mistaken for a “rice-Christian” he determined not to visit there until he was in good standing. Obtaining no suitable employment he hired himself as a coolie—a most degrading step for any educated Pakistani. A Moslem “friend” relieved him of his bedding, cycle and clothing. As his garments got dirtier and hair and beard longer, he looked more and more the coolie he was acting. Then his health gave way under the strain, and he had to change his work for something less strenuous. He was insulted, abused and beaten, but hung on to what little hope of the new world he had learned. Once while being beaten he stood there meekly, tears running down his cheeks, but not trying to defend himself, for had he not read in “The Book” when smitten on one cheek to turn the other? At last in poor health, penniless, jobless, unshaven, friendless, filthy, clothed in rags and the concrete sidewalk his bed, his affairs changed. He obtained employment, was given a meal, a change o£ clothes and a haircut. He felt like restored Job. Now Hussain, with a smile that seems permanently hooked on his two ears, walked into the branch office and told his story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In closing this report, a word of appreciation for the wonderful little booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Basis for Belief in a New World </span><span class="font7">is appropriate. It is the most powerful aid we in pagan lands have ever had to aid us bridge the gap that separates the Moslem mind from the truth. We now long to receive the Urdu edition of this booklet.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark309"></a>PANAMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in Panama have good reason to rejoice. During the 1954 service year 110 persons symbolized their dedication to do Jehovah’s will by water immersion. The publishers there reached new peaks well over the ten and twenty per cent goals they were striving for. There is still much work to be done in Panama, and by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness the ministers of the New World society will continue to press forward and reach out into the isolated territories. This they have been doing with excellent success. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences, and a few are related here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have had wonderful success in showing the film “The New World Society in Action.&quot; We are planning on showing it to all our congregations and isolated interest. Up to the end of August a total of 3,354 persons had seen this film. In a small town where there are only seven publishers, 500 came to see it. In another small congregation of about nine publishers, 172 saw the film. The week after the film was shown in the congregation sixteen showed up for group witnessing. That same month this congregation reached a peak of 21 publishers. The circuit servant writes: “It has been a real joy to have the privilege of showing the Society’s Him to the congregations in the interior. Many are the expressions of appreciation of the brothers who before had little idea of the magnitude of Jehovah’s New World society. Several people of good will, after actually seeing what they had been told about the love and unity among all of Jehovah’s people, regardless of race, color or nationality, are now convinced that they, too, want</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">to belong to the New World family. Even persons who before knew nothing about the work are now keenly interested in learning about it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The new arrangement for vacation pioneers has been wonderful for those who had not been able to pioneer before. So far this year twenty publishers have become vacation pioneers, the highest number we have ever had. Five of these twenty have now further expanded their ministry by becoming regular pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have a great amount of unassigned rural territory in the interior of the country, so we wrote circular letters to all the congregations and pioneers and sent them a list of these territories. Many responded to this call. One pioneer sister has a group of islands located in the Gulf of Panama for a territory assignment. After four months there she had helped eight new publishers to participate in the Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In one of the units in Panama City a publisher bought a station wagon to be used by that unit to work in the territory. Twice each week a group of about eight from that unit goes out in the service, and they have worked about sixty miles of territory, composed of about a dozen small towns, with great success. In one of these towns they met an interested person who had charge of collecting money to build a Catholic church. Several years ago he had delivered the sum of $6,000 to the local priest for its construction, but today they have just eight concrete pillars standing forlornly in the town square to show for the $6,000. As a result he is no longer a Catholic and many people in the town are getting their eyes open because of the priest’s perfidy,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark310"></a>PARAGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Though there has been opposition, Jehovah’s witnesses have moved ahead in Paraguay. Brother Henschel visited Paraguay last year and, at the time, opposition was so strong that a hall could not be obtained, but this did not stop the delivery of the public talk. The Catholic Church has not let up since then, believing they can break down the organization of Jehovah’s witnesses, but the harder they work the more people of good will leave their organization and ally themselves with the New World society. The branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences about what is going on in Paraguay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With six new missionaries we have been able to open up a new missionary home in Encarnacion, one of the larger towns of Paraguay. This has proved to be a great help to the congregation there, which was previously averaging six or seven publishers each month. During the past four months since the arrival of the missionaries, it has averaged fifteen publishers each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of the brothers responded well to the isolated territory campaign, especially the Asuncion congregation. There practically every week end a large group of publishers, sometimes up to fifty, went out into the isolated territory. Many books and Bibles were placed, much to the annoyance of the Catholic priests in these small towns. At times they threatened Jehovah’s witnesses in an effort to get them to leave, but when this did not work sometimes they went around personally to warn the people and to try to collect the literature that had been placed or instruct the people to burn it. This only tended to make the people more curious and showed them that the priest was not such a Christian gentleman after all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The circuit servant wrote the following while visiting one of the congregations. “This morning the brother and I started off at 6:30 a.m. with three new publishers to witness along the highway leading into the small village of Capitan Sosa. At 10:30 a.m. we stopped at the river, where we gave the baptismal discourse and two of the new publishers were baptized, a young brother and his wife. The other brother decided to wait a little longer and then be baptized with his wife. From there we continued working until we arrived at the village. By the time we had finished the village, the three new publishers were working alone for the first time and placing literature. They were really thrilled about this. That day they had worked eight hours without stopping. That same night the brother and sister who had been immersed asked for a pioneer form; so it is possible that they may pioneer soon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One congregation had worked all week peacefully advertising the public talk for the following Sunday afternoon. They assembled to continue this work on the Sunday morning, when in walked the local priest. He roughly demanded to see the police permit for the public talk, and after reading it said we should also have permission from the bishop. Reasoning that the priest was just trying to hinder them from their preaching activity, the police were sent for to settle the matter. After stating that he had more authority than the police, he said he would be back to interrupt the talk. True to his word, in he walked about fifteen minutes before the talk was to begin, not by himself this time, but with about one hundred men. Shouting and laughing they said, “We have come to stop you from telling lies to the people.” A discussion on Bible subjects began with the priest trying to cover his ignorance of the Bible by talking in Latin. This did not avail him much, because soon his own people demanded that he talk in their language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Instead of this unlawful action’s hindering the work of Jehovah’s witnesses as was the desire ofthepriest.it has had the opposite effect. It has served to strengthen the publishers and the people of good will in the congregation. The next day on the street many were heard discussing among themselves whether such doctrines as the purgatory were really true.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark311"></a>PERU</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">When there is more activity in Jehovah’s service there is more joy and happiness on the part of his witnesses. Peru has experienced a very prosperous year in the gathering of the other sheep and the ministers of the good news are filled with joy. A number of changes were made in Peru recently by shifting missionaries from one part of the country to the other. Great appreciation of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awahe!</span><span class="font8"> was shown on the part of the brothers by their increased distribution of the magazines. This is playing an important part in the work of preparing the field for further activity. The year has been filled with exciting events for Jehovah’s witnesses. New fields have been opened, and the branch servant reports some fine experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As we look back over the year, one of the things that helped the work greatly was your visit, Brother Knorr, accompanied by Brother Henschel. At the assembly in December, 1953, the brothers seemed to get a greater appreciation of Jehovah’s organization and of the necessity of maintaining a close, active association with it. This outlook, coupled with the training program that has been carried on by all the congregations and publishers in isolated parts, has borne fruit, resulting in a series of new peaks in publishers, and determined steps by many toward greater maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some people accept the truth quickly, but others are slower, some being impressed at first by the organization and the spirit that exists among the brothers. One pioneer sister showed this to one of her home Bible studies. She had studied with the lady for a long time, and the truth did not appear to be taking hold in her mind. So at last the pioneer said: “Look! I know of a method whereby you will be able to learn the Bible more quickly. You come with me in our work of teaching others, and you will find it a great help.” So the lady started going out in the service. Naturally, she also attended all the meetings in the Kingdom Hall; and, consequently, she made progress. She was baptized a few months later, and continues to make good progress, learning while she teaches others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the whole, the brothers throughout the country are becoming more and more adept in placing literature and obtaining subscriptions. There has been a great increase in the amount of literature placed this year over the year before, and such plays an important part in preaching the good news. This experience written in by a pioneer sister emphasizes the point. She says: “I was witnessing from house to house one </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">fiesta</span><span class="font7"> day in July when I met a man outside his home. I began to preach to him; but he interrupted me and began to preach to me, teiling me ‘there is no hell-fire, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sehorita.’</span><span class="font7"> After listening to him for a while I asked, ‘How do you know there is no hell-fire?’ At this point he invited me into his home and explained that originally he and his whole family had been members of the Pentecostal church, but after reading a booklet that a friend had given him they had all left that organization. And what was the booklet that he had read? Why, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Joy of All the People.</span><span class="font7"> A study was quickly arranged with the entire family. It is a pleasure to study with them, for all are keen Bible lovers and have a desire to become witnesses of Jehovah and so serve him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The two magazines </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> in Spanish are playing a large part in helping many people find the way to everlasting life. One experience follows: “A </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font7"> book was placed with a lady and a study commenced later. Eventually she subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazine, only to find that the copies began to disappear from her house soon after their arrival, sometimes before she had had time to read them. When the subscription ran out and the magazines stopped coming, her mother took her to task as to where the magazines were. Yes, it was she who had taken them, and, although an ardent Catholic with images all around the house, she had begun to appreciate many facts about the Bible, and the images began to be thrown away. Her daughter saw to it that I met the mother, and I was able to start a study with her, using the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font7"> book. The first chapter that she wanted to study was ‘The Use of Images in Worship.’ Although many images had already disappeared, she still had a picture under which burned a small light. After we finished the study of the chapter, I noted that the light had been extinguished, a sign that the true light had begun to burn in her heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The mother is sixty-seven years old and says that she has entered into a period of happiness such as she has never known before. She says, ‘If I live four or five more years, they will be the happiest years of my life, because now I know the truth.’ Inwardly it is her hope to be one of the happy Armageddon survivors.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark312"></a>PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The sound counsel that was given at the New World Society Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in New York was echoed at the district assemblies later in the Philippine Islands. The brothers there appreciate that it is not for them to be independent and carry on individualistic conduct among Jehovah’s people, but all must be at unity and see alike. There is certainly love and appreciation of the systems of things Jehovah has organized, and the brothers in the islands are sincerely trying now to live as a New World society. With one voice they say: “For Jehovah is our judge, Jehovah is our lawgiver, Jehovah is our king; he will save us.” The New World society in the Philippines has had an outstanding year, and they show great respect for the theocratic organization. The branch servant sends through a very interesting report and some of the high lights are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A man visiting in Batangas casually picked up one of the Society’s publications in a boardinghouse. The owner had obtained it from one of Jehovah’s witnesses but was not interested. The visitor read it through and became very much interested. Later he heard about the district assembly in Manila and he came all alone to attend it. He was quite impressed. Later he heard about a circuit assembly in Lucena, Quezon. He went to it and took two of his friends. He interviewed the circuit servant and asked for help. Now a pioneer is helping him and his two friends to witness in his own home town. It pays to leave some literature in every home if possible. Someone may read it even though the householder is not interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The mayor of Loreto, Davao, heard about Jehovah’s witnesses. He traveled nearly two hundred miles down the Agusan River to attend a district assembly in Bu-tuan City. Conversing with the branch servant he said: “I heard about you people only recently. I was so favorably impressed that I came to see with my own eyes whether all I heard was true. It is all true. Here is an organization of true Christian unity and peace. I request that you send representatives to Loreto to teach my people how to live the way you live. I will gather the people and will do all the oral translating for you.” Arrangements were made on the spot to have publishers go in to this remote territory and help the people of Loreto through oral teaching in public gatherings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two graduates of Gilead opened up the work on the island of Palawan this past year. Already they have seven other publishers working with them, where there were no publishers a year ago. Four other graduates opened up the work in Zamboanga City and Basilan City. They have six other publishers working with them now. The two graduates in Cebu City have a flourishing congregation of 144 publishers after four years of intensive training. There was no congregation when they started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have a lot of work to do here yet. Our chief work is to train these many thousands of new ministers to be more efficient in their service activity. The Society’s training is designed for this very purpose. It is now under way in the Philippines, but we have a lot of improvements to make to bring the whole organization up to the requirements that Jehovah has made clear to his ministers of today. By his undeserved kindness the next year of service will be better than the one just completed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark313"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Reports have come through regularly from Poland during the past service year, and we can certainly rejoice with our brothers in this totalitarian land behind the Iron Curtain. They are faithfully serving Jehovah God and are having many interesting experiences. The report from Poland shows a great increase in the number who have forsaken Babylon and come into the New World society to find safety. From time to time new waves of persecution come up against Jehovah’s witnesses. The secret police are constantly trying to ferret them out so as to stop their preaching. It can be reported that their preaching runs into millions of hours spent talking to others about the good message of Jehovah’s kingdom. We rejoice with our brothers in Poland and are happy they are standing firm, still able to gather the other sheep and give them the important knowledge that leads to life. From reports that have come in the following can be published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In spite of all the persecution and opposition the truth continues its triumphal march throughout Poland. One report comes in: “One evening as I came in from a study I heard voices in one of the houses I was passing. I approached the house and looked curiously in through the window. I noticed there was a Catholic Rosary meeting. One of the persons was just readingchapter twelve of Revelation. Someone asked who the woman was of whom the chapter spoke. The person conducting the meeting said it was Mary. Some of those who were present did not seem to believe this. After this they started talking about the cult of images. I took courage, entered the house, and was able to give a thorough witness to all those present. The result of this was that I was able to start home Bible studies with four persons who attended that meeting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the other hand, two sisters, because of faithfully preaching the good news, were sentenced to four years in prison. The same sentence was pronounced on two other sisters by the same court. Word comes through from Poland that “we are very happy to belong to the New World society, the nucleus of the new earth. We are glad to know all about the new heavens and the new earth in which righteousness is to dwell.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark314"></a>PORTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">As we look back over the past year we find that our brothers in Portugal are taking on more congregation responsibilities. Attendance at the regular Bible study centers has improved considerably and those who have associated themselves with the New World society are growing to maturity. The publishers are now better trained and equipped, and they are having good success in preaching the good news in Portugal. The experiences are quite interesting and show how the New World society is growing in this land. The branch that is organized there looks after Portugal, the Azores and Madeira. Excerpts from these reports are published here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here is the story of a young lady whose life has been transformed by the message of Jehovah’s kingdom. She hails from the city of Luanda, Angola (Portuguese West Africa), but was in Lisbon taking a higher technical course. She had lost faith in false religion and had been drawn into a round of pleasure, dances, cinemas, smoking and, out of curiosity, had even begun to dabble in “black magic.” One night she had such a horrible nightmare that she felt ill next day. A fellow student noticed her pale cheeks and downcast looks and casually invited her to attend a home Bible study with Jehovah’s witnesses. The young lady went and was enthused right from the start. She obtained the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True” </span><span class="font7">in Portuguese and in the flyleaf wrote these words: “May this book bring me, Lord Jehovah, the light that my bedarkened soul needs so badly, so as to make me very soon one of your true servants.” Her prayer was answered. Three weeks later she started in house-to-house work and before long became one of the most active and competent publishers of the Lisbon congregation. She is now back in South-West Africa, planting and watering the first seeds of Kingdom truth in Luanda, her home town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But not all accept the truth as quickly as that. As a contrast there is a case of a married couple who were visited five years ago by some publishers. A home Bible study was started with the husband, but the wife, a sincere and ardent Catholic, raised objections and the study was stopped. However, the husband continued to read privately, and occasionally, with true feminine curiosity, the wife would have a peep too. It took years, but finally they both embraced the truth and were baptized a few months ago. They are among the most active and zealous of the Lisbon witnesses. The wife, after her own experience, is especially patient with Catholics who at first show opposition but seem sincere.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark315"></a>AZORES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It is difficult to engage in the open house-to-house work, due to fanaticism of the almost entirely Catholic population. However, we are pleased to report that at least some headway has been made in this respect. On the main island of Pico there is a nice little group established. They hold regular meetings and let the Kingdom light shine in this remote corner. When a traveling representative of the Society visited them a few months ago they were all in good spirits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were 34 in attendance at the Memorial celebration. This is a considerable improvement for meeting attendance. During one month they hit a peak of 26 publishers. Yes, from letters and reports received we see the New World society is established on these rocky little islands of the Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MADEIRA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses have made a start here too in their work of bringing comfort to the good-will folks. One full-time pioneer from the United States is busy here. Recently his efforts were rewarded with a few new persons taking their stand. He arrived in the island at the beginning of the year, but by April he had already found several prospective “sheep.” For the Memorial celebration there were twenty-one present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before the close of the service year we received reports indicating that some have progressed to the point of publishing. Now there is a group of four Kingdom publishers in this island.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark316"></a>PUERTO RICO</span></h2>
<p><a name="bookmark317"></a><span class="font8">This island in the Caribbean has always been a place where it has been easy to place a lot of literature. But Jehovah’s witnesses are not only interested in placing books for people to study; they are also interested in making back-calls and conducting home Bible studies. This is a Catholic territory, but it is found that Catholics are seeking the truth just as much as anyone else in the world. Sometimes Jehovah’s witnesses are treated with meanness and disrespect by the Catholic Church when people leave the church, for it has been proved time and again, especially in Latin-American countries, that Catholics do not want the people to read the Bible and become acquainted with its contents. But the ministerial work of Jehovah’s witnesses goes on to bring life to those who will listen and believe. The branch servant of Puerto Rico gives a report also on the islands of Tortola, St. Croix and St. Thomas. Here are some experiences from these islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The work in unassigned territory during the summer of 1953 gave a huge witness, and we have been able to see the results of this activity during the past year. The Santurce unit had worked the small town of Corozal and had given Bible lectures in the town square. The local priest became infuriated and tried to interrupt the lectures by turning his own sound equipment on full blast to drown out the Bible lecture that was being given peaceably nearby. This action on the part of the priest caused a young woman, who was already studying the Bible with one of the missionaries, to take her stand firmly for the Kingdom. It is the custom of the church in that section to leave an image of the virgin in the homes of the people for a few days and then receive a donation. The young woman learned that she was on the list to receive the image; so she wrote to the one in charge not to bring the image, that she did not believe in it any more. The good Catholics were horrified. It was sacrilege against the virgin, plain and pure. Two priests visited her to make her see the error of her way, but to no avail. She was like a rock. Then they organized a meeting to be held in a neighboring house and placed the loud-speaker on the roof. In this way they could inform the whole neighborhood that they should not visit this terrible woman without their permission, and if any of her “Communist” friends came to their door they should accept nothing from them, and that they should use violence if necessary. All of this only served to strengthen the young woman, and she is now conducting her own Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The populace on the tiny island of Vieques was visited again this past summer by ten publishers, and in two short days they placed the astounding total of 240 books and 500 booklets. Many of the people, while not coming in contact with the witnesses often, listen to the radio programs that are broadcast regularly over five different radio stations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya (The Watchtower)</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">iDespertad! (Awake!)</span><span class="font7"> are becoming well known by almost all Puerto Ricans. The distribution of the two magazines has increased tremendously. The publishers are now giving shorter testimonies, but more to the point, and are having wonderful success. Instead of averaging two magazines per publisher per week, as suggested by the Society, they averaged better than three magazines per publisher per week. The total of magazines placed last year was 121,269. Many more people are receiving the magazines in their homes through subscriptions. Over 6,000 new subscribers were added to those who were already subscribing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark318"></a>VIRGIN ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This past year will be </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> memorable one for many of the brothers in the Virgin Islands, due to the fact that they had one of the most unique assemblies that has ever been held. Brother Milton Henschel was scheduled to visit the Virgin Islands in April and the boat “Faith” was in that area too. The first part of April was set as the time for the assembly. Since there were only five brothers on the island and such few facilities there for caring for large groups of persons, most of the equipment, foodstuffs and the people had to be transported from the island of St. Thomas to Tortola by the “Faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The assembly was a great success and had a very good effect on the persons of good will in Tortola. There were three persons baptized and the following month seven publishers reported. The work in St. Croix and St. Thomas, while not producing more publishers, is of higher quality and the publishers who are active are becoming more firmly grounded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pioneer brother who was in Tortola had the following experience while doing street work: As he was standing offering the magazines, he noticed that a woman was watching him intently. When he approached her she said, “I am one.” “One?” he asked. “I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” She had been living over on the east end of the island, so he had not previously met her. The brother supplied her with some of the latest literature and she returned to her home. A week later she wrote him a letter stating that she intended to continue as a witness and wanted to know when she could be baptized and how she could receive </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> regularly. Thus the other sheep are coming forth from every part and are asking to go along to worship Jehovah, because they recognize that Jehovah is with his witnesses.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark319"></a>ROMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Word comes through that our fellow servants in Romania are still very busy studying the Word of God. While there is a strict censorship of mail, still communications do reach other countries telling of the joy our brothers there have in serving Jehovah God even though they meet much opposition. Some have been imprisoned during the year because of their faithful service, but despite this the New World society is having a good ingathering of the other sheep. They have informed us that there was a “good harvest,” and they are well satisfied with what they have. We know from the number preaching the good news of the Kingdom that progress is being made, and our brothers do rejoice in the success they are having. Jehovah’s name is being honored in the land. Our brothers come together and study, inciting one another to love and right works. They are not showing fear in the face of their enemies. While they are very careful about their activity, still they are not afraid of the evil tidings, because their hearts are fixed on Jehovah and trusting in him. They are looking forward to better days when they will enjoy the association with their brothers in all parts of the world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark320"></a>SIERRA LEONE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">It appears from the report of the branch servant in Sierra Leone that people in that part of the world are great readers of the Bible and they enjoy having that book in their homes. The people are very familiar with the Bible and often when a missionary starts to quote a scripture they will finish it for him. We are told that the people in Sierra Leone generally recognize that education is quite essential, but the missionaries and those in Jehovah’s organization realize that as far as education is concerned a knowledge of Jehovah God is the essential thing, because that is education that will lead to everlasting life. There is much more work to be done in Sierra Leone, and those who are dedicated to Jehovah God are trying to the best of their ability to preach the Word in this country. The branch servant gives us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our first vacation pioneer was a sister of 66. She had a two-month vacation, so decided to spend it wisely in Jehovah’s service. She traveled to some of the villages in the interior or “upline,” as it is called, and, finding interested people, placed 51 books, 165 booklets, 143 magazines and obtained one subscription, besides making 72 return visits, To travel from village to village in the interior means one must ride in a lorry or truck, often without a seat. The drivers travel fast over the rough narrow roads and so the passengers are tired, shaken up and often ill at the end of the journey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the past year the Society’s instructions concerning keeping the organization clean did not meet with the approval of some publishers who wished to continue living in the loose worldly manner of immorality. Consequently a shaking process developed in which some left the theocratic organization and were swallowed up in old-world living. In two recently formed congregations there was a drop of well over fifty per cent in publishers. But this does not cause discouragement, because, in Jehovah’s organization, it is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">quality </span><span class="font7">that counts, and not quantity. There are still a few of the brothers who think the Society should consult them on organizational matters, and question the action taken to keep the organization clean. But in general there is a much better theocratic spirit in the congregations now, and fewer publishers have accomplished more this year. There has been a marked improvement in book, magazine and subscription placements as well as in hours, back-calls and public meetings during the 1954 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is not unusual for one of the missionaries to be stopped in a public building and asked to settle a Bible question under discussion among the employees. They are glad for the Bible answer. It is a common sight to see the educated member of a family reading and explaining to his friends and relatives who are unable to read what the Bible teaches through the aid of Watch Tower literature. Often local preachers get their material for sermons out of the Society's Bible helps. One such preacher said: “I have used the book called </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Prophecy</span><span class="font7"> many times as the basis for my sermons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Do you have any more to help prepare sermons?” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font7"> is very popular with some of the clergymen, and a number subscribe for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark321"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark322"></a>SINGAPORE AND MALAYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">One of the biggest problems in Singapore and the Malay States is to bring the publishers to maturity. It takes time to train them, but, by seeing to it that they attend the meetings and study with Jehovah’s people, and then with the mature ones helping the weaker and inexperienced in the field service, advancement has been made. The branch reports that the publisher training program has been a timely provision and that the regular visits of the circuit servant have made possible good progress in developing house-to-house preachers. The local brothers are now capable of delivering interesting sermons at the doors. Wherever seed is sown throughout the land it eventually sprouts and brings forth fruit. Some of the experiences set forth by the branch servant show that seed has been planted; and even though some of it has had very little watering, the increase has come through Jehovah’s guidance and direction. There is still a lot of work to be done in this territory of Singapore, the Malay States and North Borneo. The branch servant sets out some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A young Ceylonese fellow who was a devout Buddhist and the founding president of the Buddhist Union in Kuala Lumpur has now joyfully accepted the truth. He practiced Yoga and even healed a number of sick persons by that power. Having had some knowledge of the Bible from boyhood, he began to realize that his religion was drawing too much attention to himself and not enough to God. Consequently he went to different “Christian” churches, but everywhere he went he heard them speaking against Jehovah’s witnesses. This led him to approach one of the witnesses whom he located in a coffee shop. After only a few studies this meek person recognized the truth and joyfully accompanied the circuit servant in the house-to-house ministry. His joy is brimming over. Being well known by his community in the city, he has already made contacts with people of good will with whom he has discussed the Kingdom message. In order to gain further knowledge and training he has given free lodging to the special pioneer brother and now looks forward to the next assembly in Singapore. So the false religionists by denouncing Jehovah’s witnesses are also helping in the gathering work, as the Scriptures state: “We can do nothing against the truth, but only for the truth.” —2 Cor. 13:8, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Even into the deep dark jungle of Malaya the rays of truth have penetrated. A soldier fighting terrorists with the security forces obtained a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Way Is Love</span><span class="font7"> from a friend. As a Catholic he was greatly impressed by the truths he learned, all backed up by the Catholic Bible. He wrote to Singapore for more literature, and, after reading through </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True’’,</span><span class="font7"> became convinced of the truth. Everyone, including the Catholic padre, tried to dissuade him from becoming one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Said the cleric, “You don’t know much about Catholic doctrine, do you?” “Whose fault is that?” countered the brother. The padre promised to come back again to have a Scriptural discussion but failed to turn up. An opportunity came for the brother to return to England and go back to civilian life. There he plans to continue as a soldier for Jehovah God and his King Christ Jesus. —2 Tim. 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Seed sown by missionaries in the island city of Penang three years ago, before they were sent out of the country by the authorities, has brought forth fruit. Two fifteen-year-old girls made a study of the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font7"> and from it came to a knowledge of the truth. They write to the Society, and it is a great joy to receive their theocratic letters, excerpts from which follow: “Upon receiving your letter my friend Y--- and I have been made very joyful by</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">the assurance that we may rely on your help in our pursuit to understand Jehovah’s purposes.” “We rejoice in learning of you. You know, I prayed and prayed that I might meet one of Jehovah’s witnesses one day. You know whether my prayer has been answered or not. When I received the first letter from you my cup overflowed and overflowed.” Although isolated and opposed by their parents, who are Buddhist, these youthful prais-ers of Jehovah are doing marvelous work as they have distributed some literature and are endeavoring to start home Bible studies with their school friends. The circuit servant has been able to visit them and explain many things about the New World society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark323"></a>NORTH BORNEO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">“Pay attention to . . . all the flock, among which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers, to shepherd the congregation of God.” To the extent that overseers carry out this divine instruction, to that extent the congregations prosper, growing in number and maturity. This seems to be the reason for the lack of increase in Borneo. The servant in the congregation there did not take the proper oversight because of secular ties, and consequently the organization has not prospered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two sisters have been regularly engaged in preaching the good news, and they have devoted good hours in the field and conducted back-calls and home Bible studies with interested persons. Only by making back-calls on the “sheep” can the hireling “shepherds” be kept from fleecing those who belong in the Right Shepherd’s fold of other sheep.—John 10:10-16.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark121"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark324"></a>SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">A number of problems arise in South Africa. The witnessing must be carried on among the Afrikaners, who are staunch advocates of the Dutch Reformed Church and Afrikaner nationalism. Then there are the Bantus with their deep-seated paganism, superstition and frequent illiteracy. Preaching to the “Coloured” South Africans presents its own problem. The Indians of subtropical Natal have their false religions, which present a barrier to the preaching of the good news. It takes much preaching and many good deeds on the part of Christians to overcome the ideas in the Indians’ minds concerning their Hindu and Moslem religions. Jehovah’s witnesses have worked diligently during the past twelve months among all kinds of men and with good success. Truly the message of the Kingdom goes to all nations, kindreds and tongues. The branch servant in South Africa makes reports on the work in Angola, Basutoland, Bechuanaland, Madagascar, Mauritius, St. Helena and Swaziland. Portions of his reports on these lands follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Publishers throughout the land report that house-to-house work has become much more interesting since they began using the three- to eight-minute sermons at the doors. It is like a complete new type of work, and the results are wonderful. Placements have increased and a much better witness is given. To give just one example: a small town was assigned to a congregation a year ago in the unassigned territory work. They covered the town from one end to the other and placed just one bound book. Since then this town was assigned to two farm congregations. These congregations were very pessimistic about working it, but they were encouraged to prepare three- to eight-minute sermons and to select good talking points in the literature to point out to the people. The results were unbelievable. By the time three quarters of the town was covered more than 60 bound books were placed, with many promising back-calls to be followed up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The unassigned territory campaign was entered into with enthusiasm, and real joy was experienced in feeding the truth-hungry people in many isolated dorps. One of the most remarkable incidents this year was the case of a man and his wife who have had truth literature for the past twenty-three years, but, apart from casual witnessing that was never reported, they never got down to house-to-house work. This year when two missionaries took them along in the unassigned territory campaign they were amazed at this man’s logical and able presentations as they went from house to house. Of course he was only using, with Jehovah’s help, the knowledge he had gained from twenty-three years’ study of the Society’s publications. All he needed was some help in channeling his witnessing abilities into the most effective field, the house-to-house ministry. The unassigned territory campaign provided the opportunity. Now we have another zealous house-to-house publisher, the nucleus of a new congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year an effort was made to strengthen the literacy classes. Progress is slow, but diligent efforts continue to be made by those who appreciate the importance and value of being able to read and write. Those who have made the efforts are reaping the benefits in their ministry and are becoming more efficient preachers of the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All over the country employers of non-European labor are learning that their best and most loyal servants are Jehovah’s witnesses. Said one principal of a school after enthusing over the increased efficiency of his servants since their contact with the truth: “I can tell almost instantly when one of them is becoming careless about attending the meetings. His work loses some of the efficiency which I have come to expect from Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark325"></a>ANGOLA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During the past six months we have received letters from several persons in southern Angola. They have written for literature in the Portuguese and French languages. In response to our queries they have given us a most remarkable account of their experiences in recent years, during which time we have had no previous contact with them. Early in 1943 a man in the Belgian Congo formed a choir consisting of twelve persons. The choir grew until there were 500 members. In 1946 the leader of this choir was invited to attend an international conference of Protestant missionaries. At this conference he learned for the first time about the Society and its work. As he was eager to get a complete knowledge of the kingdom of God, the only hope for mankind, he obtained the Society’s address at Brooklyn and wrote for literature at the beginning of 1949. In response ho received </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Children, Joy of All the People</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From that time he began teaching the contents of these books to his choir members and then, in July, 1949, a number of those who had accepted the Kingdom message began to preach the good news in Leopoldville, capital of the Belgian Congo. The religious organizations, with which they were still associated, immediately sought means in conjunction with the Belgian government to put a stop to their preaching. In October of that year the leader and all who participated with him in the proclamation of the Kingdom were arrested. After an imprisonment of two and a half months they were deported to their homeland of Angola, where they arrived in January, 1950. Apparently they were not permitted to return to their homes and all of them were interned. The leader was separated from the others, but no matter what action was taken to discourage them they kept on preaching. In course of time they were sent to different towns throughout Angola. As they have had opportunity they have preached, and our correspondents inform us that there are now 1,000 individuals claiming to be Jehovah’s witnesses in Angola.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BASUTOLAND</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark326"></a><span class="font7">Basutoland is a British Protectorate and is entirely a native reserve. European control is supervisory and the African chiefs exercise much power. Polygamy is practised by the chiefs, and as each son becomes a chief when he reaches maturity there are many chiefs. Many of these chiefs are friendly to the Christian work of Jehovah’s witnesses. They permit the witnesses to hold their public meetings in their </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Khotlas</span><span class="font7"> (where their councils meet). They themselves frequently attend and evince interest in the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One young girl of sixteen took her stand during the year. Her parents tried to prevent her accepting the truth, but without success. They then enlisted the cooperation of the minister, who told her she could serve God just as well by remaining in the church of her father. But from her studies the young girl had learned that Christ taught his followers to go from house to house, and she was able to tell the minister that the church did not follow that example. The minister then said that if she wanted her name taken off the church roll she must come to church the following Sunday and make a public statement to that effect. He thought this would frighten the girl. When she turned up he announced that one of the members had been deceived by false prophets and wished to make a statement. The young girl then gave her testimony to the entire congregation, and stated her reasons for leaving the church. At the next circuit assembly she was immersed. After her immersion she went to stay with relatives and began preaching to them. Her aunt accepted the truth and was immersed at the following circuit assembly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark327"></a>BECHUANALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There are approximately 300,000 Africans in this British Protectorate and just over 2,000 Europeans, all scattered over an area of 275,000 square miles. There are eight main African tribes, the two chief ones being the Bamangwato in the north and the Bangwaketsi in the south. The people live in rudely built houses with thatched roofs. Their way of life is very primitive. In most huts there is not even a single piece of furniture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is somewhat more freedom in the northern part of the country, and the brothers in that part do not have the same strong opposition with which to contend. All the brothers in Bechuanaland, although still very immature, are quite determined to preach the good news of Jehovah’s established kingdom, even without the Bible helps provided by the Society. They are learning to use the Bible alone as they go from house to house and are trying hard to develop interesting short sermons to awaken interest in the new world of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When one thinks of the hardships under which our brothers in Bechuanaland labor and the lack of literature, one cannot but admire their zeal and boldness in carrying forward the work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark328"></a>MADAGASCAR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In 1933 two pioneers from the Union of South Africa visited the island. During the month they were there they witnessed in the two main towns, obtaining subscriptions for the magazines and placing upward of 1,000 books and booklets. Since that year there have been occasional enquiries from Europeans who have been desirous of obtaining some of the literature published by the Society, but there has been no evidence of anyone's desiring to engage actively in the Kingdom work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the past service year, however, we have been in correspondence with a sister who went to Madagascar from France and who nad an understanding of the truth before she went there. This sister introduced the truth to several other women and carried on home Bible studies with them as she had opportunity. Both of these women have now accepted the truth and are desirous of continuing their studies. We hope their interest will continue to develop and that they in turn will become publishers of the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom. Unfortunately the sister who passed on the truth to them has now returned to Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of those who has recently become interested has offered to furnish accommodation for a missionary.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark329"></a>MAURITIUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The arrival of two missionaries at the beginning of the service year, bringing the total to four, justified the opening of a missionary home, and arrangements were made accordingly. The brothers found a place conveniently situated from which to serve the whole island. The fact that they do their own housekeeping, cooking, window cleaning and laundry has surprised a number of Mauritians. But it has given the missionaries an opportunity to explain that there will not be any servants in the new world; so they might as well get used to it now. The home is also the headquarters of one of the congregations and is therefore a real center of theocratic activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Arrangements were made for a circuit servant from the Union to visit the island in August. The usual program was followed in each congregation, and his visit was climaxed with a circuit assembly. This was an occasion of great blessing and happiness for all the brothers in Mauritius. It was a real spiritual uplift, and they expressed their appreciation at the close for all the help they have received from the four missionaries and the visiting circuit servant. At the public meeting 75 were present, and they listened with keen interest to the message of hope concerning the new world. Three symbolized their dedication by water immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the missionaries had an interesting experience with a Catholic couple. The woman was employed to clean the Catholic church and to ring the bell. In return she and her husband were permitted to live in a house owned by and next door to the church. The husband subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazine in French and took a number of the books. He was studious and the missionary frequently found him propped up against the side of the church reading the Society’s literature. One day the wife was away on a visit and her husband was left to ring the bell, but so preoccupied had he become with his studies that he forgot to ring the bell. This led to complications, and he had to choose between carrying on his home Bible studies or quitting the house. He chose the better part. In less than two months from the priest’s visit he was out of the house and is continuing with the studies and attending the congregation meetings. When his wife handed back the key to the priest he said: “Your husband is too intelligent to be allowed to stay in our house; he may destroy our church.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark330"></a>ST. HELENA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">House-to-house work is quite difficult. Bear in mind that there are fewer than 5,000 souls on the island, and 40 publishers call at the homes regularly. Each time they go round, the territory seems to become smaller and smaller. There is no longer any need for the publishers to introduce themselves. The decision of the householder has been made in many cases before the door is opened, if it is opened. Notices making false charges against the work have been posted in public places. Yielding to pressure from the false shepherds some have asked the brothers not to call again. Others remain indifferent, though acknowledging where the truth is to be found. But in spite of the difficulties </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font7">the brothers engage in the house-to-house work and return from it happy and always with some interesting experience to relate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The island is mountainous, the roads are poor and the brothers have no transport. After working nine hours a day at their secular work and spending two or three hours walking to and from their place of business they are still not too tired to go out and make a back-call or conduct a home Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One young couple who were having a home Bible study had their study interrupted two years ago when the owner of the home ordered the publisher out of the house and forbade him to return. Now this young couple have a home of their own, so the study has been resumed. They are both attending the congregation meetings, sharing in field service, and were immersed in August.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark331"></a>SOUTH-WEST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">One interesting experience sent in to the office concerns a young Catholic man. He attended the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study one evening, and as soon as it was over he made an effort to show where Jehovah’s witnesses were all wrong. When he found out that he did not </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">have</span><span class="font7"> a soul it was quite a revelation to him, so much so that he began telling his Catholic work mates about it and they in turn told the priest. A visit from the priest followed, but he failed to prove that man </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">has</span><span class="font7"> a soul. He relied upon the fact that he was an &quot;intelligent” man and, tapping his head, he said that his intelligence told him he </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">had</span><span class="font7"> a soul. After such a poor effort from the priest the young man got down to a regular study of the Bible. This young man appreciates his freedom and is now a regular publisher of the truth that makes him free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In another town one of the missionaries had a most encouraging experience. He encountered opposition from both a husband and wife belonging to the Dutch Reformed Church, but with the aid of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font7"> and other Society publications their difficulties about the permission of evil and the invisible presence of Christ were soon ironed out and a systematic study followed. Now the whole family has left their former religious connection. Their home is the headquarters of the local congregation. The weekly </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study is held there and each member of the family has had some part in spreading the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark332"></a>SWAZILAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">As in the case of the other two British Protectorates in this part of Africa, the wartime ban on the literature still stands. A further effort was made during the year to have this ban lifted. Representations were made to the resident commissioner and also to the paramount chief of the Swazis. The latter has read the Society’s literature and is familiar with the contents. He had many interesting questions to ask thereon and concerning our work. During the interview he assured us that he had no objection to the circulation of our literature in Swaziland. Asked why the ban was not lifted, he replied: “It is the white man’s law; he must lift it.” But when the white man is asked the same question, we are assured that “the matter is having consideration” and “we must have a common policy for all three Protectorates” and “as soon as all three Protectorates are in agreement action will be taken.” We have been given to understand that one of the three is holding out against us, and have no reason to think that it is Swaziland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers are not molested in any way as they carry forward their preaching activity. One of the circuit assemblies during the year was held at Mbabane, the capital, with the full knowledge and consent of the European officials. Of course, police boys were present with their notebooks. Their happy, smiling faces indicated that they enjoyed the proceedings as much as the 100 brothers who had come in from all parts of Swaziland for the occasion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark333"></a>SOUTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The training program goes ahead at a splendid pace in Southern Rhodesia. All of Jehovah’s people are anxious to grow to maturity and be spiritually-minded. The study of God’s Word and his organization is vital in their lives. The different assemblies they have held in Southern Rhodesia have been effective and have built up the brothers in their faith and made them stronger. A fine increase is seen in the report for this country, as many of the other sheep are being gathered. Southern Rhodesia is a hard territory to cover and many of the circuit servants must work back in the bush to teach the truths to those who are illiterate and see that those who are able to read and write take the lead in helping the others to grow in maturity and understanding. The branch servant gives us some interesting reports about what is going on down there, and he shows how the African circuit servants are aided to give better service to their brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the service year the work of the European brothers assigned to supervise the African circuit servants came to an end. The African brothers have appreciated this arrangement, and the efficiency of the circuit servants has greatly improved. As a climax to this training work, a school was held for the African circuit servants after the last of the district assemblies. Twelve of the general pioneers were also called in with a view to selecting six additional circuit servants and training the rest for the special pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fourteen special pioneers were sent out this year into isolated territories which had never before heard the good news of God’s provision for reconciliation. Their joys and blessings are reflected in the constant flow of letters bringing details of new and thrilling experiences as they search for Jehovah’s sheep. Entering a farmer’s compound to preach to the natives, a special pioneer was stopped by the farmer and forbidden to work there. Walking away down the road the special pioneer met the farmer’s “boy” and, seizing his opportunity, spoke to him about the promises of the new world. He was invited to come to his hut the following Sunday where a study was held using </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> The next Sunday twelve were present at the study, and the pioneer was invited by them to meet the Evangelist preacher at their church the following week. This resulted in the preacher’s inviting him to give a talk that morning at which 61 persons heard more about God’s kingdom, the preacher himself asking many questions and insisting that the pioneer return every week and teach them about the good things promised for obedient men in God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another special pioneer, on arriving at his assignment, reported to the local native commissioner for permission to carry on his ministry. On learning that he was from the “Watch Tower” the commissioner told him he was not wanted there and sent him under escort to the police with instructions to send him away immediately. At the police station he was questioned by the officer in charge, who eventually asked: “The Watch Tower is against the government, isn’t it?” His answer was: “No, sir. The Watch Tower is the government law-keeper, because all the things the government asks us to do forbidding to fight or to murder, to steal, to commit adultery or to bear false witness, these are the things that are preached by the Watch Tower from the Bible.” On hearing this and satisfied with the other answers given, the officer telephoned the native commissioner that the pioneer was doing a good work and should be allowed to stay. He sent him back to the native commissioner, who then gave him permission to preach wherever he liked in the area and commended him for having come to him in the first place. As a result of his faithful stand, the pioneer and his wife have had many blessings in their assignment, conducting 17 Bible studies between them during the first month.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark334"></a>SPAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The message of the Kingdom generally is warmly received by the common people of Spain. About 99 per cent of the Spanish people are nominally Roman Catholic, but many of these show themselves to be not in strict accordance with the church’s teaching, for they do not practice their religion. The clergy by their course of action have disturbed the people’s minds, especially during the Civil War. The strife and turmoil of those years are not forgotten by the people. They well remember the way priests and nuns took an active and often bloody part in some places in that wasteful struggle between the Nationalist and Republican armies. The common people of Spain, like people all over the world, are sick of war. They have had enough of racial hatred and religious strife. They would like to be able to look forward confidently to peace the way the Bible has outlined it, but their faith in the Bible has been shaken by the Catholic false shepherds. Jehovah’s witnesses in Spain, though, stand ready to help those who are truly seeking the truth and who are thirsting for knowledge of God’s will. They are active in building up the faith of the Spanish people in God’s Word. From a report by the one in charge of the work of the New World society in Spain, the following is taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is not surprising to find many people, especially in the larger cities, with a strong anticlerical feeling. Many express themselves to the effect that the church says too much but does too little. A very common expression is, “I believe in God, but not the priests.” This is often told to Jehovah’s witnesses when they have opportunity to speak about the Bible and its true teachings. The attitude of the Catholic Church toward Protestant propaganda in Spain is well known. Protestant churches may exist but Protestant propaganda may never be distributed. The Roman Catholic Church carries on a bitter campaign against any activity having to do with the disseminating of Bible truths by nonCatholics. Whatever meetings Jehovah’s witnesses have with individuals are private meetings. There are no Kingdom Halls, no public lectures are given, no circuit or national assemblies are held, no street preaching is done—in short, there is no public testimony given by Jehovah’s witnesses. This has to be so because of Spanish law, which states in article 6 of the “Fuero de los Espafioles”: “The profession and practice of the Catholic religion, which is that of the Spanish state, will enjoy official protection. No one will be interfered with in his religious beliefs nor the private exercise of his worship. No ceremonies or external manifestations will be permitted other than those of the Catholic religion.” Jehovah’s witnesses, being law-abiding, peaceful citizens, come under this legal provision. They are not trying to stir up anyone against the constituted government in Spain. They are not anarchists or Communists. Their desire is to aid persons of good will privately to learn more of the blessings of Jehovah’s lasting new world now so near at hand. Paul said that they pray that “kings and all those who are in high station” will let them “go on leading a calm and quiet life with full godly devotion and seriousness.” So, under these conditions the good news of the Kingdom is preached in the private homes of the people who want to gain a greater knowledge of Jehovah God and his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With great joy those of the New World society receive the information as set out in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font7">magazine and other publications of the Society. They are happy to have studies. There are private groups to study the magazines in small gatherings. To these meetings are invited any who are interested in the affairs of the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a joy to report that many more Christians have associated with Jehovah’s witnesses during the year and they are happy to be together in the congregation of God’s people. There are excellent prospects for rapid growth of the work in this country. Likely many who will enjoy life in the new world will come from sunny Spain.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark335"></a>SURINAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">In this Dutch settlement of Surinam the work is increasing as more persons come to a knowledge of the truth and take their stand for the Kingdom. There has been a fine increase in the number of persons engaging in the ministerial work, and for this increase all of Jehovah’s witnesses there rejoice. The Society has been trying for some time to get more missionaries into Surinam and has succeeded in gaining entry for one more missionary, who will be taking up his work there. Even without the desired missionary assistance, though, the local congregation publishers and pioneers are zealously working to get the message to all parts of the land. The branch servant gives us a brief report of what has gone on there in the way of experiences during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Your visit to Surinam with Brother Henschel in January was something for which we have become increasingly grateful in the months since, because of the benefits your suggestions have brought about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The special pioneers you had assigned to the two towns of Coronie and Moengo have been at work for about six months now. Already in one of those places three new publishers have been found, and the third report of their activity has been received. The method employed by the special pioneer was very effective: first he covered his territory and started studies, but in addition he did just one thing more. He felt quite alone at first and decided that with Jehovah’s help he would try to find the most promising prospect for a publisher and try to build him up as quickly as possible to the point where he could have a share in the work. From then on, figured the pioneer, I will not be alone any more. So he found the one who seemed to be most likely to advance and concentrated more attention on him, visiting him almost daily, talking to him, explaining the Scriptures; and he got results. Before the end of the second month in the territory rolled around the man of good will had been in the field service. Two others have joined them. The pioneer’s zeal together with Jehovah’s blessing has assured that he is no longer alone.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark336"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are a “nation not desired” as far as Sweden is concerned. Opposition has come directly from the clergy. They feel the only ones who have the right to express themselves are the state church, and, of course, they have full control of radio broadcasting. They have stamped Jehovah’s witnesses as a non-Christian movement and have made it very difficult for many of our young publishers. Many, however, are paying good attention to what Jehovah’s witnesses have to say. One of the newspapers commenting on Jehovah’s witnesses said: “They do not let the spiritual happenings rotate around the individual and his salvation, but to them the advent of the Kingdom of God is the great Biblical theme around which all their thoughts and hopes are revolving. ... It is the irrefusable duty of each witness to make this good news known to everybody around him.” The New World society has made a good impression on the people of Sweden, and we rejoice with them in the progress they are making. The branch servant gives us an interesting report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When next year’s convention delegates get here they will be especially interested in seeing the new Bethel home and the adjoining printing plant at Jakobsberg about twelve miles outside Stockholm, which were opened on March 31. Beginning with the issues of May 15 and July 8, respectively, we have been printing our own editions of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines. After the district assemblies this summer about 1,900 of the friends used the opportunity to travel past Jakobsberg and see the place, and numerous express-sions of delight were heard and also received in the mail afterward. The people out here looked with bulging eyes at the many visitors, and we amused ourselves at the thought of what they will think when the 1955 crowd of visitors comes. We are very grateful, indeed, for the beautiful and practical place of work and living quarters provided for us here, and pray Jehovah to continue to bless the work that is being done to the glory of God and the good of his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The publishers in Sweden have not only had to contend with much indifference but also met direct opposition. As usual, however, this has had the effect of giving the message publicity and causing right-minded people to look into it. For instance, at the old university and archbishop’s town of Upsala the chief of police took it upon himself to deny Jehovah’s witnesses the use of public squares and parks for open-air meetings. He gave as his reason that Jehovah’s witnesses refuse compulsory service and are being sentenced to prison terms for that; and hence the town authorities would in reality be giving support to an organization that exhorts people to commit punishable acts, if the witnesses were granted the right to hold meetings on such sites. His decision was promptly appealed to the county governor. This started publicity in the newspapers all over Sweden, overwhelmingly in our favor, as the chief’s action was recognized as clearly contrary to the principle of religious freedom now codified in the law of Sweden, and many editors pointed out the danger of permitting police authorities to decide whether an organization is worthy to enjoy certain freedoms or not. The only newspaper that heartily approved of the chief’s action was the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Dagen</span><span class="font7"> at Stockholm, the official organ of the Pentecostal movement, which wrote that if the chief’s action could open people’s eyes to see what Jehovah’s witnesses are really up to, then it served a very good purpose. The county governor, upon hearing the case, reversed the chief’s decision, and when the delayed lectures started they were attended by many more than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The pioneer ranks had a real boost through the new arrangement of vacation pioneering, the number this year being 302, to compare with 50 in 1953. The arrival during the year of the new book in Swedish, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What Has Religion Done for Mankind?</span><span class="font7"> resulted in a good increase in placements of bound books. The circuit and district servant work according to the new arrangement and the training program in the congregations have also been much appreciated, and as time goes on the result will certainly be seen in greater increases in the number of those taking regular part in the witnessing work and doing it efficiently.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark337"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">One of the most wonderful things about the New World society is that it does not have a lot of the difficulties and barriers that worldly organizations have to contend with. While our brothers in Switzerland speak three different tongues, German, French and Italian, still they are able to meet together in one organization and rejoice in Jehovah with good results. The Society’s printing plant in Berne, Switzerland, reported good production for the year. The branch has the privilege of supplying a number of countries nearby with publications. The clergy of Switzerland have put out much propaganda trying to give the people the wrong impression of Jehovah’s witnesses, but the publishers are able to overcome this with patience. The clergy are galled at the freedom of speech enjoyed by Jehovah’s witnesses and it has been necessary to fight this matter in courts of the land. The branch servant gives us a report on the work in Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Maybe the clerical reaction to our work is the best barometer as to the effect of our preaching activity. At any rate, this year the country has been flooded with Protestant and Catholic church bulletins as never before, misrepresenting and ridiculing our message and work. Here is one passage that will interest you: “Most dubious, however, is where this Bible ‘interpolation’ is used to represent God’s kingdom as an earthly paradise in which every kingdom-citizen will be able to make week-end excursions in a Rolls-Royce on heavenly-earthly superhighways . . . These erroneous teachings are rooted in the wholly earthly aspirations for happiness which form the nucleus of all their hopes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Things like that do not worry Jehovah’s witnesses at all. They know that true Christians must be spoken evil of in these last days, and that there are still many people of good will who will join the New World society if they just get a chance to hear what our true message is. So they keep on working in the best interests of such people, showing true neighbor love. By not giving up they are bound to receive a good response sooner or later, like the pioneer sister who was brushed off at a door after having introduced herself and then said in a friendly manner: “Permit me just to say that I am calling entirely in your interest, and not in my own,” and turned to go. The woman hesitated, reflected a moment, and then said: “Will you come in, please?” The sister related: “In the presence of her husband she asked me many interesting Biblical questions on the soul, hell, resurrection and so on, which I could answer to her satisfaction with the use of her own Bible; in fact she was enthusiastic about what she heard. Then quite unexpectedly she broke in: </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Fraulein,</span><span class="font7"> you must excuse me for wanting to send you away so quickly just now, but I thought you were from Jehovah’s witnesses, you know.’ ‘Oh!’ I replied, ‘I not only come from Jehovah’s witnesses, but I am one of Jehovah’s witnesses myself.’ Astonished, but still kindly disposed toward me, she said: ‘But till now I had always thought that Jehovah’s witnesses didn’t believe the Bible.’ I left a book, obtained a subscription and made an appointment for a home Bible study. Both the woman and her husband made rapid progress in gaining a knowledge of Bible truths, and soon they were taking part in the field service with their nine- and thirteen-year-old boys. My joy was indeed full as this whole family took their places with the baptismal candidates at the St. Gall district assembly recently.” Friendly and constructive witness work bears such fruit!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers in Switzerland are used to court fights. They must keep the door open for preaching as ministers of the gospel without being restricted by the laws that are meant for peddlers. It was necessary to fight three court cases during the past year and Jehovah gave us the victory in all of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A fourth case that had been pending for more than two years was decided on during the year. That was in the Canton of Graubiinden, where we have had troubles for over twenty years. In its session of March 19, 1954, the Lower Council finally decided the pending case in our favor and thus changed its course of jurisprudence after twenty years. The decision said in part: “From the argument of the defendant and his counsel and from the publications of Jehovah’s witnesses themselves, one gains really the impression that their religious activity is mainly an oral teaching and that the literature constitutes a completion to it and a deepening of the oral presentation. The criterion of a commercial intention, which is recognized in all decisions of other cantons as an essential element of peddling, indeed is lacking.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Other cases against brothers pending before the same court were dropped, and we thank Jehovah for his guidance. Such victories do not give us any immediate relief outside the canton itself. There are twenty-two cantons or “states” in the Swiss federal union, and it seems as if we have to fight our way through every court in every canton on all kinds of charges, which will take some time yet. However, with Jehovah on our side we can keep the fight up as long as they can.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark338"></a>THAILAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The people in Thailand are not a fast-moving people. One needs Oriental patience to meet Oriental action, speculation and argument. But by perseverance the theocratic organization continues to expand in Thailand. They have reached a new peak in publishers this year and it is most interesting to learn that a number of these new publishers are Buddhists, persons who are very sincere in heart and want to learn of the true God. The branch servant in Bangkok sends us a very interesting report, but only a few excerpts can be printed here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One young man started to study with a missionary in Bangkok and showed keen interest in spite of the fact that most of his friends forsook him, accusing him of disloyalty to Buddhism. Another friend, a Catholic, tried to dissuade him from attending the Kingdom Hall. “Then why not take me to your church?” the Buddhist man asked. Did the Catholic respond to this opportunity to try to ‘convert’ a Buddhist? No. Instead, the latter, already enthused with his new knowledge, did the preaching and finally convinced his friend he should come to the Kingdom Hall. Now they are both regular attenders and progressing toward maturity. One has now given his first student talk. Of the two, the former Catholic feels he has more to learn than the former Buddhist about the Bible’s teachings!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Moving now to the East where nominal Christians have long had a foothold, interest is also manifest. One church member visiting the missionary home in Korat said there were others besides himself in a town a hundred miles north who were searching too. This call to “come over and help us” was answered. After a very kind welcome a real Bible discussion was started. Their Bibles were all open, notes were taken, and climaxing the “trinity” argument with John 8:17, 18, referring to the witness of two men, the point struck home. The house happened to be that of the head preacher of the Missionary Alliance, a man who had established congregations in various places. Such discussion soon reached the ears of the American leaders. A warning campaign started, and lectures on the “danger” of Jehovah’s witnesses were given. Pamphlets and magazines were printed against us, but a chain reaction was well under way and more people became curious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yet again there was a call, this time from a village a hundred miles from Korat. After seven hours in a truck shared with pigs and smelly fish, two missionaries covered by red dust and looking like American Indians, followed their waiting guide through the jungle. At one point their guide showed them the tracks of a tiger, but he reassured them that the tigers only prowled at night. After a three-hour walk they came to the village and there under the shade of a tree some forty nominal Christians were ready for a discussion on the trinity. Afterward one of the eager listeners extended an invitation to visit his home two miles away, and the missionaries gladly accepted. This man had spent much time watching his cattle from a watchtower of his, which had also become a communal resting place. He appeared to be a true Christian watchman as well as a cattle watchman, for in his tower he had nothing but a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine and a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> book, and he had already started the warning work. He has since been baptized and now reports regularly. Since then eight others have been baptized and there is a prospect of more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These isolated brothers, whether ex-Buddhist or “Christian,” will not be isolated when they attend the district assembly in Bangkok in September and meet their brothers from all parts of the country. In fact, for all of Jehovah’s people here the assembly will be a happy time and will strengthen them for further activity during the new service year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark137"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark339"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">For two years the reports from the branch in Trinidad showed no increase and this was a cause for concern on the part of the publishers there. Now there are many of the other sheep making an appearance, and the branch servant reports that he feels the training program introduced at Yankee Stadium in 1953 is responsible for this increase and improvement in the islands. The brothers are grateful that someone will go with them and help them in their work. There are a few who are resentful and do not want to be taught, but by far the great majority are happy to become better acquainted with the house-to-house work. They appreciate the circuit assemblies, too, and the possibility of having joint meetings several times a year on the islands. This has stimulated them to greater activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The clergy, newspapers and some of the government officials object strenuously to the work Jehovah’s witnesses are doing, but despite this opposition the New World society continues to thrive. They know this is the time to preach the good news, so they move out actively to all the territory under the direction of the Trinidad branch. The message will continue to be preached by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. The branch servant’s report covers the work on the islands of Barbados, Carriacou, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Tobago and Trinidad. Excerpts from the report are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Besides bringing the publishers to greater maturity, the training program has proved a means of strengthening the organization. The congregation book study center, through which the program is principally carried out, has been measurably strengthened. One circuit servant reports the training program &quot;has raised our congregational Bible study attendance to 73 per cent of the total publishers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A preacher of the Pentecostal Mission, not being satisfied with using his pulpit for slandering the witnesses, started to follow them around to do so. Whenever the congregation arranged for a lecture, he would go to the place an hour before the talk and bellow out his accusations against us. When I served the congregation he did the same thing. When the time came for my outdoor public talk to begin he was still carrying on, but he had contradicted himself so many times that a part of the crowd demanded that he stop so that we could start our talk. I replied: “If the gentleman will soon be finished we have no objection to waiting a few minutes more, as it might be interesting to compare a few of his statements with the Bible.” A section of my lecture dealt with the reasons for studying the Bible, one being that of cleansing our minds from false doctrines, and quoted Scripture to refute the arguments of the gentleman. The crowd jeered him and he left abruptly before our lecture was over. Questions from the audience were answered, and we now have a group meeting for Bible study on the same spot twice a week using </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and other Bible aids. They will soon be organized in a congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the island of Carriacou it is reported that the priest is now going from house to house, not in imitation of Jesus or the apostles, but telling the people that “those wicked men off the boat are back again to disturb my people, and now I have to run from house to house begging the people to come back to church. I heard that a boat was lost at sea and I was hoping it was them, but here they are back again causing me trouble. These people are too lucky. You can hear their printing presses running all night on the boat, printing Bibles, and then they come ashore with lanterns to distribute them.” It seems this poor fellow has heard the boat’s donkey engine running at night to charge the batteries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Lying is a very common practice with many people; it is second nature to them. But when one comes to a knowledge of the truth and dedicates oneself to Jehovah one must leave those practices behind and make one’s mind over in conformity with the truth. One publisher working in the home of a prominent government official as a domestic servant was ordered by her mistress (who is Roman Catholic) to tell an unwanted visitor she was not at home. The sister refused, saying it was lying and as a witness for Jehovah she would not lie. Her mistress threatened her with dismissal; she still refused. As a result her mistress was so impressed she gave her charge of the house, including all the keys, saying that she felt she could trust one who could not be forced to lie.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark340"></a>URUGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">For the past two years it appeared that Uruguay was either standing still or going backward as far as visible progress of the New World society was concerned. All of Jehovah’s witnesses were working diligently but they did not seem to see any results from their labors. This year the branch servant is very happy to report a definite increase in almost every feature of the work. It was believed advisable, too, to send someone down to the Falkland Islands, northeast of Cape Horn in the south Atlantic, and some good work was done there. The branch servant’s report shows how the witnesses of that land are very zealous. Some of the experiences are here related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Without a doubt your visit with Brother Henschel in January was the outstanding event of the year for Uruguay. The district assembly then drew an unexpected record crowd of 1,032. It was the first time the radio and newspaper were used to give extensive publicity to assemblies here. Before and during the assembly more than twenty stations made spot announcements, and eight free radio interviews were broadcast. More than sixteen different local newspapers published fortyseven news write-ups, including pictures. Thousands of signs were pasted on the city walls in addition to the usual placard and handbill work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The counsel given at this assembly and the changes made have all contributed toward a livelier, more zealous spirit in the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In spite of the indifference on the part of the majority of the people, Jehovah’s witnesses are finding “sheep.” Last year three ministers were sent to a very Catholic town of some 25,000 where no witnesses had preached before. Finally, three persons became witnesses and a congregation was formed. By April of this year they increased to nine when a circuit assembly was held there. Catholic opposition was aroused because of the assembly, but this only gave more publicity to our work. After the assembly the witnesses were invited to the parish to discuss the Bible with the priest. About twenty persons were present when the priest unsuccessfully tried to hold them up to ridicule. They insisted that he prove his statements by the Bible. He was stumped, so told them to return the next day. This time about forty were present, and the priest refused entry to many more who wanted to hear the discussion. To the amazement of all, the brothers so skillfully handled the Bible in answering all false charges and giving a further testimony that many of those curious ones who were formerly opposed in the audience gained more respect for the witnesses. The discussion ended and arrangements were made to visit some in their homes, where studies were started. Since then several of these have become active publishers, thus bringing the total up to twenty-five in August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another congregation in the interior obtained use of a sound truck to work an isolated village and deliver a public talk in the town square. After driving through the town announcing the subject, time and place, they were surprised to see the large crowd that came to hear the talk. Later, the townspeople welcomed the witnesses and many studies were started. The man in charge of the local Baptist mission has now become one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and several of his former Baptist associates are studying with the witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Missionaries of Jehovah’s witnesses do not try to become popular with the people by putting on dances, parties, musicals, sports events and social clubs, as do nearly all other religious missionaries. Good-will people notice this too. For example, one Mormon lady said: “I like your </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine better than our Mormon monthly magazine. Yours is pure Bible; ours is full of pictures of men, and praises to them. Yours praises God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At our public talks often the attendance is more than double the number of publishers present. Typical of the attitude of many such newcomers is the expression of a young </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sehorita</span><span class="font7"> who recently appeared at a discourse for the first time. After the talk, a publisher approached her and asked with what religion she was associated. Her answer brought joy to the heart of the questioner: “Well, I was a Catholic until I heard this Bible talk.” She asked how she could become a witness, and arrangements were made then and there to help her.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark341"></a>FALKLAND ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In January two missionary graduates of Gilead were sent to the Falkland Islands to introduce the Kingdom message to the people in this virgin territory. They worked for two months and found good interest. Eight public talks were given and the attendance at each averaged thirty persons. It developed that fourteen families showed definite interest and wanted to learn more about the Kingdom. It is sincerely hoped that they will continue to study. A local radio station made announcements about the work of the missionaries and the report shows that the truth disturbed the tranquillity of the five clergymen on the island where only 2,280 people are living. One of the Protestant ministers had not visited some of his people for over two years, but now that Jehovah’s witnesses came he started to visit his flock twice a month and warned them not to listen to these missionaries. Another visit will be arranged and probably a congregation can be started.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark342"></a>VENEZUELA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The preaching of the good news goes steadily on, and the publishers in Venezuela are thankful for their privileges of service to Jehovah. They realize their talking is backed up by an unalterable purpose. They know that Jehovah God will accomplish his will and, even though great forces come against them in an attack from Gog, they will be faithful and will come off victorious. This is not a time to waste time. The message is urgent and the members of the New World society in Venezuela know they are a chosen people to do a special work. The witness work has been on the increase steadily in this land, and the branch servant gives us some interesting experiences about what has occurred during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During November the New World society in Venezuela welcomed a visit from the president and his secretary. When Brother Knorr was here in 1950 the peak attendance at that assembly was 143, but since then the publishers have worked with a purpose, ‘conversing daily of the glories of Jehovah/ and were thrilled to see 942 present at this national assembly —the largest in the theocratic history of Venezuela.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the service year started there were thirteen congregations in the country and seven new congregations have been organized. Three new ones were formed in the capital city of Caracas, making a total of five.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here is an experience from Barquisimeto: “A businessman approached me while in the magazine work, saying he had read a few </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazines which a doctor in Uruguay had sent him and he was interested in learning more. I suggested that he subscribe for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> whereupon he invited me to call at his home that very afternoon. He not only subscribed but also took three books. After one discussion a week later he attended a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study, the following Tuesday a book study, and Thursday the service meeting. He was convinced that he had found the truth. In less than two months he joined us in the Sunday morning group witnessing, and has scarcely missed a Sunday of service since. Shortly after coming to a knowledge of the truth he attended a circuit assembly and his comment on his return was: ‘I never knew it was possible to feel so completely separated from this old world and yet still be here. What a taste of the new world!’ At the following district assembly in Caracas he was immersed. Everywhere he goes he is talking and preaching the Kingdom message and bubbling over with joy at his newly found treasure of service to Jehovah and his hope of living in the New World society forever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another experience recounts: “Some time ago one of the new publishers succeeded in talking one of her friends, a spiritualist, into having a Bible study. Shortly thereafter she turned the study over to one of the missionaries. The young woman made good progress, gave up spiritism, began attending meetings and soon started accompanying the missionary in the service. But like so many others in Venezuela, this woman had </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘companero</span><span class="font7"> trouble.’ She was living with a married man who spent half the week with his wife and the other half with her. This man threatened to kill her if she gave him up. She was terribly upset at first, but she prayed to Jehovah to give her the strength to do His will. It took her some time, but she finally made a complete break with him. She was baptized at the next assembly and now less than a year later is sending in her pioneer application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Before learning the truth, she had talked a friend of hers into becoming a spiritualist too. Feeling responsible for her, she did not rest until she had convinced her that they had made a mistake, and arranged to have the missionary study with her and her little niece. This lady also has </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘companero</span><span class="font7"> trouble,’ but she attends all the meetings, because she knows that this is the truth and is trying to put her life in order, to conform to the high moral standard of the New World society. Her niece, however, is now a faithful and zealous little publisher. Though only ten years old she goes from house to house alone, even using the Bible in her presentations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Concerning the isolated territory work and the value of it to extend the preaching comes this experience: “While working from door to door in a distant town, I met a nice lady who was interested in the message and at once began to ask questions. She took the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font7"> in German. Four weeks later I called again and found she had read the book and enjoyed it very much. She had given it to her mother-in-law, so she requested two more and a Bible for herself. After studying these books with the Bible, she explained that she had no desire to attend church any more as they do not teach the truth. Then she asked what she should do now to gain God’s approval. After considering the text of Matthew 24:14 and how Jehovah’s witnesses announce the Kingdom message, she subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and is already telling others about the truths she has learned.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark343"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">At the present time Jehovah’s witnesses in Yugoslavia can freely exercise their worship. It was only in 1953 that laws dealing with faith and religion came into existence. It is now necessary for every religious community to register their religious activity in compliance with the law. Jehovah’s witnesses have done this, but now they find it rather difficult to get Kingdom Halls and meeting places. This does not deter them from advancing and organizing their work. Good progress has been made during the 1954 service year, and a report that comes through indicates that even though halls are not available they get along well and the brothers are being strengthened. The other sheep are being gathered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have divided the country into four circuits, and every month we have an assembly in another circuit. Results show that these assemblies are very necessary and are richly blessed. Several languages are spoken in this country, so it is often necessary to translate the discourses into at least three languages. Recently we arranged an assembly on the farm of a brother because we had no other hall. This was really an event, and it proved to be a very good witness to the local community. People wondered why so many people were coming to visit this “believer of a new faith” (we were more than 150 brothers), and some said we were probably having our </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Kirchweih,”</span><span class="font7"> parish or church festival (an annual fete of the Catholics); but when they noticed that everything proceeded in an orderly and harmonious manner, and when they saw all the happy faces and genuine joy of those attending, then they concluded it would not be such a festival, because when </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font7"> have their &quot;parish festival” there is always some strife and fighting, with some wounded or even left dead on the parish fairgrounds. The day following this assembly a woman who had been one of the greatest opposers of Jehovah’s witnesses asked a sister to come and see her because she wanted to learn more about us. The sister gave her a good witness, and this woman is now glad to know who Jehovah’s witnesses really are. Also the attitude of the neighbors toward the brother on whose farm this assembly was held is now much friendlier than before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In spite of all the difficulties regarding halls for our congregation meetings and the complete lack of literature for publishing, the work has progressed here too during the past service year. In 1953 we had a peak of 914 publishers, but in 1954 we had a peak of 1,164, and during this service year 266 took up the work of witnessing and' were immersed.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark344"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark345"></a>1955 SERVICE YEAR</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses are always looking ahead to greater accomplishments under the direction of Christ Jesus, their God-given and unconquerable Leader. With minds and hearts full of desire to do God’s will they will continue to plan their activity to center around expansion of his worship. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society will give careful supervision to the work through its branches in all parts of the world and, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, the Society will continue to operate the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead for the training of missionaries. It is hoped that during 1955 the Society will be able to send out several hundred more missionaries into countries where the work is already being done or to new lands, cities and territories where the good news has not yet been preached. The New World society will not allow itself to become stagnant but will see to it that refreshing waters of life flow earth-wide. All branch offices will be giving the congregations constant attention to see that there are circuit and district servants to visit the congregations regularly to give the publishers the training they need and desire. Individually each of Jehovah’s witnesses will eagerly desire to become more skillful and efficient, sharing wholeheartedly in supporting the training program so all will be aided to present the Kingdom message more effectively in the house-to-house work and to all whom they meet. In thus paying attention to themselves they will be improving their own abilities and at the same time helping others, too, to awaken to greater privileges in the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A busy, joyful time will be the 1955 service year for Jehovah’s witnesses as they make increasingly widespread proclamation of the Kingdom and gather more of the other sheep. Each enlightened publisher certainly will feel his responsibility as a slave of Christ Jesus and will certainly recognize and appreciate how his diligent performance will, when added with that of his brothers, make the 1955 field service report even more outstanding than the 1954 report. Jehovah’s witnesses’ activity for 1954 all sums itself up in one word—Praise. All the work that Jehovah’s witnesses do is with that one idea in mind, advancing the praise of the true God, </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah.</span><span class="font7"> He it is who has organized and established them as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font7"> praising host.—Isa. 43:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They are fully aware that the god of this world, Satan the Devil, is constantly seeking to destroy the New World society and to banish its right works from his evil system of things. They know that he is putting an ‘evil thought’ into the minds of the religious, political and commercial leaders of his world to exert every effort to bring the work of the New World society to a violent and complete halt. (Ezek. 38:10-12) They know that he, like Gog, is causing woes earth-wide—constant trouble and turmoil—to strike fear into the hearts of all on earth, so as to cause them to curse the Sovereign Ruler of the universe and to blame him as the source of all their griefs. Continually the Devil is attacking the mind of everyone to instill fear—fear of famine, fear of earthquake, fear of war and fear of neighbor. Satan, the god of hate and fear, has established a fearful and hateful world. Jehovah, the eternal God of love, has formed and firmly set up a society based on love and life; and Jehovah’s witnesses rejoice in bringing to the fear-maddened world the news of this loving provision of Jehovah, this New World society. With confidence and joy born of firm faith in him, their Father, Jehovah, they bring to the terrified and fainthearted people of earth the same heart-cheering message that Christ Jesus brought when he walked this earth. This is a message, not of hate, fear, doom and death, but of love, of life and of the birth of God’s kingdom, the kingdom for which Christ Jesus taught all his faithful followers to pray: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (Matt. 6:10, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font7"> This kingdom, mankind’s only hope, Jehovah’s witnesses delight to keep on announcing; and every one of them knows this, believes it with all his heart and therefore preaches it on every occasion. They have no reason to be frightened by the mounting flood of evil tidings coming now from every part of the earth. Their hearts are fixed, trusting in Jehovah, their Rock, the living God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yes, a busy year it will be for Jehovah’s witnesses and they look forward to a glorious climax to the 1955 service year at the great international assemblies to be held world-wide. At the time of writing this </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font7"> plans are to start the international assemblies in Chicago, moving on to Vancouver, Canada; then Los Angeles, Dallas and finally New York’s Yankee Stadium for the last of the North American assemblies. Then are scheduled to follow the big European assemblies. Many Americans and Canadians will be going to Europe to attend those assemblies: first London, July 27-31; then Paris, August 3-7, and Rome, August 5-7. In the second week of August (10-14) thousands upon thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses will converge in Nuremberg (Germany). From there many of the travelers will be spreading in two directions, some to the north to attend the assembly in Stockholm (Sweden) and others to attend the assembly at The Hague (Netherlands), both being held August 17-21. Thus a joyful, prosperous year will be brought to a grand climax. Very likely several hundred thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses will happily flock together at these eleven principal assembly points in eight nations, all rejoicing in their privilege of gathering with their brothers in these troublous times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Meantime all members of the New World society will be earnestly praying to our heavenly Father, giving thanks for the bountiful blessings of his organization, his house and the rich provisions for his people. (Psalm 122) They will keep on asking him for his blessing on every part of the organization and, too, upon the grand assemblies that have been planned for 1955. If it is Jehovah’s will for his people to assemble together in this way (Jas. 4:13-15) it will be done, all to his honor, praise and glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What a joy it is for us to be able to bless Jehovah every day! Jehovah’s name was blessed every day during 1954, the greatest year of praise in the long life of Jehovah’s witnesses. (Heb. 11:4; 12:1, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font7"> All the branch offices, when sending in their 1954 reports, have especially requested me to give love and greetings to their brothers in all parts of the world and to express to them appreciation for the good works that have been accomplished due to their financial aid, and their producing literature and publications so that they may go ahead to a greater extent in the preaching of the good news in their own language in their own lands. The unity of Jehovah’s organization is pleasant. (Psalm 133) We are happy to be dwelling together in the New World society. May it be our choice portion during 1955 to sing Jehovah’s praises and also to be honored to do it throughout eternity. We are grateful for Jehovah’s undeserved kindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Your brother and fellow servant trusting in Jehovah,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, President</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark346"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark347"></a>ANNUAL MEETING</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, a Pennsylvania corporation, held its annual meeting on October 1, 1954, in its new offices located at 4100 Bigelow Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This new structure was built by the Society during the past year, and there is a very beautiful auditorium in connection with it so that it may be used by the Society for special meetings, like this annual one, and by some of the local congregations as a Kingdom Hall. In the basement there is another large auditorium as well as an immersion pool. Just off the main lobby there is a library and the business office of the Society. Provision, too, is made for sleeping accommodations for a few people, and there are rooms for the caretaker. We are very grateful to Jehovah God that we can now have our own building in Pittsburgh and that it is being used all the time by local congregations to associate together and incite one another to love and right works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the annual meeting, which began at ten o’clock in the morning, three members of the board of directors whose terms had expired were re-elected. A week later the entire board of directors, made up of N. H. Knorr, F. W. Franz, G. Suiter, H. H. Riemer, T. J. Sullivan, L. A. Swingle and M. G. Henschel, met in the New York offices of the Society and elected the officers. By unanimous vote the following were elected: Nathan H. Knorr, president; Fred W. Franz, vice-president; Grant Suiter, secretary-treasurer; Hugo H. Riemer, assistant secretary-treasurer. The board of directors expressed their gratitude to Jehovah God for his rich blessing of their work, for his direction and for the spiritual food he has provided for his people. All the members of the board of directors are very gateful for their privilege of service and are happy to be at your service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark348"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark349"></a>YEARTEXT EOR 1955</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in Jehovah.”—Psalm 112:</span><span class="font8">7_, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These words are indeed comforting. With all the turmoil and distress of nations around us and seeing so many people afraid of the evil tidings, these words of Jehovah coming to us at this time are very strengthening. While we fully appreciate we are in Jehovah’s organization and associated with the thousands of the New World society, still to be told not to be afraid of the evil tidings is comforting. The people of the world wonder why Jehovah’s witnesses find such satisfaction in this expression. It would be hard to explain it to them, because their hearts are not fixed nor are they trusting in Jehovah. But Jehovah’s witnesses know they are reading from Jehovah’s Word and they take these words as though Jehovah were speaking to them. Of course, we know that Jehovah was using the psalmist to write and he begins his expression with, “Praise ye Jehovah. Blessed is the man that feareth Jehovah, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.”—Ps. 112:1, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is only one class of people today who rejoice in the commandments of Jehovah God, and they are Jehovah’s witnesses. All of them together rejoice that the remnant of the anointed class still on the earth remain true and faithful to Jehovah God and they understand that this is the “man” who has been blessed by Jehovah because he feared Jehovah. During the past forty years this man has gone through many trials and tribulations; but at all times he has put his trust in Jehovah and now he has ‘seen his seed mighty upon the earth: he has seen the generation of the upright and these, too, have been blessed,’ that is, the other sheep have been brought in to be</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">associated with the upright remnant. In these last days before Armageddon these two classes walk together before Jehovah, praising him and not afraid of the evil tidings, because both of them together have their hearts fixed upon Jehovah, trusting in his Word, happy to do his will and willing to follow out his commandments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">They that wait for Jehovah shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 40 ■' 31,</span><span class="font4"> AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Anyone who has come into the truth and has dedicated himself to Jehovah has experienced this loving-kindness and tender mercy, and that gives him real faith and enables him to live an active Christian life and not be a hypocrite. Regardless of age, whether his years be many or few, it seems that a Christian shows only his youth, because no one will become old in the Kingdom, and the Kingdom is now here. So now every morning when we rise to talk of the glory of Jehovah’s kingdom we rise as a man in his youth. As David says: “Thy youth is renewed like the eagle.” No longer are we in captivity to Babylon, but are now free. We have something to keep us so busy. We have no time to get old and retire from serving the prospering Kingdom, which will soon clean out this old world of Gog of Magog and destroy it all. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font4"> 20</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark352"></a><span class="font4">Jehovah has established and irresistibly continues to build a New World society, earthwide, which will last forever. Members of that society, all ministers, constitute the visible nucleus of Jehovah’s “new earth” that will live through Armageddon. This society of ministers consists of the remnant of Jehovah’s anointed ones, along with their goodwill companions. For effectively helping many other willing ones to learn about Jehovah’s new world, these ministers must have the necessary requirements. Their ministry they must and they do take seriously, for its faithful performance means life; its failure, death. It is not an occupation to be undertaken for a while and then set aside for another. Yes, this work will last for the next thousand years, and after that Jehovah himself will give every faithful minister other assignments in his universal organization. What a delightful prospect I What an incentive to faithful service! W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1/1</span><span class="font4"> 3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">To act without reflection is not good; and to be over-hasty is to miss the mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Prov. 19:2, AT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To strike a blow in sudden anger is evidence of poor motive, namely, the release of the emotional pressure of a steamed-up parent. Such discipline is for selfish relief, not done out of love for the child. In many cases the solution may be found to lie between the two extremes of never spanking and always spanking. But this is not true in all cases. The temperament and disposition of the individual child must be considered. Some are very sensitive, and sueb drastic measures as spanking may not be necessary. Some may be so callous that such drastic measures may be ineffective. Concerning men a proverb says : “A rebuke sinks deeper into a man of intelligence than a hundred lashes into a fool.” (Prov. 17: 10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">AT) </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">So it is with children. Some are more sensible and some are meeker than others. A rebuke may discipline them more than a whipping would others who are more stubborn.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Acts It: 12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite the widespread confession in Christendom that Christ is the Ransomer of mankind, there is great misunderstanding of the role he plays in the purposes of Jehovah, and even startling disbelief in the merit of his life given as a ransom. Jesus Christ of Nazareth rose from birth in a manger to a position of vital importance to humankind. No other single individual since creation of Adam has made such an indelible imprint on the pages of history, nor has any other person ever been so universally the subject of controversy. Countless other men have gone down into death as martyrs, but in no other instance has there been attributed to such martyrdom the role of savior. Jesus Christ stands alone in world history as one whose death is said to qualify him to act as the Redeemer of humankind. His position in this regard is unique. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font4"> 1, 2</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God.—rs. JfO: 1, 8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was no question about Jesus’ perfect heart devotion to his heavenly Father while he was on earth, from earliest childhood. However, during the time he was living at home no particular issue confronted him requiring his decision or determination. But when approaching the age of thirty he perceived clearly from God’s Word that his Father had an altogether different life pattern in mind for him. Jesus, after fully weighing up the situation and all that was involved, put aside his own will, perfect though it was. Instead, he decided to undertake to do God’s will as revealed in the Scriptures and determined to carry it out to the finish. That decision and determination to set himself apart to do God’s will constituted his dedication. He dedicated himself in the spirit of loving devotion. Thus we see a Scriptural distinction between dedication and devotion. IF </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span><span class="font4"> 18a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 54: 2, 3, U<sub>lt</sub> AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The bounds of the New World society have to be extended. Everything must be strengthened and conformed to Jehovah’s righteous requirements. The organization must be able to bear the weight and pressure resulting from increased numbers. It must be fortified against possible errors and corruption by those who have just left false religion. Those coming in cannot bring with them false teachings, wrong ideas and actions. No, these must be left outside like a discarded, filthy, smelly garment. They are provided with clean garments of identification. No one must hinder these returning captives. Do not be opposed to widening the provisions for their reception and for putting them to work. There are many more yet to come, and they may be in God's service for a long time —at least a thousand years. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font4"> 24a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">love.—l Cor. 13:13, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God shows that love is the principle on which he works, and that is the principle every one of us has to work on if we are going to be in that new world of righteousness. Love is the foundation of it all. So we might as well begin learning to love now: love Jehovah, the Sovereign Ruler; love his Son, love his other creatures and do things for them. One of the best ways to show our love to people now is to talk to them of the glory of Jehovah’s kingdom. It is a real government, a growing organization that hundreds of thousands of persons already recognize. It has been and is constantly bringing blessing and happiness to millions of persons since its birth in 1914, and will bring life and happiness and peace to yet more millions in the future. Love will make the new world a marvelous place in which to live I Having seen what selfishness has done to this old world, we have made our choice for Jehovah’s kingdom of love. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font4"> 11, 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Those receiving the heavenly reward are surely among those resurrected to life. Then there are some of the “great crowd” of sheeplike ones who have died faithful since Christ’s kingdom has been established, and may yet die faithful before Armageddon. It would reasonably follow that the faithful men of old and any of the present-day other sheep who die will receive a resurrection early in the new world, to join the Armageddon survivors in making earth a paradise. Theirs would be a resurrection to life also, in that they would come forth with a good start, having already patterned their lives to a great degree in obedience to God. The stand they will take on coming forth is not one of doubt, but they will immediately take up again the way of obedience and conformity to new-world ways. These also would be the “righteous ones” mentioned at Acts 24 :15, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW. </span><span class="font4">17 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span><span class="font4"> 17</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11,5:11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While Psalm 145 is one of praise and adulation of Jehovah’s glory and that of his kingdom, it is not just a dreamy expression or mere wishful thinking. No, it is one of praise and expresses many things about the glory of his kingdom. What the psalmist writes about are real down-to-earth expressions of things that are happening and things that will happen. He is speaking of the glory of Jehovah's established kingdom. It is real, it is living, it is a going concern. It is something to work for and with, not against. Is such a kingdom possible? If, when you meditate upon Jehovah’s Word, that Word lives in you, it will convince you that the Kingdom is here, that it is in operation, that it is ruling Jehovah’s servants today. All this can be observed by placing physical facts alongside the Bible prophecies. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 8, 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">4-'24, W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">True religion is the genuine worship of Jehovah. False religion embraces everything against the worship of Jehovah. The word “religion” in its simplest and most common form means “a form or system of worship.” We speak of pagan religion as well as of Christian religion. True religion is eternal and can never be destroyed. Throughout the many centuries enemies have tried to throw it down and destroy it, but their works of evil have proved futile. There have been many occasions when true religion hardly survived the terrific onslaughts made against it. But though sometimes almost in ruin, yet Jehovah has always raised up faithful men to champion its cause and fight for its existence, regardless of personal loss and even the danger of death. These men repaired the breaches and restored the paths, so that people might again worship Jehovah in spirit and truth. In just such a critical time we are living today.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">24: 19, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To all in his organization, Jehovah is both Holy God and Absolute King. By virtue of this dual office he has the right to exact exclusive devotion, perfect obedience and expert service. Such exclusive performance toward him is complete integrity. By creatures’ respecting the legal mark of integrity set by the God-King they demonstrate their loyalty and faithfulness to this truly Holy One. Bv meeting this set mark of what God considered manifesting friendship they legally have a standing before him. Since it is God’s purpose to bring forth creatures who out of their own free will lovingly desire to do the will of Jehovah, those who follow this divinely designed pattern thereby produce praise and glory for Him. So by measuring up to the mark of integrity the faithful creature can also be said Scripturally to be manifesting the glory of God in exclusive devotion. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">6:32, 34, US.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here we have God’s thoughts on religion in politics. How so? Because Jehovah refers to himself as the husband of those with whom he is in covenant relations. Because of the Law covenant Jehovah said of the Israelites: “I was an husband unto them.” That placed the nation of Israel in the position of wife toward Jehovah. By covenant she was obligated to be true to Jehovah governmentally as well as religiously. To be faithful to Jehovah the great Husband the nation of Israel had to follow him in matters not only religious but also governmental. To form other religious or political connections in oppostion to Jehovah constituted spiritual harlotry on Israel's part, as the Bible states: “They had unfaithful intercourse with other gods.” So just as a wife in adultery means strife with the husband, religion in politics means war with God.

<p><span class="font4">The increasing activity on the part of those ’‘taken along” by Christ has been carried on despite severe persecution by those who have been abandoned for destruction. And while our very boldness is an evidence of impending destruction to those who oppose, we realize there are still many pitfalls between us and the revelation of Christ. We know we arc called upon to make decisions every day that might affect our standing with Jehovah. We remember that the bulk of the Christian Greek Scriptures admonishing Christians to faithfulness was written when there was special need for them during the consummation of the Jewish system of things and before the climax of judgment. So today, with their minds braced up for activity those taken along continue to heed the warning of Peter to “keep completely balanced.” W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">6/15</span><span class="font4"> 8a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">For Christians today sanctification means that each one has turned from a course of lawlessness to lawfulness before the great Lawgiver, Jehovah. This sanctification necessarily is something that must be pursued and maintained. It docs not continue with a person automatically, because it involves a change in a person’s life, which change he makes after he dedicates himself to serve the Most High and in which he must continue and mature. This change in a person's life means carrying out his dedication to the righteous God, and hence to his righteous cause, namely, the proper determination of the issue of Jehovah’s supremacy. This issue moves those who worship Jehovah to uphold his Godship by calling attention to the facts regarding his relationship to his creatures and regarding his revealed Word, the Bible. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15 17</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It required great courage, faith and confidence in Jehovah to declare fearlessly God's judgments against the Devil’s visible organization. This degree of faith and courage Jehovah’s people as a whole did not have before 1926. The organization was not wholly clean. Many were there to serve their own selfish purposes and draw followers after themselves. Such conditions could not be tolerated by Jehovah. Once he had set his King upon his throne, these people must be cleaned out. Obstructionists could not be permitted in any degree to interfere with God’s purposes. To try, test and prove his servants Jehovah decreed that they must do a mighty witness work; this they were required to do and at the same time their life and actions must be on the same lofty plane as the message they were bearing. They must never lose sight of the fact that they were called to reflect the glory of Jehovah. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span><span class="font4"> 4</span></p>

Gathering together are a great crowd of earthly followers, for God’s favor has turned to the nations to bring forth this class. Today Jehovah’s people are vigorous and active. They are as young warriors and they follow the priestly King wherever he goes. It is not a mercenary army, but one that serves out of love. It is clad in the robes of holiness, and all are singers. They are truly soldiers of a Priest-King. They serve in righteousness and for the holy cause of righteousness, and nothing stops them. True it is, this nation has appeared only just in these last days; that is how Jehovah said it would be, a multitude, a sudden, unexpected, marvelous appearing.

<p><span class="font4">Aptness to teach others and a desire to share in training them in many ways for serving Jehovah are among today’s requirements for his ministers. Even as Jesus was, so today Jehovah’s ministers are required to be diligent students of Jehovah's written Word. Another required duty in building up the New World society is searching for the other sheep of the Lord Jesus who now are entitled to become of the growing great crowd of that society. In all earth’s lands these sheeplike persons walk today, isolated, oppressed and robbed by Christendom’s false shepherds ; but now they are being found and gathered together into one fold under Jehovah’s Right Shepherd, to feed on rich food in good pastures. Jesus did not mean that he personally would come down to earth from heaven and do this gathering work.

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah never judges anyone guilty without a fair trial. He clearly points out his will to man and gives man full opportunity to show a good and right heart by adhering to it. He even makes repeated warnings to those who are prone to ignore him. But his judgments are sure and swift when guilt has been established. There are three distinct phases or aspects to any such visitation or advent of a righteous representative of Jehovah in a time of judgment. The entire period of the representative’s advent is referred to as the presence. Then there is a time when the purpose of the presence becomes manifest, a time for judgment to begin on all Christians. Finally, there is a climax of the purpose of the presence, which is the execution of judgment. This is a time of revelation because the purpose of the visit is now clearly seen in the deliverance of those favorably judged and in the destruction of those found unworthy of salvation.

<p><span class="font4">Thoroughly refuting the charge that Christ’s resurrection was an imposture or hallucination are these facts: The witnesses were not men of power or influence, to overcome or bribe the guards stationed at Jesus’ tomb. There was little likelihood of a collusion among so many, especially as to something that would be of no personal gain to them. Their witnessing to the resurrection could have no selfish motive; it exposed them to suffering and death. They gave their testimony in the very place where the bitterest enemies were, where certainly a fraud could be uncovered. And they did not wait, but witnessed then, while the rage of the Jews was at its height. Furthermore, if it had been a mere vision or imagiuation, it would have been of the expected thing; but this was to them a great surprise in their downcast condition—the unexpected. Really it was the very thing that gave them courage to bear testimony that could not be broken down under the most violent persecution. 17 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7</span></p>

They are still of the old world and they believe that the old-world practices can be worked into our New World society. Jehovah, however, will not allow it. We must be careful of such kind of persons, for they are hypocrites. Their philosophy or way of thinking has no place in the New World society. Such opposing and unelean ones will lose everything.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power.—Ps. 11/5:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses are the most expressive creatures on the earth. Having gained knowledge of Jehovah and Christ Jesus, they cannot refrain from expressing themselves; that makes them talkers. The right kind of talkers, too—not gossipers —because they talk the truth as expressed in God’s Word. Really, they have something to talk about, the most wonderful news of good things to come that you have ever heard. It is very evident that they know their God, Jehovah, his majesty, glory, power, wisdom, love, righteousness and his sovereignty. They know that Jehovah is the greatest one in all the universe, that by studying his Word we can find out what he has done, is doing and will do as that Sovereign Ruler. When we come to appreciate what Jehovah’s name means, what his mighty acts are, what he purposes to do, we will not refrain from talking about Jehovah and the glory of his kingdom. Are you thus talking? </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">You children may obey your parents because they want you to. That is a good reason, but here is a better one—obey because Jehovah wants you to. Young animals must obey to live long; here Jehovah tells you to obey if you want to endure on earth. Do you love Jehovah? Then obey him. He says, Obey “your parents in union with the Lord”; so obey yours who are Jehovah’s witnesses. If it is sometimes hard to do, do it anyway, but look at it as obedience to Jehovah. God tells the wife to be obedient to her husband and the slave to be obedient to his master. How should they view this? As to the Lord, as to Christ. You children, obey your parents “as to Jehovah, working at it whole-souled for his sake. So in this also you are serving Jehovah, just as when you witness for him. Heeding reproof and discipline means life. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font4"> 22a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The creator of false religion is Satan, for he deliberately caused the rebellion of man in Eden to make a breach between God and man, and in this he was successful. Then Satan began to organize mankind into his way of worship. He has always done his utmost to prevent humankind from obtaining knowledge of Jehovah. To accomplish this he caused men to commence worshiping the creation of God, instead of the Creator, and so over the centuries men have made religion of everything, from the sun to creeping things on the earth. Earth-wide confusion has resulted. The time will come when Satan will not be able to deceive mankind with false religion, for it is foretold that Jesus will hurl the Devil into the abyss, there to remain for a thousand years. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font4"> 5</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">About thirty years ago God’s people realized the great importance attaching to the actual name Jehovah and set about learning more about it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> January 1, 1926, carried the leading article, “Who Will Honor Jehovah?” Since that time the name has become more vital and meaningful to his children. Then in 1931, at a convention in Columbus, Ohio, the name Jehovah’s witnesses was embraced by thousands of faithful Christians. Since that time this people has become world-renowned for integrity, suffer ing, loyalty and love toward this name. In every trial they have honored Jehovah’s name until today hundreds of thousands of people are trusting in it; at the same time it has become a fearful name to God’s enemies. The lifting high of this name has brought great reproach and suffering, but also has brought joy and pleasure in abundance. Jehovah honors those who honor him. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font4"> 7a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 10:2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Christian witnesses of Jehovah do not go around in the religious toggery of Christendom’s clergy, but dress simply in ordinary clothes. Most of us work at honest occupations part-time as the apostle Paul did, in order to be apostolic and to provide for our natural needs decently and honorably and not financially burden the congregations with which we are associated. Because we do not differentiate ourselves from the rest of the people by high-sounding titles or unusual religious garments or living a life of ease as a clergyman, the authorities of this world may not look on us as consecrated priests of God, but look on us according to what we appear to be in the flesh. So we must disabuse the minds of those who take us at face value and so do not appraise us as ministers of Jehovah God, consecrated priests of the Most High pod. members of a “holy nation,” not of this world. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font4"> 9b</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">And now come and let me send you to Pharaoh and you bring my people the sons of Israel out of Egypt.—Ex. 3:10,</span><span class="font4"> NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On hearing this message from Jehovah Moses should have rejoiced, but instead he was afraid because he knew the spirit of the Egyptians and their king. He said he was not qualified for the mission. This displeased Jehovah, because he knew more about Moses’ abilities than Moses himself. So Jehovah told him he would be with him. With this assurance as his strength Moses went ahead to accomplish his mission. Moses had the requirements necessary for this assignment. He was richly blessed for carrying it out. Here is a good lesson for all of us. When given an assignment by Jehovah through his organization we should not make excuses or complain that we cannot do it. Jehovah cannot accept excuses. Were he to do so, it would mean that he does not know the limitations of his servants. Such a lack on his part is impossible for the God of infinite wisdom. Obedience on our part is better than excuses. Obedience leads to life; excuses can lead to endless death. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font4"> 6, 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">What kind of life pattern are you building? Is it possible to change one’s life pattern? That it is possible to experience a change of heart, resulting in a change of life pattern, is seen by the record of Joseph’s brothers. These, to begin with, were governed by jealousy and ill will, showing itself in cruelty and treachery. But when in later years it came to pleading on Benjamin’s behalf under the most adverse circumstances, we could not imagine a more convincing proof of a change of heart than found in that deeply moving intercession of Judah. (Gen. 44: 16-34) Certainly a change of life pattern is possible and necessary for everyone who would escape the corruption of the old wicked system of things and find a place in the New World society.

<p><span class="font4">Sanctification means to be in accord with Jehovah God, who never steps down from his holiness and righteousness, never changing. The righteousness of Jehovah is a complete reason for his creatures to devote themselves to him. In fact, sanctification is preceded by the personal dedication to do God's will; and this step by the individual, as well as his subsequent course of action consistent therewith, is because of his worship of Jehovah. This certainly does emphasize the extreme contrast between Jehovah’s morality in every respect and the present-day civilization’s immorality in every respect. This holiness of God prompts his acts; it impels his creatures to righteous acts in obedience to him and in worship of him. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

Well, certainly those who have come to know Jehovah and have studied his Word have been satisfied with truth and their present happiness in life. But let us go beyond just his people and look into the earth itself, even to the animal kingdom. The birds that fly above the earth, the animal life that crawls upon the earth or the fish that are in the sea —he satisfies all their needs. Well, if he looks after them so thoroughly, certainly he will look after us if we come within his organization. What a marvelous provision God has made for everything that he has created in the heavens and on earth! “Observe intently the birds of heaven, because they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses; still your heavenly Father feeds them.

These sheep do not include all men of all nations no matter what their belief or living habits, for the primary purpose of the ransom is, not the salvation of creatures, but to enable Jesus to redeem from the death penalty men who by their faith and devotion would prove the Devil a liar. It follows that if some men, by their willful submersion in evil and complete disregard of the saving message of the Bible, show themselves to be opponents of truth and righteousness, they have no hope in the merit of Christ’s ransom. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font4"> 11, 12a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Today men must choose whether they will serve God and live or will serve the liar, Satan, and be put to death. People who have righteous hearts and love true doctrine and righteousness are taking up the pure worship of Jehovah, studying his Word and seeking to do his will.

Of certain Christians Paul knew at the time at Rome, all except Timothy were “seeking their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.” (Phil. 2 : 21, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> When Timothy dedicated himself to Jehovah he completely submerged his own will so that God’s work might take precedence in his life.

Each may choose to accept that wonderful gift, exercise faith in Christ, and enjoy the blessings of the glorious.Kingdom and its rule over this new world. But if anyone does not want the redemptive price to apply to him, he will not be compelled to accept it. The minister happily goes on from him to find and feed the ones who are hungry.

<p><span class="font4">Christ was not the least seditious in teaching his disciples to pray for God's kingdom to come, and neither are his true followers today seditious in telling that that kingdom is now at hand. Speaking the truth of God’s Word as a warning to this generation of impending destruction is not subversive in any sense. It is a lifesaving message delivered out of love and mercy. Noah diligently worked in a similar way, which resulted in “the saving of his household.” His proclamation was not subversive. It was not his message that washed that wicked system of things out of existence. Rather, it was Jehovah’s terrible manifestation of supreme power that wrought the havoc. So, too, in modern times, the message delivered by Jehovah’s witnesses, although appreciated by all lovers of God, may be hot on the ears of the wicked; nevertheless, its heat is nothing to compare with the fire of God’s jealousy, which will consume this world at Armageddon. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font4"> 14a</span></p>

No ! God never hopes I He knows! “Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.” Jehovah's perfect knowledge of his works allows no room for hope. Rut, then, how did Jehovah subject mankind to futility “on the basis of hope”? By saying what he did to the covering cherub in Eden just before he sentenced Adam and Eve to death. Thereby he summed up the supreme hope for all mankind! A promise from the Most High God that the fiendish introducer of wickedness, the “one having the means to cause death, that is, the Devil,” would be crushed out of existence by a deliverer.

The priests back there had to ‘teach the sons of Israel all the regulations that Jehovah had spoken to them by means of Moses.’ (Lev. 10 : 11, AH') They had to teach theocratically, for tremendous responsibility lay on their shoulders, and God held them to this responsibility. They were administering Jehovah’s law; hence he was the real Judge in Israel. Faithful priests taught the law and kept the people of Jehovah in the right paths.

No, Christians look to God’s righteousness and rely upon his spirit as they try to copy Christ’s pattern, maintaining integrity.

In the darkest hour of mankind's history, when Adam and Eve rebelled against their Creator, bringing sin and death to their offspring, Jehovah saw the need of a hope and in his loving-kindness provided it when, as Judge, he told the unfaithful covering cherub that the seed of the woman would bruise his head. (Gen. 3:15) That sublime hope, first disclosed almost 6,000 years ago, is filled today with dynamic and protecting power, for those loving and searching after righteousness.

They could not do so. Where, did they talk? Publicly and from house to house. And just as that method was so important for them from the first and later, in Paul’s day, so it is our most important work today. We should get into the field, going from house to house, meeting the people in their homes, talking to them about the glory of Jeho\all's kingdom. Are you doing that, especially now that the Kingdom, Jehovah's permanent government, is here? It is urgent to do so, because the years left before the final battle at Armageddon cannot be too many.

Such a world-wide reconstruction work has been in progress, and today hundreds of thousands have' gained great benefits. Not that they have found a new religion, but rather they have been guided into the old paths again, having been led back to the religion of the apostles and of the faithful men like Noah, Abraham and others. They have coine to learn that Jehovah is the Most High God, and the love of God kindled in their hearts and lives has produced obedience to the doing of his will. True religion has developed in these sincere and honest-hearted ones reverence, honor, gratitude, hope and godly fear. It has bound them securely to the Almighty, moving them to surrender all to Jehovah willingly. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font4"> 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">A promise might be made, but of what use is it if there is no certainty of its fulfillment? Hence in connection with any important declaration, undertaking or promise, the custom arose from the earliest days of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">swearing an oath. </span><span class="font4">This was done by invoking a mutually recognized authority higher than merely human. Naturally enough, the highest possible authority was appealed to, God himself, or his Word. Thus, to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">swear an oath </span><span class="font4">means to affirm or utter a solemn declaration, with an appeal to God for the truth of what is affirmed. And if, in the society or nation where this is done, such an oath carries with it a binding legal obligation, with sanctions or penalties attached on proof’s being given that the oath has been violated, then there is the strongest possible “legal guarantee.” This means, as far as humanly possible, “the end of every dispute.”—Heb. 6: 1G, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span><span class="font4"> W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span><span class="font4"> 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The New World society has left behind a world without hope. Satan cannot give hope; he has none himself. So he is envious of the sure and powerful hope we possess, and seeks to crush it in a low-down manner, through persecution. But the Devil has been a miserable failure as a general; his strategy always works against him when Jehovah’s people keep integrity. For we are the ones who gam because of the tribulation. Not only does it further advance the good news, but we gain so much in the way of building up our hope that the apostle tells us to “keep on remembering” the sufferings we endured. You of the New World society who are now undergoing tribulations, remember that after this “momentary and light” tribulation has passed you will look back upon the trials with profit. They have brought you an approved condition, have fortified your hope. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">8/15</span><span class="font4"> 9a</span></p>

But now, particularly, it is, because we see the fulfillment of so many Bible prophecies, such as the one found at Isaiah 60: 1-3, 8. Just think! “kings” and “nations” will come seeking comfort and light from Jehovah’s ministers. For this service it is necessary that his witnesses possess certain requirements. Now is the time to prepare for this work, for in all lands many ministers are needed. Are you interested in this lifesaving work? Then prepare for it. All who wish to prepare for this great ministry will find that every possible help has been provided by Jehovah through his organization. Avoid the need of ‘being beaten with many strokes.’ You will not enjoy them nearly so much as preparing for the ministry. Now there is no time to lose. Prompt, thorough action is essential !

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Luke 17:26, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When God gave Noah notice of the flood, that marked the beginning of “the days of Noah” or the time of Noah’s presence during which ho served as a “preacher of righteousness.” The people certainly knew Noah was there and preaching, but they paid no attention. Then the day arrived when Jehovah took Noah, his family and the animals into the ark. During this manifestation of divine favor while Noah was going into the ark the way was still open—but not for long. “After that Jehovah shut the door behind him.” The judgment of all in the earth at that time was now sealed. Jehovah had given evidence of his favor to Noah and now proceeded to give evidence of his wrath against all who had not recognized Noah’s righteous presence. The flood was an unmistakable climax of the truthfulness of Noah’s preaching and a revelation to the wicked world in which he lived. So it will be at Christ’s second presence.

<p><span class="font4">Whenever the headquarters office or a branch office of the Society sees anything wrong in a certain congregation, or anything that is dampening its zeal or slowing down its members, it sends mature visiting servants of Jehovah to remove the hindrance and build them up again in the most holy faith. Likewise the servants in the various congregations should always be looking after the flock of God and calling back on those who are weak in faith and teaching them how to go from house to house. They should look after those who are isolated and live in rural territory and who have shown interest. The congregation servant with his assistants or others should get out there to look after them when at all possible. They are other sheep, they are scattered, they must be brought together and fed, even as was done iu the early Christian congregation.—Acts 5: 42. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font4"> 16, 17a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The little ones in Israel were not to be shunted off into some Sunday school for special instruction, but were to remain in the one congregation, ‘that they may listen and learn.’ And to what were they to listen? To the law specially simplified for children? No, they gave ear to such complicated things as Leviticus! They listened and learned, and when they failed to understand they questioned their parents later. Today little ones are not to be sidetracked into a soundproof room to romp, nor is it wise to supply them with trinkets to toy with and drop during meetings. Reinember Jehovah’s purpose for ordering their presence is ‘that they may listen and learn.’ If little ones in Israel could listen to Leviticus and learn, youngsters today can listen to much lighter material and learn. This way may not seem right to men, but it is right to God. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font4"> 8</span></p>

Yes, to see his name Jehovah shining brilliantly, gleaming gloriously, prominently displaying its grandeur and majesty to the gaze of all creation. These are some of the marks of true religion. It is not formalism, not ritual, not a social function. No, it is not something to try to show oneself respectable, but a living, all-consuming zeal to worship Jehovah with spirit and truth. There must be a holding to the Creator and it must bind us in bonds that cannot be broken, even as Paul, a true worshiper, expressed in the above words. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font4"> 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">With Jehovah there is no confusion. He leaves nothing to chance or haphazardness. (Rom. 8:28) If we always try to realize this fact, it will be of invaluable help to us in our God-given assignment as followers of and diligent workers with his enthroned King. In fact, we must come to realize this fully in order to withstand the onslaughts of the enemy. Jehovah foreknew and made record of his purpose to bring his organized people before kings and judges of this old world to testify before them concerning his kingdom when that perfect government is being erected to displace theirs permanently. Neither the invisible nor the visible rulers of Satan’s world have taken kindly to that idea, and they determine to fight it with everything in their power.

God tells us what they are at Isaiah 40:15: “Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance.” If God is for us, who can be against us that matters? But if God is against us, who can be for us that matters? We can have the whole world on our side, but what have we got, what does it amount to? A drop of water, a speck of dust—strong support that is for someone in a war against God I Yet because of fear of what Jehovah likens to a waterdrop and a dust speck millions side with this old world and against God and thereby become sharers in its sins.

True to the meaning of his name, Job was hated, harassed and persecuted by the Devil, the demons and their disciples. And yet for all the sadistic cruelty and prolonged torture of his body and mind Job’s fidelity and devotion to Jehovah remained unbroken. ‘Though I am slain, yet will I trust Jehovah,’ was his attitude. Thus by such unswerving and continued faithfulness under trial and testing Job made Jehovah’s heart glad, for he furnished the Most High with an answer to give the taunting adversary.

It was for the perfect new world that God gave his only-begotten Son. When the resurrected Christ presented the merit of his ransom sacrifice to his Father in heaven, it being accepted by Jehovah, the new world's foundation was laid.

<p><span class="font4">Hope is defined as “desire accompanied with expectation of obtaining what is desired.” Hope is thus comprised of two elements: (1) a desire and (2) a feeling that the desire will be realized or fulfilled. Hence one may have keen desire but lack hope. For desire accompanied by the background realization that there is little or no possibility of ever having that desire fulfilled is not hope. True, desire may attract, but hope does much more: hope impels, hope pushes, hope urges one to effort. To believe in things we hope for there must be firm and irremovable grounds, a basis or foundation for confidence and reliance, because we hope for what wc do not see. The word “see” at Romans 8:24 (above) conveys the thought of having one’s hope fulfilled, for then one’s eyes will behold realization. At job 7: 7 we read: “Mine eye shall no more see good,” the marginal reference adding “to see, that is, to enjoy.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font4"> 7, 8</span></p>

The words that are the first words in it that God himself wrote were for a theocratic organization, that is, the “Ten Words,” the Ten Commandments, for his typical theocratic organization. Yes, all the books of the Hebrew Scriptures were written for the typical theocratic organization of Israel.

<p><span class="font4">The early Christians were not interested in selfish pursuits, nor did they engage in the work to make a name for themselves. Their purpose was to declare abroad the excellencies of him who had called them out of darkness into his wonderful light. Jehovah’s name had been defamed, his sacred Word had been hidden and his immutable purposes were obscured. Hence, footstep followers of Christ who had been informed on these very important matters considered it a great honor and privilege to tell their fellow creatures about the marvelous provisions Jehovah had made for their salvation and deliverance. Their preaching work was one of love; first of all, love for their Creator, Jehovah God, and, too, love for their neighbors and fellow creatures.

Likewise, Abraham was made strong to pass the test of offering his son Isaac, Job to endure intense suffering and loss of everything but life itself, and the great crowd of faithful witnesses of old to withstand being “tortured because they would not accept release by some ransom.” The apostles were filled with a “living hope” by Jesus’ resurrection and the guarantee it gave them, lending a force and enthusiasm to their preaching that no amount of persecution could dampen.

The child may think you are inconsistent and unreliable; and feel it too can ignore principles. Your training and precepts must be consistent or the child will not know where it stands with you, will not be sure that when you say a thing you will do it, that when you promise you will perform, that when you threaten you will fulfill. If you say but do not do, you will be like the hypocritical Pharisees of old. What they said was all right; what they did was all wrong.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Not like Cain, who originated with the wicked one and slaughtered his brother. And for the sake of what did he slaughter him? Because his own works were wicked, but those of his brother were righteous.—1 John 3:12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Adam and Eve had a perfect life pattern to begin with. But of their own free will they deliberately vitiated that perfect pattern by selfishly grasping at what they thought would open their eyes to absolute freedom, independent of God and in defiance of his commandment. Cain and Abel were born of the same parents and came under the same parental influence. Cain chose to follow the Devil’s pattern of wicked works in the spirit of jealous hatred and murder. Abel, however, chose to exercise faith, proved by a righteous course of action, and it seems, in point of time, that his name was written first in God’s record. This shows that we are individually responsible for our life pattern. Let us not excuse ourselves by putting the blame on our parents or on anyone else. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span><span class="font4"> 8, 9a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Since 1945 this warning takes on added force and increasing urgency. It is from that time that the disgusting wild beast has been visible in a complete way. When it was present as the League of Nations it did not manifest animosity to any extent toward Christendom’s religions. Then the antitypical Jerusalem, Christendom, was not surrounded by enemy forces; but since the reappearance of the wild beast in 1945 it embraces political elements whose radical horns of power are threateningly aimed at Christendom and its religions. W’ho can deny Christendom’s fear as she sees these hostile forces rising up on every side? They read the handwriting on the wall. So certainly it is time for us to help men of good will to see and discern the disgusting thing and to flee to the mountains for safety.

That Word is tried and tested and it is pure. (Prov. 30:5) Throughout the centuries it has been preserved to stand bright and clean now in the midst of a corrupt and decayed system of things. Its great Source being complete, righteous and holy, this Word is sufficient and is not subject to addition or reduction. No question about it, persons who love righteousness and all that it implies must turn to this holy Word of God because therein alone lies guidance in uprightness. So pure, holy and precious is it, and so beautiful its component parts, that the seasonable word is compared to golden apples in silver settings. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font4"> 1</span></p>

It might be they will make it appear they have accomplished their purpose and for this reason cry, “Peace and security!” Then it is that Christ reveals himself to the nations in all the majesty and power of his great invisible presence. Until that time, courage, faithful slaves of Jehovah! “Let us stay awake and keep our senses.” The way of maintaining the favored position is clearly marked out before us and the victory feast is certain.

<p><span class="font4">Joy bubbles forth from our hope. And this joy works for our endurance. Christ provided the perfect example of how hope, joy and endurance work toward one another. His hope laid the foundation for his immeasurable joy. That hope was to buy the treasure hidden within the sphere of God’s universal organization; namely, the headship of Jehovah’s capital organization. His hope prompted him to act joyfully: “For the joy he has he goes and sells what things he has and buys that field.” If Jesus had looked only at the present he could never have endured the agonizing trial that faced him. He could never have met the test of endurance successfully. But his mind was perfectly mature; he rejoiced in the hope ahead. As a result his intense sufferings were “momentary and light,” as are the sufferings of his followers who keep the mental attitude which was in him. That his hope brought joy and his joy, endurance, there can be no doubt, for we read that “for the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font4"> 3, 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Circumstances arose in totalitarian lands where the brothers in court under oath were faced with two evil alternative courses. One was to tell all and incriminate and expose the brothers and oneself to persecution. The other was to refuse to answer questions while on the witness stand and be held for contempt of court. In like circumstances today it is up to each one to choose whether he wants to answer or not. Refusal means punishment. He can choose to stay silent and go to prison or to speak and multiply his punishment or place his brothers in danger. This, however, is not to say a person should always remain silent before an unjust court. There are times when good can be accomplished to the honor of Jehovah’s name by giving a bold witness. (Matt. 10: 17-20) So it is left to the accused Christian to judge whether it is advisable under the circumstances to speak freely or not; but if one chooses to speak he must tell the truth.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 58:12, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Preparatory to Jesus’ work of restoring the “old paths'’ John the Baptist did an “Elijah” work among the Israelites, calling the people to repentance. As a nation they refused to repent; only a remnant of them remained faithful, but not in suflicicnt numbers to make up the heavenly Royal House of 144,000. But because of Christ’s sacrifice and Jehovah’s undeserved kindness the invitation went out to the nations to take out of them a people to make up the Royal Palace. Satan’s scheme to prevent true religion’s being restored was defeated, and the break he attempted failed. At this time, then, Christ was “The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in,” because he repaired and restored true religion by maintaining integrity and holding faithfully to his Bather’s purpose, and honoring and exalting the name of Jehovah. Thereby he furnished the perfect example for those who follow in his steps now. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1 </span><span class="font4">4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">By continually trying to engage in all features of the service we prove that we are the ‘right kind of ministers of Christ Jesus,’ joyfully sharing with Jehovah in building up his New World society, to his everlasting praise. Well do we realize that one cannot truly worship Jehovah today without taking part in the work he now assigns to be done for his purposes. Even blind and bedridden ones can, little by little, cultivate and strengthen the habit of tactfully preaching to visitors, or by an occasional letter to friends, telling clearly about the new world, its perfect government and the blessings in store for all who choose now to serve and love Jehovah, its Maker. When little else can be done in the ministry because of physical infirmities, still one can regularly pray to God and supplicate him on behalf of those able to work. This right practice Paul emphasized. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span><span class="font4"> 6a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 103:2, 3, 5, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We ought to bless Jehovah and his holy name, for have we not seen all his benefits? He has healed us and helped us into the path of the living. He has provided the truth for all to follow and to benefit by it. He has redeemed us from destruction in this old world because we have come into his New World society. He has crowned us with loving-kindness and he has shown us his tender mercies by making his Word accessible. If we study his Word, he will satisfy every desire. Then each one of ns can say: ‘I have the truth. I know Jehovah. I appreciate that I can work for him and that I can gain life by continually taking in knowledge of him.’ And what does that do to us? It keeps us young; it keeps us alive; it keeps us active in his New World society, as representatives of him. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font4"> 18, 19</span></p>

We should not corrupt the purity of our brotherly affection. By purity and sincerity in this regard we can recommend ourselves to others, so that they have no fear of evil motives on our part. Paul did that. Hypocritical love makes its possessor, not something, but nothing. It is not the greatest quality when ranked with faith and hope. It is the worst thing, because it is a counterfeit of the greatest thing. Quite fittingly the hypocrites come into judgment of Gehenna. The “evil slave” class who abuse their brothers are cast out by the Lord, to have their part with the hypocrites. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font4"> 11</span></p>

This means they must carefully inform themselves on such instructions and must study them over to get the understanding of their meaning and also of their implication, thus being able to take care of many things that are not expressly stated in the instructions.

So when people ask you as one of Jehovah’s witnesses what you are trying to do, what the purpose of your witnessing is, tell them the truth, for remember, ‘Jehovah hates a false witness that utters lies.’ Do not hesitate or evade speaking the truth when asked the purpose of your witnessing. You know it is to have “this good news of the kingdom . . . preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness.” W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">8/1</span><span class="font4"> 9, 10a</span></p>

It could only be Jehovah-inspired and made possible by the power of holy spirit. It is this spirit from the Creator that quickens the mind, making it alive to heavenly hopes. Both the anointed remnant and the hundreds of thousands of the “other sheep” are deeply grateful for this marvelous provision of God’s workmanship, namely, the kingdom of the heavens. The kingdom of priests is the temple and will be the highest place in the universe. It means a habitation for Jehovah by spirit, and this is something the Most High has not possessed before.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The word here translated “substance” signifies the underlying foundation, that which becomes a foundation for another thing to stand on. Thus Weymouth’s translation (third edition) defines faith as “a well-grounded assurance of that for which we hope.” Now what is “assurance” ? Is it conviction, a firm belief? Even more! For according to lexicographers “conviction is a belief established by argument or evidence; assurance is belief beyond the reach of argument.” Surely, then, we can understand the rich meaning of the rendering from the A&lt; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">w </span><span class="font4">World </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Translation:</span><span class="font4"> “Faith is the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">assured</span><span class="font4"> expectation of things hoped for.” Eve never had a “well-grounded assurance” or “assured expectation” of that for which she hoped.

(1 Tim. 1 : 11, IV W) He is the very source of true happiness. From him flow every blessing and every perfect present. As the “Father of the celestial lights” he is ever at the maximum height of his powers to bring happiness and blessings to his associates. Unlike our physical sun, with him there is no buildup to a topmost position of power nor is there a passing from such a zenith to a decline.

To say that there is no theocratic organization smacks of lawlessness or anarchism, for that would mean God has no organization and does not have his people, his flock, organized. It is more important for him to have his living, intelligent creation organized than for him to have his inanimate creations, the sun, moon and stars, organized ; for the unity, harmony, peace and working effectiveness of his universe depend upon their being theocratically organized and operated. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font4"> 1</span></p>

But is such openly displayed horror based upon the right view and understanding of the Scriptures concerning these last days? No. And generally the gossiper has what he said swing around back at him, and then there is trouble for him, trouble explaining, trouble apologizing, trouble in grief at seeing the harm he has done to those who have become offended at God’s truth and the organization.

First of all, faithfulness under test contributes to the vindication of Jehovah’s name and Word. This was true in the case of Jesus and all others of Jehovah’s slaves, past and present. Obedience is learned and perfected under such endurance. Then, too, the trials of Jesus’ apostles and their associates resulted in their being scattered abroad. So the gospel message within them was carried into many lands. Further, these tests do a refining work among the servants themselves, cleansing and equipping them for grander work Jehovah has in store for them. Never at any time do these tests get out of hand, nor are Jehovah’s people left at the mercy of the Devil and his hordes. Throughout the tests Michael, who stands for the children of his people, is ever on the alert to see to it that the fire is well within the bounds of his control. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1 </span><span class="font4">15, 17, 18, 21</span></p>

Having dedicated our lives to Jehovah God it is now a matter of continual, neverending service. It is not just doing a little now and then. It is not just a hobby, or a pastime, but, “Every day will I bless you.” Our service to Jehovah is our worship.

<p><span class="font4">Note, Jehovah does not spare merely on the grounds of sonship. No, the emphasis is on the proof of sonship by service rendered. This is how Jehovah makes manifest those whom he considers righteous (though needing much mercy), and those who are judged as wicked and hence blotted out of his book. (Mal. 3 : 18) And how does God spare those sons who cling to his service? By extending to them mercy and loving-kindness, removing their transgressions from them “as far as the east is from the west.” That means that he really forgives and forgets. Further, Jehovah ever keeps in mind our frame, he remembers that we are dust and so pities us as a father pities his children. And in striking contrast with the brevity of man’s life, the merey and loving-kindness of Jehovah is “from everlasting to everlasting” to “such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his precepts to do them.”—Ps. 103:13, 14, 17, 18, AS. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span><span class="font4"> 14, 15a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The true religion involves the personal relationship, for it involves the decision of the creature to subject himself to the Creator. Such an act is virtuous, for it means that one is continually prompted to render to God the worship and reverence that are his by right. True worshipers find loving communion with the Creator and come to know and honor him as their own Supreme Lord, and love him as a Father, finding in his family and in his sacred service complete rest, happiness and peace. Hope is born and the prospects of entering into everlasting life become part of one’s life, and more so as one learns to believe and trust in the promises of Jehovah and Christ Jesus. Hope produced by true religion transforms the life. It nullifies the disappointments, trials and sufferings of the present existence under this evil system of things. This hope of life for all time can be given only from Jehovah through his Son. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font4"> 8, 9</span></p>

These priests and prophets persecuted Jeremiah, but he carried out his commission and fully proved he had the requirements necessary for the ministry. On one occasion they brought Jeremiah to the princes, accusing him of sedition and saying he was worthy of death. Because of his fearless testimony the tables were turned on the false priests and persecutors, the people saying, “This man is not worthy of death; for he hath spoken to us in the name of Jehovah our God.” It is even so today, for Satan has no new tricks; he just dresses the old ones up in new clothes.

<p><span class="font4">In view of the momentous period in which we live, this is no time for us to slack our hands. We have our divine commission we have our assignment of territory, we know our purpose, and we have the backing of the Most High God. Therefore, Go! advertise the established kingdom of God as man’s only hope for eternal peace ; disciple all nations with implicit trust in the one that is “with you all the days until the consummation of the system of things.” Go, “preach good tidings unto the meek” ; go, “proclaim liberty to the captives”; go, “comfort all that mourn”; and as you go, never show fear in proclaiming “the day of vengeance of our God.” Continue to preaeh this joyful news from door to door, on the streets and in the homes of the people until the Devil’s organization is wasted and emptied without an inhabitant. And, never forget it, Jehovah’s spirit, favor, blessing and prosperity will continue upon you and your work! </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font4"> 20a</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.—Matt. rlJf: H, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible shows that before anyone would be brought to complete responsibility a way of preparation would be made before the Lord. Only when those earnestly seeking him would have an opportunity to recognize that he is present in his kingdom would he suddenly appear to hold an accounting. The Scriptures show further that this first responsibility would be with the “house of God.” Then, Jesus pointed out, a full and complete warning would be given in all the inhabited earth by the preaching of “this good news of the kingdom.” Yes, Christ Jesus will bring “due punishment upon those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus.” (2 Thess. 1: 8, jVW<sup>7</sup>) Oue’s responsibility at the revelation of Christ at Armageddon therefore depends upon whether one accepts or rejects the good news of the Kingdom that Jesus said would be preached world-wide. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font4"> 3</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">And his master commended the steward, though unrighteous, because he acted with practical wisdom; , . . Also 1 say to you, Make friends for yourselves by means of the unrighteous riches, so that, when such fail, they may receive you into the everlasting dwellingplaces.—Luke 16:8, 9,</span><span class="font4"> A W'.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark355"></a><span class="font4">Dishonesty is not thus approved or applauded by Jesus in the parable he stated at Luke 16:1-8 regarding the unjust steward. Jesus never approves unrighteousness. Some have thought that the “master” referred to means the one who spoke the parable, Jesus Christ, but that is not so; he was not commending the dishonest steward. It is a mere reference to the master of the unjust steward, who could not help but admire the shrewdness of the unfaithful steward. Jesus showed how worldly ones make use of their means to ensure their future. The “sons of the light” must look to the future too and use their possessions and abilities to please Jehovah, and gain enduring riches of everlasting life. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font4"> 18a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The king granted the Jews that were in every city to gather themselves together, and to stand for their life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Esther 8:11, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Are not the modern-day witnesses of Jehovah in the same position as those ancient servants of God? Yes, exactly ! We must fight world-wide for our lives. Jehovah has commanded us to preach the good news. Our lives depend upon faithfully preaching it! In fact, necessity is laid upon all of us. Woe is to every last one of us if we do not publicly and fearlessly declare the good news. Satan knows that the way to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses, according to Ezekiel 33: 8, 9 (where Jehovah warns Ezekiel that failure to sound the warning will mean his death), is to force us to stop preaching in all the nations, as commanded by Jehovah. He knows that if we do we shall suffer death. To attempt to stop us he, therefore, frames mischief by law against us throughout the world. Since our lives are at stake we fight for freedom to preach. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1 </span><span class="font4">3, 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">For what is our hope or joy or crown of exultation—why, is it not in fact you?—before our Lord Jesus at his presence? You certainly are our glory and jog.—1 Thess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2:19, 20, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our common purpose is the worship of the one true God Jehovah. His glory and beauty on the earthly organization of God’s servants are found in its faithful members who conform to the principles of righteousness ; and thus, in some measure, the glory of God is reflected. When you learn of Jehovah’s provisions and take your stand on his side, dedicating yourselves to him, and uphold his cause, you are the adornment of this Christian group. Jehovah knows those who are his, and if you are his he knows you and loves you, and you who are younger brothers in the worship and service of God are in fact as the joy of God’s earthly organization now. You have a great responsibility to keep clean and upright, not going along in the way of the nations which do not know God, because he “that shows disregard is disregarding, not man, but God, who puts his holy spirit in you.”—1 Thess. 4:8, AW. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font4"> 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hallelujah. Happy the man who reverences the Eternal, who finds rich joy in his commands!—Ps. 112:1, Mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As you face 1955 and the years beyond, do you feel like shouting “Hallelujah”? There is every reason for you to do so if you are a fearer of the One most high over all the earth, the God who alone has the name Jehovah. By practicing the fear of him you can entertain the best of prospects for 1955 and for all the years ahead, prospects of prosperity with happiness. That means a prosperity that will benefit you in heart as well as in body and mind, for it is a spiritual prosperity that gives happiness now and leads to endless life in the righteous new world, the foundation for which God has now laid. When we come to know and appreciate that real prosperity with happiness comes from Jehovah and is guaranteed to those who fear him, we cannot hold back from exclaiming “Hallelujah I” for that cry means “Praise Jehovah!” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The fruitage of the spirit is . . . joy.—Gal. 5:22, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Where can we find joy today and how can we find the best opportunity of bearing this fruit? There is only one answer, in Jehovah’s organization, Zion, wherein Jehovah’s own loving heart finds joyful satisfaction: “he will rejoice over thee with joy; ... he will joy over thee with singing.” (Zeph. 3:17, AS) We know, too, that Christ Jesus has entered into the “joy that was set before him” in being made the chosen instrument, as King, to bring to full fruition his heavenly Father’s glorious purpose and the complete vindication of his Father’s name. In this happy work all the Lord’s true followers are invited to share. Let us be faithful in the service of whatever Kingdom interests have been committed into our hands so that we may have the thrill of hearing and responding to that invitation: “Enter into the joy of your master.” And what greater joy is to be found than in seeking and finding and then feeding one of the Lord’s “other sheep”? </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1 </span><span class="font4">3, 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">By means of him we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one, yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Eph. 1:7, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To come under this release by ransom we must have faith of the same kind that Abraham had and, like him, we must back up that faith with works. Abraham believed Jehovah and it was counted to him as righteousness. It gave him a good standing before God and, because of this, he is due for a resurrection and blessings of new-world life, made possible by Christ’s ransom. Paul and other believers of Jesus’ day laid down their earthly lives sacrifically, all dying faithful to God. Their faith, like Abraham’s, was counted to them as righteousness with God. It gave them a favorable standing and placed them in position to receive the “release by ransom” and all its benefits by imputation. Because of proving faithful as Christ’s fellow sacrificers to the death they will receive a resurrection to heavenly life to be joint heirs of Kingdom glory with Christ.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">6:14, 11, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With this suit of armor we can now be peaceful residents of earth and at the same time carry on a theocratic spiritual fight against the wicked spirit forces that use their earthly dupes to try to stop our freeness of speech. With the “sword of the spirit” we can do no bodily violence to anyone, but, instead, immense spiritual good. It has been said, “The pen is mightier than the sword,” meaning the literal sword. In turn the Word of God is mightier than the pen of worldly men, and hence is mightier than the literal sword. It is alive and “exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword.” Why, then, should we who are sanctified to the sacred theocratic warfare not use the mightier sword, the superior weapon, the spiritual sword, the Word of God, against our common enemy? Our mightiness in war lies in weapons from God, and these only we may use. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font4"> 17b</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">These men that have upset the inhabited earth are present here also.—Acts 17: 6, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah does not propose to reform the irreformable, and neither do we. He is not attempting to straighten out this wicked generation, and neither are we. This old system is condemned by God and doomed to complete destruction. The charge that the early Christians “turned the world upside down” was, of course, entirely false. So also is the same charge today when leveled against Jehovah’s witnesses. The assignment we have from God is merely to warn all of the impending cataclysm of Armageddon, in order that all who will may now take advantage of Jehovah’s provision for safety. Instead of seditiously disturbing the peace within nations, or agitating revolt among the people, the work of Jehovah’s witnesses has an exactly opposite effect. The momentous announcement of God’s theocratic government now being made by his witnesses gives real contentment and tranquillity with peace of mind. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font4"> 15, 16a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ue hath swallowed up death for ever; and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces.—Isa. 25:8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time is steadily drawing closer when the resurrection will be a reality to those who will live on the earth. Think of the joy Christ and his heavenly joint heirs will have as they administer the merit of Christ’s ransom sacrifice during Christ's great Kingdom sabbath to lift billions of earth’s dead out of the pit of death. Think of the joy of Jehovah’s other sheep in the paradise earth when notification comes from Jehovah, telling his organization to prepare to receive the resurrected dead. And the joy of arranging for the feeding, housing, educating and training of the resurrected multitudes to fill their places in the New World society ! How heart-cheering to look to the time when perfected human society hears Jehovah’s expressed approval justifying them as worthy of permanent life! What a loving and thoughtful God we serve I Truly his resurrection promise should stir us to greater activity now. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font4"> 25a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2:15, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just as a ship may be blown out to sea again and flounder disastrously if the anchor is not sturdy enough, so with our spiritual support. We have the best ground for fastening our “anchor”—in the promises of Jehovah. But if our anchor is flimsy, not even the good ground can hold our ship of faith steadfast during violent storms of tribulation. Therefore never think that while attending </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies we can nod and doze off, believing that just one wink will not weaken our anchor. If one is dozing at the time vital truths are being explained, one’s ship of faith is not being built up. Then, too, how can one defend his ship of faith, which is attached to his hope, unless he uses </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4"> the weapons in the arsenal of revealed truths of God’s Word? “Let us put on the weapons of the light.” “Always [be] ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font4"> 13a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.—Ps. 51: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This shows children need guidance; it also shows they will not be perfect. Expect neither too much nor too little. The rules of conduct should be clear to them, and fair and with merciful allowances. Remember their age. After reasonable rules are established and the child knows them, enforce them with promptness and consistency, so the child knows what to expect. Otherwise the child will be emboldened to chance violations to see how far he can go and how much he can get away with, just as adults become bold in evil-doing when retribution seems to lag. If discipline is not fair and consistent the very keen sense of justice possessed by children will be offended and resentment will arise. So correct in fairness and firmness, tempered by love and merey. Jehovah remembers our frame is dust; let us remember the child’s also is dust.

<p><span class="font4">A lie is a false statement to another who is entitled to hear the truth and which tends toward injury to the other. A false statement made for the purpose of deceiving and working injury to an innocent person is a deliberate and malicious lie. History well proves this. Jehovah appointed the covering cherub as man’s overseer in the garden of Eden. Faithfulness to God and duty to man required the covering cherub to tell the truth. Eve was entitled to know the truth. The covering cherub stated to her that the eatiug of the forbidden fruit would not result in her death, but that the eating thereof would result in great wisdom to her. By that false statement Eve was deceived and she induced Adam to join her. A false statement resulted in their death and brought suffering and death upon all mankind. The covering cherub’s statement to Eve was therefore a deliberate, wicked and malicious lie. It was the beginning of lying. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1 1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">112:9, RoPss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The generosity of the Jeho-vah-fearing Christian does not limit itself to giving material things to needy brothers, but concerns itself greatly with distributing the Kingdom news to all men of good will, the scattering abroad of the seed of Kingdom truth upon those whose hearts are like good, productive ground. While the earth today teems with people materially poor, the poor to whom the wise fearer of Jehovah gives are those who are “conscious of their spiritual need,” and hence disposed to accept the satisfying Kingdom message. These are the kind of poor Jesus sent his followers to hunt and feed. What they are able to “give free” must be the spiritual riches that God has bestowed upon them free. By giving the Kingdom message instead of mere material things they reach those who are really “conscious of their spiritual need,” rather than just the self-seeking poor of this world who do not care to belong to Jehovah.—Matt. 10:8; 5:3, AW.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 34:1, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do you feel and talk that way? Do you want to bless Jehovah at all times, and continually praise him with your mouth? If you do, what happens? Others who are meek will hear your praise. One who has come to Jehovah and keeps on devoting his life in service will talk regularly, and the meek will hear his talk; and then they will be invited to magnify Jehovah with him, and to exalt his name together. And then the meek will respond to the invitation: “Let us exalt his name together.” Now, are you going to do this praising and exalting of Jehovah in this forty-first year of his established kingdom? The New World society is globally organized to do just that, and it is doing a great work, not because of its numbers, but because Jehovah’s active force is activating it. All who come into Jehovah’s organization feel its power. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font4"> 23</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Christians must speak God’s Word to one another to build one another up spiritually, to comfort and to urge them onward in the right course: “Comfort one another with these words.” Speakers appointed to do so should preach the Word to congregations, and all the members of the congregations must preach the Word to all the inhabitants of the land. Not only should love be shown by speaking at all but love should be shown by the care we use as to our words and forms of expression and illustrations. The tongue must be used, not as a fire set aflame by Gehenna to cause our hearers everlasting destruction, but as the “tongue of the wise,” which imparts health mentally and spiritually to the hearers. Let our tongues be the medium of the words of life. There is no arguing about it: wc must love in word and with the tongue, and we must do that toward God as well as our neighbor.

<p><span class="font4">World wide persecution forces us to use every possible method in the fight for freedom to preach. Our method of fighting must of necessity vary in different countries, because it must be legal. Democratic countries permit us to appeal to “Caesar” by defending ourselves in the courts, and in such countries we freely appeal to the courts for the defense of the right to preach. In other nations we must appeal to the heads of the state, such as the president or prime minister. This we do. We claim our rights and argue before them as did Moses before Pharaoh. Time and again we have appealed to the authorities to lift bans against our work in certain lands. We also petition authorities to permit the importation of literature and appeal to officials to allow missionaries to enter a country.

How circumspectly, therefore, we should walk in this day of judgment I Regardless of whether we hope to be one of the associates of Jehovah’s Royal High Priest, or one of his subjects, faithful obedience is required of us. All must walk in fear and trembling because negligence, unfaithfulness, unbelief and disobedience will merit disqualification, and to those disapproved ‘there remains no more sacrifice for sins.’ Let us therefore hold fast our confidence and be always grateful for Jehovah’s undeserved kindness and for the sacrifice of his beloved Son. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span><span class="font4"> 11, 12a</span></p>

They wanted to appear before others to be something that they really were not. If they had told the truth, if they had said they were giving part of the price they received, they would have done no wrong. But their hearts were not right. Jehovah searched down into the innermost parts of their hearts to see what their motives were, why they were doing what they had done. He found their hearts were bad. The result to them was the adverse judgment of God. Their case shows that persons can be disfellow-shiped for lying, for Jehovah disfellowshiped them permanently.

<p><span class="font4">Today we do not have much difficulty appreciating the cleansing work that had to be done among the professed people of God before 1926; but back there they did not see the need as we do today. It was a great trial upon the faithful. The effect of these tests was to drive the unfaithful and. ungodly out of the organization and into the Devil’s camp and to reveal to all the discerning, intelligent observers just who were the faithful servants of God. Jehovah knew that just as the Devil and his demons fought to prevent the return of the remnant of the Israelites in 537 B.C., so they would viciously fight a thousandfold harder to oppose the deliverance of the Christian congregation, to prevent their proclaiming the Kingdom’s establishment and its blessings.

He grants to these theocratic, legal recognition, favors and blessings as associates in his happy organization. He purposes good, that which works for unending happiness and pleasure to himself as God-King and to all those in holy union and harmony with him. The holy God expresses his purpose of good toward his servants by providing them with opportunities to experience progressive states of happiness. In any one period of time the true state of happiness enjoyed is the condition of full contentment, delight and exhilaration as to the abundance of good things ever newly brought forth by the happy God for the pleasure and gladness of those who are his friends in lawful union with him. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span><span class="font4"> 3, 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Not all fruit is the same fruit. The word fruit, or fruitage, occurs many times in Scripture, referring to many different things, both good and evil. But all the references have this in common, the idea of something produced, the natural and logical outcome, or outgrowth, or produce, resulting from certain causes or course of action. In view of the Kingdom’s having been established and a Kingdom organization’s having been built up on earth, all the fruitage that we produce, by the help of God’s spirit, can properly be called Kingdom fruitage. But even this good fruitage can be looked at from different angles. Since iu the parable of the great Sower the seed sown is the Word of truth, the Kingdom message, it follows that the fruitage we must produce is that of bearing witness to yet others with that same message and thus help to multiply the Kingdom interests. That is one rule, and the main one, governing the use of fruit bearing at John chapter 15. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font4"> 8, 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jesus, in his detailed prophecy on evidences that would mark the “time of the end” when he would be invisibly present, said he would then appoint a “faithful and discreet slave.” The world events since 1914, and particularly the events among Jehovah’s people since 1918, give visible evidence that the Lord Jesus Christ, having come into his kingdom, has come to God’s spiritual temple to carry on the final judgment at the “house of God” and, in expression of his judgment work, he has found a “faithful and discreet slave” and has appointed him over all his belongings, all his visible Kingdom interests on earth. (1 Pet. 4: 17) Hence in order to render complete recognition of the theocratic organization today, we have to take recognition of this “faithful and discreet slave” that the returned Lord and Judge has appointed over all his belongings. We cannot sidestep this. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font4"> 13</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">If it is a bond of union it must draw and hold us together, not separate us, not scatter us. Difficulties should not be of long continuance between brothers but should be ironed out at the earliest in the interest of everyone’s being of the same mind in the Lord. God’s creation hangs together through power from him, and the new world of righteousness will also hang together. It is just ahead, so that a great crowd of this present generation may survive in the “ark” to enter into it from its start. Armageddon will not miraculously change our disposition toward our brothers, suddenly making us amiable. We must change it now. True, Armageddon can blot out dispositions, but the dispositions it blots out will be of those it destroys. One thing is certain : True love will survive Armageddon and so will those who practice it. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font4"> 35</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">death to life.—John 5:24, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do you appreciate that Jehovah in the past has done much for you to talk about, that he is accomplishing great things now that must be mentioned to others not informed, and do you understand what he is going to do in the future, and that this you must declare? Has he revealed himself to you through his Word? If so, and if you are acquainted with his Word, then you must tell others what you know. You have come to know how to gain eternal life. With life you are able to do things yourself and to express yourself. If death is your goal, you have no incentive to make expression : “for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in Sheol.” But Jehovah’s people are expressive people because they believe and want to live. You will want to talk about the things you learn from God’s Word because you want to live in Jehovah’s kingdom and you want others to live in it also.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—2 Thess. 1:1, 8, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why do the nations not realize the approach of this climax of judgment? Because they have not heeded the worldwide advertising of Christ’s second presence.

And since 1914 physical evidences establishing this truth have been repeatedly published in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font4">The nations continue to ignore this sign and refuse to recognize that a time of judgment is even now in progress. They cannot see that Christ appeared in the temple for judgment in 1918, and that since then a division as between sheep and goats has been going on among the people right before their very eyes. They willfully close their ears to the warning message that a climax of judgment is fast approaching when Jesus will be so completely revealed to the world that his presence will be indisputable. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font4"> 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The early Christians were different from the rest of the corrupt world, not, however, because they were queer or off balance in their senses, but in that they were devoted to truth and righteousness and the service of Jehovah. Actually, those early Christians were very intelligent and wiser than their opponents, who were so dull of hearing and perception they could not recognize the way that leads to life. Christians of the first century had zeal, enthusiasm, determination, power and endurance in far greater measure than devotees of other religions. Such driving forces were supplied by Jehovah, and those early Christians acknowledged this source of their strength. Yes, it is Jehovah’s active force that enables faithful followers of Christ to push ahead amid such violent and fiendish opposition. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font4"> 18, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">19</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">If anyone is at warfare it is Jehovah’s witnesses. For the past six thousand years few, if any, have been the centuries that have not been disturbed by warfare between fleshly contenders and reddened by the blood of the slain. But for these witnesses of the Most High God it has been a continual warfare, a lifelong conflict, a daily battle, with no furloughs granted them by the One for whom they have fought, with no truces, no armistice, through all the sixty centuries. With heavenly aid they have been able to endure until now, so that Jehovah’s witnesses are still upon the scene of action today, and the fight goes on. They will not abandon it, for theirs is a holy warfare, a sacred conflict, in the midst of an ungodly world. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font4"> 1</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 112:1, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This psalm not only describes the truly happy person on earth but is prophetic. It points forward and identifies the happy man or class of men in our time. Who is the class of people, the collective “man” of our day? We are not left to ourselves to make an answer that might call forth the indignant cry of partiality, racial prejudice or national pride! The divine Inspirer of the psalm himself supplies the unerring answer, using one of his writers of the Bible to quote from this psalm and apply it to the class of people whom God himself had in mind. It is the spiritual Israelites, those who are Jews inwardly, of whom there is a remnant of some thousands yet on earth. (Rom. 2: 28, 29) In 1931, that they might be correctly identified before all the world, they embraced the name marked out in the Bible and that has since become notable throughout the earth, Jehovah’s witnesses. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font4">3, 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">7:9, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Royal House having been rebuilt, Jehovah is now assembling from all nations another class, namely, the other sheep of the Right Shepherd. Jehovah does not call humans to two classes at the same time, and then let them choose what they would like to do. No, he is not the author of confusion. The invitation to one class closes down and that to another opens up. There is nothing strange about this, for Jehovah dealt in the same way when Jesus commenced preaching. Then John the Baptist identified himself as the friend of the Bridegroom and as the one decreasing and Christ Jesus as the Bridegroom and the one increasing. (John 3:29, 30) So it is in these last days: the general invitation to be of the Christ concludes and another class appears, a mighty crowd. Note the words “After these things I saw,” which clearly mean that after the elect have been gathered together then another class appears.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11:1, HW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Christ Jesus as a man on earth was a perfect example of one who possessed the necessary requirements for his God-given ministry. A diligent student of Jehovah’s Word, Jesus as youth and adult followed its instructions implicitly. His ministry was his life’s work. He had no other interest on earth, but gave all his time and talent to his assigned task. His followers were well instructed for the work he assigned to them after his death and resurrection, and they performed it well. Like Jesus, his faithful apostle Paul was wholly devoted to Jehovah’s service. “One thing” occupied his interest and attention: the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom. Paul did not try to do many things. He likened himself to a soldier who kept from involving himself with worldly business in order that he might please his superior. All his time and strength he devoted to his assigned ministry. Can we, like Paul, say, “Become imitators of me, even as I am of Christ”?

Not only is this true relative to theocratic activities, but it is specially true with respect to personal conduct.

<p><span class="font4">Christendom has chosen Caesar governments instead of Christ—a disgusting thing that seals her desolation.

But she cannot halt the ingathering to the new system of things. Those fleeing to the symbolic mountains will remember what befell the Jews that delayed flight or tried to salvage worldly wealth, out of line with Jesus’ instructions to his disciples. Without delay and without worldliness they will flee, appreciating that we now live in the urgent period parallel to A.D. 66-70. As Jehovah did then, so now he allows time for flight.

<p><span class="font4">Do you marvel at the resurrection hope? Surely there is nothing unreasonable or farfetched about the possibility of a resurrection. Think of that musician who can remember and accurately reproduce, not just one piece of music with all its notes, but many and varied such pieces. We readily admit that mere man, with his many limitations and imperfections, has marvelous capabilities within the scope of his memory. Why, then, should we think that the almighty and infinite Creator, the One who made man’s mind and knows exactly how it works, has not the power to call back from the memorial tomb and re-create all those whom he has held in his memory, including all their traits and mental impressions? As Paul once pertinently asked: “Why is it judged unbelievable among you men that God raises up the dead?” There is only one answer. “Do not marvel at this.”—Acts 26:8; John 5:28, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

<p><span class="font4">In this fight to maintain integrity it is not easy for one to go contrary to the ways and thinking of this old world. It is far from the coward’s course, though the world may use this false accusation to intimidate and force the Christian into parallel with its mad rush toward destruction. For, instead of love and reasoning, this world uses the whip of fear or pride or selfishness. By reason of this dictators can hold entire nations in subjection, people being afraid to maintain cherished principles of righteousness by speaking out or taking an open stand. By their silence they tacitly approve and so bring themselves under community condemnation with the wicked nation. Fear of death is their terror. If people had true knowledge of the resurrection they could be free of such fear. Without such understanding and faith we cannot maintain integrity.

<p><span class="font4">If questions are asked regarding a brother and the questioner is not one who is entitled to know at the time of inquiry, then it is best for a Christian brother to mind his own business and protect his brother by saying nothing in reply. Discourage persons who try to prv into the business of others. In other words, it is good to avoid gossip, starting rumors, or finding fault with the brothers. Remember, Jehovah hates not only a witness who speaks lies, but also one that sows discord among the brothers. Whispering about any brothers is to be avoided. If you think someone has done wrong, very well; if you want to say something about it, go directly to him. Do not start a whispering campaign. In plain language the admonition is that we should mind our own business and our business should be in accord with Jehovah’s Word; then we shall have no dilliculty or trouble due to busy-bodying. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1 </span><span class="font4">6a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">As far as God himself is concerned, and perhaps, too, as far as his loyal and perfect creatures in heaven are concerned, there is not the slightest need for him to strengthen his word. But God, when making that promise to Abraham, stepped in with an oath: “As</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">suredly</span><span class="font4"> in blessing I will bless you.” (Heb. 6: 14, A<sup>7</sup>IF) That sworu oath makes the promise a solemn declaration of binding force, a legal guarantee, which cannot be broken. Hence, with the oath added to the promise, we have that exceedingly strong combination that makes up the “two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie.” Yes, God’s oath-bound promise constitutes the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">legal</span><span class="font4"> foundation of the new world, because its operation, under the administration of the King, is for the very purpose of completely fulfilling the Abraham-ic covenant for the blessing of all the families of the earth. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font4"> 18, 19</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah specifically ordered priests to the front when he gave commandment for the Israelites in their battles in the Holy Land. It was suitable that the fighters of Jehovah’s wars should have his direct representative give them encouragement right there at the battle front. (Deut. 20: 1A) However, it was not required of the priests themselves to do any of the fighting. The sounding of the battle signal also called for the presence of the priests in the heart of the camp. No others than they could give the battle signal for a victorious onslaught against the foe. (Num. 10:2, 8, 10) It was the Levite priests who sounded the battle signal with the silver trumpets that animated the whole army, causing the rank and file to move into action. The trumpet sound was an appeal for help from on high. It was like an alert to God to go into action with them and give victory, for it was a priestly sound. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15 </span><span class="font4">2,3a</span></p>

As far as the danger of becoming egotistical is concerned, the above words of Paul show this to be our biggest internal enemy. How, then, are we going to be helped in getting the right viewpoint of ourselves in order to avoid this danger? We need to view ourselves in the way Jehovah sees and deals with us today, namely, primarily as a people, gathered to his theocratic organization, Zion. Many prophecies speak of this gathered people, and in one place Isaiah shows the result of the pouring out of God’s spirit upon them: the wilderness becomes a fruitful field and the fruitful field a forest; with justice, righteousness, peace, quietness and confidence being the lot of God’s people.

Neither could it be a body constructed to be the exact duplicate of the body at the moment of death, for if a person had a mutilated body at death he would not return in the same way. Through the miraculous power granted him by Jehovah, Christ can construct for the resurrected ones bodies that are reasonably sound. Will they be perfect fleshly bodies? No, they will be reasonably sound and healthy bodies. They will receive training and instruction from Christ during his thousand-year reign. Continuing in the path of obedience, they will have the curative powers of Christ’s ransom applied to them, removing the death process until every trace of imperfection is gone and they stand with sparkling, invigorating life force filling every cell and tissue of their bodies. 17 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span><span class="font4"> 15-17a</span></p>

Philip, the evangelist or missionary, carried the good news north into Samaria and succeeded in establishing a congregation in the city, the members of which he baptized. One important thing the congregation lacked : the holy spirit with its miraculous gifts. Recognizing the theocratic organization and knowing that the miraculous gifts of the spirit could be imparted only by the apostles or in their immediate presence, Philip sent word up to Jerusalem. That was an unselfish, loyal recognition of the theocratic organization by an evangelist or missionary. The apostolic governing body sent down the apostles Peter and John.

No. He accepted the willing sacrifice of his Son’s life, for it to be used in behalf of those who would appreciate its value and what it meant on the part of God and his Son. Thus his supreme love in giving his Son was not in vain. It was most practical. The faithful sacrifice of human life also brought the Son the reward of immortal privileges and honors in heaven, and his sacrifice was used in laying the foundation for a clean, upright new world. Denying God’s sacrifice of his Son as if it were a barbarism means not knowing God, really not loving him, for God is love. That means he is permeated through and through with it and expresses it perfectly. “The love is in this respect, not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent forth his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice.”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font4">John </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font4"> :10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

Jesus expected to be persecuted and he warned his followers to expect it. The mistreatment we receive, therefore, is no surprise to us. It is not as though it were unexpected. Rather than discouraging us, it encourages us, for it proves to us that we are the ones worthy to bear his name.

He is the Befriender of the poor and needy. The “man” that fears him makes it his aim to imitate Him in these regards. He gives generously of his spiritual gifts, not expecting a material reward ; and he does so gently, not trying to embarrass anyone, not threatening or reproaching or addressing in abusive terms even the ones that refuse the good news of the Kingdom unselfishly preached to them.

In Eden, Satan called into question the veracity of God’s word, his workmanship and the honor of his name, yes, and even his good purposes toward the human pair. The enormity of this crime can be understood only when we consider the nearly 6,000 years of sinning, sickness and death inflicted on the human race. How despicably selfish and rebellious to the extreme even to cast a doubt upon the word of the Creator! Those sinister words “Is it really so that God said”-—partly interrogative and partly simulated astonishment—were designed to arouse suspicion and distrust of the Creator. Yes, the depths of Satan’s wickedness are hereby revealed. His plan of action was to cut the binding tie between the human pair and Jehovah, to make a breach that would be impossible to repair and to restore to its original soundness. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font4"> 11</span></p>

The great heavenly reward will be theirs only if they serve Jehovah in complete obedience and make him their inheritance. However, though their hearts must be set on it, the faithful ones may not serve merely for the sake of the promised heavenly reward. Further, all such must remain in a cleansed condition, in a purified state by the preciousness of the blood of Christ and his available righteousness.

<p><span class="font4">Jesus not only healed the sick physically but also opened the way for spiritual recovery. So when Jesus rode into Jerusalem to present himself as king, a division among the people took place. The multitudes who had prepared themselves by listening to him hailed him as king. On the other hand, the chief priests, who had refused his works, now manifested their attitude by refusing to recognize and anoint him with holy oil in the manner of accepting kings in Israel. At Pentecost this division became even more marked when Christ manifested his favor toward those following him by pouring out God’s active force upon them. It was at this time that they were entrusted with the stewardship of God’s service and anointed with his spirit to preach the good news of the resurrection of Jesus. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15 </span><span class="font4">4a</span></p>

As Jehovah’s name-people we are still able to praise our God enthusiastically and worship him day and night, and we are fully aware of Jehovah’s interest in us. We therefore continually talk of the goodness of Jehovah God and advertise his kingdom. We preach the Word and, like our God, we are happy. Jehovah continues to reveal himself to us; we know Jehovah and are glad to express ourselves regarding him. He has shown us immeasurable kindness, and has been forgiving and long-suffering with us as well as with all mankind.

<p><span class="font4">This pronouncement in the first place declares that Jehovah’s irresistible and omnipotent power will be displayed in all its terrible majesty when the Devil and his entire company of rebels are utterly destroyed. Furthermore, it is made certain that Jehovah’s name, word and purposes will be declared, published and witnessed about throughout the earth in order that people who love God may have the opportunity to escape destruction and become a part of a New World society which will fill earth with righteousness. It is therefore quite clear that from the very beginning of man’s deflection from the truth Jehovah purposed to have a people in the earth who would be faithful to his cause, a people who would be his witnesses, a people for his name, a people even called by his noble name, that is, Jehovah’s witnesses.

Some of them, like the Devil, try to be light bearers and they try to add to God’s Word in order to make themselves appear to be right and truthful. But Jehovah does not allow these men to get away with their wicked schemes. He turns the light of truth from his Word upon what they say and his Word of truth reproves them and shows them up to be liars, for it is the most powerful force in existence to combat lies. Because he is the father of truth, Jehovah hates a lying tongue or a false witness that speaks lies. Men may lie, but it is not because God wants them to. God is not a liar. He expects men to tell the truth, too. Jesus originated with Jehovah, so he made a clear distinction between truth and lies. Representatives of Almighty God hear and speak the truth. They do not lie.

The Israelite that obediently took part in the fighting was said to light Jehovah’s battles. To be a battler for Jehovah is a high honor and a blessing, and Jehovah is with each theocratic battler. The divine blessing is upon him. Today there are Christian battlers for Jehovah, and in a way they display greater courage than did the Israelite battlers for Jehovah, because these Christian witnesses of Jehovah do not use carnal death-dealing weapons such as the Israelite warriors did and they will not use such violent weapons or raise private military squads even at the battle of Armageddon. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font4"> 13</span></p>

How shabby the false religious veneer of sanctimoniousness alongside the sound words of the Master spoken from the fullness of the heart of one facing death upon a torture stake! As surely as Jesus lived and died because of his worship of Jehovah, just so certain is the reality of his own sanctification of which he here spoke, and also of the sanctification of his body members, to which he here also made reference. Yes, sanctification for Christian men and women now upon earth is real, genuine, not an empty phrase to be merely spoken, but is a practical Christian way of life, God’s will for his people and a reality.

<p><span class="font4">To direct the right course of his free-will inferiors Jehovah established a mark of integrity, a mark indicating whether or not one was rendering exclusive devotion to his supreme Benefactor, the God-King; a mark placed a legal limit on certain actions beyond which it was divinely inadvisable for the creature to venture in exercising his freewill powers. Surely God had the absolute right to define the safe boundaries of the relative freedom of his created inferiors. Such limitations would constantly remind the creature of his inferior relationship, which was one of dependency, and that he should ever be conscious of ascertaining the divine will of his sovereign superior. Such legal restrictions worked no hardship on man nor was God thereby withholding something from man to which he had a legal right. Also, God had a right to test his friends as he did Abraham. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&gt;7 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4/15</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 6</span></p>

And true to past parallels, Jehovah will today put it into the hearts of radical political elements within the United Nations to desolate, hypocritical religion at the start of Armageddon. Even now within the United Nations there are a number of member nations, foremost of which is the Soviet Union, that are openly hostile to Christendom and its religions. Since 1945 some of the horns of the wild beast point ominously toward the harlot, menacing Christendom even as Israel was menaced by encircling armies in 609 B.C. and A.D. 66.

<p><span class="font4">Kindness means to be disposed to do good, to confer happiness, to be benevolent, sympathetic, merciful and obliging. It is a spontaneous expression of love. Kindness finds its source in Jehovah. Jesus stressed the point that we were to be like Jehovah who “is kind toward the unthankful and wicked.” (Luke 6:35, 36, A'W) When we take the Kingdom message to the people it is our golden opportunity to manifest this fruitage for the benefit and refreshment of others and that in spite of continuous indifference or opposition. Christ is the one specially chosen to explain aud exemplify Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. To those who enter his service he says: “My yoke is kindly and my load is light.” There is therefore every reason why we should respond readily and heartily to the apostle's appeal: “Become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave you.” —Eph. 4:32, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

There are sound Scriptural reasons for altering the methods of work in different countries. We are not sent into the world to go to jail. We do not choose to be dead martyrs.

<p><span class="font4">If we view the Jehovah-fear-ing man of the psalm as a collective person macle up of all members of Christ’s body, then the man’s seed or offspring are the “other sheep.” The Right Shepherd has been using this collective “man” to gather these into one flock. Their everlasting destiny is in this earth cleansed and made a “paradise of delight.” They will remain in it for all time. They become mighty in it, not just automatically.

It imparts a peace of mind at this time when “men become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth.” It urges us to keep integrity. It works for our ultimate salvation. “For we were saved in this hope.” Hope is essential. We cannot get along without it. If we could Paul would have reduced the Christian in-dispensables to a basic two: faith and love. But no! He found hope also indispensable. He did not stretch faith so as to make it include the contents of hope. lie knew that the test of endurance was yet ahead.

<p><span class="font4">Love “does not keep account of the injury.” In other words, do not hold a grudge against a spiritual brother. Those in the New World society must therefore guard against harboring resentment, sulking, getting moody, going over real or fancied injuries again and again in the mind and just growing colder and more bitter against a brother considered as an offender. The brother charged with the offense or guilty of it may follow the course Jesus outlined at Matthew 18: 15-17. Still the brother stays stubborn and refuses to allow for reconciliation; he does not want to let the offender off too easily, even if he is his spiritual brother. He prefers to make the contentions unbreakable like the gate-bar of a castle. He thus misses the opportunity to imitate God, who by Christ freely forgave us.

(Gal. 6:7, 8) Yet it is amid these sullied seas of delinquent humanity that we must navigate a course of morality and integrity, and one of the most anxious concerns of faithful parents is that their children will uot sink in these seas wdien they venture from the home port. Parents that are in the truth when their children are born have a blessed advantage. They have a head start on worldly associations. They have exclusive association with the child the first few months, and are its chief associates for the first few years, before it starts to school. If the parental association is good . it will entrench useful habits before bad associations make their assaults. When evil forces finally get at the child for attack he can repel their advances.

And while we do not have the apostles personally in the flesh to-daj' we do have their writings. These instruct us on how the true Christian congregation today should be organized and conducted with qualified overseers and ministerial servants, these being appointed by the governing body of the entire Christian congregation throughout the earth.

What a terrible plight they were in! They wanted to push the name of Jehovah from their memory. ‘We don’t want it!’ they said. But the faithful prophet would not even consider desisting from speaking in the name of Jehovah. Never will the faithful servant hesitate to preach the name and to declare the message from Jehovah, and never will true worshipers be found guilty of hiding the name Jehovah under such general titles as “Lord” or “God” to make his Word more acceptable to people in different parts of the world.

On the other hand, the religious leaders and those who would follow them were left desolated of God’s favor and allowed to remain for almost forty years to hear the resurrection of Christ preached. So Israel’s time of decision continued until A.D. 70, while those who had been “taken along” continued present with those who had been “abandoned.” This miniature foreshadow now finds a parallel in the time of Christ’s second manifestation and revelation. 17 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">6/15</span><span class="font4"> 6a</span></p>

It is for our own welfare that we abandon everything having to do with lies and stick close to the truth.

Then we shall keep ourselves free from every form of wickedness, including lying. —1 Thess. 5: 20-22, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">17:29, 30, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even as did Noah, so Lot also stands out in judgment against a people. Because of the wickedness of the men of Sodom and Gomorrah Jehovah sent his angels to bring a judgment of condemnation against them. Lot made an attempt to persuade the Sodomites to adhere to the righteousness of God, but they scorned him. When he warned his sons-in-law he seemed to them “like a man who was joking.” No doubt they still thought he was joking when the angels of Jehovah took Lot and his wife aud two daughters by the hand and led them out of the city. They did not recognize it as a manifestation of Jehovah’s favor until fire came down upon Sodom and Gomorrah. This revelation of the presence of Jehovah’s angels with righteous Lot was too late for their salvation. Jesus, at Luke 17:29, 30, clearly links his own revelation in our day with the execution of judgment. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font4"> 9, 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The safe course to pursue is to cultivate forward-looking minds. Hope helps us to do this. There is so much to hope for, so much to keep the mind looking ahead ; for the anointed remnant: heavenly glory, incorruptibility and the sublime privilege of reigning as kings and priests and judges for a thousand years with the new world’s King, Christ Jesus, seeing him “just as he is”! For the other sheep: everlasting life on earth, participating in the work of transforming the earth into a global paradise, sharing in the token fulfillment of the procreation mandate, exercising dominion over the animal creation, witnessing the general resurrection of the dead! And the crowning hope for both the spiritual remnant and the other sheep: to see the utter destruction of all of Jehovah’s enemies that the glorious name and word of Jehovah will be everlastingly vindicated. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font4"> 23a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Jehovah is no pacifist, but according to his righteous purpose he has resorted to war against his enemies and those of his people. He has never lost a battle, for his warfare is holy and righteous. He being the Theocrat, his wars or those he authorizes are theocratic wars. They are truly sanctified, sacred. Already in Moses’ day there was in existence “the book of the Wars of Jehovah.” This book may have begun with Abraham’s war against the kings who had captured his nephew Lot together with his family. This war was theocratic and Jehovah fought for his friend Abraham. Theocratic warfare specially became prominent in the case of the twelve tribes of Israel. Jehovah engaged in a war not only against Pharaoh and his war machine but also against the Egyptian demon gods. Throughout the fortyyear wilderness journey and all during the days of the judges ‘it was Jehovah who was fighting for Israel.’—Josh. 10:14, NW. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font4"> 9-11</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Unselfishly we carry the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom from house to house. But that is not the end of our work of love, for after having brought it into a home and having told its occupants the glories of Jehovah’s kingdom, we do not want them to forget it. Remember, we are so much more mature than those people to whom we have given the first taste of Jehovah’s truth. We have the truth settled in our minds; our faith has been made strong. Paul and Barnabas knew that. So they went back to their brothers whom they had given the truth; yes, to every one of the cities they had visited. They wanted to strengthen them in the Word of God, which, as Jesus said, is the truth. We today must follow that God-given pattern of action. The Watch Tower Society does it organizationally in sending district and circuit servants to the congregations. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font4"> 15, 16a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Clearly it is the new world of righteousness that God loved so much that he gave his Son to provide the basis for its establishment by the pouring out of his blood. It is a world now near at hand that will be inhabited by people who accept the free gift of life and who have been released from the condemnation of sin and death inherited from the common father Adam. Each person must by belief and right works demonstrate his personal desire for application of the ransom merit in his behalf. Here is where “release by ransom” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">for all men </span><span class="font4">individually is ruled out, because not all choose to serve God and accept the free gift. God does not discriminate against any in granting them the opportunity to receive life by means of the ransom, but neither does he force the ransom’s benefit upon men against their own choice.

<p><span class="font4">What Christian group is identified by the modern-day fulfillment of these words of Jesus? The facts speak for themselves, Jehovah’s witnesses. They are the ones who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake in all the nations. No other religious organization on earth has been persecuted for the name of Jehovah, for which also the name of Jesus stands. Does that make us sad? No! We are happy to be such favored people 1 Peter said : “Indeed, who is the man that will harm you if you become zealous for what is good? But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy.” So we, as Jehovah’s witnesses, will, by Jehovah’s help, hold to our freedom to preach. While it is a fight in many courts of the land and it means persecution to us, we enjoy it and cling to this glorious treasure of service, preaching world-wide. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font4"> 19-21</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">15:22, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time of the judgment in Eden Jehovah purposed a new thing. The resurrection would be necessary to accomplish it. This was a new creation, a royal theocratic organization of 144,001 kings as the capital part of his universal organization. These would be selected from among men who would show unbreakable integrity to death—a government the members of which the universe could ever depend on for justice, righteousness, adherence to Jehovah’s direction and principles of truth. By the resurrection Jehovah could also let his only-begotten Son, the one closest to him iu the universe and his Chief Executive Officer, be tried to the limit and raised again to heaven, this time to immortal life to be the Forerunner and Head of his royal brothers. Through this One the way is opened for a resurrection for others. His death and resurrection are a foundation for hope of all who desire life. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font4"> 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The above is not only for the encouragement of those who have the heavenly hope but also for all the “other sheep” invited to “inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the world’s foundation.” So let each one of us see to it that he builds industriously and discreetly on the Kingdom’s “foundation cornerstone.” On the one hand, do not run ahead of Jehovah and his organization and decide for yourself how to render acceptable, sacred service, for you will be in danger of acting </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ultra vires,</span><span class="font4"> that is, overstepping your legal rights. On the other hand, do not become sluggish and irregular in your Kingdom service. You will never build anything worth while that way, for “by slothfulness the root sinketh in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh.” No, ‘do not loiter at your business, but be aglow with the spirit.’ —E c c 1. 10 : 18, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">AS ;</span><span class="font4"> Rom. 12:11, jVIF. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font4"> 12, 13a</span></p>

Our public activity is not done because we have an inflated ego that demands public attention, or because we have a fanatical desire to be martyrs. Nehemiah and his associates did not undertake the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls because of a craving to hear their enemies ridicule them, but because of their supreme love for Jehovah and an intense, burning desire to see pure worship once again protected in the land which enabled them to move ahead with the work in spite of scoffer Sanballat and his cronies. Today the same devotion to Jehovah and his righteous worship moves us to action, notwithstanding the fact that “all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font4"> 13a</span></p>

They love his sheep and do all within their power to aid them to learn about the living God and his Christ and to become mature ministers. This they do by associating with fellow praisers of Jehovah in meetings arranged for the benefit of his servants. At these we learn how better to carry out our ministerial obligations and share in building up one another as active members of his New World society. There we are able to render valuable aid to the less mature and newer ones. These very things Jesus did among his disciples because he knew the sheep are in great need of help and comfort. Now, as in Jesus’ day, the sheep have been oppressed and fleeced by false shepherds. Those oppressors’ victims are deeply conscious of their spiritual need; they need instruction to help them in their ministry.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 112:1, Yg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Were the psalmist to behold Jehovah’s witnesses today he would again exclaim the above words. According to this, Jehovah’s witnesses should be the happiest people on earth. And is their happiness really such as to excite comment like that of the psalmist? Yes. Never was the world more unhappy, for it is in its “time of the end” and it looks forward in dread of what it sees coming. Never have Jehovah’s witnesses been happier, for they know from the prophecies of God’s Word that they are living in the “time of the end” of this joyless world, now that God’s kingdom for which they have long prayed has been set up in the hands of Christ, who is at the right hand of God in the heavens. Their happiness is not of a frivolous kind ; it has a solid foundation. It is associated with the highest wisdom, the wisdom that is from above and it is because they fear Jehovah that they have this heavenly wisdom. —Ps. 111:10, AS. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font4">5, 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In order to do right and tell the truth we have often to suffer at the hands of persecutors and those in the world who are against what is good. By doing right we share in the witness concerning Almighty God and have a part in the vindication of his name. It is pleasant to have a good conscience, but it is torture for a person to tell lies and go in the wrong way and have a bad conscience. If one tells the truth he does not have to keep worrying about keeping his stories straight. Why not tell the truth at all times and enjoy living with a clear conscience? If one has to suffer for telling the truth it is not so hard to bear when one is confident in conscience before Jehovah. It is a privilege to suffer for doing right and keeping a good conscience. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1 </span><span class="font4">29a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2:13-15, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The presence upon earth for forty years of solid, sound faithful members of the “little flock” of sanctified ones and also of members of the other sheep who have been long in the ministry is proof, not only that sanctification is Jehovah’s will for Christians, but also that it is something that can be maintained year after year. It is proved to be both real and possible. Those who recognize themselves to be of the body members of Christ thank Cod for the privileges they have had and are having now, and they know that they, too, must continue to stand firm and maintain their sanctification. They seek no retirement from service, no deflection inconsistent with their anointing. Their steps toward their heavenly prize have taken them too far along the way even to think of turning back at this late date. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font4"> 2a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 2:2, 3, Da.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When Jesus said, “Begin fleeing to the mountains,” did he mean literal ones? No, that would bring no safety at Armageddon. (Amos 9:2,3) The mountains must be outside Christendom’s system of things, just as the literal ones to which Christians fled after A.D. 66 were outside Jerusalem and Judah. The mountains to which lovers of righteousness now flee in obedience to Christ’s command are the New World theocratic system of things Jehovah has created and which is entirely separate from this old world that rapidly approaches the end of its days. To these symbolical mountains peoples of all nations now go to worship even as Isaiah foretold. There only is safety found. Many thousands are now fleeing there and finding that safety. Thousands more will yet come. Are you saying “Come” to lovers of righteousness who have not yet fled?

<p><span class="font4">Sometimes brothers may be a burden to us, not in a financial or physical way, but by their conduct, their weaknesses and their Christian immaturity. But love should be equal to this. To have love for the whole association of brothers means not only praying for all the brothers throughout the world but also putting up with them in our very own congregation in spite of their failings, and not getting tired of it and losing patience. It is dangerous for Christians to go into voluntary isolation, tiring, becoming bored at the association of brothers and preferring aloneness or the society of animals or, worse still, the society of this world. Such may indeed lead to madness in a spiritual way, for it cuts us off from the theocratic organization through which Jehovah's food, direction and protection come, and so it leads us to destruction. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font4"> 23, 24</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">What exactly is our part toward the cultivation of the fruitage of love is not difficult to answer. As we come to appreciate more and more what true love is, as seen in Jehovah, and as we come ever closer into union with him, then we have a deep and burning desire to express that same quality of love. Love is like that. It wants to express itself, it wants to be active. It is unselfish, so that we desire to see others enjoying and sharing in the same things that mean so much to us. llow better can love comp to its full fruitage than by sharing as fully and as closely as possible with the New World society, attending and actively sharing in all the meetings of our local congregation and in the various features of direct field service?

<p><span class="font4">The vindication of Jehovah, the God of victory, was at stake. Keeping the camp above reproach in God’s sight and worthy of gaining the victory by Jehovah’s continued favor was of vaster importance than committing any ceremonial or moral uncleanness and violating the sanctity of the military expedition. This is true also of the sacred warfare of Christian battlers for Jehovah today. And while these are not required to abstain from intercourse with their wives because they are in a sacred warfare, nonetheless, their conduct must be clean morally and spiritually. Their keeping themselves from immorality and also from spiritual adultery by being a part of this world must befit the sacred-ncss of this Christian warfare. Their part in the vindication of Jehovah is at stake, and it furnishes them a cleansing influence, an impulse to purity morally and spiritually.

They send the youngster out into worldly associations without the defense of divine wisdom, thinking the small child’s mind incapable of grasping basic truths and principles. They overlook the fact that an infant can learn a complicated language in a short time. Why not let it begin with the pure language? Why not nut in its vocabulary words that will give praise to Jehovah? Why not let theocratic teaching get first entry into the mind, rather than defer it for years while inferior information is absorbed? Timothy’s mother and grandmother made no mistake by teaching him while he was an infant, did they? And they used God’s Word, not a simplified book.

Then, if such strict requirements were made for the typical priesthood, how much more for the antitypical? True it is that physical blemishes do not disqualify one for membership in the heavenly priesthood, but other blemishes will, for nothing defiled will ever enter into heaven. ‘No fornicator or unclean or greedy person has any inheritance in the kingdom of God.’—Eph. 5:5. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W J,/l</span><span class="font4"> 15</span></p>

Hence today all the twenty-seven books of the Christian Greek Scriptures belong to the Christian flock of God and not to any individual: and these books, together with the thirty-nine books of the Hebrew Scriptures, form the complete inspired Bible. In view of its unbreakable connection with the Christian theocratic organization, the Bible is organization-minded and it cannot be fully understood without our having the theocratic organization in mind. This makes it very necessary for those who humble themselves under God’s mighty hand to take account of the theocratic organization and to recognize it.

Hope is a power that protects ; so why not wear it as a helmet? A soldier's helmet protects the head, hence the mind. The Christian's hope, then, is really part of the “complete suit of armor from God,” so “accept the helmet of salvation.” Indeed, Jehovah put on the “helmet of salvation,” and now this battle command applies to his faithful witnesses. How do we wear the helmet? By thinking of the hope ahead, by filling the mind with theocratic ideas, by studying these daily texts and comments, by discussing theocratic activities. Hope provides subject matter for meditation and thus protects the mind from old-world thinking.

<p><span class="font4">As soldiers of Christ we are engaged in a sacred warfare against wicked spirit forces and we must continue to preach the good news of God’s kingdom that the light of it may put to rout the forces of darkness. The efforts of Christendom’s rulers to religionize their wars, calling them “crusades,” does not alter the case for us. By thus trying to religionize their combats the rulers are setting up an establishment of religion. They are dictating religiously to those who should have the freedom of conscience to choose their own religion or the freedom to choose to guide their conscience by God's Word. Ke-specting an establishing of one religion and prohibiting the practice of another the apostle Peter and bis fellow apostles said to the Jewish High Court: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.” —Acts 5: 29, A'W.

<p><span class="font4">Favoritism for some neighbors and arrogant contempt for others can exist or crop up through selfishness. This is contrary to one of the two greatest laws. James (above) recommends to lax Christians to quit violating it through favoritism. This means loving poor neighbors as well as rich ones, without any favoritism by us in the hope of selfish gain, or in the thought that rich ones deserve better treatment. We do not love ourselves less than the rich because wc may be poor. Upon the two allembracing commands, to love God with all we are and have and to love our neighbor as ourselves, the whole Bible hangs. The rest of the Bible shows how we must put love of God and love of neighbor into action. Discriminating un-neighborly against the poor is not obedience to the kingly law. It does not lead to the best results, hence is not practical. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font4"> 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">band.—Eph. 5: 33, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although “devotion” and “dedication” are closely related, a distinction can be seen. Devotion has to do with the heart and means to have ardent love, strong attachment and intense loyalty. Dedication is a sharper word and has rather to do with the mind respecting matters for decision and determination, requiring the exercise of will power. Thus the Christian husband is devoted to his wife and dearly loves her. The Christian wife is likewise devoted to her husband, but there is something else required of her. When she marries she decides to accept and submit to her husband's headship “in everything.” So her relation involves the aspect of dedication as well as devotion as far as her married life is concerned. She not only loves her husband, but deeply respects him as her head. She delights to do it though at times she may find it something of a potion.

<p><span class="font4">In the days of Moses, Pharaoh defied Jehovah, exalting himself before the world as the greater. Jehovah destroyed the power of this mighty world ruler, threw down his idols, and established himself as the Most High. To Pharaoh God’s warning was: “But, in fact, for this cause I have kept you in existence, for the sake of showing you my power and in order to have my name declared in all the earth.” (Ex. 9:16, AW) Throughout the life of Moses and his successor Joshua it became necessary to place squarely before the people the choice of adhering to true religion or falling away from divine favor by adopting false religion. The people of Israel were time and again saved from destruction. On one occasion Moses lovingly pleaded with Jehovah to save them for His own name’s sake ; God heard, and that breach was healed.

Also in the midsummer of 1926 “A Testimony to the Rulers of the World” was presented at the London, England, convention, together with the public talk, “Why World Powers Are Tottering—The Remedy,” which boldly declared that Christendom's nations, having now chosen the disgusting League of Nations, instead of Jehovah’s kingdom, were falling to their final and total destruction; but that the rejected and permauently set Kingdom actually would prove to be the only light, the only remedy for all persons of good will.

Therefore we stick close to the organization that Jehovah has built up and do what his Word tells us to do. We must avoid the evil influences of this old world and not learn morals from its environment. We are obliged to do with our utmost ability the things that Jehovah would have us to do. Fill the heart with truth, then the truth will be spoken. (Phil. 4:8) Jehovah searches the innermost thoughts down into the depths of our hearts, examining our motives to see whether they are right or wrong. If we are telling the truth we can expect the favor of Jehovah. And our children will gain his favor also, for they will see in us the proper example and will be truthful before Jehovah too.

<p><span class="font4">There we have the secret of our part in cultivating and bearing the desirable fruitage of the spirit. Not a course of self-training by a process of mental exercise. No. It is a matter of “living by spirit” and “walking orderly also by spirit,” seeing ourselves as a people gathered to Zion, where Jehovah has poured out his spirit upon his servant class and where he has put his word into our mouths and teaches us, not individually, but as a people, how to live by his spirit. Having started in the right way, it is a matter of making steady, orderly progress under theocratic direction and, have no fear, the fruitage of the spirit w’ill be produced to Jehovah’s praise and the blessing of others and to our own salvation.

We do not gang up on the government officials. We do not force our way through the Iron Curtain I We do not harm officials, and we do not arm ourselves to oppose them. We do not advocate the overthrow of government by force or violence through men or groups of men. This is true even when that government oppresses our God-given work of preaching. We make use only of those instruments of fighting that are available according to the law of the particular country. Even though the law of a country does not have any procedure wherewith we can fight legally, we do not attempt to make the government over or change it or rebel against it.

<p><span class="font4">The courageous work of enlightening the other sheep blindly stumbling about in tile world’s gloom agrees well with the words above and shows how like Jehovah this “Jeho-vah-fearing man” is, for Psalm 112: 4 (AS) says: “[Jehovah] is gracious, and merciful.” The man that fears him copies him in these qualities by exercising them toward others. We need to exercise these qualities toward others, even as the heavenly Father did to us: “Continue becoming compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate.” (Luke 6:36, jVII') The fearer of Jehovah can copy him and display these qualities closely by endeavoring to enlighten the bedarkened other sheep and bringing them to the theocratic organization of light. However, he must also be gracious and merciful to his own brothers within the New World society, that all there may get along together in peace, harmony, purity and mutual helpfulness. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font4">20</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">He that exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life.—John 11:25, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since Jehovah is the great Purposer, he has a purpose in the resurrection. When Adam sinned, Jehovah had the power to bring forth a new race. But the resurrection shows forth not only’ his unlimited power but also his love and mercy and vindicates him as the Preserver of those who serve him. Having resurrection power, he is able to show that his servants will be faithful to him to the very death. He can answer Satan by letting him go the full limit of killing some in a lain effort to support his false accusations. The fact that Jehovah’s servants are willing to give up even life itself in his service proves their service is solely for love. It also proves they acknowledge him as the Almighty, able to resurrect them, the Supreme Sovereign and God of love. It proves they arc dedicated to him for his wonderful qualities. Thus Satan is most thoroughly convicted as a liar in his challenge of Jehovah’s supremacy and of the integrity of his creatures’ devotion to him through love. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font4"> 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Heb. 6:16, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There arose the demand for a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">legal guarantee</span><span class="font4"> in man’s dealings with his fellows. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Legal</span><span class="font4"> means that which is in conformity with, or permitted by, law ; therefore lawful. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Law </span><span class="font4">means, primarily, a rule of action or a rule of conduct. Note that both these words are derived from the root word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to lay.</span><span class="font4"> Hence a law is that which is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">laid</span><span class="font4"> down, set, or fixed. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rule</span><span class="font4"> means a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">line</span><span class="font4"> of conduct, a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font4"> practice, an </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">established</span><span class="font4"> custom. Note the thought of unbroken continuity in each of these expressions. Ever since man broke away from the safe course of perfect and loyal obedience to his Creator man has realized his desperate need of those things on which he can place absolute reliance, things of stability and permanence, now so sadly lacking. He felt his need for that which would provide a security in harmony with law and backed up by law. God has given this legal guarantee.

<p><span class="font4">Believers in sprinkling instead of baptism by immersion teach that Peter must have sprinkled that large group, since there was no way to immerse so many in Jerusalem. But such are mistaken, for there then were many pools in and around Jerusalem where multitudes could easily be baptized. These were pools that I Solomon built to water his gardens. (Eccl. 2:4-6, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">AT) </span><span class="font4">Today three of those pools can still be seen in Jerusalem. They were connected together with terra cotta pipe, and are about 50 feet long, 20 feet wide and about 12 feet deep, with stone steps at each end. In addition to these pools there was also the pool of Siloam, where mass immersions could easily have been performed. So undoubtedly those thousands were immersed in water. Peter was indeed well trained for the ministry and, aided by the spirit of Jehovah, that faithful apostle used the first of the “keys of the kingdom” to open Kingdom privileges to the Jews. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span><span class="font4"> 14</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Those who dedicate themselves to the service of Jehovah make a vow that may not be broken without due punishment resulting. Those who make such vows must keep all the terms of their dedication, which means full obedience to Jehovah. Or if one comes to a knowledge of the truth and knows what is right, he also has the responsibility to do what is right before Jehovah. So whether one makes a dedication or merely professes to be a god-fearing Christian person, it is still required of him that he do what is right aud observe the truth. We are living a lie when we claim to be something that we are not, which is exactly what the clergy of Jesus’ day did. All who are unfaithful make themselves liars.

Just as “faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself,” so with love. It must have works. To be the true thing it must be evidenced, not by just words of the tongue when such are cheap and cost us no more than a wag in the mouth, but by works, by unselfish deeds, by giving at cost to ourselves and without calculating on some return. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font4"> 20, 21</span></p>

The kingdom of heaven is now governing the New World society, which includes the other sheep of Christ Jesus whom he is now gathering together so as to have the opportunity of living for eternity in happiness, in peace and in prosperity in the new world of righteousness. Have you become one of these other sheep by dedicating your life to Jehovah’s worship?

<p><span class="font4">Punishments may vary according to temperaments of meekness and stubbornness. When the Bible speaks of the rod of correction it does not necessarily mean a literal rod ; in the broad sense it means parental authority. Its corrective influence may take a variety of forms, by withholding a token of affection, by banishing the unruly from the company of the obedient, etc. However, whatever form it takes it should alwajs be wielded in love and mercy, never in anger or in rigid justice. Never try to mete out the full measure of what the child’s conduct might justly demand. Remember, we are not under strict justice but under divine mercy, and must show mercy to others, especially to our children, whose imperfections and blemishes are traceable in greater or less degree to us and our forebears. The new-world-society atmosphere breathing love and Jehovah’s spirit is essential in rearing children for life eternal.

Indeed, it must. Did not Jesus foretell for this day that “people will deliver you up to tribulation and will kill you”? During World War II thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses imprisoned in concentration camps would not accept a release by renouncing their faith. To do that would have meant the loss of their hope. Nor will those who have the New World hope “accept release by some ransom” though they be imprisoned or tortured by Communist or “Democratic” dictators. And with the attack by Gog of Magog yet ahead, Jehovah’s witnesses will need the sustaining power of the resurrection hope.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—John 11:11,</span><span class="font4"> .Vir,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God’s revealed Word is essential for the righteous course of sanctification. Jehovah, having sanctified the dedicated members of the body of Christ by giving them the call to the heavenly kingdom, anointing them with his spirit, does set them apart to his holy service, consecrating them, and he guides them through his Word of truth. It is certain that Jehovah does not come down and sit with them and instruct them in his Word. Neither does Christ Jesus, because he is the heavenly King. As it was throughout the Christian era so it is today, men and women enter this blessed relationship with God because of the fact that other Christian ministers who preceded them have come to them with the message of God’s Word and have preached this Bible truth to them and they have heard and have responded, and then He sancti-ned.

<p><span class="font4">It is simple to quote scriptures about love and discourse about it before an audience, but practicing it when it costs something to the flesh and its possessions is another thing. It is a surer test of the trueness of the love voiced. Sometimes it may call for us to give forth a little strength to do something for others rather than to he waited on all the time. When it comes to doing something for others, we should try to be first in rendering service. Jesus did that, lie ‘’came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.” (Matt. 20:28, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Taking the lead in doing honor to one another as servants of God will keep us from becoming a burden, so that people tire of having us as guests over a period of time.

We do know that these events prophesied long ago are now coming to pass, and happy and blessed are our eyes if we see them.

<p><span class="font4">For the sake of endurance we must “look intently” at Jesus’ example: his rejoicing in the hope ahead; also at the example of the apostles who, when they, came into severe trials, rejoiced “because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name.” How could they suffer a flogging and rejoice over it? Because of the joy-producing hope that they had. There was reason for joy also because they had passed a severe trial, and by doing so had worked out endurance. “Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you meet with various trials, knowing as you do that this tested quality of your faith works out endurance.” Since Jehovah is the Source of hope he is also the Source of joy. “The joy of Jehovah is your strength.” Joy, a fruit of the spirit, cornea in unbounded measure when we “persevere in prayer,” requesting God’s holy spirit. His spirit enriches our hope. TF </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">8/15 4,</span><span class="font4"> 5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The high priest said to him: “By the living God I put you under oath to tell us whether you are the Christ the Son of God!” Jesus said to him: “That was for you to say.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Some have claimed that circumstances such as those in Nazi Germany would justify lying under oath, but the Bible does not say so. There is no indication that Jesus ever lied. (Regarding John 7:8 see the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.) </span><span class="font4">Even though the court had exceeded its own legal privilege and Jesus was unjustly forced to make an answer, his reply, though saying little, was the truth and the sum total indicates that it was understood to be in the affirmative. Peter denied Jesus with an oath. When one makes an oath he must tell the truth. What Peter did was certainly not right. He knew it, because afterward he wept bitterly. His conscience bothered him. Jesus had not given him such an example to follow. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1 23,</span><span class="font4"> 24a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Had Peter and Paul and the other apostles compromised and turned back they would have lost the blessing of expanding the early Christian congregation and of writing the Greek Scriptures. Also, if they had compromised and turned back, the modern-day witnesses, unjustly imprisoned in many nations, would have lost their blessed privilege of opening up the work and rebuilding it in many totalitarian lands where the preaching had been banned. They would not be enjoying the sight of the ingathering of the great crowd of good will today. “For God gave us not a spirit of cowardice, but that of power and of love and of soundness of mind.” (2 Tim. 1: 7, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font4">Thank Jehovah that those faithful before us and those faithful among us here now have not, as cowards, fled the field of fighting for the freedom to preach. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font4"> 20a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Jer. 48:10, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Most High was fully justified in fighting battles for his people. His defeating and destroying his own enemies and his people’s enemies were an execution of judgment upon these death-deserving opposers. He commanded that his people take a hand in this destruction of the condemned sinners, and he made their warfare theocratic and used them as his executioners. There was no sin or moral wrong for engaging in such warfare, for it was in obedience to the will and commandment of their God. The sin would lie in not carrying out orders to the pleasing of God, as in King Saul’s case. Jehovah did not authorize his chosen people to set out on a course of world aggression and establish a world power, but he did command them to destroy the immoral, demon-worshiping pagans out of the land that he had promised to give them. Many were the miracles that he performed for them while obediently carrying out these orders of theocratic warfare.

<p><span class="font4">“A friend loveth at all times.” By such permanent friendship it becomes manifest to this world that we truly are Christ’s disciples. (John 13:34, 35) Love makes such a permanent friendship possible. “Love coveretli all sins.” Love is an indissoluble tie, if it is the real article. The oil with which Aarou was anointed and consecrated as high priest was not only smooth but very fragrant, releasing a pleasant perfume. It was a fragrance that no other ointment had. In the same way the fragrance of the New World society’s unity makes us pleasantly conscious of an atmosphere of love such as no organization of this world exhales. We enjoy being in that atmosphere; it is good for us. It comes from God through his great High Priest. Jesus Christ. It is the breath of his spirit. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font4"> 36, 37</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The fruitage of the spirit is love.—Gal. 5:22,</span><span class="font4"> AW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Must we put ourselves through a mental exercise and say to ourselves the first thing every morning, ‘I must try to be more loving. I determine I will be more loving’? Well, if we went about it that way, then whatever we might develop would really be the fruitage of our </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">own</span><span class="font4"> spirit, would it not? But it is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God’s</span><span class="font4"> spirit the apostle is referring to, not our own. How, then, does it work out? First, when we begin to learn of the truth, it is God’s great love that appeals to us, his kindness and goodness. As we learn more of the truth, so we learn to appreciate more God’s unselfish love until we come to the point where we respond to his invitation : “My son, give me thy heart.” That means that in the spirit of devotion we dedicate ourselves to Jehovah to do his will, and thus we become true Christians. Obviously that is not because of love that we have developed of our own initiative. Rather, as Paul says, it is “because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy spirit.” —Rom. 5: 5, A’ IV. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font4"> 11, 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Prov. 11: 25, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah will always back up and preserve the Kingdom publishers and supply them the means to carry on this preaching of the good news, that they may be “enriched for every kind of generosity.” He will “supply and multiply the seed for you to sow and will increase the products of your righteousness.” Because God continually replenishes the righteous and generous distributor of the good news, that one never has to go begging because of such liberal giving. He is always kept in position to carry on his good works of scattering the benefits of a spiritual kind to the needy ones. Thus, although being poor materially himself, he can make many rich spiritually. The products of his righteousness, namely, the people of good will who are enriched and gathered into the New World society, increase steadily. Instead of impoverishing the giver, the free giving and scattering of the good news result in increased returns. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font4"> 12a</span></p>

We need to watch the state of our mind, so as to see that it is not negative, self-centered, introverted, wholly absorbed in oneself or thinking w*e are a nuisance to others, and so inclining us to want to be alone with our thoughts. The antidote for this is: “Keep tins mental attitude in you which was also in Christ Jesus.” Following this antidote we shall be moved to act unselfishly toward our brothers.

It could also indicate that Elisha should go up as did Elijah and in that way the community would be rid of him. It is likely that adults were responsible for this delinquency, the childish taunting being a reflection of the adult attitude if it was not directly instigated bv religiously opposed adults.

Though no definite word is gheu as to how Moses obtained his information, yet for two reasons it is not surprising. First, all those who died in faith, from Abel onward, had strong confidence that Jehovah would retain each of them in his memory, or, in human language, would keep a permanent record of them, as in a book. Secondly, now that there is evidence indicating that the art of writing goes back to preflood days, it is not surprising that Moses should gite expression to his own faith respecting Jehovah’s memory by using the metaphor of a book written and preserved by its Author.

The code contained laws providing for holy sabbath days, holy garments for its priests, a holy meeting place between God and his servants, holy anointing oil, a high priest’s crown with an inscription, “Holiness belongs to Jehovah,” holy conventions and holy contributions.

<p><span class="font4">The invitation to be one of those “standing before the throne” is actually the greatest honor and privilege that could possibly come to any creature of earth today. Since the identification of this class at the Washington, D.C., convention in 1935, each one in the theocratic organization has known whether he is one of the few remaining ones called to the heavenly Royal House or one of those called to the earthly position before the throne. True religion holds both classes in their proper place, both having the hope of life in God’s new w-orld. Since 1935 one class has been decreasing in numbers, while the other class has been increasing until today there are hundreds of thousands of the great crowd rejoicing in the hope of life on earth, while the others now number but some thousands.

<p><span class="font4">To have Christian theocratic organization we must go back to the apostolic instructions and arrangements of the first century. Today on earth God has his flock of sheep under his Right Shepherd, and so he must and he does have a visible organization now under His mighty hand. In proof that it is theocratic, just as the apostles were, this organized flock of his sheep is apostolic in its arrangements and its methods of activity. At the same time it is adjusted to the needs of our modern day for God’s service. It being apostolic, however, does not mean it has living “apostles,” so-called, or even “apostolic successors.” It could not have such, because the twelve apostles of the Lamb were foundation stones of the Christian congregation and belonged to its beginning, founding or infancy. By the close of the first century all the authentic apostles were dead, and they made no appointment of successors. 17 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">9/1 4, 5</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Linder the figure of two sisters the wayward courses of the ten-tribe nation of Israel and the two-tribe nation of Judah are shown. Because of doting on the Assyrians and committing whoredoms with them God delivered Oholah (Israel) into their hand to slay her. But her sister Oholi-bah (Judah) was not warned away from such a course by seeing Israel overthrown and taken captive by Assyria in 740 B.C. Instead, she became entangled with the Assyrians, and later increased her whoredoms bv involving herself with the Babylonians. But even in her whoredoms she was fickle, and turned her back on the Babylonians to form alliances with Egypt. So Jehovah warned that he would bring the Babylonians against her. These events show the consequences of Israel’s mixing in with worldly politics. Jehovah’s dealings with that covenant nation when it strayed into politics discloses his mind on such matters. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font4"> 11, 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There are at least five strong reasons for referring to the legal foundations of the new world in the plural. The first reason lies in the fact that God’s oath to Abraham is a legal foundation of the new world. The second reason is that Christ also fulfills the oath-bound promise: ‘You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.’ Then the new covenant, which is “legally established upon better promises” and which really does produce a people delighting to do God’s will and who, with Christ, form part of the new-world government, furnishes a third reason. The fourth reason is another oath-bound promise regarding the King of the new world: “I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant: thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations.” And the fifth legal foundation is the ransom provided by Christ Jesus and upon which the success of the other four foundations depends. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15 </span><span class="font4">19-24</span></p>

Jehovah’s power is more deeply appreciated when wc consider the fact that here he reconstructed the second-greatest personality in the universe. What wonderful fruits of the spirit the Son developed during his millenniums of prehuman heavenly service to Jehovah! I-Iow he had added to this by his earthly service under Satan’s test, where “he learned obedience from the things he suffered” I Not one whit of his qualities of proved, unbreakable integrity had been lost by Jehovah in resurrecting him, re-creating his personality.

He has the riches and wealth that wisdom imparts, for divine wisdom says: &quot;Riches and honor are with me; yea, durable wealth and righteousness.” (Prov. 8: 18, AS) He has an heirship in God’s heavenly kingdom with Christ : and what could be more precious than that? He has the treasure of the ministry or service of God’s Word; and what on earth could be more honorable than that? He stores up treasures in heaven by living and working to gain God’s approval and blessing and a worthiness to receive the fulfillment of God’s promises. He lays up a foundation for what are riches in the new world. He is “safely treasuring up for [himself] a right foundation for the future, in order that [he] may get a firm hold on the real life.”—1 Tim. 6:19, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW. </span><span class="font4">IF </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">12/15</span><span class="font4"> 15</span></p>

About thirty-five centuries ago Jehovah’s prophet Moses was schooled in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, being reared in the royal court. Later, as a mature man obeying Jehovah, Moses knew how to approach and deal with proud Pharaoh. Being mild-tempered and humble, Moses exercised also remarkable forbearance with the millions of Israelites who, having just been released from slavery in Egypt, were restless and not easy to control. They frequently complained about the provisions Jehovah made for them on the trek in the wilderness. Only on one occasion did Moses become exasperated. Then he lost his self-control; yes, he then forgot Jehovah. (Num. 20: 9-13) But, all in all, Moses was equipped for his work as Jehovah's minister, performing it well, dying in Jehovah’s favor and being buried by Jehovah.

Our brothers, in such countries where there are bans, do not quit like the unfaithful fleeing prophet Urijah did. They are like Jeremiah. He was under a ban and faced death threats. He refused to flee. When he was thrown into a dungeon Jehovah delivered him. As with Jeremiah, the truth is like a fire in the bones of modern witnesses in such lands. Can it be stopped? No! It cannot bo stifled! It just has to come out!

<p><span class="font4">Jesus Christ did not suddenly burst upon the human scene and proclaim himself a savior. He was not merely a man of unusual gifts and mental brilliance who made a mark upon civilization by reason of his energetic activity, as other men have done with varying degrees of success from time to time. No, indeed ! Rather, his appearance was singularly different, for long centuries beforetime his coming was foretold. Men of godly understanding looked for the appearance of a savior of humankind because of the promise Jehovah gave in Eden concerning the coming of a “seed” of righteousness. Nearly 1,900 years before the birth of Christ, Jehovah confirmed with an oath his promise to Abraham concerning this Savior, a “seed” whom Paul at Galatians 3: 16 identifies as Christ. Moses, David, Jeremiah, Isaiah and others foretold the coming of this Savior and the blessings he would bring. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1 4,</span><span class="font4"> u</span></p>

It was a day of triumph for Elijah, as he was used to repair the breach and restore true religion, and to exalt the name of Jehovah. He had risked his life in protest against all this profanity, this God-dishonoring false religion. Elijah was jealous for Jehovah. Jehovah himself is a jealous God, and therefore could brook no rival. Elijah’s conception of the Most High God was so lofty that it absolutely precluded all other gods and objects of worship. This contest on Carmel is one of the finest ever recorded. However, the decision there made did not end the contest forever, because the invisible Satan soon got busy again breaking down the work Elijah had built up and taking from Israel the true religion.

This attack will reveal who are the integritymaintaining people of Jehovah, and who, on the other hand, are unfit, corrupt, unfaithful, faithless and wicked within that organization. These fiery trials will not permanently harm Jehovah’s faithful people. Rather they will work to their ultimate blessing and the glory of Jehovah. Mature consideration of Jehovah’s dealings with his name-people leaves us comforted and assured. The only ones permanently harmed by Satan’s persecution are the creatures who choose to capitulate to him.

<p><span class="font4">One may receive from the organization a reproof. If he feels keenly hurt he may persuade himself that he is of no use in the position of service or he may feel that he should retaliate. So he abruptly quits the position without giving notice and moves out without any orders from the organization’s governing body to do so, and thus leaves the position of service to take care of itself. That is hasty, ill-advised action. A reproof is not a discharge from a position ; it is a correction for the benefit of the position and the one occupying it. The right thing to do is to take the reproof as deserved and to cause one to do better, to act correctly in carrying out organization instructions, and then wait upon the organization for its next move, whether to discharge the reproved one or to retain him in the same position in view of a changed course.

Yes, for the reason that Jehovah does not approve unrighteousness, and those of the great crowd of his other sheep are certain to have his approval, if, as and when proving their faithful devotion to him. Their dedications are unquestionably genuine. Their service of praise is now swelling into a tremendous chorus to his honor and glory. They beautify the organization of Jehovah's people on earth in this day. They love Jehovah and he loves them. Their prospects for everlasting life in the new world are thrilling. Even as Jehovah enjoined holiness upon his servants without heavenly hopes in times past, so it now applies to all Christians in our day, including the other sheep.

It is a special resurrection. It is the chief, as to both time and importance. As Paul said: “But each one in his own rank: Christ the first-fruits, afterward those who belong to the Christ during his presence.” Christ has been invisibly present in his kingdom since A.D. 1914, and those who died faithful belonging to him as members of the royal priesthood have had this “earlier resurrection” since his coming to the temple in 1918.

Do not try to deal selfishly with his righteous organization. Never bring dishonesty or uneleanness into the congregation of Jehovah God. That is selfishness.

As a builder of a house from the outset has a definite aim, a final goal or objective that he strives to achieve, eveu more so the supreme Master Builder of the universe.

But Jesus had such confidence in his heavenly Father’s power and ability to hold in his memory as many of these as he chose that he deliberately used the expression “memorial tombs,” which was in common use in his day. Jesus showed he was justified in saying: “1 am the resurrection and the life,” when, by God’s power, he raised Lazarus from the dead, who “had already been four days in the memorial tomb.” Note the two reasons why Jesus rejoiced that he was not there in time to heal his friend before death actually occurred. The first reason was that it was “for the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it.” The second reason given was “in order for you to believe.” Surely there is every reason why we should have strong belief in a resurrection. —John 11: 4, 15, 17, 25, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

Another interesting fact—it is always a ruler that “knows” or judges between what is right and wrong or good and bad. In God’s statement upon Adam’s expulsion from the garden, it is inferred that Adam had decided to become his own judge to “know” what is &quot;good” and “bad.” By so doing he had rejected the heavenly Superior Authorities.

Dor example, romping during a meeting hurts the child and others. There is a time to play, a time to romp; and a time to listen, a time to learn. So watch time and place, for the good of everyone.

They form a spiritual house for the indwelling of God by his spirit, and Jesus is the chief cornerstone of this spiritual temple, and they may not be profaned and desecrated by wrong use by this world. It is for this all-powerful reason that Jehovah has . exempted all of them, the entire congregation, from taking part with carnal weapons in tnc battle of Armageddon. Being no part of this world, these underpriests of Jesus Christ must keep a strict neutrality toward the present-day conflicts of the nations and must apply themselves to their priestly duties toward the people of all nations alike, without partiality or discrimination. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font4"> 7b</span></p>

In some countries it is only by the favor of the officials that the work is permitted to be carried on from house to house. Street preaching is prohibited. In such a situation the right to preach on the streets is not insisted upon, which policy is fixed by the Society, not the local brothers. To demand the right to do street work there would merely force the speedy imposition of a ban. It may cause the officials to stop door-to-door preaching of the good news.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 111:10, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some understand the expression “beginning of wisdom” to mean the principal thing, the crowning feature, of all true wisdom. Fearing Jehovah begins real wisdom; we must have that fear of our Creator at the very start and we must retain that fear uppermost always. Having that fear makes it impossible that we fear man, for the fear of both at the same time cannot exist. The fear of the One makes a person wise for gaining everlasting life in the endless new world ; the fear of the other is foolishness that ends with the fool’s everlasting destruction in Gehenna. The most fearless man ever on earth said: “Do not become fearful of those who kill the body but can not kill the soul; but rather be in fear of him that can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.” (Matt. 10:28, A’W) So fear of Jehovah counteracts and removes the fear of man and devil or of what these can do to us by God’s permission. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font4"> 6, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">7</span></p>

Even though you may be isolated in some part of the world or in a small congregation of his people, Jehovah will be near to you if you call upon him in truth. Even when two or three are gathered in his name, there he is in their midst, by his power and care. Being Jehovah’s witnesses and having dedicated ourselves to Jehovah, we have a hope. We know that the Kingdom is a reality. We have proof from the Scriptures that it was established in 1914. Now wc see the gathering of the other sheep in great numbers, by the thousands, and we have seen manifested the spirit of Jehovah God upon the New World society. Why, then, should we ever doubt?

While we Christians today do not live under those priestly arrangements, nevertheless wc are under obligation to be honest and upright and to settle all debts and pledges properly. We do not defraud brothers, but should make things right with them and ask Jehovah’s forgiveness for any wrong that has been committed.

Then the time comes when he exercises his own will in choice of a course of good or evil practices. Since ‘man’s incliua-tion is bad from his youth up,' and the world’s wicked environment is pressing in on him from all sides, he must turn to God’s Word for guidance. He must have God’s spirit or active force directing him. He also needs the help of God’s organization and must walk in harmony with it. Doing these things, he will react properly toward his environment and take the right course as issues present themselves to him. He will be able to develop any good qualities and talents he has, to use them in God’s service. He will be able to overcome wrong tendencies.

In countries where the Bible has not been taught, people are hungering for Kingdom truths. In some places are those who cannot read, but when the message is read to them they recognize the ring of truth, remember it and promptly get busy telling it to others near them. What a privilege it is to help these people learn about Jehovah and his kingdom I Soon, however, this part of the work will be finished, and there will be no further opportunity to suffer for Christ and the truth's sake, something his apostles delighted to do. To fulfill the Master’s command to preach the good news of the Kingdom to all nations many missionaries and “princes” are needed who have the necessary requirements for this ministry. These must be well organized in all lands. Today, even as in Jesus' day, it is true that the harvest is great and the workers few, for the whole world is the field.

It means that the results of his righteous acts will be permanent, not being wiped out at Armageddon, whereas the works of this wicked world will be burned up in that war and their effects be completely obliterated. By sticking to righteousness he keeps integrity toward Jehovah, whom he fears, and by his being preserved for life in the new world righteousness is preserved in the earth, where we pray that God’s will may be done the same as it is up in heaven. The earth as God’s creation is properly the place for righteousness. The way of the defiers of Jehovah will vanish and their wickedness will vanish from the earth. The seed or generation of the upright, Jehovah-fearing “man” will carry on like him in righteousness in the earth forever.

<p><span class="font4">The Lord Jesus has used his faithful anointed ones to heal the great breach and, through many years of fighting and suffering, to restore the pure religion, which magnifies his Bather’s holy name. The highway is now free and clear to travel on, for all those escaping Babylon the Great. Therefore. “you shall be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of streets to dwell in.” It is the knowledge of Jehovah and of our Lord Jesus Christ that produces true religion, and it praises and magnifies them, causing complete, willing, joyful obedience to the doing of God's will in faith. Those so doing will have hope, and hope of life will bind us tightly to Jehovah and his Son. Therefore share in true religion and help all others to do the same, for their everlasting good, and for the honor of the name of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font4">In view of Daniel's vision of “one like unto a son of man,” who is given “dominion, and glory, and a kingdom&quot; that would never pass away or be destroyed, it is evident that the foundation of the new world inheres in Christ Jesus as the promised “Prince of Peace,” upon whose shoulders the government of the new world rests. But we have more direct word than that. Israel of old was not without rulership, and God used that people to make a prophetic pattern of things better and greater to come. Well, the rulership of that typical theocracy was exercised through a kingdom that had as its center the capital city of Jerusalem, the governing part of which was called Zion, where the throne was situated. Peter in the above text quotes Isaiah 28 : 16 and applies it to Christ Jesus. Beyond any dispute, Jesus Christ is the foundation cornerstone. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font4"> 9, 10</span></p>

One maintaining sanctification is a dependable man or woman. To maintain it one must keep the heart fixed upon Jehovah from whom comes all sanctification. And since it is through the truth of his Word it must be constantly studied and adhered to if one would continue in the condition of holy devotion.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 24:30, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just as the Pharisees and Sadducees demanded a sign, so the many sects of Christendom turn blind eyes to the sign of Christ’s second presence and insist upon awaiting the sign of his revelation, which can mean only their destruction. They are refusing the very sign the Jews were seeking in their day, the “sign of the Son of man” foretold by Daniel. This sign over which the Jews stumbled was pointed to by Jesus himself as evidence that he would be present among men the second time. Since Daniel 7 : 13, 14 links the sign with the giving of the Kingdom it is obviously a sign pointing to the beginning of Christ's presence and his coming into his kingdom. This could not occur until his return, and so, along with other things that were to happen at a later date, Jesus gave to John a revelation of this sign and identified it as marking the beginning of his presence and of his kingdom and power.—Rev. 12 : 1, 2, 5, 10.

The sum of that argument means that we are engaged in a spiritual fight. It is a spiritual warfare to which we are sanctified. We are enlisted in a spiritual army in a theocratic war, and our Commander is the Son of God, Jesus Christ, and he is the one we have to please by obedience and imitation. It is the approval of Christ that we are obliged to meet, for he has enrolled us in the theocratic army and we are ‘soldiers of Christ Jesus,’ and we must show ourselves the right kind by suffering evil for his sake. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font4"> 10b</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Self-control may not be mentioned in Scripture so often as other qualities, but when we remember that it is closely tied in with discipline we know it has strong Scriptural support. Due to imperfection we are apt to go to extremes, either becoming headstrong or easing off and becoming slack. Therefore we need to be alert at all times, not only to the unique Kingdom privileges that are ours, but also to the dangers both from within and from without. That is why Paul said: “I browbeat my body and lead it as a slave, that, after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow.” And after noting the sad results of a lack of self-control and the consequent need of self-scrutiny, he mentions the other aspect of discipline, namely, that administered by Jehovah. “If we would discern what we ourselves are, we would not be judged. However, when we are judged, we arc disciplined by Jehovah.” (1 Cor. 9:27; 11:31, 32, .W) Every true son needs and receives such discipline. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font4"> 23, 24a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The wicked haters of Jehovah have gloated over seeing us under oppressions, injustices and bans, but their gleeful gloating is turning to chagrin and dismay at seeing the increasing honor that Jehovah confers upon his faithful people. The wicked is ill-willed and has no love of righteousness and hence does not rejoice at the exalted horn of Jehovah’s righteous fearers. This is why he seeks to destroy their spiritual prosperity. He takes offense at Jehovah's goodness to his people. He wants the worldly favor and success and the divine favor and spiritual prosperity also, but he cannot have both at the same time. His consciousness of being rich in worldly goods and favor does not fully satisfy him, for he has only the form of godliness but proves false to its power to transform the heart and make one truly happy. Eaten up with envy at the spiritual prosperity of the witnesses, he grieves. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font4">17a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">This does not mean that Jehovah will gather all his witnesses to one place upon earth and there only have them preach. Rather, it seems to indicate that he will gather them into close unity in order to instruct them. His statement, “whom I have formed,” would mean those pressed together as a unit or organization to show forth Jehovah’s glory. This was done in a limited way in the talk “Principle Work of All Servants” given by the Society’s president at the 1953 New World Society Assembly, in which was outlined the preaching work to be forwarded in all lands, the purpose being to gather the King’s other sheep into the New World society. The speaker pointed out the necessity for all to work in the same way under the direction of the organization Jehovah has established upon earth for proclaiming his message of hope to all the nations and how important it is to finish this work as soon as possible.

For this reason earthly fathers must discipline their young to hold them to standards of goodness defined by a superior authority. It is not the inferior that determines the rules of goodness, but it is the lawmaking superior that does. Jehovah is the one who is the final judge and ruler to determine what is good and what is bad.

<p><span class="font4">This was true of the spiritual remnant in 1919. At that time they were lying in the darkness of bondage and oppression under mystic Babylon. They had been taken into captivity during World War I and deprived of their right of freely and fearlessly worshiping God according to his Word. The darkness of religious misunderstanding and of this captive condition was dispelled in 1919, when Jehovah rose as a light to them and sent his Son to free them from this spiritually killing bondage in Babylon and to put them back in their proper place and freedom inside God's organization as his fearless witnesses. Micah 7: 8, 9 (AS) had foretold this: “Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, Jehovah will be a light unto me.

<p><span class="font4">But how could Christians in Jerusalem obey the command to flee, with a hostile army ringing them in? The way for flight was opened for them when Gallus, for some unaccountable reason, withdrew his army. The historian Josephus said that Cestius, “had he but continued the siege a little longer, had certainly taken the city.” Instead, “he retired from the city, without any reason in the world.” This strange withdrawal gave an opportunity for flight, to heed Jesus’ warning, and so the Christians fled, not only from Jerusalem but also from Judea, crossing the Jordan and taking up residence in the mountains of Gilead, and settling particularly at Pella. Thus they escaped the desolation that later came as a result of the disgusting political alliance with Rome, the disaster caused by the abominable placing of Caesar in the position of kingship reserved for the Messiah aloue. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font4"> 20</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">It is Jehovah’s spirit and the power of his Word that have accomplished the great worldwide harvest of preaching. The struggle for freedom will not stop. It must continue. Whether we be iu democratic lands where much freedom is granted, or in countries where preaching is restricted, or in countries ruled by dictators who allow no freedom at all, the fight for freedom to preach world-wide must go on. Paul preached in prison and carried on his fight for freedom to preach from there. So today, we also when not at liberty to go from door to door must preach as prisoners in chains. There is no stopping in dictator countries. There is no silencing of us, his witnesses, even in Communist prisons or the prisons of others. We shall continue to preach both out of prison and in prison, and that we shall do with boldness.

<p><span class="font4">The wicked will try to make the righteous fearer of Jehovah totter, trying to involve him in conflicts with the political governments and bringing him into courts and passing laws making it illegal for him and his seed to exist, all this in order to move him out of the way and have his righteous, charitable activities suppressed and so bring about his spiritual death and destruction. But till now the enemy have been unable to move him off the earth or out of the field of witnessing, and they will be unable to do so in 1955 or at any later time. This spiritual Israelite “man” practices the fear of Jehovah, for which reason he will not be allowed to totter in his integrity. Jehovah, in whom he takes refuge, is his high tower and defense. His hope and citizenship are in Mount Zion above where the King Christ Jesus reigns. Jehovah and his Monnt Zion certainly can never be moved. Most certainly, then, neither can Jehovah's worshipers.

Satan knows that he has but a short time left and “this generation” is assured by Jesus that it will not pass away until all these things occur. Knowing and believing these truths make our faith sure. Our confidence is not built upon dates, and never was; for, in fact, the signs of the fulfillment of prophecy arc far more convincing than even dates. True it is, Jehovah made mention of years and days, and it is pleasing to Him for us to gain understanding of them; but let us always remember that Jehovah is the Most High, and it is actual faith in him that counts and that always has counted. Faith in Christ Jesus, the beloved Son, and in his sacrificial work and his glorious priestly service is our assurance. Knowledge and acceptance of his rulership give us hope and joy.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Seek peace, and pursue it. ~Ps. 31ft Ilf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Does that mean that peace is an elusive bird, as the “dove of peace” is to the nations today? No. It is the importance of peace that is being stressed. First, we must gain peaceful relations with God, through Christ Jesus, and with his family of devoted people. Then we must see the necessity of pursuing and maintaining that peace, praying for it and always working to that end: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. For mv brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say. Peace be within thee.” (Ps. 122 : 6, 8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">AS)</span><span class="font4"> This may mean, on your part, sacrificing something, perhaps some relationship into which you have entered, that is quite legitimate in your owu eyes but that you know very well is only causing uneasiness and talk among your brothers, to say nothing of providing a source of gossip among those not in the truth. It is ever a safe guide to put the interests of God’s community above personal interests for the sake of its peace. 17 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span><span class="font4"> 6a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">No harm is practiced by withholding incriminating information from one who is not entitled to know. An example of this in English-speaking countries is, when one is under arrest, he can, if he chooses, legally refrain from giving information to a police officer who may ask incriminating questions. No answer need be given him, as it is none of the officer’s business. It is a matter for court. But when one goes into a court and enters within the witness box and swears to tell the truth, matters </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">concerning the transaction</span><span class="font4"> theretofore confidential and possibly incriminating no longer can be withheld without risking contempt charges, as the judge has the authority to demand an answer. One can, however, claim exemption as to other crimes or transactions. Such exemption can also be claimed by all persons brought before American Congressional investigating committees, as there is no particular crime or transaction involved. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font4"> 21a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5:19, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sacrcdncss of theocratic warfare called for a sanctifying of the Israelite men for this service of God as upholders of his universal sovereignty and as executioners of his righteous indignation against the worshipers of false gods. Accordingly it was necessary for priests to accompany the army, their presence adding sanctity to it. Also when a battle engagement was facing the Israelite army it was customary for a sacrifice to be offered to Jehovah, and this required the presence of Jehovah’s prophet or of his Levite priests. Furthermore, before engaging in a certain battle strategy the God-fearing military commander would consult Jehovah by means of the ark of the covenant, or by a priestly ephod or by the sacred Urim and Thummim that were borne by the high priest. Jehovah’s people inquired of him for his direction in battle, and this, too, required the presence of Jehovah’s prophet or priest. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font4"> la</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ, because the accuser of our brothers has been hurled down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Rev. 12:10,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Think of some of the wonderful things that Jehovah has done concerning his kingdom. Read Revelation chapter 12, and see there described Christ receiving to himself his authority and reigning in the heavens and casting the Devil down out of the heavens to the earth. In view of such things you can speak of the power and glory of Jehovah as expressed through his Son to cleanse the heavens of all unrighteousness and to prepare things for the glorious new world of righteousness now near. That battle in heaven was fought and won; the next and final one, Armageddon, is still to be fought for the vindication of Jehovah’s name and Word. Only those will survive it who now study and talk about the glories of Jehovah's kingdom. Those who have come to know Jehovah and his Son and of the new global nation are happy and want to preach about that kingdom. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1 </span><span class="font4">3, 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">35: 5, 6, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The happy message of God's kingdom calms and quiets distressed people who sigh and cry because of the present abominable conditions. It strengthens the weak and brings sight to the mentally blind. It opens the ears of the spiritually deaf and restores health to the spiritually sick. It gives hope to the hopeless and life to the spiritually lifeless. Of course, such a wonderful message will not be acceptable to all, for those with the spirit of the Devil and of this old world detest and reject it the same as did those who perished at the Flood. Hence, the present publication of the Kingdom message causes a dividing of the people in their standing before the Lord, a separating of lovers of what is right from workers of lawlessness. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1 </span><span class="font4">16a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ue will not fear the roar of the bad.—I’s. 112:7, Fenton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even if “evil tidings&quot; under the form of threats from the enemy come, this does not make the fearer of Jehovah afraid. lie knows that God Almighty, his Protector, is more powerful than the combined forces of the enemy, seen and unseen. Strengthened with this knowledge, he cannot get afraid, but fearlessly goes on doing his Christian work in obedience to God’s commands, declaring His name and bearing witness to His kingdom. He refuses to get afraid of what worldly rulers and peoples get afraid, of. He follows God’s instructions: “Do not become afraid of what they are afraid of, neither become agitated.” Hence the Jehovah-fearing man is not scared into following the course the world recommends and thinks practical. In fearing the Most High Jehovah the man’s superior wisdom stands forth. Worldly fears do not paralyze him with terror, but he does all he can to dispel such fears from the people of good will by giving them the Bible message of peace and comfort. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font4">3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">60:1, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because Jehovah has brought his devoted people into his organization, has put his spirit upon them and has put his words (Kingdom message) into their mouths, they arc enabled as a united body of people, welded into one harmonious pattern world-wide, to respond to the above call: “Arise, shine.” In the world even the brightest memories are often tinged with sadness, knowing that the former things enjoyed in the days of youth cannot be repeated. But once we have been brought into Jehovah’s organization and privileged to become members of the New World society, then the whole outlook is changed. Even now, in Zion, the New World activities are so continuously satisfyiug and our lives are so full and happy that we have begun to realize the fulfillment of the glorious prophecy : “Be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.&quot;—Isa. 65:18, AS.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant concerning those who are sleeping in death, that you may not sorrow just as the rest also do who have no hope.—1 Thess. 4:13,</span><span class="font4"> AH'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the strongest features of our hope is the resurrection. It protects us from enemy assaults that would otherwise crack our integrity to God. Even the blow of death cannot do that, for we know the 144,000 will be resurrected to immortal glory “in the twinkling of an eye,” while with those of the other sheep it will be just like going to sleep one second and awaking the next. So while all Jehovah’s witnesses desire to live and preach as long as Jehovah wills, they do not fear death. And at the death of their loved ones they do not go beyond natural love and affection and permit sadness to affect their integrity-keeping course in Jehovah’s service. Rather, they continue more firmly, knowing that faithful service will assure them a place in the new world, so they will be able to see their loved ones again in the resurrection. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font4"> 23, 24a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Tim. 5:1, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While avoiding hypocrisy we should try to avoid needlessly hurting others by our very frankness. There are proper ways of shaming people with a view to their taking the right course. But never be caustic. Consider, too, the years of the person in the truth or in physical age. You may think a person who is older in years or in the truth is slackening or is not up to standard. Do not twit him by comparing him to his face with an odious religious class, thinking you are correcting him or reminding him of his shortcomings. By such remarks you may do injustice and are likely to cause deep hurt. Youthful bustle does not always mean that much is being accomplished, nor does an aged, slow pace mean that little is being accomplished where there is a patient, steadfast plodding along with regularity. So do not be severe in criticism or comparison. If comment you feel you must make, use tact. W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">9/15</span><span class="font4"> 12, 15</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">And my holy name trill I make known in the midst of my people Israel; . . . and the nations shall know that I ant Jehovah.—Ezek. 39:1, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is clear that Jehovah is permitting us to suffer and fight for freedom to preach world-wide for very good purposes. The main purpose is to vindicate his great and holy name and his Word. Another purpose is to select obedient and courageous people to populate the earth and live in the new world. Still another purpose served by our fight for freedom is to lead the enemy on to Armageddon. Jehovah is using us, by our fight for freedom to preach worldwide, as bait for the Devil. Termed Gog in the book of Ezekiel, he will be led on to assault Jehovah's people. Then Satan and his entire organization and all the people supporting the Devil will be destroyed. Until then let us keep ourselves in the fight. May Jehovah continue to bless us as we keep on waging the “fight for freedom to preach world-wide.” W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">12/1 21,</span><span class="font4"> 22a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Wear the helmet of salvation. Rejoice in the hope ahead. Think upon your hope; it is true, of serious concern, righteous and lovable. The more often we rejoice in the hope ahead the more often we shall think of the God of hope, Jehovah. This is wholesome, for He remembers those that think upon his name. And when is our hope valid? It is valid now if we are making public declaration of it. As faith without works is dead so hope without its being voiced is invalid: “With the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.” So hope backed up by Jehovah’s spirit and made valid by our public declaration of it is a power. It helps us think ahead, live ahead and work for the hope ahead. “To this end we are working hard and exerting ourselves, because we have rested our hope on a living God.” Our hard work and unfaltering efforts to preach the good news assure us that our work is not in vain and that our hopes will be realized. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font4"> 24, 25a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 112:8, RoPss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course, if you love and fear Jehovah, the adversaries who hate him will also hate you. If you love someone you will do anything, yes. suffer and endure anything, for that one. If you love Jehovah and know him, take his viewpoint toward the adversaries. Take his estimate of them. Relieve in his prophecy concerning them. Then fear of the adversaries will depart. Just now the adversaries may look quite frightful in their numbers and their increased power to harm the New World society. But look at the harm that God can do to them, and also to you, more harm than they can do to you. Do not, then, be afraid of them. Do not quit preaching because of them, but just go on letting your heart be sustained and upheld by Jehovah’s spirit and his Word. Doing this you will at last gaze upon your adversaries when they will no longer appear so fearsome but their own fears will have been realized upon them. That will be a feast to our eyes.

<p><span class="font4">Prayer is an essential part of our warfare, a necessary addition to our defensive armor. Prayer in the thick of theocratic battle is very vital. Long ago it brought victory to King Asa. Realizing his army of sanctified warriors was no match for that of the Ethiopians, Asa prayed fervently: “Help us, O Jehovah our God ; for we rely on thee, ... let not man prevail against thee.” Jehovah answered his prayer, causing the Ethiopians to be “destroyed before Jehovah and before the host.” (2 Chron. 14 : 9-14, AS) What a grand illustration of how prayer aids to victory! So, as wo fight on in support of the preaching of the good news let us pray fervently in faith for one another and for success of the divine cause. Then our theocratic warfare will not be in vain. No, but it will be garlanded with God’s own victory by Christ Jesus and with eternal life for us as sharers in His victory!

<p><span class="font4">So guard that “anchor for the soul.” It will prevent shipwreck. Our hope works out endurance. It brings joy. It encourages us to “persevere in prayer.” It makes us think upon the name of Jehovah. So, then, rejoice triumphantly, you of the New World society. The world’s hope is dark; your hope is bright. The world’s hope is collapsing; your hope nears fulfillment. The world’s hope is based on credulity; your hope is based on faith. The world’s hope leads to disappointment ; your hope leads to success. For with the new world, oh so very near, our fondest hope, whether heavenly or earthly, will soon be realized to our eternal satisfaction. Therefore we can with unflinching endurance “live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things, while we wait for the happy hope and glorious manifestation of the great God and of our Savior Christ Jesus.”—Titus 2: 12, 13, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Prov. 22:15, RS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With some children occasions arise when words fall short, and parents may have to become men and women of action, applying the rod to keep the child from spoiling. Though it understands your words, it may not pay heed. “Not by mere words can a servant be trained; for he understands, but will not pay heed.” “lie who pampers his servant from childhood will in the end gain nothing but ingratitude.” That also holds true for children pampered by parents. Children have no respect for doting or indulgent parents that withhold correction ; with such they only become more demanding and disrespectful. On the other hand, discipline that is wisely, fairly and mercifully administered gains respect, as Paul wrote to the Hebrews: “We used to have fathers who were of our flesh to discipline us and we used to give them respect.” (Ueb. 12:9, .Vil') Such discipline is to train, not just to inflict painful punishment. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font4"> 3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1:19, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah has given humans a conscience. That conscience can be good or bad. The Christian should have a good conscience. He should be confident in the fact that he is doing right, that he is sticking to the truth in everything. It is necessary to have a good conscience before Jehovah in order to make a success of our faith. When we come to a knowledge of the truth we leave behind the evil conscience and through the provision Jehovah has made make ourselves pure. (Ileb. 10:22, .Vlf') The Christian conscience, instructed by God’s Word, is a good guide to right doing, making the setting up of a Talmudlike code of rules unnecessary. The Christian must individually consider the advice of Jehovah’s Word, to see what is right and to determine what he must do and say when confronted with the making of any choice.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">5:12, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Death comes to man justly, through the operation of Jehovah’s righteous and perfect laws. It was no injustice on God’s part, for man brought this slavery upon himself, with its punishment of death. In keeping with justice. God could allow death to reign over men for all time to come, but his great quality of love and mercy moves him to provide a way out for men who incline toward righteousness. In exercising his mercy, however, Jehovah cannot ignore the justice of the penalty of death entered against man. Consequently what Jehovah had decreed as the penalty for sin, namely death, could be lifted only by the payment of a ransom. If one could be found willing and able to make payment of this ransom, thus fulfilling Jehovah’s just law, then his mercy might be extended toward mankind. Jesus Christ was the one willing and able to buy man out of his bondage. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font4"> 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The horn is a symbol of strength and power, a warning to all would-be assailants. Its being exalted with honor denotes victory for us, in vindication of Jehovah's power which backs us up. The honor with which the horn is exalted comes from God, uot from men. But men arc forced to recognize the divine source of that honor. Ultimately the honor of lasting victory will be ours, but even now we enjoy the honor of being in Jehovah’s service. The “great crowd” who are already thronging Jehovah’s house to serve him there are also a glory and honor to the Jehovah-fearing spiritual class who have labored to father this earthly seed. As Paul said of the brothers at Thcssa-lonica whom he had fathered: “You certainly are our glory and joy.” By our continuing to give the Kingdom good news freely and generously to the poor and needy, that honor of increased membership in the New World society at God’s temple is bound to be added to until Jehovah exalts our horn as victors at Armageddon. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font4"> 16a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In view of the failure of Christendom’s religious teachers to appreciate that salvation is not by works of the law, it is not to be wondered at that in the early days of our present-day movement those who then responded to the truth and forsook Babylon continued to be influenced to some extent by what they had been taught; especially since the reveahnent of truth and the consequent cicausing away of all Babylonish defilement, both in doctrine and practice, have been a gradual work. Some then in the truth laid so much stress on the importance of developing the “fruitsand graces of the spirit,” and went to such extremes about it, that it resulted in their paying far too much attention to themselves. In many instances it led to these ones’ becoming self-centered and egotistical.

<p><span class="font4">In Daniel 12: 1 Jehovah tells of Michael's standing up, of a great time of trouble and of the ultimate deliverance of his servants from it. It would then occur that their great privilege of theocratic service would be exteuded. In verse 7 he tells of the 1,260 days during which the power of God’s people would be destroyed. Following this, in verse 11, he describes a period of 1,290 days that would follow from the time of the taking away of the daily sacrifice and the setting up of the ‘‘abomination that maketh desolate.” A third period, described as a 1,335-dny period, was then to follow, after which an era of happiness would be ushered in. The meaning and understanding of all these periods, which in the fulfillment ran consecutively from October, 1914, to May, 1926, were locked up and sealed until the ‘‘time of the end.” Now we are at that very time and, true to his promise, Jehovah has unlocked his prophecies and made them plain. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font4"> 6-8</span></p>

There is still a remnant of the Kingdom class on earth all of whom must speak of Jehovah's glorious kingdom in vindication of Jehovah's name; and the One who leads in this vindication is Christ Jesus, for of him we read that “the government shall be upon his shoulder: . . . [and] of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end.” Jehovah is backing up the whole arrangement; it is his will, power and zeal that make this whole thing a tangible reality. (Isa. 9:6, 7) When we see this glorious kingdom that he has put into operation, then certainly we must talk of it. We know the need of the righteous rule and we as Christians must tell others about it all the time, “all day long.” We must manifest ourselves as God’s people by preaching this good news of the Kingdom in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all nations.

<p><span class="font4">To the restored spiritual Israel Jehovah promised : “I will be as the dew unto Israel.” By forsaking the gathering of ourselves together and by failing to keep in unity as a New World society we should deprive ourselves of this lifesustaining dew. Can we afford to be without such sorely needed refreshment amid this hostile old world? No! We need it to be always fresh for our foretold work among the people of good will. We shall not be suited to be like dew to the parched people unless we ourselves have this spiritual refreshment first. Our keeping unified as a New World society will supply it to us, keeping us cool and calm and pleasant. The allessential thing to our keeping thus united is that fruitage of the divine spirit, love. It is a love, not merely in word and with the tongue, but in deed and truth, for true love is practical. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font4"> 39, 40</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Joshua and Caleb are shining examples of waiting upon Jehovah with continued faithful service and not trying to run ahead of him. They did not lose anything because of choosing to suffer the consequences of the nation's bad conduct along with them and not presuming to march ahead for themselves into the Promised Land. No; but during those thirty-nine years of delay they saw further mighty works of Jehovah with his people and built up valuable experience. At Jehovah’s due time they were exceptionally admitted by Him into Canaan, Joshua as Moses’ successor in the national leadership and Caleb as his faithful fellow warrior. Think of how valuable Joshua and Caleb were to the visible organization! What examples they were of faithfulness, of theocratic submission, of competence for God's work and of his reward for loyalty and devotion to God I They are also worthy examples to us during our trials today.

He is the “foundation cornerstone” in Zion, precious in God’s sight and in our eyes, “and he that rests his faith on it will by no means come to disappointment.” This assurance should serve as encouragement to stir us to “declare abroad the excellencies of the one that called [usJ out of darkness into his wonderful light.”—1 Pct. 2:6, 7, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW. </span><span class="font4">W </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3/15</span><span class="font4"> 1, 2a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">We were saved in this hope. —Hom. 8: 24, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A hope that is founded on faith has the unimpeachable promise of God that the things for which we hope are absolutely certain to be realized, if we continue faithful to the end. Such a well-founded hope was what the early witnesses of Jehovah had. They looked forward to a new world, to an earth filled with Jehovah’s glory. They “esteemed him faithful who had promised,” and hoped to “attain a better resurrection.” The hope of eternal life in heaven for the faithful Christian congregation of Jesus’ footstep followers is called “a living hope.” There is only a small remnant yet on earth of those having this hope to reign with Christ a thousand years. The hope of salvation is also a power in the lives of the “great crowd” of people of good will. These are the Lord’s “other sheep” who owe their hope of eternal life on a paradise earth to Jehovah and also to the Lamb, because “he became responsible for everlasting salvation to all those obeying him.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15 </span><span class="font4">14, 15, 18</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The ancient faithful witnesses of Jehovah certainly displayed the same commendable qualities possessed by their God Jehovah. Their minds were set on doing his will. In their hearts the issue of who is supreme was settled. They knew they were right. So forward they moved, steady, resolute, unswerving in their devotion, steadfast in their integrity, inflexible in their faith. Truly they were a people with a fixed purpose, namely, to live a life in accordance with their Creator's perfect will and purpose, and they were determined that by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness they would do that very thing, come what may. Primarily such a course on the part of those men and women served for the vindication of Jehovah’s word and name, and secondarily it meant their own salvation and deliverance as well as eternal life for all who heeded their warning message.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">112:4, Soncino.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This shows the obligation now resting upon the Jehovah-fearing “man” or spiritual remnant. Being enlightened by Jehovah he must reflect the heavenly illumination to others by his right works, that the darkness-blinded ones may see and learn to know and fear Jehovah and glorify him. What a blessed privilege it is to enlighten others and thus drive back the forces of darkness! Zion’s children are promised that “Jehovah will arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.” (Isa. 60:1, 2, A8) Yes, but only if they rise as a light in the darkness. Only in that way can the upright ones of all nations come out of the world darkness to the bright-shining organization of light. The forces of darkness hate the light and try to escape its exposures by suppressing the light bearers. But lovers of the light show their sheeplikeness by coming to the light and doing good to even the least one of Christ’s spiritual brothers. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font4"> 18, II)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The cities are the congregations of the righteous, established to the praise of Jehovah. The desert places are those barren conditions requiring the preaching of the truth to water them, so that growth may be had. Much water is required, and the barren places are getting it, and behold the marvelous increase! Think of some countries where missionaries and others have been working during the past decade that at one time were devoid of true religion, and now see (he flourishing cities (congregations), deserts blooming like the rose, vines producing fruits of righteousness, trees planted and growing upright. What a wonderful work is being performed by the remnant and the great crowd today! And this is only the beginning of the reconstruction program, for the New World building work is to go on for a thousand years I What a privilege to have a part thereiu! </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font4"> 24, 25a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Since we need knowledge and understanding to build up our hope we must daily and regularly study God’s Word. (Rom. 15:4) And not only does that hope produce endurance but every trial endured strengthens and makes more certain our hope. How so? Because keeping integrity fills our minds with a realization that we are pleasing to God. This approved condition is what builds up our hope. Thus hope is fortified as the result of a sort of “chain reaction” process. What a victorious combination Jehovah has given us! Tribulations can build up hope, however, only if integrity is kept. And hope that is founded on faith and that is continually fortified with spiritual food and by endurance will never lead to disappointment. By rejoicing in the hope ahead we can already experience the thrill and joy of Jehovah’s victory at Armageddon.

They back there faced human foes and armed themselves with man-made weapons ; we today face and grapple with a superhuman foe, but, just the same, the warfare with him is very real. It is therefore a conflict requiring constant vigilance, a perpetual warfare, a lifelong conflict, from which there is no furlough granted us, in which there is no truce, no armistice. In it there is continual need of divine exhortation to keep one in fighting trim, ever courageous. The conflict reaches its intensity in this wicked day, because Satan knows he has but a short period of time until Armageddon. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font4"> 1, 2b</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Christians cannot serve two masters, cannot be for both Satan’s world and Christ’s kingdom. We must not enter politics to clean it np; we must escape its plagues by staying out. To shun politics puts us on the defensive before men; by entering it the clergy are on the defensive before God. For separateness we may be accused of sedition against Caesar, but for mixing in the clergy arc guilty of adultery against God. Men arc indignant when a wife wrongs her husband : they are indifferent when the clergy wrong God. Nevertheless, just as a wife in adultery means strife with her husband, so religion in policies means war with God. Fear God, not the world. It looks big if we face it alone. If we face it with God it is no more than a drop in the bucket, no more than a speck on the scales. And who is afraid of a drop of water, or seared of a speck of dust?

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">3:13, 14, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah is selecting people and training them for life in the new world. He expects these to clean themselves and to keep clean, to keep separate from the old system of things under Satan. There is no room among them for such practices as the world carries on. It is time for Christians to be careful about how they live. To avoid things that will lead to lying and going against the truth is wise. The advice of James, above, is as much as to say that if one has jealousy or contentiousness in his heart, if his heart is not right, it will not be very long until he is lying. One wrong leads to another; one lie covers up another. But lying should not be found in any form in the congregation of God. It is wrong; it is disapproved by Jehovah.

And since not all the spiritually qualified men of their day could be included among the twelve apostles the governing body took in, besides the twelve, other older men of the theocratic organization at Jerusalem, such as James, the half-brother of Jesus. Naturally, the governing body of the “faithful and discreet slave” class today does not include any of the twelve apostles, but it does follow the written instructions of those apostles and the older men associated with them in writing the Christian Greek Scriptures. The theocratic governing body of today includes older, spiritually qualified men of the anointed remnant. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 15</span></p>

Now today, we who have, for many years, been preaching the good news during the last days of this system of things, arc we going to let up? Slow down? Go into retirement? We cannot! Today we sec the Kingdom more clearly than we did back in 1914, 1918 or 1931, or any previous time. We feel its power; we sec its activity.

<p><span class="font4">By the impact and impression of his Word upon us Jehovah molds us as clay vessels of mercy or of wrath. The fresher the clay is, the easier it is to mold. The longer it sets the harder it gets. It is easier for us to be molded into conformity with Jehovah’s Word if that Word is brought to bear upon us while we are young instead of waiting till we are old and more set in our ways. The young arc more pliable, and the younger the better. Jesus used a child as an example of humility, saying his followers must become as one. A babe is unstable and needs direction. The tender years are the formative years, and forming will take place, for good or for bad. Parents must make the forming for good, based on right principles, or other influences will make it for bad, and by the time tardy parents think theocratic training should start they may find a hardened stand against it.—Prov. 19:18, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">RS.

By keeping the work going in those countries our brothers and the people of good will can be supplied and fed with spiritual food from the headquarters of the Society. However, even though a ban may cut off the direct supply lines from the earthly headquarters, Jehovah’s witnesses are still in the country. They cannot stop preaching. The ban merely prevents their public or open preaching. They cannot carry on their work legally aboveground.

The gift of his Son for sacrifice was not a barbarism but was an expression than which there could be no greater unselfish affection. Parents that give up their sons to the dangers of being killed in wars do not think themselves barbaric. If their sons are killed in battle they say with patriotic pride that their sons paid the supreme sacrifice for their country. What, then, of God ? He saw the need of a human sacrifice for the sake of men who would like to live forever in a new world, but God did not force his Son into such a sacrifice. God’s Son willingly laid down his life, and that without harming anybody, but only to do mankind good. His enemies, not his Father, were the barbaric ones.

Already the remnant have become a means of blessing to this rising generation of “other sheep.” As they are an “upright” class, the seed or generation that they father stand in direct line for a blessing. But remember, too. that the seed or generation of the upright ones are prospective children of the “Bverlasting Father,” Jesus Christ, who is primarily the Abrahamic seed of blessing.

Although the other sheep are not of the holy nation of “saints” or “sanctified ones,” they arc now closely associated with that nation as part of the “one flock” under the “one shepherd.” Hence they must not act as a defiling influence among them as the “mixed crowd” once did.

We are now forty-one years within “this generation,” the generation that witnessed the eventful year of 1914, the generation doomed to experience Armageddon. Make no mistake about it, that final war is a fixed date on the divine calendar, just as sure to occur on time as all the other purposes of Jehovah have. “For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven.” “For to every purpose there is a time and judgment.” (Feel. 3:1, 17; 8:6, AS) Really, it is much later than most people think!

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Keep completely balanced. —1 Pct. 1:13, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Keeping completely balanced means keeping a clear vision of the theocracy and one’s relation to it. An unbalanced person is erratic, changeable, unreliable. Falling a prey to the insidious unrighteousness of the world, one might begin to form his decisions and set his course of action according to “accepted” standards of the old-world society. Such a course is dangerous and leads to many painful experiences. Those who wholeheartedly love Jehovah and his New World society do not wish to have any serious part with those who are being abandoned to Christ’s wrath at his revelation. Neither will those maintaining proper balance be drawn aside by some secondary issue such as the racial question. They know that class distinction does not exist within Jehovah’s organization. However, knowing that assembling together is primarily for study and that our main objective is giving the witness in the field, they will maintain complete balance by taking whatever course or following whatever legal methods are the most practical.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The wicked . . . shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall pcnsh.—Ps. 112:10. AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The wicked cannot overthrow the spiritual prosperity of those who fear Jehovah. He gnashes or grinds his teeth at the sight he is obliged to behold, but that is all he can do in his rage. He cannot truly harm the righteous or destroy the New World society. When Jehovah stops Gog’s furious, malicious assault on the New World society at Armageddon, the wicked will still not see the desire of their eyes but will have one last look at a sight grievous to their eyes, the enduring prosperity of Jehovah’s witnesses and the triumph of the New World society on earth. Then the wicked will melt away in an inglorious end at the grand dis-play of Jehovah’s battle power at Armageddon. Oh the unhappiness of the man that docs not fear Jehovah and that does not delight greatly in his commandments! But oh, your own happiness if you will be a fearer of Jehovah and keep his commandments with Godgiven freedom from fear!

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2:17, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Do we have strong faith in Jehovah’s kingdom and its message? Then, “preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season.” Do we have strong faith in Jehovah’s organization? Then loyally and actively support it. Your regular attendance at the congregation meetings is in itself a testimony to your faith, encouraging others to do the same. Do we not sometimes know those who are old in the truth and old in years, perhaps so frail that they can do but little field witnessing, and so deaf that they can hear but little at the meetings? Y'et still they come, as regularly as possible. They love to be in the company of God’s gathered people. It is an expression of their deep-rooted faith and devotion. Their very presence encourages those who are newly interested to think well of an organization that inspires such lifelong confidence among its members. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font4"> 19a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The “princes” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(sarim')</span><span class="font4"> in this text means leaders or captains and refers to men on earth dedicated to the King. They shepherd the King’s other sheep, of whom there is already a great crowd to be regularly assembled, fed and prepared for a place in the New World society. Satan tries now to confuse the sheep by his winds of false doctrine and propaganda, and he could cause much damage among them were it not for Jehovah’s provision of “princes” or captains with the requirements for the ministry of aiding the disturbed sheep. The “storm” refers to the assaults that Satan is today making upon the society of the true religion, trying to bring about our destruction. The King's sheep are protected by the ministry of the “princes” who bring refreshing streams of truth to guide and strengthen those humble ones, and thus they come under the shade of the great Rock, Jehovah. 17 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">7/1 </span><span class="font4">11, 12a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4: 2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s command to those in the New World society is to “preach the word.” That word is the truth about him and his Son, Christ Jesus, and all the things the Creator of the universe has revealed to us through his written Word. Th a t message must be preached. There are many individuals who have heard part of the Word, but even that part has never been implanted in them. It is “the implanting of the word” that will save lives. That Word is able to save our souls if we do what that Word says. It is not only hearing, it is preaching to others the things we have heard. Each individual must choose whether he will serve Jehovah God or stay with the Devil’s organization. So do not become hearers only, as millions of religionists are, but be doers of the Word. By following the command of the Sovereign Ruler to preach, we show we want to worship Jehovah. 17 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1/1</span><span class="font4"> lb</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Yes, we ‘have heard such a thing,’ and it is marvelous in our eyes. The nation of restored spiritual Israel is brought forth, existing since 1919 as the nucleus of the New World society. This fact is greater proof of the Kingdom than even the sign seen in the fighting among the nations. The evidence of this wonderful event is realized on earth by the movement in this visible theocratic nation. Shortly all the members of the royal priesthood will be gathered together in heavenly glory, and then the Kingdom of priests will rule from heaven and over all. Upon earth will be the visible representatives of this theocratic government. These representatives will be princes </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(sarim'),</span><span class="font4"> having the oversight of all matters pertaining to visible human society.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pride gocth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.—Prov. 16:18,</span><span class="font4"> Af&gt;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hope can lead to success or failure, depending upon what we have based that hope on. It was hope's power that moved the covering cherub into carrying out his ambitious plan of action. But that satanic mastermind who perpetrated rebellion will never realize his fondest hope, that of making himself like the Most High, for there was something wrong witli his hope. First, it was made up of a criminal desire ; second, the feeling that the desire would be realized was inspired by a blinding pride that corrupted the cherub’s wisdom. Such a pride-inspired hope could only lead to disaster. Already Satan has been tumbled from the heavenly heights and soon he will be checkmated at Armageddon when he is hurled into the abyss of deathlike inactivity. His case illustrates how hope, without a sound basis, can never lead to success and how powerful a desire for something together with the feeling of obtaining it really is.

<p><span class="font4">It was Jehovah’s love and mercy that moved Christ to provide the ransom. It was an action initiated by God, and it was accompanied by the willingness of his Son to meet the terms of justice by paying the ransom, the Son being willing to pay it out of love for Jehovah and for fallen man. It was no new thing for Jehovah thus to require a ransom payment. lie was merely following the same principle he followed in bis dealings with Israel as that nation’s Ransomer. He said of himself: “I have given Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in thy stead.” The law given to Israel provided for the payment of a ransom as a redemption for one’s life in certain kinds of offenses. The poll tax of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font4">half a shekel for every Hebrew was deemed the ransom to propitiate for their lives. The annual offering of a bullock and of a goat for the sins of the people served as an atonement that Jehovah recognized and accepted. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1 17,</span><span class="font4"> 18</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">6:8, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Doing justly and telling the truth fit together. They arc qualities that must be found among Christians. Christians are brothers who deal honestly with one another and help one another. But there is no need for a merciful Christian to continue to put up with wrongdoing, if someone comes into the organization that does not have good heart motives. Sometimes persons come to associate with us who, deep down in their hearts, are not honest people. These are sometimes called “spongers,” people who practice fraud and deceit, men who go about seeking to borrow money or goods and possessions of their brothers, and who inwardly have no intention of paying them back and never do pay back. This kind of people make an outward show of Christianity, but their interests are purely selfish. Judas was a thief who showed hypocritical sympathy for the poor. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font4"> 11a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Having faith in Jehovah and in the blood of Jesus and having dedicated ourselves to God, we must form a proper life pattern if we would be deserving of a resurrection. Our life pattern is molded by four things: (1) Our inherited traits. At the time of conception a child inherits certain mental qualities, traits, propensities and talents, usually reflecting some of his parents qualities, and so at birth possesses to some degree a life pattern. His brain has certain “circuits” already dimly formed aside from instinctive survival traits. At this point God could tell what its tendencies will bo and how strong they arc to withstand or comply with later environment. (2) Environment, which includes experiences undergone during lifetime. (3) Our own will or choice as a free moral agent. (4) The influence of God’s holy spirit and his Word and organization.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—Isa. 2:4, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As Isaiah’s prophecy applies right now at the coming of the men of good will to Jehovah’s temple, it is now that the worldly nations marvel because they do not see these “sheep” taking up carnal weapons or learning any longer the arts of untheocratic warfare. These have learned of Jehovah’s judgment and decision and have come to know that his law and word from the heavenly Zion forbid them to carry on “works of the flesh” as before, but now they must turn to the arts of peace which they will practice in the new world just ahead. Having coms* to God's house or temple, the place in which Jehovah will give peace, they must keep the peace and not be disturbing elements among the spiritual priesthood. This priesthood may not sanction their engaging in violent combats among themselves or with outsiders at Armageddon. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font4"> 14, 15b</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1:11, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Why are the great crowd so favored? Because Jehovah purposes to have a people on earth after Armageddon, settled in different parts of the earth to form the vanguard of the earthly subjects of the Kingdom, marching up on the way to righteousness during the 1,000 years. Too, he, has a great work now for them to do before Armageddon, a work which the anointed remnant could not [xissibly perform alone and which Jehovah long ago foretold. Still another reason for Jehovah’s favor to this great crowd is that they are righteously inclined and detest the abomination of false religion. Like Lot, they are greatly distressed and torment their righteous souls because of the lawlessness in the earth. (2 Pet. 2:7-9, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Yet another reason for Jehovah’s favor to these blessed ones is that they are good to the brothers of Christ Jesus. —Matt. 25: 34-36. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span><span class="font4"> 18-21a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There is so much hypocritical love expressed with the tongue. Those who are moved to make such expressions usually have a secret selfish purpose and seek some advantage, even if it means breaking up the unity of the congregation. Those who have left the theocratic organization usually approach those who are holding fast to it with “smooth talk and complimentary speech.” Treacherous are their words, even as were Ahitho-phel’s, David’s unfaithful counselor. Unless we see behind a person’s mask, his pretending to love us by his words disarms us and we are apt to be thrown off guard by the hypocritical, suave speech. For our spiritual safety we need to become trained to sec through hypocrisy and guard ourselves against being misled. And even as we do not want to be misled ourselves we do not want to mislead others with hypocritical expressions in word or with the tongue. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font4"> 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The righteous are never out of Jehovah’s mind. He will never forget them. They will always live to him, even if it means he has to resurrect them. The Jehovah-fearing, righteous man will always be something to remember on earth. To all eternity the inhabitants of earth will remember Jesus Christ, the most righteous man ever on earth, whose righteousness on earth amidst Satan’s world worked for the salvation of humankind. Likewise men will always remember his righteous followers, including the remnant now. But far more important is the remembrance by Jehovah, for that means life eternal for the righteous class. The former wicked things of this world will be destroyed and be forgotten and never come to mind with any attractiveness, but righteousness will never be forgotten. Jehovah will always keep the righteous in remembrance and see that they enjoy life to the full, forever.

<p><span class="font4">For years it was thought that this “faithful and discreet slave” was a man or was the responsible office to be filled by an individual man. But is the visible theocratic organization dependent upon any single individual for spiritual “food at the proper time”? No ; and now in the light of accomplished prophecies we correctly see that the appointed “slave” is a class, the remnant. This being so, its continued faithfulness and discreetness do not depend upon any single individual. Today, in administering all the belongings of the Lord Jesus on earth, this “slave” class serves the “food at the proper time,” not only to the remnant, but now also to a great crowd of the Lord's other sheep. Since the Lord has appointed the “slave” class to administer all his visible belongings, he does not feed his sheep on earth today by anv other than this “slave.” TV ,9/1 14</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">What is the secret of freedom from fear? Not by fearing fear but by fearing Jehovah we learn the secret of freedom from fear. That is why there will be one class on earth that will enjoy freedom from fear during all the years to come. That class is the “man” that fears Jehovah and delights in His commandments, together with his seed or generation. (Psalm 112) The tidings or news about the world is all evil these days; there is nothing consoling about it. Added to this, in God’s own Word there are not good tidings for this world, but only doom by the execution of God’s vengeance against the wicked. The Jehovah-fearing man already knows this and so is not disturbed by the trend of world events and the ominous future that is shaping up for this world. From God’s prophecies he knows that this world must end shortly at the climax of this “time of the end,” to be followed by a bright new world of all good things. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font4"> 1, 2a</span></p>

This love, however, is not shown by gushing sentimentality or baby talk or by indulging every childish whim. Love is not pampering. It makes the child feel wanted. Children are spoken of as an inheritance from Jehovah, likened to tender olive plants. They need tender care to grow up and bear fruit. They are the fruit of the mother’s womb. Jehovah’s Word tells us the fruit of our lips should praise him, and the fruit of the womb should do likewise. Do your children praise Jehovah? If you will, they usually will. Help them, show them the way, direct their steps, give good instruction, set right examples, correct when necessary, and guide them to eternal living with the New World society.

So he steps aside to let his superior in the organization follow up with the necessary steps to crown work with final success that brings it before public notice. He prefers to have the organization credited with the accomplishment as a specimen of the work of the entire organization. Let appreciation of the organization be what is built up among the public, let the public have the organization prominently in mind and speak of it and have confidence in it rather than pay adulation to some incidental member of it, some mere slave in it. This curbs the entrance of personal pride that leads to a fall, and it means the humbling of oneself under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt the faithful one in due time. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font4"> 6, 7a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Cain never forgave Abel; Absalom never forgave his half-brother Amnon. One who shows such an unforgiving, irreconcilable spirit as those did tends to make his brother weak, to impede him spiritually. Better is it to forgive and dispose of the contentions and help the brother to be like a strong city. Our responsibility and privilege is to edify our brother by extending forgiveness, if necessary, and thus help to make him strong and untakable by the enemy, able to hold out like the bar of a castle against all assaults of this world. In that way a Christian benefits himself as well as his spiritual brother. “The merciful man doeth good to his own soul; but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.” Remember Jesus said: “Happy are the merciful, since they will be shown mercy.” Is not God’s forgiveness worth gaining?

An accused brother may have a hearing before servants in a congregation and a point-blank statement is asked for. There is a question whether he has done right or wrong. One called to testify will say the truth about his brother. Fear of some form of retaliation must not be permitted to color the testimony. Nor fear of witchcraft. Nor should family relationship or clannishness warp testimony to shield a wrongdoer. And some people always wish to please someone considered superior by saying what that person might like to hear. But never should the desire to please lead one to tell untruths, whether in a hearing before a congregation or at other times. One who pleases Jehovah must come clean with his testimony.

But that does not mean that bearing the fruit of the spirit is a simple and easy matter.

Under his direction, however, wc do some cultivating work, in the way of planting, watering and weeding, but never forget it is ‘God who makes it grow/ All the same, as the apostle continues, though individually we are nothing in ourselves, “let each one keep watching” how he is carrying out his responsibilities, for “each one’s work will become manifest, for the day will show it up.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1 </span><span class="font4">13, 14</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The warfare of Jehovah’s witnesses today is different from that of worldly armies. It is with a different foe. Worldly armies fight for “the god of this system of things” of which they are a part; the Christian witnesses of Jehovah fight against him. That is why they need different w’eapons, a fighting equipment that none of the armament makers of this world ean turn out. They know their enemy, and they know the only fighting equipment with which they can fight him and win. It is a fighting equipment from the greatest Fighter of them all, Jehovah God. The fact that our enemy is spiritual, superhuman, alters altogether the nature of our warfare and the nature of our weapons. So, “go on acquiring power in the Lord and in the mightiness of his s t r e n g t h.”—E ph. 6: 10-18, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">8:25, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mature Christians see beyond the present system of things. They seek to do the will of Jehovah and their minds are attuned to New World living. Immature Christians still see much that interests them in this system of things. They still want their own way. Their minds are still attuned to their own interests. To lay hold on the hope of everlasting life demands maturity, that we direct our minds ever forward, toward the hope ahead. It is the mature Christian, then, that can fully use the amazing power of hope, the power that encompasses the future and thereby governs the present. And by its governing our lives now, hope becomes an uplifting power that produces endurance. Endurance means that quality of determination that will never, no matter what the circumstances, relinquish the hope that God’s Word validly offers. Never must our ship of faith suffer shipwreck or stop short of its goal, the haven of the new world. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15 1,</span><span class="font4"> 2a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Dwelling as brothers in unity refreshes us, revives us, like the dew of Mount Hermon of the lofty Lebanon range. Hermon's perpetually snow-streaked top caused the night vapors to condense upon Zion’s mountains. The dew thus falling was a saving factor for the vegetation of the Promised Land during the hot rainless season from May to September. As with typical Zion so with the antitypical Zion, God’s kingdom. Because God has commanded that there, in the Kingdom, should lie the blessing for us, even life forevermore, he caused the typical Zion of old to be bathed daily with dew during the hot, wilting season, as a prophetic picture. Our dwelling as brothers in amiable unity is like that abundant dew, refreshing amid the persecutive heat of this world and conducing to our life forevermore in God’s new world. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font4"> 38, 39</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">If you know an evil man is trying to harm a brother and he asks you where the brother may be found, it is not necessary to answer. Jesus often countered questions with other questions, which put his opponents in a bad light, showing how one can properly be evasive with evil men. If one is asked to commit himself as to whether he is one of Jehovah’s witnesses or not in a land where it is a crime to be one of them, and he replies that he is, he could immediately be arrested. In such an instance he would have to decide for himself what he wanted to do. He might conclude that it is proper merely to say, “I am a Christian,” or else say nothing at all. This would not be a denial of Christ such as mentioned at Matthew 10: 33. He can still tell the good news and protect the interests of himself and of Jehovah’s organization by not answering questions for every person who might ask. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1 </span><span class="font4">19a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I have no common bread at hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Sam. 21: 4, RS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Being kept from women meant being kept from sexual intercourse with their wives or concubines. At ordinary times there was nothing wrong or disqualifying with such proper intercourse. But when an occasion or a service called for ceremonial cleanness, then such relations between an Israelite and his wife were out of order. Why? Because after such intercourse they were ceremonially unclean until the following evening. Consequently, sexual intercourse that day would have made David and his men unfit to be given the unused showbread to eat. The theocratic nature of the warfare, called for sanctity of this kind, if the divine blessing was to rest upon the army and victory was to be granted to those battling for Jehovah. It was a sacred service. Today at times theocratic duties will call a Christian from his wife's side and he must respond. Yes, “let those who have wives be as though they had none.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font4"> 16, 18</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Now the Jehovah-fearing “man” faces many adversaries, but he does not back down from his uncompromising position for the kingdom of God. He has his heart braced upon the unbeaten and unbeatable God. Neither fears that men express for the fate of their own system of things nor the threats that the adversaries make against the New World society' cause his heart to tremble and vacillate. It is upheld by Jehovah because of his love for Him. He is strong-hearted in his love and attachment to the righteous new world that God has promised. lie has no spiritual heart disease in these times when men are lovers of pleasures more than of God and have merely the form of godly devotion but not their hearts in it. So copy his example. To keep from worry and from the tyranny of fear strengthen your heart in ils love for Jehovah. The rest will follow: love will throw out fear.—1 John 4: 18. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15 </span><span class="font4">5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">H:27, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ordinarily, people seek peace by trying to create and live under conditions that are literally peaceful. Their realization of peace depends largely on their physical surroundings, and is for the most part an emotional experience. That is the only way the world can provide this valued treasure. But Jesus is giving us peace these days by delivering us from the authority or this discordant world and transplanting us into his own theocratic domain, where he reigns as King. From there, by God's all-powerful spirit, he is directing his people on earth in a grand work of righteousness, the effect of which spells “quietness and confidence” to those engaged therein. Under that spirit of peace that controls and guards our hearts and mental powers we truly “abide in a peaceable habitation, and in safe dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.”—Isa. 32: 17, 18, 48. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font4"> 7a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Do not misunderstand. What Paul here calls our “own interests” may be perfectly legitimate pursuits; if not un-scriptural, they are “lawful.” But as the apostle explained : “All things are lawful; but not all things build up.” The desire for “fine” things and entertainment-interests (television, radio, cinema, etc.) may, if care is not exercised, subvert our hope; for of a certainty they do not build up. We need to fortify our hope so that it will become our very “joy,” as it did for Jesus. Many other nontheocratic interests abound in the world, such as the so-called “hobbies.” But hobbies, like commercial pursuits, may very easily entangle one and undermine one’s hope. Meetings may be missed and association with outsiders may be cultivated for the sake of one’s hobby. If such an interest is not checked and pnt in its theocratic place, shipwreck is ahead. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font4"> 19-21a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Some, feeling they must take the lead and show the organization what real progress is and what real advanced thought and understanding are, break away and set up their own supposedly superior, more advanced society. There are good Scriptural examples against such a heady, impatient course. Take Moses, for instance. He had an opportunity to have God himself start a new typical theocratic organization with Moses as the patriarchal head because of the Israelites’ having turned to licentious calf-worship. Hut Moses did not have in mind exalting himself; he had larger considerations. So, instead of hungrily grasping at the opportunity to have himself glorified in a new organization, he pleaded with Jehovah to feel sorry for his wayward people and to consider the faithful remnant for his own name’s sake.

<p><span class="font4">In a hearing one who tells lies in order to get the defendant into trouble becomes hateful to God. By his testimony he may think to gain favor with someone or to gain personal advantage, but he is certainly putting himself in disfavor with Jehovah. Much evil can be done to a person if perjury is committed when one is testifying concerning him. Naboth suffered death because of perjurers. False witnesses came against Jesus and contributed to his death. False witnesses testified against Stephen. Perjury is wrong. It is a form of lying. It is especially evil when it results in harm to others, and it nearly always does. When the wicked bring their false witnesses against a person it may cause a moment of anger, but yet we should keep control of our faculties and not at any time try to retaliate with lies. We continue to observe God’s law and follow his righteous principles and tell the truth. The responsibility is upon the wicked for what they do. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font4"> 4, 5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4:1, 2, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In God’s tolerating “vessels of wrath made fit for destruction, in order that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy,” we see his grand quality of long-suffering. (Rom. 9 : 22, 23, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Paul cites his own case, too, as an outstanding example of long-suffering demonstrated by Christ on Paul’s behalf. Surely with such inspiring examples before us, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font4">should ever be ready to show this same quality whenever there is a sincere plea for mercy, or whenever iguorance can be taken into account, as with those not in the truth. The opposite of long-suffering is short-suffering. Do you very quickly become short with your brothers, ready to snap their heads off in a spirit of irritation and impatience? That is not the fruitage of God’s spirit. At the same time, that does not mean that a sharp word is never necessary; but if it is a matter of letting off steam, then it would be better to sit tight on the lid a little longer. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font4"> 8, 9a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">We all make mistakes; but we count on the mercy of Jehovah and the love of our brothers, as we do the work God has given to his New World society in these later times. There is only one group of people today who keep integrity and who uphold the principles of truth and righteousness in God's Word, and these are those who make up the New World society. It is right, and pleasing before God for us to be pure and upright and clean, to tell the truth, to deal justly and honestly with our brothers, and to preserve the peace and unity of the organization. Let us allow no wrongdoing among those who associate with Jehovah's theocratic organization. Let us deal justly with one another and learn how to live for the new world now, so we can live in the new world then when it is in complete operation. —Eph. 4: 15, 16. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font4"> 31a</span></p>

Clad in the spiritual armor of God, we must continually fight now against the wicked spirit forces, valiantly wielding the “sword of the spirit,” by preaching the good news of the Kingdom. Then as the decisive battle nears, yes, even as we enter the “war of the great day of God the Almighty,” we, as a “holy nation,” and our good-will warrior companions, will be worthy to sing Jehovah's praises and to blow the trumpet for a courageous advance against the foe with full confidence that Jehovah will give us the victory.

So the man has prepared his heart for the coming of these things that he may not give way to fear or be stumbled or confused. lie has taken time to study God’s Word and practice its teachings and thus build up a confidence and trust in Jehovah. Hence his heart does not fluc-uate between Jehovah and this world: it remains steadfastly fixed with Jehovah. He keeps a complete heart toward God. His heart never turns to the idols of this world. He has familiarized himself with Jehovah's promises and has observed how the Promiser has fulfilled them toward his faithful fearer. Knowing the fate that awaits this world, he realizes there is no safety in it and that it cannot win in its fight against Almighty God. He trusts in the certain Winner.

We must have abounding faith in God and in what God himself has absolute confidence in, namely, his Son, his Word, his purpose and his kingdom organization. As part of the spirit’s fruitage we must learn how to communicate faith to others. This means to have a living, active faith, as James said. (Jas. 2:17) The kind of works needed whereby others can benefit from our faith is shown by Paul when he argues that preaching the message of truth is our all-important work in order that others may first hear of Jehovah, then exercise faith in him and call upon him, resulting in their eventual salvation, and our own too: “With the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.” “How will they call upon him in whom they have not put faith? How, in turn, will they put faith in him of whom they have not heard? How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach ?”—Horn. 10: 9-15, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW. W 11/1</span><span class="font4"> 17, 18a</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The poor are not able to repay us fully for the spiritual gifts we give them free, but this does not beggar us. While lending to the poor without hoping for any material return at all, still compensation does come. From where? From Jehovah. In having pity and giving to the spiritually poor without receiving material repayment, does one really lend to Jehovah? Yes, because the poor, especially those conscious of their spiritual need, really belong to him. The poor who belong to Jehovah cannot pay back materially, so Jehovah undertakes the indebtedness of these who belong to him. It is amazing to think that the King of the universe, the Owner of all things, considers himself obligated to the one that gives free to the poor who are conscious of their spiritual need. Jehovah discharges all debts thus acquired by fulfilling all his promises to care for and sustain those who fear him and keep his commandments.

A person does not have the right to refuse to answer on the grounds that it might incriminate some other person, although to protect his brothers one may choose to remain silent and face contempt charges. The exemption is individual and for the benefit only of the person claiming it. Even in employment cases a person cannot be compelled to incriminate himself.

<p><span class="font4">We cannot afford to ignore our brothers in the New World society. One may think that by attending the meeting at the Kingdom Hall he shows love ot God; but he who ignores his brothers fails to consider that such love of God is incomplete, is merely formal, for there is a failure to love him by keeping his commandment to love one's neighbor as oneself. We should support meetings, not just by attendance, but by taking part in them where there is such an opportunity. And try not to be latecomers, especially to public talks. If strangers are there on time it makes a bad impression if they see that members of the congregation are late in attending. After the meeting, mingle with those in the hall, giving attention to those who appear to be overlooked.

It is most refreshing to come in contact with, and, after all, that is the great attraction regarding fruit, is it not, even more than its food value? It is so refreshing. Do your brothers find your company refreshing, with never a fear of finding you harsh and unsympathetic as if you were on a higher level than they? Mildness and lowliness are especially desirable, too, when witnessing to others, many of whom are full of weariness of spirit. To those toiling and loaded down Jesus said: “Take my yoke upon you and become my disciples, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart, and you will find refreshment for your souls.” Mildness is also needed by those in any position of responsibility, for when “a man takes some false step before he is aware of it,” those who “have spiritual qualifications” are to “try to restore such a man in the spirit of mildness.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font4"> 20-22a</span></p>

They also must “make sure of all things,” and we want them to belierc in Jehovah’s kingdom. Ours is a peaceful message delivered by peaceful persons. As ministers of the New World society we represent Jehovah, the Sovereign Ruler of the universe. And when we go into a house we should let our peace be manifest to that house. If that house does not want our peaceful message and our peaceful, friendly presence, and it does not want to learn of the glorious kingdom of Jehovah, we do not rebuke the occupant who refuses to hear.

We have consulted the will of God by means of him and have learned that we must “contend for victory in the right contest of the faith.” We know we must each prove to be a “right kind of soldier of Christ Jesus.” He as our High Priest is with us in the camp to counsel us and to encourage us not to fear the enemy but to move forward doing God’s will as theocratic soldiers.

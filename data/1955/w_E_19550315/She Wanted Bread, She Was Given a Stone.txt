She Wanted Bread, She Was Given a Stone
 A Catholic priest in Nassau visited one of his flock and found her reading the book “New Heavens and a New Earth”. He told her that it was “poisonous and pernicious stuff,” and that she was an infidel for reading it. If it was reading matter she wanted, he could provide all that for her. So he brought her a novel based on the supposed love life of Mary Magdalene. This, however, did not satisfy her, as she was hungry for truth and not for fiction. After reading more Watch Tower publications this sheeplike one has come to see that the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses are indeed the truth. In view of the tactics used by the priest is it any wonder that today there is a “famine in the land” regarding the “hearing the words of Jehovah”?—Amos 8:11, AS.

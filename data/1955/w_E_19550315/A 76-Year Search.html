<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> An assembly of Jehovahâ€™s witnesses in Nottingham, England, was attended by an 87-year-old brother from Wales who recounted how 76 years ago he had begun his search for the truth. For more than twenty years he tried different religions, but without satisfaction. For the next fifty years he made no further search but continued to pray for help. Four years ago, at the age of 83, he received a copy of <em>The Watchtower, </em>and a few months later he attended an assembly in Cardiff. Soon he was baptized and today he continues active, devoting more than twice the national average of hours each month to the field service.</p>

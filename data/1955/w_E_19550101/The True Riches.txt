The True Riches
 Paul said he was “as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.” (2 Cor. 6:10) How was this possible? How could a man who was poor possess all things, and make many rich? He could do this because, though his worldly possessions were limited, he had the greatest of riches—the riches that this world frequently ignores. What were they? A knowledge of the truth and the blessings of Jehovah God. Which riches do you value?

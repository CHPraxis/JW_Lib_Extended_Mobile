BRACING UP THE MIND FOR NEW NATION ACTIVITY—1 Pet. 1:13, NW.
New nation activity! What does it mean? Is it promoting and supporting the much-talked-about United Nations, in which 73 per cent of the people in the United States (according to a recent poll) place their best hopes for peace? Bible students know that the United Nations is not the ‘new nation’ spoken of in Bible prophecy. They well know that God’s kingdom by Christ is man’s only hope. Appreciating that the sole purpose of this magazine The Watchtower is to announce Jehovah’s kingdom, all Jehovah’s witnesses this month will offer this vital Bible study aid from house to house at the yearly rate of $1. Three booklets will be given to each new subscriber. Why not share in this grand work? Write us for details.
1955 CONVENTIONS FOR UNITED STATES AND CANADA
Obtaining locations for the conventions this year has just been completed for the United States and Canada. Consequently, the Society is pleased to announce these (as shown below) so all of Jehovah’s witnesses can make necessary vacation arrangements to attend the convention of their choice. All the conventions are for FIVE days, and you will not want to miss any part of them. In other words, the conventions will start Wednesday morning of the respective week they are held.
Further information relative to rooming accommodations will be made at a later date, but in plenty of time to take care of your requirements. Hence it will not be necessary to write for rooms until the proper time when the address for each city is released.

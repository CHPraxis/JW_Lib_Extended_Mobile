<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> The Toronto <em>Globe and Mail, </em>July 24, 1954, headlined an article: “Witnesses Show the Way: Defense Experts Get Tips on Serving Meals.” The item said: “Air Vice-Marshal T. H. Lawrence, Toronto civil defense director, and A. Deslaurier, civil defense co-ordinator for North York, paid a visit to CNE grandstand cafeterias yesterday to observe assembly line feeding of Jehovah’s Witnesses. This was the second visit of civil defense authorities to a Watchtower convention, the first having taken place last year at the Yankee Stadium when New York civil defense officials watched a similar demonstration of mass feeding.” Further, it explained: “Smooth operations were due to two things—pre-organizational work and the enthusiasm of the workers.” Air Marshal Lawrence, the paper stated, “said he was most impressed with the organizational work of the kitchen workers who had ‘many lessons to teach in the organizing of assembly-line feeding.’”</p>

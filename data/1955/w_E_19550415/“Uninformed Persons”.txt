 The following appeared in News Notes of the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors, Vol. 6, No. 7, September, 1954: “The United Press reports that an East German court has imposed sentences totaling 64 years on nine Jehovah’s witnesses. The sect is outlawed in the Communist zone. In this country, a good many uninformed persons seem to think J.W.’s are helping the Communists.”

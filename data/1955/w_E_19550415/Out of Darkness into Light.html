<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> At the district assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses held in Richmond, Virginia, was a clergyman’s daughter who had become one of Jehovah’s witnesses, also her husband who had opposed her interest before he too saw that it was truth, yes, and her clergyman father himself. The daughter and son-in-law, after accepting the message of God’s kingdom, had taken advantage of every opportunity to discuss the new world with this preacher, emphasizing the new earth and its blessings. Both the clergyman and his wife began to show interest. Some of the truth crept into his sermons, and some of the warmth of the audience slipped out. His attendance at the Monday-night home Bible study became regular, and his activity with the Christian Church, a branch of the Disciples of Christ, was dropped. The entire family has now been baptized, dedicating their lives to Jehovah’s service, and are rejoicing in the truth. Said the ex-clergyman: “There is none so blind as he who will not see. No one knows just how deep this darkness can be except one who has been fortunate enough to come out of it.” Happily, thousands of persons of all walks of life are doing that very thing today.</p>

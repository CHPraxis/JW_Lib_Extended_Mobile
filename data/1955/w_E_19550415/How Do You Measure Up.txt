How Do You Measure Up?
 At a recent assembly of Jehovahâ€™s witnesses in Cincinnati, Ohio, a transit company supervisor said he had expected a group of radicals, unreasonable fanatics, who would be difficult to handle. He was amazed, he said, to discover that they were just ordinary people like himself. He said a colored cook with whom he talked could say more in five minutes than he had known in his life, that a little boy quoted more scriptures than any preacher he knew, and that this was the first organization of its kind he had met that was reasonable, logical and easy to get along with and deal with. The witnesses appreciate his comments, but it also reminds us, does it not, of the knowledge that we must have and the high standards we must maintain in order to bring the proper respect to the name we bear?

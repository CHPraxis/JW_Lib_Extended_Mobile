<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In March, 1954, a Mrs. W———— wrote the Watchtower Society requesting her subscription for <em>The Watchtower </em>to be canceled as some of its articles were “not exactly to our liking.” In reply the Society observed that if she could be more specific about her objections it might be able to make explanations and then she doubtless “would be glad to continue to receive our magazine. Since the purpose of our magazine is to be of help we do not like to cancel any subscriptions.” In December, 1954, the Society was glad to receive the following letter:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Some time ago (about six months), I wrote you a letter requesting that <em>The Watchtower </em>no longer be sent to us as our views differed so greatly. At that time you folks sent me a wonderful letter and some fine literature which I studied.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“It has taken quite some while to ‘uproot’ my Catholic belief and traditions; but now I feel I can write you a letter of sincere thanks and gratitude, not only for myself, but also for my husband and two children. Our sincere desire is to keep learning more and more of Jehovah’s wonderful truths and be able to tell others the glorious good news and the happiness it brings into our everyday living.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Thank you again for your wonderful publications and the opportunity of being able to share in the truth of Jehovah’s kingdom.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sj">Very sincerely, [signed]”</p>

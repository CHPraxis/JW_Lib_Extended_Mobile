<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● When Jewish religionists asked John the Baptist if he was Elijah he said, “I am not.” But Jesus told his disciples that John was Elijah. Why the disagreement?—J. C., England.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The record of John’s reply is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:19-43:1:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 1:19-21</a> (<em>NW</em>): “Now this is the witness of John when the Jews sent forth priests and Levites from Jerusalem to him to ask him: ‘Who are you?’ And he confessed and did not deny, but confessed: ‘I am not the Christ.’ And they asked him: ‘What, then? Are you Elijah?’ And he said: ‘I am not.’” Over two years later Jesus said just the opposite: “The disciples put the question to him: ‘Why, then, do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?’ In reply he said: ‘Elijah, indeed, is coming and will restore all things. However, I say to you that Elijah has already come and they did not recognize him but did with him the things they wanted. In this way also the Son of man is destined to suffer at their hands.’ Then the disciples perceived that he spoke to them about John the Baptist.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:10-40:17:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 17:10-13</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Jews questioning John thought that Elijah would be resurrected to return and fulfill Malachi’s prophecy that Elijah would come and do a preparatory work before the arrival of “the great and terrible day of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:4:5-39:4:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mal. 4:5, 6</a>, <em>AS</em>) But John was no resurrected Elijah; so he correctly denied that he was Elijah. But when Jesus said that “Elijah has already come” and the “disciples perceived that he spoke to them about John the Baptist,” Jesus knew that Malachi’s prophecy did not mean Elijah himself would come again, but that one like Elijah would come to do a work similar to that done by Elijah, a work of turning sincere Israelites to true repentance. Jesus knew that before John’s birth it was foretold that “he will be filled with holy spirit right from his mother’s womb, and many of the sons of Israel will he turn back to Jehovah their God. Also he will go before him with Elijah’s spirit and power, to turn back the hearts of fathers to children and the disobedient ones to the practical wisdom of righteous ones, to get ready for Jehovah a prepared people.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:15-42:1:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 1:15-17</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Thus John was to fulfill Malachi’s prophecy, and he did, and therefore he was the Elijah to come according to that prophecy. So Jesus gave the correct answer. But in view of the fact that the Jews who questioned John had in mind a resurrected Elijah, John was also correct in denying he was the prophet in that sense.</p>

To Start Action
 The pastor at the First Methodist church in Cordele, Georgia, announced not long ago that the offering plates on a special Sunday would be filled with one dollar bills. The Sunday came. Each person present was asked to take out one one-dollar bill from the offering plates as they were passed among the parishioners. “Our people are faithful and loyal in their offerings to the church,” explained the pastor, “and we like the idea of the church giving an offering to the people so that they might in turn invest this offering for Christ and his church.” Observers could not help thinking of a rather apt illustration: pouring water into a pump to start action.

More Manufacturing Dextran
 More and more, blood and plasma expanders and substitutes are coming into their own. Thus the November, 1953, issue of the trade journal Sugar, under the heading “Dextran for National Defense,” told of the reasons for discontinuing the use of plasma and the important strides being made in the utilization of dextran, “until recently a nuisance product of sugar manufacturing.” Dextran is now being produced by several leading refineries and chemical corporations and the number of pharmaceutical houses that handle it is increasing right along. At present some of these are delivering their entire supply to the government.

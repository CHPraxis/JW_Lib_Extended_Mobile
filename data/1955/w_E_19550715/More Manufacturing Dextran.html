Thus the November, 1953, issue of the trade journal <em>Sugar, </em>under the heading “Dextran for National Defense,” told of the reasons for discontinuing the use of plasma and the important strides being made in the utilization of dextran, “until recently a nuisance product of sugar manufacturing.” Dextran is now being produced by several leading refineries and chemical corporations and the number of pharmaceutical houses that handle it is increasing right along.

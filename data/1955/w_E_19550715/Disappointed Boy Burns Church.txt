Disappointed Boy Burns Church
 The Bible counsels Christians to instruct their children at a very tender age in the truths of God’s Word. When this is done the parents avoid much heartache and pain. But when parents become negligent, even in instructing youngsters on proper prayer, the consequences could be disastrous. At Milwaukee, Wisconsin, an eight-year-old boy confessed that he set a fire in St. Stanislaus church, causing some $200 damage. The boy’s motive? He said he “wanted to get even with God” for not answering his prayers. Could the church have failed to instruct the parents on right matters for prayer?

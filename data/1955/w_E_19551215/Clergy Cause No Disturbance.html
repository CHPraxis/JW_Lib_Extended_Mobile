<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> When the early Christians preached the good news, quite frequently disturbances arose. As to Paul’s preaching in the district of Asia, the Bible says: “There arose no little disturbance concerning the Way.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:23-44:19:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 19:23</a>, <em>NW</em>) But the pastors of Christendom’s churches are careful that they disturb no one. This they admit. At the sixteenth Michigan Pastors Conference recently Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, president of Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia, said: “The temptation to walk the middle way is strong, to say nothing that will disturb the hearer or offend the powers that be. And it is easy to rationalize the middle way. After all, a minister has to live.” Then to the 500 pastors present Dr. Mays declared: “There are things we know we ought to do, but we fear to lose our jobs if we do them.”—The Detroit <em>News, </em>January 19, 1955.</p>

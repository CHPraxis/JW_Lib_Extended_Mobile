<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What about a witness whose mate dies faithful before Armageddon and is then brought back in a resurrection soon after that battle’s end? Can that couple be reunited and share in the procreation mandate?—A. M., South Africa.</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:2-45:7:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 7:2, 3</a> (<em>NW</em>) states: “A married woman is bound by law to her husband while he is alive; but if her husband dies, she is discharged from the law of her husband. So, then, while her husband is living, she would be styled an adulteress if she became another man’s. But if her husband dies, she is free from his law, so that she is not an adulteress if she becomes another man’s.” Death ends the marriage tie. We cannot say for sure just how Jehovah will arrange matters after Armageddon, but it does not seem unreasonable for two such persons to be reunited after Armageddon if that is the wish of both. They might entertain that hope. However, the one surviving is free to remarry, before Armageddon, and is under no obligation to wait for the resurrection of the deceased one. The marriage tie is completely broken by death. If the survivor remains single and the dead one is raised shortly after Armageddon, they might be made companions if Christ their Everlasting Father pleases, but whether to procreate, we have no definite scripture to favor this.</p>

“But We Can’t Do That!”
In a small town in the Eastern zone of Germany two witnesses of Jehovah came to the home of an elderly clergyman. He invited the two witnesses in. A lively discussion was had on Bible teachings. Toward the end of the discussion the record of Jehovah’s witnesses in the face of persecution was called to his attention and he was asked, ‘In the face of these facts, would it not pay to investigate conscientiously and without prejudice?’
The clergyman admitted this and then explained that he had been giving the matter some thought because only a few days ago a man visited him who had just been released from a Communist prison, and who had told him: “Believe me or not, Mr. ———, but if we hadn’t had those Jehovah’s witnesses with us in prison we would have become desperate, we wouldn’t have been able to hold out!” To which the clergyman added: “I know that God has actually raised up a people in the witnesses of Jehovah, who stand for his Name.” Then in a resigned tone he added, “But we can’t do that.” Why can Jehovah’s witnesses and why cannot such clergymen? Why?

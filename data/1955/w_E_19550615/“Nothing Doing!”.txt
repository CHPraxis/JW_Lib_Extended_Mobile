“Nothing Doing!”
In Eastern Germany two witnesses were going from house to house preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. At one place a man was busy working in his back yard and as one of the witnesses tactfully began to explain the purpose of their visit, the man, sensing that they were Jehovah’s witnesses, became so panic-stricken with fear that he shouted, “Nothing doing!” and rushed into his house lest any one see him talking with the witnesses.
He having shouted so loudly that his neighbors, who were also working in their gardens, wondered what was going on, the two witnesses thought it best to follow the panic-stricken householder into his house. There they were able to calm him and tell him about the Kingdom hope. Arrangements were made to call back upon him and now he wishes to get immersed at the very first opportunity, to confess publicly that he is one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Today he recollects with amusement his once fearful cry, “Nothing doing!”

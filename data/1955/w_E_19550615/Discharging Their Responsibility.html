<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> The printed program of the Calvary (Episcopal) Church in Memphis, Tennessee, said last December 12 that, while statistics are supposed to be dull, these might be of interest: “With a membership of 520,000, Jehovah’s witnesses had adult baptisms at their district assemblies alone amounting to 14,509 in the summer of 1954. This does not include weekly baptisms in Kingdom Halls. Our Church, with a membership of 1,777,631 (confirmed) had 14,952 adult baptisms in 1953. Why the difference, do you suppose? Could it be that we are not taking seriously our responsibility to witness for God and his Church?” It could be. There are less than a third as many of Jehovah’s witnesses as there are members in the religion that made the comparison, but this smaller group performed nearly four times as many baptisms (a total of 57,369 during the year).</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>DAILY PRACTICING TRUE LOVE</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There are those who sing of love a great deal but who do not practice it, because they do not know what true love is. They think of it as self-gratification instead of self sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:18-62:3:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 3:18</a>) True love goes out to others with a desire to aid and do good to them. Jesus stressed to his followers the requirement that one deny himself. True love and service of God prompt one to aid others to a real appreciation of God and his purpose. To that end Jehovah’s witnesses during July will present to people a Bible study aid book and booklet on a contribution of 50c. Would you like to share? Contact the local Kingdom Hall or write this office.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> The apostle Peter counsels Christian ministers: “Sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:15</a>, <em>NW</em>) Whether or not America’s foremost evangelist heeds Peter’s advice to give the witness “with deep respect” may be determined by the following quotation from a speech by Mr. Graham: “Daniel was the prime minister of one of the most powerful countries in the world and a buddy of his boss, the King of the Medes and the Persians. Some jealous guys were out to get him, so they trained their spy glasses on him while he was praying with his Venetian blinds up. They tattled to the King. The King went to his lawyers, said, ‘Boys, find me a couple of loopholes so I can spring my pal Daniel.’ They just couldn’t find any, so the King had to send Daniel to the lions. First thing he does is kick a skinny lion away and say, ‘Move-over, Leo, I want me a nice fat lion with a soft belly for a pillow so’s I can get me a good night’s sleep.’”—New York <em>Daily News, </em>June 13, 1954.</p>

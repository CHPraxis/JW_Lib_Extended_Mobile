Why People Go Astray
 Have you ever wondered why people go astray when they have the Bible to guide them? It is more than inherited sin. It is because Satan the Devil has been hurled down to the earth and is “misleading the entire inhabited earth.” Under his wicked influence the masses are being led astray: “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.”—Rev. 12:9; 1 John 5:19, NW.

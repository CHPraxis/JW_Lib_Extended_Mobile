<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE Watchtower Society’s missionary boat “Hope” arrived at Spencer’s Cove and inquiry was made for use of the United Church school, but the one in charge did not deem that he had the authority to grant us permission. We then investigated as to whether we could use the Church of England Women’s Hall. After the hall committee considered the matter they decided to let us use it for a Bible talk. But one of the responsible businessmen of the village refused to give us the key.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This started an unexpected reaction and the point became the topic of conversation throughout Spencer’s Cove. A telegram was sent to the clergyman and he came to the village to hold a meeting the following day. Many of the women were so indignant over this matter that they threatened to resign. Another lady was overheard to say that if we would have asked her we could have used her front room.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">And sure enough she arranged with her neighbor to have the talk in her house. So the next day she sent word to the boat to have us come to her home to deliver the Bible lecture. Even though there was a special meeting over yesterday’s affair at the time, the house was packed. The following night they wanted another talk in another house and arrangements were made immediately to comply with this request. Again there was a full house. This, mind you, with no advertising on our part. Everything was arranged by the people of the respective homes. Chairs were carried in from neighboring houses to accommodate those in attendance.</p>

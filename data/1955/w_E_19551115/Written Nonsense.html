<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"> Never before has so much been written that is nonsensical. In Roman times Paul told Christians not to act like the people of the nations, who “walk in the unprofitableness of their minds.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:17-49:4:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Eph. 4:17</a>, <em>NW</em>) Just how sadly unprofitable some of the writings of those minds must have been we can imagine from a discovery at Pompeii. It was the custom back then to write on the walls of buildings. Some shrewd reader and commentator of the writings of others had written on a wall in Pompeii the following in Latin: “It is a wonder, O wall, that thou hast not yet crumbled under the weight of so much written nonsense.”</p>

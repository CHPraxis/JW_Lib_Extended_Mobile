<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Cosmetic surgery is a new approach to helping those suffering from Down’s syndrome, although such surgery can be very costly. One child in Britain and a few children in the United States have had such operations. But the pioneer work on 60 children has been done in Israel by a team of surgeons headed by Professor Ruben Feuerstein.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What is involved? Surplus folds of skin can be removed to correct slanting eyes. Silicone implants can be used to make a new bridge for the nose. Cheekbones can be raised and a receding chin reshaped. Ears can also be pinned back closer to the head. And an outsize tongue, common to many with Down’s syndrome, can be trimmed.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“These children,” commented Feuerstein, “are frequently confined to the educational dustbin and some are even left to die in [the] hospital after they are born. Because of their very distinctive looks they are assumed to be much more backward than they often are.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Pointing to apparently satisfying effects in the case of one girl in Britain, London’s <em>Sunday Times </em>published its report under the headline “Happiness is a brand new face.” Of course, plastic surgery in such instances has its critics. And <em>Awake! </em>does not endorse or recommend specific forms of therapy, recognizing that these are matters for personal decision.</p>

Down’s Syndrome​—A Modern Approach
Cosmetic surgery is a new approach to helping those suffering from Down’s syndrome, although such surgery can be very costly. One child in Britain and a few children in the United States have had such operations. But the pioneer work on 60 children has been done in Israel by a team of surgeons headed by Professor Ruben Feuerstein.
What is involved? Surplus folds of skin can be removed to correct slanting eyes. Silicone implants can be used to make a new bridge for the nose. Cheekbones can be raised and a receding chin reshaped. Ears can also be pinned back closer to the head. And an outsize tongue, common to many with Down’s syndrome, can be trimmed.
“These children,” commented Feuerstein, “are frequently confined to the educational dustbin and some are even left to die in [the] hospital after they are born. Because of their very distinctive looks they are assumed to be much more backward than they often are.”
Pointing to apparently satisfying effects in the case of one girl in Britain, London’s Sunday Times published its report under the headline “Happiness is a brand new face.” Of course, plastic surgery in such instances has its critics. And Awake! does not endorse or recommend specific forms of therapy, recognizing that these are matters for personal decision.

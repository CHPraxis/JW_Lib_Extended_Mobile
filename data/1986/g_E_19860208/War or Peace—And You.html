<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>What Is War?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">“War is an element of the order of the world established by God. Without war the world would stagnate and lose itself in materialism.”​—German field marshal Helmuth von Moltke.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sa">“Suppress war, and it would be like trying to suppress the processes of nature.”​—Joseph P. Goebbels, Nazi minister for propaganda and national enlightenment.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sa">‘A part of politics.’​—Russian leader Lenin.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sa">“The only study of a prince. He should consider peace only as a breathing-time, which gives him leisure to contrive, and furnishes ability to execute, military plans.”​—Italian political philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sa"><strong>What Is Peace?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sa">“A period of cheating between two periods of fighting.”​—Ambrose Bierce, American journalist.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sa">“A moribund condition, caused by a surplus of civilians, which war seeks to remedy.”​—Cyril Connolly, English critic and writer.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sa">“A dream, and not even a beautiful one.”​—Helmuth von Moltke.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">HOW do the above-quoted expressions strike you? Do you sense a cynical approach to war and peace? Do they give you the impression that for many people, especially rulers and politicians, life is cheap​—as long as it is not their life that is at stake? Yet we are sure that regardless of your nationality you would like to live in a world of peace and harmony.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">During mankind’s 6,000 years of history<strong>, </strong>war has reaped its dead by the hundreds of millions. Even after the experience of two world wars<strong>, </strong>peace and harmony seem to be a dream. As Gwynne Dyer wrote in his recent book <em>War: </em>“During the last two years of World War II, over one million people were being killed <em>each month.</em> If the great powers go to war with each other just once more, using all the weapons they now have, <em>a million people will be killed each minute.” </em>And if the nuclear powers go to war, will they consult the people first for their opinion? History answers otherwise.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Past conflicts and the present potential for slaughter lead us to ask, What are the causes of war? What are the prospects for a true, lasting peace in our time​—not just a breathing space between wars? And in this nuclear age, is lasting peace an elusive dream?</p>

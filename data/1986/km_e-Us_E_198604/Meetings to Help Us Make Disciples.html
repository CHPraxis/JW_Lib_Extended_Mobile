<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>What Do You Treasure? A talk with some audience participation, stressing keeping spiritual goals to the fore and maintaining confidence in Jehovah’s power to provide. Important to answer this properly since heart is centered on what we value most highly in life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:21-40:6:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 6:21</a>) Guarding heart, seat of motivation, and channeling its desire in right direction bear on our everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:23-20:4:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 4:23</a>) Taking a wrong view of material things, whether rich or poor, can lead to misplaced trust or becoming overly concerned about lack of material advantages. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:15-20:10:15" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 10:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:11-20:18:11" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 18:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:15-42:12:15" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Luke 12:15</a>) Most valuable possession is a good relationship with Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:63:3-19:63:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 63:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:27-19:73:28" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 73:27, 28</a>) Material things will be of no value on day of judgment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:4-20:11:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 11:4</a>) Important to maintain proper balance now while pursuing spiritual goals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:30:8-20:30:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 30:8, 9</a>) Christians should be encouraging spiritual goals, such as auxiliary and regular pioneer service, Bethel and missionary service, or increasing and refining sacrifice of praise to Jehovah. No need for parents to fear they are jeopardizing future of young ones if they set spiritual goals before them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:25-19:37:25" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 37:25</a>) When important decisions in life must be made, do we prove that our affections are centered on Jehovah and Kingdom interests or on other things? (May get expressions from some in congregation who have set fine example in this regard.) Keep affections fixed on what is everlasting.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:91:14-19:91:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 91:14-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:18-47:4:18" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 4:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Help Young Ones Share in Giving a Witness. Interview and demonstrations. Parents have primary responsibility to teach young ones from infancy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:15-55:3:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:15</a>) All can be conscious of assisting those of tender years when working in service with them. Young ones like to be involved when at doors instead of standing idle. Ask a parent or two with young ones how they involve their children in witnessing at the doors. If old enough, do they have service bag with Bible and literature? How do you introduce young ones and permit them to share in reading scripture or making offer? Briefly demonstrate how a young one can offer householder free tract when offer from older publisher is refused. Also, briefly demonstrate how parent or older publisher may introduce conversation and then allow young one to read scripture. Encourage all to be conscious of assisting young ones to share in giving witness at doors.​—See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:21:16-40:21:16" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 21:16</a>.</p>

Make Good Use of Older Tracts
1 A brief printed message that is designed to catch the eye and provoke thought​—that is what our Kingdom News tracts have proved to be over the years. So it is important to make wise use of them. Rather than allowing these tracts to lie around and become discolored or soiled, we should be alert to use them in our ministry!
2 Even though we are not in a tract distribution campaign, publishers can wisely use tracts when the householder does not take the regular offer or the magazines. They may also be left when householders are not at home. Each tract provides a concise summary of a timely subject, making them effective tools in reaching people of various persuasions and interests. At times, a well-chosen tract is most effective in giving a further witness. It is free, can be read quickly, and invites the reader to obtain further information.
3 Some congregations still have older tracts on these timely subjects: “Is Time Running Out for Mankind?” (No. 16); “The Family​—Can It Survive?” (No. 24); “Why Are We Here?” (No. 25); “Hope for Ending Inflation, Sickness, Crime, War” (No. 28); “Is a Happy Life Really Possible?” (No. 29). Make good use of them in your ministry so that they are not wasted. Congregations may order Kingdom News Nos. 30 to 33 when additional tracts are desired. You may wish to carry a variety of tracts to present in service. But be sure the tracts you use are still presentable.
4 Literature servants are encouraged to place a supply of the tracts on the counter or at some other convenient place so that those picking up literature can see what is available. No doubt many will be glad to take a supply for the appropriate contribution and use them effectively in the field ministry.

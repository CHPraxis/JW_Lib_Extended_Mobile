<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what one father reported when he came to the branch office of the Watch Tower Society in Peru recently. He explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“My little boy has been pestering me for weeks, wanting me to get him the book <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>Ever since one of his schoolmates got it, my boy has not given me a minute’s peace. I have been searching high and low to find where to get a copy. I did not have the slightest idea where to start. Inquiries at bookstores brought no results.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I mentioned it to one of my office workers, and he said I should go to Jehovah’s Witnesses to get it. I said, ‘Oh, no! Not those people. They are always coming to my door, and I keep turning them away.’ But he convinced me that you are not so bad​—in fact, he spoke very highly of you and said that the book I was looking for was really a good one. So here I am. I want that book.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We feel that you, too, will want this beautifully illustrated, large-print publication. Its 116 Bible accounts give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Please send, postpaid, the hardcover publication <em>My Book of Bible Stories, </em>for which I enclose $2.50 (U.S.).</p>

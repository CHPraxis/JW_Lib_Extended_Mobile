“My Boy Has Not Given Me a Minute’s Peace”
That is what one father reported when he came to the branch office of the Watch Tower Society in Peru recently. He explained:
“My little boy has been pestering me for weeks, wanting me to get him the book My Book of Bible Stories. Ever since one of his schoolmates got it, my boy has not given me a minute’s peace. I have been searching high and low to find where to get a copy. I did not have the slightest idea where to start. Inquiries at bookstores brought no results.
“I mentioned it to one of my office workers, and he said I should go to Jehovah’s Witnesses to get it. I said, ‘Oh, no! Not those people. They are always coming to my door, and I keep turning them away.’ But he convinced me that you are not so bad​—in fact, he spoke very highly of you and said that the book I was looking for was really a good one. So here I am. I want that book.”
We feel that you, too, will want this beautifully illustrated, large-print publication. Its 116 Bible accounts give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about.
Please send, postpaid, the hardcover publication My Book of Bible Stories, for which I enclose $2.50 (U.S.).

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE cream-colored Land-Rover was laden with supplies, spares, and Bible literature. It was heading north from Windhoek, capital of South-West Africa (Namibia). The time? May of 1981. As they drove through the flat, dry countryside, the four passengers had time to meditate on the exciting trip ahead.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The driver, Chris du Plessis, and his partner were Jehovah’s Witnesses and regular pioneers, that is, full-time preachers of the Kingdom message. They had just spent several enjoyable weeks in Katatura, the large black township near Windhoek. Both of them had found it exhilarating to preach the good news of God’s Kingdom from house to house among the black people with their friendly attitude and good response to the message.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The two young men had been asked to provide transportation for circuit overseer Schalk Coetzee and his wife to isolated groups of Witnesses up north, where some roads are impassable by ordinary vehicles. With the Land-Rover they could camp anywhere​—the Coetzees sleeping “downstairs” in the vehicle and the two young men “upstairs” in a tent on the roof!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">After driving some 370 kilometers<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> the party reached the “death triangle”​—so called because many people have lost their lives there because of intense guerrilla activity by raiders from Angola. Farther north they saw several wrecked cars but had no trouble.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Their first visit was at Ondangwa, a military post not far from Angola. Special pioneers were caring for the small congregation there. Christo Els and his wife Elizabeth had learned the local language, Ndonga​—a real challenge. But the people listened well and had deep respect for the Bible. Sometimes Christo had to take over plowing with donkeys or his wife had to hoe the field so that householders could be free to listen to the Kingdom message!</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>Since the area was a war zone, travelers on gravel roads ran the risk of land mines. So Christo and Elizabeth often drove on sandy bush roads, and people they met were very surprised that they carried no weapons.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">It was a real joy for them to visit the Ovahimba people living primitive lives in a remote area. These people were dressed in skins, their bodies smeared with ocher. The pioneers used a publication they had helped to translate. What a thrill to see these people show appreciation for the Kingdom message!</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">A one-day assembly was held during the week’s visit of Brother Coetzee and his party. Since the area was sparsely populated, the attendance was small. But all in this remote outpost were thrilled with the program and fine association.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>The Caprivi Strip</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">After a brief stop at Rundu to obtain permits, the party entered the Caprivi Strip. As the map shows, this is a narrow corridor of territory stretching from northeastern Namibia deep into the heart of southern Africa. It is 480 kilometers long and 80 kilometers wide at its widest point and shares borders with Angola, Zambia, and Botswana. Although it is also a militarily controlled area, it is more peaceful than the territory to the west.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">The population of the Caprivi is about 40,000, consisting mostly of blacks, although Bushmen often roam into the western section. Many inhabitants speak English and can read and write. As the party drove east, they often stopped to speak to people, and they also enjoyed the scenery​—trees and wildlife, including elephants and antelope. Upon approaching Katima Mulilo, the only “town,” the groups of neat thatched huts became more frequent. The pioneers were so fascinated by the place that when Schalk Coetzee asked if they would be willing to serve in this remote location, they gladly accepted the privilege.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">After a brief stay in Katima Mulilo, the quartet was off again to visit the isolated group at Kasane in northern Botswana. They traveled through the Chobe Game Reserve, at times alongside large buffalo and elephant herds. When they camped at night, they heard lions roaring nearby.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">At Kasane, with local pioneers interpreting, they preached from hut to hut, African style. The approach is slow and dignified. The visitor stands outside the hut and calls out to attract attention. Someone responds and invites him to enter and be seated. Usually the whole family is summoned to listen. Then follows a lengthy exchange of greetings and inquiries about health and origin. Only then does the Witness begin discussing a Bible topic.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The local Witnesses were very happy and grateful that the party had come so far to visit them. Meetings had to be held in a mud hut. So Schalk Coetzee encouraged them to build their own Kingdom Hall.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Returning to Katima Mulilo, the travelers all enjoyed a week’s visit with the local Witnesses. At night they camped near the Zambezi River and appreciated the silence, broken only by the throb of distant drums​—the “heartbeat” of Africa. They found the local group zealous but needing much direction on how to conduct meetings, how to witness from hut to hut, how properly to legalize marriages, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">The visitors really enjoyed the preaching work! Said one: “When the people learned that we had Bible books in Silozi, their language, they nearly overwhelmed us, requesting not only books but also someone to teach them. It was unbelievable!”</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>Reluctantly the party left their new friends in Katima Mulilo and began the return trip. They spent a week with the local congregation at Rundu in northern Namibia. Most of the brothers there were refugees from Angola who spoke Portuguese. Another language problem! After a trip of about 4,000 kilometers, they reached Windhoek, tired but happy and very grateful to Jehovah for the many privileges they had enjoyed.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>Back to Katima Mulilo</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">The two pioneers returned to Katima Mulilo, this time to remain and help Jehovah’s “sheep.” To stay, they needed accommodations and part-time work. At their first attempt they found work. They also obtained permission to use a caravan, a motor vehicle, belonging to the Watch Tower Society. And they thanked Jehovah for thus caring for their needs.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Soon, the pioneers were involved in helping the local Witnesses in various ways. This included building a Kingdom Hall. They cut long grass for the roof, collected the special mud found in anthills that sets very hard, and learned to thatch the roof​—African style. With whitewashed walls, the hall looked neat and attractive. Since they could not afford chairs, seating was on benches or logs. It was rough-and-ready, but it was their own Kingdom Hall!</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">There had been no properly conducted meetings. So the pioneers prepared the five weekly meetings held by Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide. This meant a lot of work, but for them and the local Witnesses, it was upbuilding spiritually. The pioneers also had to learn Silozi, the local language.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Before long, a congregation was formed. In time, four of the local brothers were able to deliver public talks and handle all meetings, and one was appointed as a ministerial servant. Meanwhile, the <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>pioneers were greatly enjoying the preaching work from hut to hut. So many people wanted to study the Bible that they could not handle all the requests. Would you not like to serve in territory like that? Could you?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>Another Visit to Kasane</strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">The circuit overseer had asked the pioneers to visit the group at Kasane in Botswana from time to time. On one occasion, they ran into serious trouble. Botswana soldiers stopped them near the border.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">“You are spies!” said the leader.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">“No, we are ministers, Jehovah’s Witnesses, teaching the people about the Bible.”</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">“I don’t believe you are Christians. You are South African soldiers.”</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">It was a difficult situation. But when the soldiers saw the supplies of Bible literature and no guns, they let the brothers go.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">The tense military situation in the area also made contact with Zambia very difficult. Only the Zambezi River separates Katima Mulilo from Zambia, where Jehovah’s Witnesses are numerous and have large supplies of Silozi literature. But with troops watching, the local people did not dare to cross the river in their <em>mokolos, </em>or dugout canoes. Once or twice there was a shoot-out across the river.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong>Caring for Scattered “Sheep”</strong></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">All of this, however, did not prevent the pioneers from looking after the “sheep” in the Caprivi Strip, including some scattered ones. For example, they had heard that Andrew, an elderly man in a village some 70 kilometers from Katima, was deeply interested in the Bible. When they found him, he was actually reading the book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life </em>and was almost overcome with joy by the visit! For years he had studied by himself, and he was greatly encouraged by the help the pioneers gave him.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Frank Mwemba is also very isolated. He lives in a village about a hundred kilometers from Katima. His home can be reached only with a four-wheel-drive vehicle, and even then only at certain times of the year, since much of the Caprivi is marshy and periodically under water. Frank had accepted the truth in Zambia, had been baptized there, and then had returned to his native village in the Caprivi. For many years he had carried on alone. Had he kept on preaching in that isolated place? Had he resisted the local practices of witchcraft and polygamy? Was his marriage legally registered? Yes! Frank supports his wife​—only one—​and children by fishing and farming, and he spends days visiting scattered villages in his <em>mokolo </em>or on foot so as to spread the good news. He regularly studies with his family, avoids witch doctors, and proudly showed the visitors his marriage certificate!</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">On another occasion, Chris made a trip <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>by barge down the Zambezi River to the flat, marshy region of Nantungu. He had heard that there were interested ones there. ‘What will I find?’ wondered Chris as, knapsack on his back, he jumped from the barge to the bank. To his delight he found a little group trying to live according to the Bible as they had been taught by Zambian Witnesses. They were overjoyed to see the Silozi publications that Chris had brought with him, including the latest issues of <em>The Watchtower. </em>For the next three days, Chris was busy with Bible discussions and visits to nearby villages to meet with interested ones. Before leaving, he made arrangements for regular meetings and Kingdom preaching.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="ss"><strong>A Change of Partners</strong></p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">Because of health problems, Chris’ partner had to leave the Caprivi early in 1982. Later, Chris was joined by a second partner, Melt Marais, a brother who served zealously in the Caprivi for almost a year. In May 1983 he married Magda, a young pioneer sister, and she became his third partner in the Caprivi. Their wedding talk was given in the little Kingdom Hall that Chris had helped to build.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">It took Magda a while to adjust to life in the Caprivi. The caravan had been moved to an area outside town with no electricity or running water. There they were often “invaded” by elephants at night. To shine a torch through a caravan window and see the huge bulk of an elephant two meters or so away was at first quite alarming for Magda! But she soon adapted to the new life and loved it. Her example encouraged the small congregation in Katima.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Also very encouraging for the Caprivi brothers was attending circuit assemblies in Francistown, Botswana (650 kilometers away). They were especially delighted to attend a district convention near Johannesburg (about 1,400 kilometers distant). They were amazed to see the huge crowd of Witnesses and such a smooth-running organization and to experience great kindness from the white brothers and sisters​—all evidence of Jehovah’s spirit in action.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">But it was the faithful, loving ministry of the young pioneers that was the most upbuilding for the “sheep” in the Caprivi who so urgently needed help. In turn, supplying that help brought great joy to the pioneers who were willing to serve where the need was very great.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">In September 1983, however, Chris and Magda had to leave the Caprivi. Why? He explains: “We were invited to serve at the South Africa branch of the Watch Tower Society. We were sorry to say good-bye to the 13 Caprivi publishers and many interested ones in the small congregation and three groups we left behind. Our prayers are that Jehovah may supply more workers to cultivate this field, ripe for harvest.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:37-40:9:38" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 9:37, 38</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">There are many other places where help is needed. Are you able and willing to serve in this way, to give of yourself to care for Jehovah’s sheep? If so, there are rich rewards in store for you. As Jesus said: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p>

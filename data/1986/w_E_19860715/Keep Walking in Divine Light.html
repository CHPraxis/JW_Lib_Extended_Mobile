<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 1, 2. When and where was First John written, and to whom does it apply?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb">JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES are grateful for divine light and intend to keep walking in it. Doing so is not easy, however, for even early disciples of Jesus Christ were faced with apostasy. But Jesus’ loyal apostles restrained its spread, and one who ‘acted as a restraint’ was the apostle John. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:1-53:2:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 2:1-12</a>) As a very old man living in or near Ephesus about 98 C.E., he wrote his first divinely inspired letter. Its counsel helped first-century Christians to keep walking in divine light. But what about us?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>John’s words are just as helpful to 20th-century Christians. So during private study of this article and the two that follow it, be sure to read all cited portions of his first inspired letter as they are being considered. In the apostle’s letter and our remarks thereon, such pronouns as “we” and “us” refer chiefly to Jesus’ anointed followers. But basic principles relating to righteousness, love, faith, and the like, also apply to Christians with earthly hopes.</p>

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 3. What evidence is there that God’s Son lived, suffered, and died as a human, and why is he called “the word of life”?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>John first speaks about a joyful “sharing.” (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:1:1-62:1:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><em>1 John 1:1-4</em></a><em>.</em>) Jesus, “the word of life,” was with Jehovah “from the beginning” as God’s first creation, by means of whom “all other things were created.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Colossians 1:15, 16</a>) Certain first-century apostates claimed to be sinless and denied Christ’s rightful place in the divine arrangement. But Jesus’ apostles heard him speak, viewed him attentively, and touched him. They knew that God’s power operated through him. So there was eyewitness evidence that he was God’s Son who had lived, suffered, and died as a human. He is “the word of life” because “life [eternal] was made manifest” through Jesus, by means of whom God has provided the ransom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 6:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:1:9-55:1:10" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 1:9, 10</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>By what the apostles said and wrote, they ‘bore witness’ about the sinless human Jesus Christ. John ‘reported’ such matters so that anointed ones might have “a sharing,” or fellowship, with other Kingdom heirs, with the Father, and with His Son. This “sharing” denotes unity and causes great joy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:133:1-19:133:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 133:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:20-43:17:21" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> John 17:20, 21</a>) Apostates who hate former associates in Jehovah’s service no longer have such fellowship with God and Christ.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Stated next is a “message” the apostles received from Jesus. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:1:5-62:1:7" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><em>1 John 1:5-7</em></a><em>.</em>) It is this: “God is light and there is no darkness at all [nothing unholy, immoral, untrue, or wicked] in union with him.” So Jehovah’s Witnesses shun all sinful practices associated with darkness.

They claimed to have secret knowledge, but God is light, not dark secrecy.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>If we say we have “a sharing” with God but “go on walking in the darkness,” leading a sinful life, we “are lying and are not practicing the truth,” or living in harmony with it. But if we pursue a course harmonizing with the truth, we are in the light, even as God is. We have “a sharing” with fellow Christians, all of whom are unified in doctrine, spiritual outlook, disciple-making work, and other aspects of pure worship.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Unlike certain early apostates, we who ‘walk in the light’ acknowledge that sin is unclean.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:28:13-20:28:13" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:13</a>) God said of those in the new covenant: “Their sin I shall remember no more.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:31-24:31:34" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jeremiah 31:31-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:7-58:8:12" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Hebrews 8:7-12</a>) In forgiving them, he is faithful to that promise.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Furthermore, God is “righteous,” always adhering to his standards of righteousness. He has satisfied justice through the ransom and can ‘forgive our sins and cleanse us of all unrighteousness’ if we confess our sinfulness with faith in Jesus’ sacrifice.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>John writes “these things” about sin, forgiveness, and cleansing so that we may not practice sin.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>To keep walking in divine light, we must obey Jehovah. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:3-62:2:6" data-bid="24-1" class="b"><em>1 John 2:3-6</em></a><em>.</em>) We realize that we “have come to know” God, understanding him and his qualities, if “we continue observing his commandments.” Anyone claiming to know Jehovah but failing to obey him “is a liar.” Conversely, “the love of God has been made perfect,” or complete, if we observe his word. “By this” evidence of obeying and loving God, we know we are “in union with him.” And we are obliged to walk as his Son did, in the disciple-making work, in our relationships with others, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">12. What “old commandment” do Christians have, and how is it also “new”?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Brotherly love is also vital. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:7-62:2:8" data-bid="25-1" class="b"><em>1 John 2:7, 8</em></a><em>.</em>) John is writing “an old commandment” that the faithful have had “from the beginning” of their lives as Christians. It is “old” because Jesus gave it years earlier when he told his followers to ‘love one another just as he loved them.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:34" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 13:34</a>) Yet it is also “new” because it goes beyond the neighbor love required by the Law and calls for willingness to surrender one’s soul in behalf of fellow believers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:18-3:19:18" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Leviticus 19:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:12-43:15:13" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> John 15:12, 13</a>) Since our self-sacrificing love proves that compliance with this “new commandment” is ‘true both in Christ’s case and in ours, the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining’ among us.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">13. According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:9-62:2:11" data-bid="54-1" class="b">1 John 2:9-11</a>, who is “in the light” and who is not?</p>

Actually, a professing Christian who hates his brother “does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:13-40:13:15" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Matthew 13:13-15</a>) Will this warning move you to avoid spiritual darkness by refusing to let personal differences, the lies of apostates, or anything else destroy your brotherly love?</p>

The “young men” are victorious over Satan because they are spiritually “strong” and “the word of God” remains in them.

Since “an anointing from the holy one,” Jehovah, helps them to understand his Word, ‘all of them have knowledge.’ (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:20-62:2:21" data-bid="43-1" class="b"><em>1 John 2:20,</em> <em>21</em></a><em>.</em>) They surely know “the truth” as it relates to Jesus Christ, whereas the apostates have erroneous ideas about him. Since “no lie originates with the truth,” all lovers of Jehovah reject such false views and those advocating them.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="qu">22. What did C. T. Russell do when one of his early associates denied the ransom?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[65]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>After all, “who is the liar if it is not the one that denies that Jesus is the Christ,” God’s Anointed One? (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:22-62:2:25" data-bid="44-1" class="b"><em>1 John 2:22-25</em></a><em>.</em>) Why, ‘the one that denies the Father and the Son is the antichrist’! Interestingly, when an early associate of Bible student Charles T. Russell denied the ransom, Russell withdrew from fellowship with him and began publishing this journal, which has always declared the truth about Christ’s origin, Messianic role, and loving service as the “propitiatory sacrifice.”</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="qu">23. How does ‘confessing the Son’ affect our relationship with God, and our prospects?</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[66]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>Apostates who deny Christ do not have Jehovah as their Friend. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:23-43:5:23" data-bid="45-1" class="b">John 5:23</a>) But we who publicly ‘confess the Son have the Father,’ being in an approved relationship with God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:32-40:10:33" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Matthew 10:32, 33</a>) Jesus’ loyal early followers clung to what they had heard about God’s Son “from the beginning” of their lives as Christians. And if the same truth is in our hearts, we will “abide in union” with both God and Christ and will receive “the promised thing,” everlasting life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="47-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p>

<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="qu">24. Who have an “anointing” by holy spirit, and why do they “not need anyone to be teaching” them?</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[67]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>To walk in divine light and not be misled by apostates, we need proper spiritual instruction. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:26-62:2:29" data-bid="48-1" class="b"><em>1 John 2:26</em><em>-29</em></a><em>.</em>) Spirit-begotten ones have an “anointing” by holy spirit, have come to know God and his Son, and “do not need anyone [an apostate] to be teaching” them. By his anointing spirit, God “is teaching” spiritual Israelites “about all things” needed in order to worship him acceptably. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:23-43:4:24" data-bid="49-1" class="b">John 4:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:45-43:6:45" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> 6:45</a>) We are delighted that as Jehovah’s Witnesses we receive such spiritual instruction from God through “the faithful and discreet slave.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45-47</a>.</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="qu">25, 26. (a) Why can anointed ones have “freeness of speech”? (b) What does it mean to ‘practice righteousness’?</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><sup>25 </sup>John urges well-instructed anointed ones to “remain in union with” God. Those “in union with” Jehovah are similarly at unity with his Son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:19-43:14:21" data-bid="51-1" class="b">John 14:19-21</a>) Such unity is urged so that “when he [Christ] is made manifest we may have freeness of speech and not be shamed away from him at <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>his presence,” that is, during his Parousia.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" data-rel-pid="[68]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>Since we are now living during Jesus’ “presence,” how can we make sure that we have nothing to be ashamed of and are really walking in divine light? By ‘practicing righteousness.’ ‘If we know that God is righteous,’ John reasons, ‘we are aware that everyone practicing righteousness has been born from him.’ ‘Practicing righteousness’ means obeying God’s commandments, avoiding unrighteousness, and engaging in such fine works as making disciples and assisting fellow believers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Mark 13:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:14-50:4:19" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> Philippians 4:14-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:17-54:6:18" data-bid="52-3" class="b"> 1 Timothy 6:17, 18</a>) Being “born from” God means being “born again” as his spiritual children.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:3-43:3:8" data-bid="53-1" class="b">John 3:3-8</a>.</p>

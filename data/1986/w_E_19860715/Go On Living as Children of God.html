<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 9. In what sense is it that the spirit-begotten Christian “cannot practice sin,” and why is this so?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>John next distinguishes between God’s children and those of the Devil.

Jehovah’s “reproductive seed,” or holy spirit that gives one “a new birth” to a heavenly hope, remains in the individual unless he resists and thus ‘grieves’ the spirit, so that God withdraws it.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span><sup>10 </sup>One way to distinguish between God’s children and those of the Devil is this: “Everyone who does not carry on righteousness does not originate with God.” Unrighteousness is so characteristic of the Devil’s children that they “do not sleep unless they do badness, and their sleep has been snatched away unless they cause someone to stumble,” which is what apostates would like to do to loyal Christians.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:14-20:4:16" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:14-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">11. (a) What is another way to identify those who are not God’s children? (b) Reflecting on Cain’s course should move us to do what?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Furthermore, “neither does he [originate with God] who does not love his brother.” In fact, the “message” we have heard “from the beginning” of our lives as Jehovah’s Witnesses is that “we should have love for one another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:34" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 13:34</a>) So we are “not like Cain,” who showed that he “originated with the wicked one” by ‘slaughtering his brother’ in a violent manner characteristic of the manslayer Satan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:4:2-1:4:10" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Genesis 4:2-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> John 8:44</a>) Cain slaughtered Abel “because his own works were wicked, but those of his brother were righteous.” Surely, reflecting on Cain’s course should move us to guard against similar hatred of our spiritual brothers.</p>

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">12. How do “we know we have passed over from death to life,” and what does this mean?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>If we were to copy Cain, we would be spiritually dead. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:13-62:3:15" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><em>1 John 3:13-15</em></a><em>.</em>) He hated his brother so much that he killed him, and we are not surprised that the world similarly hates us, for Jesus foretold this. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:13-41:13:13" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Mark 13:13</a>) But “we know [or, are confident that] we have passed over from [spiritual] death to life [eternal], because we love the brothers,” our fellow witnesses of Jehovah. Because of that brotherly love, coupled with faith in Christ, no longer are we ‘dead’ in trespasses and sins, but God has lifted from us His condemnation, and we have been raised out of spiritual death, being given the hope of everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:24-43:5:24" data-bid="24-1" class="b">John 5:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:1-49:2:7" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Ephesians 2:1-7</a>) Loveless apostates have no such hope, for “he who does not love remains in [spiritual] death.”</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">13. If we hate our brother, why should we make this a matter of prayer?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Really, “everyone who hates his brother is a manslayer.” Physical murder may not be committed (as when Cain killed Abel out of envy and hatred), but the hater would prefer that his spiritual brother not be alive. Since Jehovah reads the heart, the hater stands condemned. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:2-20:21:2" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:2</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:21-40:5:22" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Matthew 5:21, 22</a>.) No such unrepentant “manslayer,” or hater of a fellow believer, “has everlasting life remaining in him.” So if we hate any fellow Witness secretly, should we not pray for Jehovah’s help in changing our spirit to one of brotherly love?</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">14. To what extent are we called upon to show brotherly love?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>If we are to go on living as children of God, we must show brotherly love in word and deed.

In times of persecution, for example, “we are under obligation to surrender our souls for our brothers,” even as Prisca and Aquila “risked their own necks for [the apostle Paul’s] soul.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:3-45:16:4" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Romans 16:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:12-43:15:13" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> John 15:12, 13</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>If we would give our lives for our brothers, we should be willing to do less demanding things in their behalf. Suppose we have “this world’s means for supporting life”​—money, food, clothing, and the like, made possible by the world. We may ‘behold’ a brother in need, not just casually seeing this but gazing upon the situation. His plight may cause “the door” of our “tender compassions,” or deepest feelings, to be opened. But what if we slam that “door” shut by allowing selfishness to thwart our intention to help him? Then “in what way does the love of God” remain in us? It is not enough merely to talk about brotherly love. As God’s children, we must manifest it “in deed and truth.” For example, if a brother is famished, he needs food, not mere words.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:14-59:2:17" data-bid="29-1" class="b">James 2:14-17</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:11-19:119:11" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Psalm 119:11</a>) If our hearts do condemn us, perhaps because we feel that we have not shown fellow worshipers enough love, remember that “God is greater than our hearts and knows all things.” He is merciful because he is aware of our “unhypocritical brotherly affection,” our fight against sin, and our efforts to live in a way pleasing <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:22-60:1:22" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:10-19:103:14" data-bid="32-2" class="b"> Psalm 103:10-14</a>) “If our hearts do not condemn us” because there are deeds proving our brotherly love, and we are not guilty of concealed sins, “we have freeness of speech toward God” in prayer.

<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">17. God’s “commandment” involves what two requirements?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>If we expect to have our prayers answered, we must keep God’s “commandment” involving these two requirements: (1) We must have faith in Jesus’ “name,” accepting the ransom and acknowledging his God-given authority. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:9-50:2:11" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Philippians 2:9-11</a>) (2) We must also “be loving one another” just as Jesus commanded.

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>A person observing God’s commandments “remains in union with him,” at unity with Jehovah. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:20-43:17:21" data-bid="36-1" class="b">John 17:20, 21</a>.) But how do “we gain the knowledge” that God is “remaining in union with us”?

<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="qu">19, 20. Why “test the inspired expressions,” and what help does John provide in this regard?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>John next shows how we must be on guard. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:1-62:4:1" data-bid="38-1" class="b"><em>1 John 4:1</em></a><em>.</em>) We must not believe every spirit, or “inspired expression,” but we should “test the inspired expressions to see whether they originate with God.” Why? “Because many false prophets have gone forth into the world.” At least some of these deceptive teachers were then traveling about, associating with various congregations, and seeking to “draw away the disciples after themselves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:29-44:20:30" data-bid="39-1" class="b">Acts 20:29, 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:7-63:1:7" data-bid="39-2" class="b"> 2 John 7</a>) So the faithful needed to be on guard.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Some first-century Christians had “discernment of inspired utterances,” a miraculous gift of God’s active force evidently enabling them to determine whether inspired expressions originated with Jehovah.

Although the spirit’s gift of ‘discerning inspired utterances’ has passed away, John’s words provide the means of determining whether teachers are moved by God’s spirit or by demonic influences.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="qu">21. What was one means of testing “inspired expressions”?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Note one means of testing.

(<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:4-62:4:6" data-bid="44-1" class="b"><em>1 John 4:4-6</em></a><em>.</em>) As Jehovah’s <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>servants, we have “conquered,” or overcome, the false teachers, triumphing over their attempts to draw us away from God’s truth. This spiritual victory has been possible because God, who is “in union with” loyal Christians, “is greater than he [the Devil] that is in union with the world,” or unrighteous human society. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:4-47:4:4" data-bid="45-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>) Because apostates “originate with the world” and have its wicked spirit, “they speak what proceeds from the world and the world listens to them.” Since we have Jehovah’s spirit, we can detect the unspiritual nature of their “inspired expressions” and therefore we reject them.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">23. Who listen to us and recognize that we are led by God’s spirit?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>But we know that “we originate with God” because “he that gains the knowledge of God listens to us.” Sheeplike ones realize that we teach the truth based on God’s Word. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:4-43:10:5" data-bid="46-1" class="b">John 10:4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="46-2" class="b"> 16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:26-43:10:27" data-bid="46-3" class="b"> 26, 27</a>.) Of course, “he that does not originate with God does not listen to us.” The false prophets, or teachers, did not listen to John or to others who ‘originated with God’ and imparted spiritually sound instruction. So “this is how we take note of the inspired expression of truth and the inspired expression of error.” We who comprise the family of Jehovah’s worshipers speak the “pure language” of Scriptural truth provided through God’s organization. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:3:9-36:3:9" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Zephaniah 3:9</a>) And from what we say, it is evident to sheeplike ones that we are led by God’s holy spirit.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="qu">24. What will John next point out?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[59]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>To this point, John has set forth some basic requirements we must meet if we are to go on living as God’s children. Next he will show why we must always display love and faith.</p>

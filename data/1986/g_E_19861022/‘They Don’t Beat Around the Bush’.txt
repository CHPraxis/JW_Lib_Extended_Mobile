‘They Don’t Beat Around the Bush’
In a letter requesting subscriptions for the Watchtower and Awake! magazines, a reader wrote:
“I wanted to tell you that I think your magazines are very interesting and also very helpful when it comes to finding out Bible principles. . . . I’m a Catholic and I don’t think I’ve ever heard or seen the Bible and its glorious message proclaimed in quite the way the Witnesses do it. Even though people are prejudiced and though the times are hard, I hope that you will be able to continue your work. I’ve been to different churches, and it feels good knowing that there’s someone out there who doesn’t beat around the bush when it comes to the Bible and its meaning. It’s a refreshing change.”
You, too, can have these two Bible-based journals delivered to your home by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.

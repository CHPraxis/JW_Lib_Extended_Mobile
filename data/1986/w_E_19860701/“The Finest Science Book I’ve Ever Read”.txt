“The Finest Science Book I’ve Ever Read”
That is the opinion of a former evolutionist regarding the fascinating book Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? He writes:
“As a former science student, I am stunned by the clarity and power of this new book. I am thrilled by the awe-inspiring descriptions of the universe, the galaxies, and all the intricate details that make life possible on planet Earth. I am amazed and delighted by the wealth of heart-stirring information on animal life and the instinctive wisdom that is all around us. And I am humbled by the descriptions of the human brain and its prodigious feats.
“Even if this book did not help a person to resolve the question of evolution versus creation, I think that it’s the finest science book I’ve ever read for building appreciation for life and the complexities of living things. It’s very sophisticated scientifically, yet on a level that anyone can appreciate.”

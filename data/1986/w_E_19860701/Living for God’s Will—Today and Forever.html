Many today find repugnant the very idea of submitting to someone <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>else’s will. Even in so-called stable societies there is a growing rebellion against authority. Riots, protests, disorder, and violence are the daily fare.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>In contrast, Jehovah’s Witnesses show that they are living for God’s will by their faithfulness, for example, in their house-to-house ministry. Yet, even within the Christian congregation, a spirit of independence has sometimes been manifested by a few. They may chafe at the discipline of the elders. A few show disrespect toward “the faithful and discreet slave” class and its Governing Body. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45-47;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:2-44:15:2" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Acts 15:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:23-44:15:23" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 23</a>) Therefore the questions arise: Why should I submit to God’s will?

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 3. What counsel did Peter give regarding our mental disposition?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Peter, who had shared many experiences with Jesus, believed that there was a very good reason to live for God’s will rather than for one’s own. He said: “Therefore since Christ suffered in the flesh, you too arm yourselves with the same mental disposition; because the person that has suffered in the flesh has desisted from sins, to the end that he may live the remainder of his time in the flesh, no more for the desires of men, but for God’s will.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:1-60:4:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Peter 4:1, 2</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Why did Jesus suffer in the flesh? Because he supported his Father’s side in the issue of universal sovereignty, or rulership. He proved God to be true and Satan a liar. And he did that by letting his earthly life be controlled by God, even though it resulted in a martyr’s death.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:14-47:5:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 5:14, 15</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Yet that death was an expression of God’s love through Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:10-62:4:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 John 4:10</a>) Why so? Because as a result of it, benefits were made available to all mankind.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Thus how appropriate even in our times is the invitation that Jehovah extended to Israel 2,700 years ago: “I, Jehovah, am your God, the One teaching you to benefit yourself, the One causing you to tread in the way in which you should walk. O if only you would actually pay attention to my commandments! Then your peace would become just like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17, 18</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:18-1:22:18" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 22:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Jehovah teaches us to benefit ourselves by our living for his will​—and those benefits are not just peace and righteousness here and now. They include the future blessings of everlasting life, even as Jesus promised: “For this is the will of my Father, that everyone that beholds the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I will resurrect him at the last day.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:40-43:6:40" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 6:40</a>.</p>

This system of things is into its 72nd year since the crucial date of 1914. Satan’s world has lasted longer than many expected. In fact, some faithful Christians who expected to see <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>Armageddon and the beginning of the new system of things in their lifetime have died. Yet their lives, dedicated to doing God’s will, have not been in vain.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>What can make it easier for us to submit to God’s will?

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Peter here uses a Greek word that is found only twice in the Greek Scriptures​—<em>enʹnoi·a. </em>Although some translators render it “mind,” it is not the usual Greek word for “mind,” which is <em>nous. </em>Therefore Peter, under inspiration, had some specific point in mind when he chose this less common noun. Greek scholar W. E. Vine says that <em>enʹnoi·a </em>“denotes purpose, intention, design.” J. H. Thayer’s <em>Greek-English Lexicon </em>defines it as “manner of thinking and feeling.”</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">11. What can we learn from Jesus’ example with regard to the way we use our lives?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Jesus’ self-sacrificing course of action clearly showed his purpose, or design. He was not leading a superficial life, just seeking pleasure and fun. He knew that he had not given up his former life in heaven in order to waste away a few years on earth in selfish pursuits. (See the contrast in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:1-1:6:2" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Genesis 6:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:6:4-1:6:4" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 4</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:6-65:1:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jude 6</a>.) Thus he stated: “I have come down from heaven to do, not my will, but the will of him that sent me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:38-43:6:38" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 6:38</a>) Jesus was single-minded in his devotion to his Father’s cause, always putting it above his own will, even down to an ignominious death.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:42-42:22:42" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 22:42</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">12, 13. (a) How did Jesus manifest his mental disposition at Jacob’s fountain? (b) What did Jesus mean when he said, “I have food to eat of which you do not know”?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Even when tired and hungry, Jesus clearly showed his mental disposition toward his Father’s will. On one occasion, while his disciples went off for food, he rested at Jacob’s fountain. Instead of taking a well-earned nap until the disciples returned, he exerted himself to do God’s will. He took an unusual step for a Jew. He entered into conversation with a Samaritan woman. He opened her eyes to an understanding of the true God. As a result, “many of the Samaritans out of that city put faith in him on account of the word of the woman.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:6-43:4:26" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 4:6-26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:39-43:4:42" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 39-42</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>When his disciples returned, they urged him to eat. How did he answer them? “I have food to eat of which you do not know.” They were baffled by his response until he added: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.” Clearly, Jesus took pleasure in submitting himself to his Father’s will. To him it was like food, and just as with eating good food, he enjoyed real satisfaction as a result. If we want to feel truly fulfilled in our lives, we can do no better than follow the example of Jesus Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:31-43:4:38" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 4:31-38</a>.</p>

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu">14. What do we need in order to have Christ’s mental disposition? Illustrate.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>How should having Christ’s mental disposition affect us? If we learn to think like Christ, then we will have an inner force that will guide us to do what Jesus would do under any circumstances. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:42-42:22:42" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Luke 22:42;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:23-49:4:24" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> Ephesians 4:23, 24</a>) This force will not result just from fear of punishment, such as discipline from the elders in the congregation, but rather from an overwhelming appreciation for Jehovah’s laws <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>and principles. We can compare the situation to the person who obeys traffic laws only when there is a policeman in view​—he subjects himself only to an exterior influence. But the person who values life, loves his neighbor, and sees the wisdom of having traffic laws will obey because he respects the law. He has a strong inner motivation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:10-19:51:10" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 51:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">15. (a) What proves that Jesus had an inner force actuating his mind?

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>Jesus had that inner ‘force actuating his mind.’ Thus he was faithful to his Father’s will, even unto death. He endured suffering without complaining or reviling his persecutors. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:24" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:21-24</a>) Sometimes we as Christians may come under similar pressures. Opposing authorities may try to stifle our preaching activity and meetings, as they did in Spain during the Franco era and in various European lands during the Nazi occupation. Many brothers and sisters were mistreated in an effort to have them betray responsible brothers in the local congregation. In spite of persecution the majority stood firm. (See <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:301978005/182:360-191"><em>1978 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses, </em>pages 171-2,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:301978005/238:366-249:46"> 182-3;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:301986012/91:817-176:306"> <em>1986 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses, </em>pages 137-59</a>.)</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>We may come under pressure in relation to Christian neutrality or the use of blood transfusions.

Or temptation may arise from a combination of fleshly desires and unwholesome companions. Perhaps at school or at our place of work, the opportunity may present itself to smoke or to take drugs without anyone else in the congregation knowing about it. Or what about the temptation to gamble in the lottery? Or to commit fornication or adultery? So often a worldly work atmosphere can be conducive to wrong thinking and wrong action​—unless we have the same resoluteness as Christ regarding the doing of God’s will. What will you do? Will you have an upright force actuating your mind so that you will follow Christ’s course of action under such circumstances?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:17-49:4:20" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:17-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:16" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 1 John 2:15, 16</a>.</p>

Because you do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery, they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of you. But these people will render an account to the one ready to judge those living and those dead.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:3-60:4:5" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Peter 4:3-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>Here Peter makes a strong point​—those who ignore God’s will must render an account. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:12-45:14:12" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Romans 14:12 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:17-58:13:17" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> Hebrews 13:17</a>.) Paul arrives at a similar conclusion in his letter to the Colossians, where he writes: “Deaden, therefore, your body members that are upon the earth as respects fornication, uncleanness, sexual appetite, hurtful desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. On account of those things the wrath of God is coming.” All those who practice such things are certainly not living for God’s will but, rather, for the satisfying of their own greedy compulsions. Yet people can break away from such moral degradation, for, as Paul states, “In those very things you, too, once walked when you used to live in them.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:7" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:19-49:4:19" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Ephesians 4:19</a>; see also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:11" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9-11</a>.</p>

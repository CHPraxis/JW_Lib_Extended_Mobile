<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">NOTE: <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the district convention and then for a 30-minute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week. Review may be divided into three 10-minute portions. Following brief introduction, chairman could review Thursday and Friday program highlights. Second brother would review Saturday program, and third brother would focus attention on Sunday highlights. Any experiences used or occasional comments from audience should be brief and to the point. A well-prepared review will help the brothers to remember key points for personal application and use in the field.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Local announcements and Announcements from <em>Our Kingdom Ministry. </em>The June 22 <em>Awake! </em>has two helpful articles on tipping. Brothers are encouraged to read these articles before going to convention cities or visiting other places.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>“<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201986202/">Be Progressive in Your Ministry</a>.” Question-and-answer discussion of article. Read paragraphs and cited scriptures as time permits. Present one or two well-prepared, pointed demonstrations showing how to offer the <em>Live Forever </em>book in local territory. Note use of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:20-45:16:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 16:20</a> as second scripture in Topic for Conversation. Adapt material to local needs.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Family Preparation for Field Service. Family-group discussion. Family head takes lead in discussion with wife and children, including one preteen child and one in late teens. Father calls attention to information on <a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989202/16:132-26:136">page 11 in <em>Reasoning</em></a> book under “FAMILY/​CHILDREN.” Suggests that these introductions will blend in very nicely with current Topic for Conversation. Wife can express agreement. Is asked how she plans to use these introductions along with topic and offer of the <em>Live Forever </em>book. She believes this presentation will be effective in local territory where there are many families with young children. She enjoys having one of the children accompany her from house to house and read one of the scriptures to be used. Father asks older son or daughter how this material could be used effectively by young person in house-to-house ministry. After greeting householder, young one may inquire whether there are children in the family and ask householder what he thinks future holds for his children or for other young ones today. Young publisher could then state that although many young people are discouraged because of what the future seems to hold for them, he is optimistic because of what his parents have helped him to learn from the Bible. This would lead into the current topic. Preteen child could then be helped with preparation of brief presentation to be used in offering the <em>Live Forever </em>book or current magazines, or shown how to offer a tract or an invitation when working with parent. Chairman should encourage parents to take time to help family members prepare for meaningful house-to-house service.</p>

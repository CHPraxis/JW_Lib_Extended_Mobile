Our March report is outstanding. We all rejoice in the new peak of 723,881 publishers. For this service year, we had our sixth peak in regular pioneers. The 62,558 auxiliary pioneers is the highest for any month of March thus far, surpassing the fine number reporting in March 1985 by 17,227. There was also a new peak in return visits. And, for the first time, we passed the half-million mark in home Bible studies, the actual number being 513,179, a new peak. What a tremendous witness to Jehovah’s praise! In thankfulness to Jehovah, our desire is to praise him more fully.​—Ps. 100:1-5.

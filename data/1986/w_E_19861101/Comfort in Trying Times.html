<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what so many of us need. A woman from Ohio explains where she found such comfort:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I just have to write to express my appreciation for the recordings of the Scriptures I am enjoying today for the first time.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I have never had anyone sit down and quietly read the Bible to me, like a loving mother. No wonder children love to be read to! How comforting, calming, and reassuring it is when we need it so much in the times we’re living in.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Please be certain of my heartfelt thanks for providing such a welcome aid.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This woman had obtained the cassette recordings of the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>which are now available in attractive brown vinyl albums. The album, complete with the entire “New Testament” (18 cassettes), is $30. Two albums of the “Old Testament” are also available, the first has Genesis through Ruth on 18 cassettes and is $30; the second album has 21 cassettes containing 1 Samuel through Psalms and costs $33.25.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Please indicate by marking the respective boxes what cassette albums you want, and remit the designated amount of money.</p>

Whom Can You Trust?
Clergyman? Scientist? Lawyer? Politician?
Dishonesty has penetrated almost every walk of life. Certainly we need a voice we can trust.
The Watchtower and Awake! are such voices. You can trust them. Why? Because these magazines are pledged to uphold the righteous standards of the Bible. They have no commercial advertisers to please. Read them regularly.
Please send a yearâ€™s subscription for The Watchtower and Awake! I enclose $8 (U.S.) for 48 issues of these magazines (four copies a month). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

Now​—Volume 1 of the “Old Testament” on 18 Cassettes in One Handy Album
The Hebrew Scriptures, from Genesis through Ruth, are now available on cassette recordings. Listen to them in your car on your way to work, while you are doing housework, or when you are sick and bedridden. The 18 cassettes, with an attractive brown vinyl album that holds them, are only $30.
Please send, postpaid, the brown vinyl album with the cassette recordings of Genesis through Ruth. I enclose $30 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

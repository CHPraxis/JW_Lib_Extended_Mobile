‘It Has Helped Me Win Respect’
That is what a man from West Africa said regarding the book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. “I often call together the whole family to have a discussion based on the book,” he writes. “Youths in the neighborhood also come to participate in the discussion. Thanks to that book, I have been able to win the respect of all the young people in the area and to help them with their problems.”
Included in this publication’s 24 chapters are: “How Do You View Discipline?” “Should You Drink Alcoholic Beverages?” “The Music and Dancing You Choose,” “Does Sexual Morality Make Sense?” and “Dating and Courtship.” You can obtain this fine aid to successful living by simply filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon along with a contribution of only $1.

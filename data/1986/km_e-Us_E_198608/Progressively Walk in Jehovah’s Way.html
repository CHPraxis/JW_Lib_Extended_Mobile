<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This theme will be emphasized in the new circuit assembly program beginning in September. Jehovah’s organization is moving forward. The preaching of the good news continues to expand. Each year, thousands of new ones have progressed and joined our ranks. But to what extent are we making progress individually? The assembly program will stimulate constructive self-examination, giving timely encouragement and admonition based on Paul’s words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:16-50:3:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Philippians 3:16</a>: “To what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Circuit assemblies play a major role in helping us to walk orderly in the truth. We need guidance that will help us act decisively in turning away from death-dealing worldly ways. We need practical, straightforward counsel that will show us how to make progress by walking in Jehovah’s ways. We also need loving encouragement that will strengthen and motivate us. The new program goes a long way in filling these needs.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As soon as the dates for your circuit assembly are announced, be sure to make definite plans to be there for all the sessions. Encourage others, especially the newly interested ones, to be there with you and benefit fully from this spiritually refreshing provision.</p>

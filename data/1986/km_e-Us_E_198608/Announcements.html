<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● Secretaries should confirm the shipping addresses on congregation literature invoices to avoid returns. This includes congregations that are using one of the Society’s literature distribution centers, as the Society may mail certain items to them. If your current shipping address is different from what appears on your literature invoices, notify the Society in writing immediately, using the S-36 form.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● During the week of September 1-6, 1986, the Society will be taking an inventory of all literature on hand in Brooklyn. Because of this inventory, no congregation literature orders will be processed for shipment or for pickup during that week.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● Each congregation will receive three Literature Inventory forms and should take an actual count of campaign literature. Please fill out the forms completely and send the original to us no later than September 6, 1986. Keep a carbon copy for your files. We are sending a third copy for use as a work sheet.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">● 1987 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses: Publishers and pioneers, please order your calendars through your congregation. Congregations should begin collecting requests for these calendars now. Then on September 1, 1986, or as soon as possible thereafter, send this order to the Society, using the regular Literature Order form (S-14). Calendars in other languages should be listed under “Other Language Publications,” showing the quantity for each language separately as well as the year 1987. The calendars will be available in Chinese, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Calendars are controlled stock items and will be charged to the literature account at $1.00 each, which is the rate for publishers, pioneers, and the public. Do not send the remittance with the order. (See the <em>Cost List, </em>pars. 22-24.) Until the calendars are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Back Ordered” on congregation invoices.</p>

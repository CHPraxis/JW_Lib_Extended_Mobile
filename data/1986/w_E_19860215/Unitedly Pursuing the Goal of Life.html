<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">JOHN 17:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 1. (a) On what occasion did Jesus first speak of “everlasting life”? (b) Who may reach this goal?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">STEALTHILY he comes, unobserved, through the shadows of the night. It is Nicodemus. He has been impressed by the signs that Jesus performed in Jerusalem at Passover time of 30 C.E. To this Pharisee, the Son of God makes his first recorded mention of “everlasting life,” adding these heartwarming words: “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:15-43:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 3:15, 16</a>) What a grand opportunity is now opening up for the world of redeemable mankind! Why, even a proud Pharisee may humble himself so as to reach the goal.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 2. (a) Under what circumstances did Jesus again speak of “everlasting life”? (b) To whom are life-giving waters made available?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span><sup>2 </sup>Shortly thereafter, Jesus is traveling from Jerusalem to Galilee. He pauses at a well in Samaria while his disciples go off to buy food. A woman comes to draw water. Jesus says to her: “Whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never get thirsty at all, but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:14-43:4:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 4:14</a>) Since the Samaritans are despised by the Jews, why does Jesus hold out such a precious hope to this woman? Further, as Jesus knows, this woman has had five husbands and is now living immorally with a man who is not her husband. Yet, as Jesus here states, life-giving waters of truth are to be made available even to despised ones of the world of mankind if only these will repent and clean up their lives.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5-7</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>“Everlasting life”! Jesus further develops this theme when his disciples return and urge him to eat. He tells them: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.” What is that work? Jesus says: “Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting. Already the reaper is receiving wages and gathering fruit for everlasting life.” Such a harvest was in prospect, even among the lowly Samaritans, and it became a joyful reality, as the record shows. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:34-43:4:36" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 4:34-36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:1-44:8:1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Acts 8:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:14-44:8:17" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 14-17</a>) Harvesting for everlasting life continues to this day, but now the field is the world.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>A year passes. Now it is Passover time of 31 C.E. As is his custom, Jesus is present in Jerusalem for the feast. But the Jews go to persecuting him because he performs loving acts of healing on the Sabbath. How does Jesus answer them? He says: “My Father has kept working until now, and I keep working.” So they seek to kill him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:17-43:5:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 5:17, 18</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 5, 6. (a) What precious union does Jesus now describe? (b) In what respect does Jesus have “life in himself”?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Jesus goes on, however, to describe a most precious union​—the unity, or oneness, that exists between him and the Father. He tells those Jews: “For the Father has affection for the Son and shows him all the things he himself does, and he will show him works greater than these, in order that you may marvel.” He indicates that the Father has committed to him extraordinary power, saying: “He that hears my word and believes him that sent me has everlasting life, and he does not come into judgment but has passed over from death to life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:20-43:5:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 5:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:24-43:5:24" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 24</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Yes, even those “dead” in God’s sight because of their inherited sinfulness may “hear the voice of the Son of God” and come to life. But how? Jesus explains: “For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted also to the Son to have life in himself.” Those words, “life in himself,” may also be rendered, “in himself the gift of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:25-43:5:26" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 5:25, 26</a>, <em>Ref. Bi., </em>footnote) So Jesus is able to give humans a fine standing before God. Furthermore, he is able to resurrect and impart life to those asleep in death.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:25-43:11:25" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 11:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:18-66:1:18" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Revelation 1:18</a>.</p>

And this is to be life in perfection, according to the will of our perfect Creator and the arrangement that he makes through his Son. It will be free of the drudgery that so often marks the struggle for survival in the present system of things. In the coming system of things, sorrow, sickness, lawlessness, corruption, even death, will be no more!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:3-33:4:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Micah 4:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:26-46:15:26" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 15:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Who are to share in the realization of these promises, and where?

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>According to his good pleasure, God has purposed “an administration . . . to gather all things together again in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:8-49:1:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:8-10</a>) This is God’s household arrangement that begins with the gathering of Christ’s 144,000 joint heirs. These are “bought from among mankind as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb [Jesus Christ].” They have part in “the first [the heavenly] resurrection” so that they may serve with Christ as kings and priests for a thousand years. Next, God’s administration proceeds to gather “the things on the earth,” starting with an innumerable “great crowd . . . out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues.” These servants of God will come out of “the great tribulation” with the prospect of gaining everlasting life in “a new earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Revelation 14:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:4-66:14:4" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:4-66:20:4" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 20:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="17-4" class="b"> 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:4-66:7:4" data-bid="17-5" class="b"> 7:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:17" data-bid="17-6" class="b"> 9-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:1" data-bid="17-7" class="b"> 21:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="17-8" class="b"> 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>The spirit-anointed sons of God, who are “the things in the heavens,” enjoy a very intimate relationship with Jesus and with the Father.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:11-49:1:11" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ephesians 1:11</a>) Jesus encouraged them to remain in union with him, just as branches remain attached to a vine, in order to bear much fruit.

It is similar to what John goes on to say: “Whoever does observe his word, truthfully in this person the love of God has been made perfect. By this we have the knowledge that we are in union with him.” First the “little flock” and then the “other sheep” come under obligation to walk just as Jesus walked.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:1-62:2:6" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 John 2:1-6</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>So today, both groups, the heavenly and the earthly, are ‘in union with the Father and with the Son’​—at full accord with them in accomplishing God’s work. Jesus prayed, “That they may all be [at unity], just as you, Father, are in union with me and I am in union with you, that <em>they also may be in union with us.”</em> This oneness is not limited in meaning to joint heirship, for obviously Jesus’ disciples do not become part of any ‘body of Jehovah’ or ‘joint heirs with Jehovah.’ They are “in union” in that they show oneness in cooperation, being of one heart and mind with both Jehovah and Christ, as they witness to the world of mankind.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:20-43:17:21" data-bid="23-1" class="b">John 17:20, 21</a>.</p>

Hence, they can be spirit begotten with the prospect of becoming joint heirs with Christ Jesus. They acknowledge their adoption as sons, saying: “The spirit itself [God’s begetting active force] bears witness with our spirit [dominant mental inclination] that we are God’s children.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:24" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Romans 3:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:1-45:5:1" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 5:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:15-45:8:18" data-bid="24-3" class="b"> 8:15-18</a>.</p>

After passing the loaf to his disciples, he next offered the wine in the same way, saying: “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf.” Later, he went on to amplify the reason for taking them into the new covenant, saying: “You are the ones that have stuck with me in my trials; and I make a covenant with you, just as my Father has made a covenant with me, for a kingdom, that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:20" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Luke 22:19, 20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:28-42:22:30" data-bid="33-2" class="b"> 28-30</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>The prophet Jeremiah had foretold the new covenant, stating that through it Jehovah would be forgiving the error and sin of his people so that they might “know Jehovah” in a most intimate relationship.

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>Who, then, may properly partake of the Memorial emblems of the bread and the wine? It is only the group that God takes into the new covenant made over Jesus’ sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:50:5-19:50:5" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Psalm 50:5</a>) The purpose of this covenant is to justify Jesus’ 144,000 joint heirs to human life first, so that they may sacrifice this life-right and be taken into the heavenly Kingdom.

<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">21. (a) How are the “other sheep” benefited as observers at the Memorial? (b) On what does the Memorial celebration focus, and what question arises?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Those of the “other sheep” class are not in the new covenant and so do not partake. However, all of them are richly benefited by attending the Memorial celebration as respectful observers. Their appreciation of spiritual matters is sharpened in line with the words of Jesus’ prayer to his Father: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="39-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) Remember, the Memorial celebration focuses attention on Jesus’ flesh and blood. The sacrificed flesh and blood of Christ are vitally important to all who are pursuing the goal of everlasting life. How is this true with regard to the “other sheep,” who have not been taken into the new covenant and so do not partake of the Memorial emblems? Let us consider this in the following article.</p>

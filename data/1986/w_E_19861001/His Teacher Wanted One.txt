His Teacher Wanted One
That is what a youth reported when he took the publication Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? to school. He explains:
“I went to school with my new book. I told my teacher that I wanted to share the book with the class. So he looked through it and liked it so much that he stopped the class from the work they were doing and shared it with them. The next day he asked me if he could have one. And that afternoon, after school, I placed it with him. He really likes it.”

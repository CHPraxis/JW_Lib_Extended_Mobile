<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong><em>DON’T try to taper off: </em></strong>It prolongs the agony of withdrawal.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong><em>DON’T waste your money on expensive antismoking remedies: </em></strong>“Without exception, the aids currently on the market offer little in the way of real help to the smoker,” reports <em>New Scientist. </em>And <em>World Health </em>says: “The major element in success . . . will always be the smoker’s willpower. The rest is just trimming.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong><em>DO accept your responsibility, but accept help too: </em></strong>Supportive friends who themselves have quit smoking are priceless. Pray. A sincere desire to please God and do his will works wonders.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:4-50:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Philippians 2:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 4:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:13-50:4:13" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong><em>DO recognize the benefits of not smoking: </em></strong>Reducing your risk of death (from heart disease, stroke, bronchitis, emphysema, or cancer); setting a good example; saving money; getting free from the mess, smell, inconvenience, and slavery of the habit.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong><em>DO understand your withdrawal pangs: </em></strong>Within 12 hours of your last cigarette, your heart and lungs begin to repair themselves. Your carbon monoxide and nicotine levels drop fast. But as your body heals, it hurts. You may feel irritable or short-tempered, but you do <em>not </em>need a cigarette to steady your nerves. This temporary discomfort is the start of a healthier life.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong><em>DO understand the challenge: </em></strong>Anticipate problems. Avoid self-pity and compromise. But have no doubt, you <em>can </em>kick the habit.</p>

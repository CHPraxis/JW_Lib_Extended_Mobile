<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is how readers of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>consider these magazines.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Writing in behalf of himself and his family, a man from the Philippines thanked the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society for supplying back issues, saying:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“As in every edition of your magazines, they contain a wealth of information. Not only do they shed light on matters of religion but they afford wide coverage of fields such as science, medicine, history, government, and language. It seems that every issue carries with it articles of special interest to us.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I might also mention that we had our past issues of The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>bookbound. There are now four such volumes stacked on the shelves of our private library. They make excellent reference material, and we keep coming back to them for helpful advice and inspiration.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">You can have <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>delivered to your home. Send only $8 and you will receive both of these magazines (four copies a month) for one year.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Please send a year’s subscription for the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. I enclose $8 (U.S.) for 48 issues. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)</p>

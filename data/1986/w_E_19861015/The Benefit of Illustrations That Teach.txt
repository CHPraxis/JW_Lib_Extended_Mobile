The Benefit of Illustrations That Teach
Visual illustrations often are more effective than the written word in teaching important ideas. A mother explains how she was comforted by such an illustration:
“The practical illustrations in the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth have been particular favorites of mine because of their aptness in focusing clearly on the point of discussion.
“However, my appreciation of their versatility was deepened last Sunday when a member of our family experienced an accident. Our younger son, Aaron, broke his arm, and the doctor explained that general anesthesia had to be administered to set it. As our son was being wheeled away, I felt my heart sinking fast. As time dragged on, my anxiety increased.
“Then the illustration in chapter 11, on page 100, came to mind. The gist of the caption is, ‘Just as a parent will allow a child to undergo a painful operation, God also has good reasons temporarily to permit humans to suffer.’ As I repeated the thought over and over, the peace of God settled down on me, and I was able to maintain my composure and self-control.”

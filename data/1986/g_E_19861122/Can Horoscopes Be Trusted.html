<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AMONG the horrible crimes of World War II were those committed by Dr. Marcel Petiot. He made a living by offering people a safe passage from Nazi-occupied France. However, he murdered his clients, stole their possessions, and dissolved their bodies in a bath of quicklime. Eventually Petiot was caught and in his death cell admitted to the murder of 63 people. What, though, does this have to do with horoscopes?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Dr. Michel Gauquelin, who has investigated claims of astrologers for some 30 years, decided to use Petiot as a test case. He sent the doctor’s birth date to a professional astrologer, who worked out Petiot’s horoscope by computer. Gauquelin then placed in a French newspaper an advertisement offering a free, personalized horoscope to any inquirer. What he actually sent, however, was the horoscope of murderous Dr. Petiot!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Did anyone realize he had received the “wrong” horoscope? On the contrary! Writes Gauquelin: “I received a dozen enthusiastic letters of acknowledgement. Ninety per cent thought that the portrait was very true and expressed their personal difficulties well.” Continues Gauquelin: “Psychologists have taught that we all tend to see a mirror of ourselves in the horoscope; but it is still disquieting that these people should find a resemblance in a profile drawn to fit only one individual​—a murderer.”</p>

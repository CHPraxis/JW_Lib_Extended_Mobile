Love for the Worldwide Brotherhood
1 “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another.” (John 13:34) Love for one another proved to be absolutely necessary for those disciples of Christ Jesus in the first century. In this 20th century it is just as necessary that such love be shown. How appropriate, then, that the theme chosen for the circuit assemblies to begin in February 1986 should be “Love for the Worldwide Brotherhood.”
2 The program is designed to consider many aspects of this love that is so necessary as a bonding agent, holding God’s people together in unity and integrity. While Satan’s world continues to manifest hatred among nations, peoples, languages, and cultures, Jehovah’s people manifest love for the worldwide household of faith. The circuit assembly program has been designed to encourage the showing of love not only to those related to us in the faith but also to those we can help to learn the truth and come into association with us.
3 Our aim is that Jehovah should find us in an approved condition as a united brotherhood worldwide. (2 Pet. 3:13, 14) Let us all make plans now to be present both days.

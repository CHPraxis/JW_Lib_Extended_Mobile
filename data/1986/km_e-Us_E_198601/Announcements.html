<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● Subscriptions and distributors’ orders for the large-print edition of <em>The Watchtower </em>in Japanese and Portuguese are now being accepted. The printing will not be handled in the United States but by other branches. Due to the distance and mail service, the magazines may not arrive in time for use at the <em>Watchtower </em>Study. However, these large-print editions are being made available so that the visually impaired are able to receive spiritual food in a form easy to read. The regular <em>Watchtower </em>subscription slip (M-1) and Distributors’ Order form (M-202) should be used. Please mark clearly in the upper right-hand corner, “LARGE PRINT.” Some may be interested in receiving airmail subscriptions for these large-print foreign-language magazines in order to receive them in time for the <em>Watchtower </em>Study. This would involve extra cost to the subscriber for the airmail postage. Any who might be interested in this special service may inquire of the Society.</p>

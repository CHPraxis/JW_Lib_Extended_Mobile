Introducing the Good News
1 Do you find that your opening words at the door are often the most difficult part of presenting the good news? Yet how eager we are to have people listen to the Bible’s lifesaving message! (John 17:3; 1 Tim. 4:16) To accomplish this, we need to develop introductions that will arouse interest in our new Topic for Conversation.
2 As announced in the October issue of Our Kingdom Ministry, circuit overseers have been reviewing points from the new book Reasoning From the Scriptures at meetings for field service during their visits with the congregations. On Wednesday and Thursday mornings they have been considering introductions that would be appropriate in the local territory. Pages 9-15 of the Reasoning book set out about 40 different introductions that could relate to various topics for discussion. Are you using this valuable information?
3 You may find it easy to use the third introduction on page 10 under “BIBLE/​GOD.” You might simply say: “I’m glad to find you at home. I’m sharing with my neighbors an encouraging thought from the Bible. Have you ever wondered what the future holds for you?” After listening to the householder’s response, it is quite natural to proceed to discuss Revelation 1:1 and Revelation 21:3, 4. If you find it best not to mention the Bible so early in your presentation, you may wish to try using the first suggestion under “FUTURE/​SECURITY” on page 11, tailoring it to lead into the two scriptures from Revelation. A review of the other suggested introductions may give you additional ideas that will work well in your territory.
4 By making good use of this feature in our Reasoning book, those important introductory words will not be so difficult to find. This should lead to more conversations in which we can highlight the Kingdom theme of our ministry. May we all show genuine concern for the future of others by using appealing introductions.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is how a 15-year-old high school student from Ohio, U.S.A., feels about the publication <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>She writes:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“If good things take time, it must have taken <em>forever </em>to compile this beautifully illustrated, easy-to-understand book. It’s absolutely captivating! I study a chapter a day and find myself wishing I had more time to devote to my personal study of this wonderful aid.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I have already made a list of friends and teachers who would enjoy this publication. When school starts next month, I will have the privilege of sharing my treasure with these ones.”</p>

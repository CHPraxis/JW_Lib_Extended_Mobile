‘A Treasure to Share’
That is how a 15-year-old high school student from Ohio, U.S.A., feels about the publication Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? She writes:
“If good things take time, it must have taken forever to compile this beautifully illustrated, easy-to-understand book. It’s absolutely captivating! I study a chapter a day and find myself wishing I had more time to devote to my personal study of this wonderful aid.
“I have already made a list of friends and teachers who would enjoy this publication. When school starts next month, I will have the privilege of sharing my treasure with these ones.”

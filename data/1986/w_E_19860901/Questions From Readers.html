<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>▪ Is there a distinction between “creation” and “creationism”?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Yes, there is. The word “creation,” appearing some 18 times in the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, </em>properly refers to Jehovah’s creative activity. (See, for example, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 1:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:21-45:8:21" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 8:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:17-47:5:17" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 5:17</a>) The term “creationism” is not found in the Bible.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>Webster’s Third New International Dictionary </em>(1971) defines “creation” as “the act of creating,” and “creationism” as “a doctrine or theory of creation.” The same dictionary defines “ism” as “a distinctive doctrine, cause, system, or theory​—often used disparagingly.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In these 1980’s, “creationism” has become a true “ism” because of its adoption by political pressure groups, such as the Moral Majority. It is no longer a neutral term, but embodies extreme fundamentalist views of the Bible, such as the view that God created the earth and everything upon it in six days of 24 hours each. There are now more than 350 books in circulation setting out such “creationism” dogma. Jehovah’s Witnesses reject the unreasonable theories of “creationism” in favor of what the Bible really teaches about “creation.”</p>

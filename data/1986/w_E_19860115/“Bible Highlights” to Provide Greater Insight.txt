“Bible Highlights” to Provide Greater Insight
WHEN the Jews returned from exile in Babylon during the sixth century B.C.E., responsible men among them “gathered themselves together to Ezra the copyist, even to gain insight into the words of the law.” What resulted from their increased understanding? Why, the people held an extraordinary Festival of Booths with “very great rejoicing”!​—Nehemiah 8:13-18.
As that example so well illustrates, the gaining of insight into the Scriptures can have a very good effect upon God’s people. Accordingly, in the issues of January 15, February 15, and March 15, 1986, The Watchtower will contain a feature entitled “Bible Highlights.” These articles will enable our readers to gain deeper insight into the Bible books of Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther.
These studies will help us to relive the thrilling events associated with the restoration of true worship in Jerusalem, the construction of Jehovah’s temple there, and the preservation of God’s people in the face of enemy assault. Indeed, by reading these books as suggested in “Bible Highlights,” Jehovah’s Witnesses and their associates will be able to derive greater benefit from coverage of the same Scriptural material in the weekly Theocratic Ministry School. Additionally, brothers assigned to present “Highlights From Bible Reading” on the school program can use the feature “Bible Highlights” to very good advantage in answering Scriptural questions and pointing out lessons for us.​—Romans 15:4.

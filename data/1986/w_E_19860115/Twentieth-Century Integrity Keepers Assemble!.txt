Twentieth-Century Integrity Keepers Assemble!
THE battle lines were drawn very early in human history. Rebellion broke out in the spirit realm as well as in the human realm, and the rightness of the Creator’s sovereignty was challenged! This produced a moral issue that involved the question, Will those yet loyal to Jehovah God uphold his rulership by keeping their integrity to him?​—Genesis 3:1-24; Exodus 9:16; Luke 22:31.
Satan the Devil has falsely claimed that Jehovah’s worshipers serve Him only for selfish advantage and not out of love. (Job 1:1–2:10) Yet, they have remained loyal to God despite the efforts of Satan and his opposing world to break their integrity. (Hebrews 11:4-38; Revelation 12:10-17) To spur 20th-century servants of Jehovah on to continued faithfulness, the Watch Tower Society arranged for a series of “Integrity Keepers” conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses to be held in many countries, beginning in the summer of 1985. Each day highlighted a fitting Bible theme.
“Walking in Integrity”
This theme of the convention’s opening day whetted spiritual appetites. The talk “‘Hear, O My People,’ the Word of Jehovah” set the stage by reminding all to pay close attention. Proving the wisdom of that recommendation was the chairman’s address, “Let Integrity Safeguard Us.” How does integrity do that? Integrity requires that we be complete in our devotion to God, keeping our hearts, motives, and affections pure. “If this is our determination,” the chairman declared, “then our integrity will safeguard us.”​—Psalm 25:5; 31:23.
We were next “Encouraged by the Example of Tested Integrity Keepers.” After referring to encouraging examples from the past, the speaker interviewed exemplary integrity keepers of our time. Those who maintain integrity are “Not Ashamed of the Good News.” This talk, based on Mark 8:38, made it clear that unashamedly identifying ourselves in our ministry, at our secular work, and elsewhere is a protection. ‘And what a wonderful thing it will be when Jesus speaks up before heavenly angels and his Father, declaring that we are his disciples who have walked in integrity!’
“The Things Revealed Belong to Us and to Our Sons” was a program feature showing that, as a loving Father, Jehovah is happy to reveal to his people “things concealed.” (Deuteronomy 29:29; Amos 3:7) Diligent study of these revealed things will fortify us so that we can hold fast our integrity. The next topic, “Finding Delight in Jehovah’s Word,” stressed the point that Jehovah’s Witnesses must be students of the Bible. (Psalm 1:1, 2) Indeed, “study is a part of the life of every Christian who walks in integrity.”
“Reasoning From the Scriptures” is the method used by integrity keepers in dealing with the various types of people to whom they preach. For example, in a synagogue at Thessalonica, the apostle Paul ‘reasoned from the Scriptures, explaining and proving by references that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer.’ Was Paul successful? Yes, for some of his listeners became believers. (Acts 17:1-4) Would the conventioners appreciate help in answering questions encountered in their ministry? What a delight to receive it when the speaker released the new field ministry handbook, Reasoning From the Scriptures!
“Handling the Word of Truth Aright”
On the second day, it was a thrill to see so many pioneers​—thousands at some conventions—​stand up at the speaker’s invitation, giving evidence that throngs are sharing in the full-time ministry. In this portion, “Exert Yourselves Vigorously in Full-Time Service,” it was stressed that pioneering is worth the effort, even though a struggle is required to share in this activity.​—Luke 13:24.
The keynote address, “Gladden Jehovah’s Heart by Keeping Integrity,” was based on Proverbs 27:11. This talk dipped into the treasure store of God’s Word and came up with these gems: “Genuine integrity means unbreakable devotion to a person​—to Jehovah God.” “Satan is the ringleader in integrity breaking,” and his rebellion raised “the issue of the rightness of God’s sovereignty.” “Although Jehovah’s sovereignty is not dependent on the integrity keeping of his creatures, the Devil’s rebellious action made the question of man’s integrity a vital part of the issue of universal sovereignty.” The speaker asked: “How is it possible for us to triumph as integrity keepers?” “We can do so because we obey God’s Word,” he replied.​—Romans 14:8.
Putting spiritual interests first in life was the thrust of the next talk, “The Blessing of Jehovah​—That Is What Makes Rich.” We were helped to realize more fully that while money is useful, love of money can be a grave peril. (Ecclesiastes 7:12; 1 Timothy 6:10) It is faithfulness that brings Jehovah’s blessing, the true riches.​—Proverbs 10:22.
The drama “Your Future​—A Challenge” compared the integrity-keeping course of the Nazirites with the challenge Witness youths face in their desire to become pioneers and remain in full-time service instead of pursuing materialistic goals. It urged young ones to accept the challenge and serve God fully. The drama also illustrated how parents and others can be helpful.
“Sow Bountifully, Reap Bountifully” explained that the principle ‘we reap what we sow’ is wise, just, and loving. Imitating God, Christ, and the ‘faithful slave,’ we will sow bountifully in meeting attendance, prayer, witnessing, and all our family relationships. (Matthew 24:45-47) Such sowing assures us of reaping Jehovah’s blessing.​—Hebrews 6:10.
During the talk “How You Ought to Be Giving an Answer to Each One,” the audience gave rapt attention to the suggestions and demonstrations on how to use the new book Reasoning From the Scriptures. Emphasized was the need to overcome apathy by using appropriate introductions, to make a tasteful response when there is a sincere though negative reaction, and to show the Bible to be the source of our answers.​—Colossians 4:6.
After the final talk of the second day, “Declaring Jehovah’s Wonderful Works,” we got busy doing just that by sharing in the field ministry. That very afternoon a Witness going from house to house in Vancouver, Canada, met the objection: “If God is a God of love, why does he allow wickedness?” The answer provided in the new Reasoning book satisfied the inquirer, and a Bible study was started on the spot.
“Blameless Amid a Twisted Generation”
This was the thought-provoking theme of the third day. That morning, the talk “Honoring Jehovah With Our Valuable Things” emphasized that our dedicated life, our close relationship with Jehovah, and our physical, mental, spiritual, and material assets are all valuable things with which we ought to honor our heavenly Father.​—Proverbs 3:9, 10.
The talk “Regaining Power, Not Tiring Out” provided timely instruction to help us resist Satan’s attempts to break our integrity through doubts, loss of faith, materialism, temptations, and various forms of discouragement. Study, meditation, prayer, meeting attendance, and regular participation in Kingdom preaching are sure ways to tap the untiring Source of energy, Jehovah.​—Isaiah 40:28-31.
A key point in the discourse “Living for God’s Will Today and Forever” was that if we have Christ’s mental disposition, we will live “no more for the desires of men, but for God’s will.” (1 Peter 4:1, 2) Jesus never allowed any human desire to sidetrack him from that course. Baptismal candidates in particular listened attentively to the next talk, “Lining Up With Jehovah’s Integrity Keepers.” They were told that the step of baptism is only the beginning of their race to keep integrity. To run well, they need to take advantage of such provisions as prayer, God’s Word, Christian publications, and active association with the congregation. The candidates stood to answer two questions indicating whether they understood the important step they were taking. Their water baptism followed, sometimes in full view of other convention delegates.
That afternoon, the talk “Is the Dread of Jehovah Upon Us?” emphasized respect for the Universal Sovereign. (Proverbs 8:13) Between God-fearing King Jehoshaphat of Judah and the now-enthroned Greater Jehoshaphat, Jesus Christ, there are such parallels as these: keeping worship clean (1 Kings 22:16; Malachi 3:1-18); defending freedom of worship (2 Chronicles 17:1, 2, 12-19; Philippians 1:6, 7); organizing to educate true worshipers (2 Chronicles 17:7-9; Matthew 28:19, 20); and setting up theocratic law courts for administering justice.​—2 Chronicles 19:6, 7; 1 Corinthians 6:5, 6.
The portion “Scriptures Beneficial to Set Things Straight” pointed out how the Bible helps us to lead an orderly life and show respect for the organization, appointed overseers, and older ones. In the following part, “Determined to Serve Jehovah With a Complete Heart,” we were impressed with the need to have a healthy figurative heart, one that is kept unified​—complete—​for Jehovah’s service.​—1 Chronicles 28:9.
But what about the eye? The next speaker answered the question, “As a Family Member, Is Your Eye ‘Simple’?” Since Satan uses many things to distract our spiritual eye, it is essential that Christian fathers, mothers, and children maintain a balanced view and keep Kingdom interests first. (Matthew 6:33) The need to recognize the Great Organizer by showing respect for the appointed elders and the congregation was stressed in the following talk, “Carefully Following the Orders of the King.”​—Proverbs 8:32-36.
The day’s climax was the discourse “Integrity to Truth in a Godless World.” Among other things, Christians must maintain integrity to truth by defending the Bible teaching of creation and by refuting godless theories. The audience was thrilled by the release of a 256-page book that thoroughly answers the question raised by its title, Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? How effective is this publication? A former evolutionist, now a Witness in Sweden, read the entire book that night and remarked: “If I had been an evolutionist yesterday, I would certainly have changed my mind overnight.”
“Maintain Fine Conduct Among the Nations”
This was the theme of the convention’s final day. One of the talks given that morning answered the question “Can Anything Separate You From God’s Love?” We alone can separate ourselves from the love of God and Christ. But as long as we maintain our faith, no pressure, no circumstance, no opposer can make God lose his love for us.​—Romans 8:35-39.
The discourse “Do Not Be Quickly Shaken From Your Reason” stressed the need to safeguard our place in the spiritual paradise. How? In part, by avoiding the spirit of complaint and by resisting apostasy, thus adhering to Paul’s counsel ‘not to be quickly shaken from our reason’ by any verbal or written message intended to create doubts and ruin our faith.​—2 Thessalonians 2:1, 2.
“Fear God, Turn Away From Bad” was the second absorbing drama. It dealt with the integrity keeper Job and showed that persecution and suffering for serving God are not new. Despite efforts made to sidetrack us, like Job we should be determined to hold fast our integrity, fearing Jehovah and turning away from bad.
The public discourse, “God’s Times and Seasons​—To What Do They Point?” reminded us that Jehovah has been “removing kings and setting up kings” in harmony with his unalterable purpose. When his time arrives, therefore, he will without fail end wickedness and restore righteousness.​—Daniel 2:21, 44.
The two closing talks were appropriate indeed. “Comfort for Men of Integrity” heartened us with the assurance that by his Word, by his spirit, and in answer to our prayers, Jehovah will unfailingly sustain us through trial. And as the final discourse showed, Jehovah’s Witnesses are not in retreat because they live in this opposing world. Rather, they are “An Integrity-Keeping Organization on the Move”! This organization is unique in its support of Jehovah’s sovereignty and in its certainty of triumph and survival.
Onward as Integrity Keepers!
In addition to their thrill in receiving other rich spiritual food, including two fine new books, conventioners were thrilled at the release of the colorfully illustrated 32-page brochure The Government That Will Bring Paradise. And what a pleasure it was to receive Kingdom Melodies No. 6, a cassette tape of beautiful music for our enjoyment!
Greatly refreshed and blessed, departing delegates have been thankful, indeed, for this most rewarding spiritual feast. Renewed is our confidence that the One who has for 6,000 years supported upholders of his sovereignty will triumphantly see his witnesses through these climactic “last days” and safely into the New Order, all to his eternal vindication.​—2 Timothy 3:1; Revelation 7:9-12; 21:1-5.
With this confidence and faith in our God, Jehovah, what is our intention? Why, we are determined to keep moving ahead courageously as the organization of Jehovah’s 20th-century integrity keepers!

What Others Have Said
  A superintendent of police, Leeds, England: “I would like to pay tribute to you, your staff, and all your people who attended . . . for the highly efficient way in which it was planned and conducted. It was a credit to you all. I visited the Stadium on Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning and found the atmosphere and proceedings a most refreshing experience. Several of my colleagues have commented likewise.”
  A chief editorial writer for a Montreal, Canada, newspaper, under the heading “Let’s smile back at the people of Jehovah”: “The day before yesterday, in less than two hours, they knocked on 800,000 doors in the area. A form of mass spiritual proselytizing, which may be a bit annoying but not really a nuisance. . . . When you receive visitors in your home, you don’t mind a little inconvenience to make room for them. . . . So, what if we don’t share the faith of Jehovah’s Witnesses; we would share, for a few days, just a little of their serenity, and we would feel better for it. These peaceful people have chosen to meet in Montreal; let more of them come, tens of thousands of them.”
  A police official in Dortmund, Federal Republic of Germany: ‘At sports events here we have at least 200 policemen on duty; at your meetings we need only two, plus two others to direct traffic.’
  A football stadium manager in Norwich, England: “The peaceful atmosphere over the four days . . . is catching. You experience a personal calmness that is in complete contrast to that of any other four days in the tense business world and daily life around us. The Witnesses really have something that is different about them and hard to explain.”

Montreal Convention​—Something Special!
  In program content, the “Integrity Keepers” District Convention held at the famous Olympic Stadium complex in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, was like all others in this series. But in some ways it was special. Among other things, it was the first of a group of these conventions that would be special in size or in other ways.
  Size: A total of 78,804 assembled from eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. It was faith strengthening to be part of such vast throngs of integrity keepers listening, singing, and praying together. That was special!
  Baptism: It was a special joy to see 1,004 newly dedicated ones stand up for baptism. Here was visible evidence of the growth now taking place among us.
  Languages: There were programs in 11 languages​—Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Ukrainian. In the bowl of the stadium, the special sound system was so arranged that those in the French sections listened in their language while the English-speaking delegates heard in theirs.
  Trailer City: This was another special feature. To accommodate delegates who needed space for trailers, recreational vehicles, and tents, efforts began in December 1984 to obtain use of nearby Maisonneuve Park, just across the street from the stadium. When officials were first approached about renting the park, they understandably laughed. After all, renting an entire city park had never been done there before. Eventually, however, permission was granted. The good reputation of Jehovah’s Witnesses had helped.
  Ultimately, 4,300 units were set up, and almost 20,000 conventioners were accommodated on lush grass amid abundant shade trees. And what was the park’s condition after so many people had used it for about a week? Amazed officials found no serious damage anywhere. For that reason, the entire amount of the five-figure damage deposit was returned!
  Governing Body Members Present: This feature also made the Montreal convention special. While Jehovah’s people avoid all creature worship, doubtless many shared the sentiments of one brother who appreciatively said: “The presence of seven members of the beloved Governing Body, some of whom I had never seen or heard give a talk before, was most encouraging.” Such association does result in a spiritual “interchange of encouragement.”​—Romans 1:11, 12.
  A Fine Reception: Officials and the general public dealt with Jehovah’s Witnesses in a commendable and fair-minded way. This was special when it is remembered that not many years ago former Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis openly declared a “war without mercy on the witnesses of Jehovah” until they would be no more. With good reason, then, one newspaper reporter observed: “Just imagine, yesterday [Friday] there were exactly 74,846 Witnesses within the confines of the stadium! Maurice Duplessis, who had banned the movement, must have been turning over in his grave.”
  This was not the first time that Jehovah had blessed integrity keepers so abundantly. In many ways, however, the Montreal convention was something special.

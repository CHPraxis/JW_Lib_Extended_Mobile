‘Man Does Not Live on Bread Alone’
Jesus Christ stated that basic truth. We also need spiritual nourishment. One way to receive this is by listening to the new cassette recordings of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. When sending their order, a couple from Georgia wrote:
“We cannot tell you how much it means to us to listen to these readings out loud of the Bible. While we endeavor to read the Bible itself every day, it is wonderful to keep up to date with our Bible reading each week for the Theocratic Ministry School by listening to these tapes at home, or while we travel to and from work.”
You can now receive cassette recordings of the Bible books listed below. Please check the ones you want.

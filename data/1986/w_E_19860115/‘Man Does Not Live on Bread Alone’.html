<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jesus Christ stated that basic truth. We also need spiritual nourishment.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“We cannot tell you how much it means to us to listen to these readings out loud of the Bible. While we endeavor to read the Bible itself every day, it is wonderful to keep up to date with our Bible reading each week for the Theocratic Ministry School by listening to these tapes at home, or while we travel to and from work.”</p>

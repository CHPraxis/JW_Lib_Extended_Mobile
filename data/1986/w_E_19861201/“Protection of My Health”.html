<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a subscriber from Senegal, West Africa, said of the <em>Awake! </em>magazine. He wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“It is with great pleasure that I regularly read <em>Awake! </em>because of the excellent subjects it covers, perfectly suited to and so necessary for our modern world. I am a subscriber for two and a half years. By means of this letter I wish to thank the editors and publishers for their contribution to the protection of my health, and not only mine but also that of the many others who have been able to break the tobacco habit and safeguard their own health by getting the strength necessary from reading the articles in <em>Awake! </em>Please continue to prepare information on the dangers of tobacco, as I find that three-quarters of the youth around me smoke, which not only endangers their health and that of others but also wastes their money. Thank you for everything I discover in reading your magazine.”</p>

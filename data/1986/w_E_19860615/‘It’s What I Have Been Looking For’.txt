‘It’s What I Have Been Looking For’
The lives of people can be changed by a small thing. This is illustrated by a young Argentine girl who wrote the following to the Watch Tower Society’s world headquarters in Brooklyn, New York:
“Dear Editor:
Please tell me soon how I can receive the magazine The Watchtower that you publish. My neighbor lent me a copy of the magazine and what I read in it is what I have been looking for for a long time. How much good it did me! It gave me great comfort. You see, I am 15 years old and am all alone in the world. I do not have anyone to worry about me, and your magazine filled me with a hope. The neighbor asked me to return the magazine since it was one of the things that her mother, who died recently, left her.”
The young girl concluded her letter explaining that she is very poor but would do everything possible to pay for the magazine. Her letter was forwarded to Argentina, and a representative of the Watch Tower Society soon afterward called on the girl. She subscribed for both The Watchtower and Awake! She progressed rapidly in Bible knowledge and was baptized. Now she shares with the thousands of her Argentine brothers and sisters in the Christian ministry.
You, too, can have The Watchtower and its companion the Awake! magazine delivered to your home by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.
Please send a year’s subscription for The Watchtower and Awake! I enclose $8 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

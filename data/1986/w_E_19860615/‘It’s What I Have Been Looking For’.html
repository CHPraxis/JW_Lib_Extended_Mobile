<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The lives of people can be changed by a small thing. This is illustrated by a young Argentine girl who wrote the following to the Watch Tower Society’s world headquarters in Brooklyn, New York:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sg">“Dear Editor:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please tell me soon how I can receive the magazine <em>The Watchtower </em>that you publish. My neighbor lent me a copy of the magazine and what I read in it is what I have been looking for for a long time. How much good it did me! It gave me great comfort. You see, I am 15 years old and am all alone in the world. I do not have anyone to worry about me, and your magazine filled me with a hope. The neighbor asked me to return the magazine since it was one of the things that her mother, who died recently, left her.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The young girl concluded her letter explaining that she is very poor but would do everything possible to pay for the magazine. Her letter was forwarded to Argentina, and a representative of the Watch Tower Society soon afterward called on the girl. She subscribed for both <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>She progressed rapidly in Bible knowledge and was baptized. Now she shares with the thousands of her Argentine brothers and sisters in the Christian ministry.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">You, too, can have <em>The Watchtower </em>and its companion the <em>Awake! </em>magazine delivered to your home by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Please send a year’s subscription for <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>I enclose $8 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)</p>

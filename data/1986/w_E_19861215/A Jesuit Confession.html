<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MANY today still believe that December 25 is a holy day, the birthday of Jesus. However, the fact that the true religious significance of this day has long been known by religious leaders is shown by the following quotation from a work by Urbanus Holzmeister, a Jesuit scholar:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Today it is commonly admitted that the occasion for the celebration of the day December 25 was the festival that the pagans were celebrating on this day. Petavius [French Jesuit scholar, 1583-1652] already has rightly observed that on December 25 was celebrated ‘the birthday of the unconquered sun.’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Witnesses for this festival are: (a) The <em>Calendar </em>of Furius Dionysius Filocalus, composed in the year 354 [C.E.], in which it is noted: ‘December 25, the B(irthday) of the unconquered (Sun).’ (b) the calendar of astrologer Antiochus (composed about 200 [C.E.]): ‘Month of December . . . 25 . . . The birthday of the Sun; daylight increases.’ (c) Caesar Julian [Julian the Apostate, Roman emperor 361-363 C.E.] recommended the games that were celebrated at the end of the year in honor of the sun, which was called ‘the unconquered sun.’”​—<em>Chronologia vitae Christi </em>(Chronology of the Life of Christ), Pontificium Institutum Biblicum, Rome, 1933, page 46.</p>

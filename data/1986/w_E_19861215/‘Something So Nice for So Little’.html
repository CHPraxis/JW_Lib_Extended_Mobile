<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is how a mother from Pennsylvania, U.S.A., feels about the cassette recordings of <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>She writes:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I have two boys Steven (9) and Robert (4). Robert is always asking Steven to read to him <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>I was thinking about recording the stories myself but haven’t had much time to do so. Now, thanks to your help, I can purchase the completed tapes for about what blank tapes would cost. It’s nice to know we can still purchase something so nice, for someone so precious, for so little.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If you have not done so already, be sure to get these cassette tapes for your young ones. Listen to the stories together as a family. Or children can play the tapes for themselves and their companions. The album with the four cassettes is only $8; playing time: 5 1/2 hours. The 256-page, beautifully illustrated <em>Bible Stories </em>book is $2.50.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Please indicate by marking the respective boxes whether you want the book or the album of cassette tapes, or both.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">□ I enclose $2.50 for <em>My Book of Bible Stories.</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">□ I enclose $8 for the vinyl album with the four cassette tapes of <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>(Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)</p>

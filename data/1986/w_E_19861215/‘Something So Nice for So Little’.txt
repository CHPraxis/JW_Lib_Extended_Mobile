‘Something So Nice for So Little’
That is how a mother from Pennsylvania, U.S.A., feels about the cassette recordings of My Book of Bible Stories. She writes:
“I have two boys Steven (9) and Robert (4). Robert is always asking Steven to read to him My Book of Bible Stories. I was thinking about recording the stories myself but haven’t had much time to do so. Now, thanks to your help, I can purchase the completed tapes for about what blank tapes would cost. It’s nice to know we can still purchase something so nice, for someone so precious, for so little.”
If you have not done so already, be sure to get these cassette tapes for your young ones. Listen to the stories together as a family. Or children can play the tapes for themselves and their companions. The album with the four cassettes is only $8; playing time: 5 1/2 hours. The 256-page, beautifully illustrated Bible Stories book is $2.50.
Please indicate by marking the respective boxes whether you want the book or the album of cassette tapes, or both.
□ I enclose $2.50 for My Book of Bible Stories.
□ I enclose $8 for the vinyl album with the four cassette tapes of My Book of Bible Stories. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● Selective Service regulations require that all men register for the draft when reaching 18 years of age. All of those required to do so should take care of the matter promptly, viewing it as a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. Elders will want to have this in mind when young brothers are nearing the age of 18 and give them appropriate reminders. Questions as to the young Christian’s responsibilities in this regard may be answered by the elders.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● The Society has produced a new 32-page booklet for the special purpose of helping persons of Hindu background. The title of the booklet is <em>Victory Over Death​—Is It Possible for You? </em>(<em>vi</em>). Congregations that have English-speaking persons with this background in their territory may wish to order a small supply of these booklets. As these become available in other languages, announcement will be made.</p>

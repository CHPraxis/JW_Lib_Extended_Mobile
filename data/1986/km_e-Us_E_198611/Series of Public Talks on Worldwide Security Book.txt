Series of Public Talks on Worldwide Security Book
1 With joy we all received at this year’s “Divine Peace” District Convention the new Bible study aid Worldwide Security Under the “Prince of Peace.” At that time we learned that it has been especially prepared for use at our Congregation Book Studies.
2 So that all will get the most benefit from this new Bible study aid, the Society has arranged to have the information covered in a series of six public talks from January 18 through February 22. All should resolve not to miss a single one of these talks that will encourage the reading of this book by some who may not already have done so. And the talks will further impress important points on the minds of those who have read the book. It is truly a book filled with timely spiritual food for consideration at our Congregation Book Studies in the near future.
3 Following are the titles of the talks and the chapters of the Worldwide Security book on which they will be based:
1​—The Ruling “Prince of Peace” Liberates His People (chapters 1-4)
2​—The Present Urgent Need to “Keep on the Watch” (chapters 5-8)
3​—Divine Covenants That Near Accomplishment (chapters 9-12)
4​—The “Great Crowd” Survive Christendom’s Destruction (chapters 13-16)
5​—Jehovah’s Loyal Ones Witness His Triumph at Armageddon (chapters 17-19)
6​—Jehovah Becomes “All Things to Everyone” Universally (chapters 20-22)
4 Thorough preparation will be required in order to ensure effective teaching and spirited delivery of the material. Hence, these talks should be given only by better-qualified speakers.

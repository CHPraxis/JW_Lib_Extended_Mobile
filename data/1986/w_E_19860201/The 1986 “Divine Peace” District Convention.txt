The 1986 “Divine Peace” District Convention
HOW fitting that the theme of our 1986 district conventions should be “Divine Peace”! Yes, Jehovah our God “is a God, not of disorder, but of peace.” He stands in striking contrast to “the god of this system of things,” Satan the Devil, who is a god of disorder, strife, and confusion.​—1 Corinthians 14:33; 2 Corinthians 4:4.
Most appropriately, Jehovah in his Word is repeatedly referred to as “the God of peace.” (Philippians 4:9; 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:20) In his Word, peace is promised, counseled, and stressed from beginning to end, being mentioned some 250 times. Truly, Jehovah is “the God who gives peace” to his people.​—Romans 15:33; 16:20.
How important it is, therefore, that every one of his servants, yes, each one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, be a person of peace! This means, not just being peaceful, but ‘seeking peace and making it our pursuit,’ as the apostle Peter counsels us to do. (1 Peter 3:10, 11) That means that we must be “peacemakers,” as our Kingdom Interlinear renders Matthew 5:9.
It is not easy to be peacemakers, to work for peace, to try to preserve the peace. There are the weaknesses of imperfect human nature that tend to cause personality conflicts. As our Kingdom song (No. 213) puts it: “Disagreements sometimes arise; we’re imperfect, we realize.” This song goes on to counsel: “Quickly settling them is great gain. Unity we’ll maintain.” There are also the pressures of Satan’s world, together with all its allurements, working against our having “the peace of God that excels all thought.” (Philippians 4:7) And, of course, there are Satan and his demons, who do all in their power to disrupt our peace; we must contend against them.​—Ephesians 6:12.
In ancient times, God arranged that his people come together on special occasions so as to be spiritually built up and strengthened in their determination to obey Jehovah’s commands. Likewise today, among the many aids he has provided to help us to be peacemakers are our annual district conventions. We hear God’s Word expounded at these gatherings. For four days we are taught by our heavenly Father by means of discourses, interviews, demonstrations, and dramas. Yes, even our songs directly or indirectly exhort us to peace.
This year at our “Divine Peace” District Convention we will feel the spirit of brotherhood as we welcome one another. Seeing how all the various convention departments harmoniously function, we will truly get the spirit of the convention.
So let us come genuinely conscious of our spiritual need and prepared to take full advantage of the entire program, arriving on time to take in the very first session on Thursday afternoon and remaining until the very last song and prayer on Sunday afternoon.
Furthermore, should we not also strive to be consistent? In what ways? By being truly appreciative of the spiritual food provided. Many of us will have come at considerable expense in time and funds. So let us see to it that we are punctual and in good physical condition. That means that we should not overindulge in food or drink nor keep late hours. Rather, let us make certain that we use moderation and get to bed on time so as to be refreshed and fit to take in all the spiritual food that is being provided. While the program is on, let us be in our seats listening, not wandering around or engaging in conversation with some dear friend whom we might not have seen for some time. The time to talk to our friends is before and after the sessions. Yes, let us come fully determined to get really built up spiritually.
In ancient times God arranged that his people come together regularly on special occasions so as to be spiritually built up. And, truly, our annual district conventions are among the many aids today that Jehovah has provided to help us to be peacemakers.

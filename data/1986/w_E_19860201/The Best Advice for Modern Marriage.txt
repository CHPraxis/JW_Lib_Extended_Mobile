The Best Advice for Modern Marriage
“Oh! You must buy these magazines and read them,” interrupted the neighbor. “Do you know why I want her to read them?” the neighbor asked the woman who was offering the magazines. “Thanks to your publications, I am back with my husband. I had left him and for one and a half years stayed with my mother. One of your people called and left me a publication, which I later read. It made me decide to go back to my husband. I continue to read your publications and am now happily married.” On this recommendation, the householder readily accepted the magazines.
The Watchtower and Awake! regularly contain Bible-based advice on dealing with family problems. Send only $8, and you will receive both magazines (a total of four copies a month) for one year.
Please send a year’s subscription for the Watchtower and Awake! magazines. I enclose $8 (U.S.) for 48 issues. (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ELDERS today often must make decisions that seem beyond the scope of their knowledge and experience. However, consider a situation that faced some Jewish elders in the days of Ezra.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Following the return of the Jewish remnant from Babylon, a 16-year-long period of inactivity set in. The prophets Haggai and Zechariah managed to shake the Jews out of their apathy, and the work of rebuilding Jehovah’s temple was resumed. Soon, though, this work was challenged by Persian officials. “Who put an order through to you to build this house?” asked the opposers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:5:1-15:5:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezra 5:1-3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The reply to this inquiry was critical. If the elders allowed themselves to be intimidated, the temple restoration would abruptly come to a halt. If the elders antagonized these officials, an immediate ban on the work could be imposed. So the elders (doubtless led by Governor Zerubbabel and High Priest Joshua) phrased a tactful but effective reply. They reminded the officials of the long-forgotten decree of Cyrus that had granted the Jews royal permission to go forward with this work. Knowing the Persian policy of never altering stated law, these officials shrewdly chose to avoid opposing a royal decree. The work was thus allowed to continue until King Darius later gave his official go-ahead!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:5:11-15:5:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezra 5:11-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:6:6-15:6:12" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 6:6-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Was this astounding result due to human wisdom? On the contrary, Ezra’s account says that “the eye of their God proved to be upon the older men of the Jews.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:5:5-15:5:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezra 5:5</a>) Clearly, Jehovah directed both their reply and the favorable response from the Persian king. Christian elders today can likewise look to Jehovah for guidance and direction when facing difficult decisions or dealing with opposers. Assures Jehovah at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:8-19:32:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 32:8</a>: “I shall make you have insight and instruct you in the way you should go. I will give advice with my eye upon you.”</p>

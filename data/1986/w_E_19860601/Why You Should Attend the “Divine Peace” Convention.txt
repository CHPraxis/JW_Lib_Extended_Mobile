Why You Should Attend the “Divine Peace” Convention
When terrorism, revolution, and war are the order of the day, how fine that beginning this month you can attend the “Divine Peace” Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses! There you will not only receive practical Christian instruction on maintaining peace but actually see thousands applying such instruction.
Be there from the opening session beginning at 1:30 Thursday afternoon. You will hear from longtime peace proclaimers. Also, you will learn of snares in social entertainment and how to avoid them. And at the conclusion of the session, you will receive something not only beautiful but useful in ministering to others.
Friday morning’s program will feature the keynote address, “Divine Peace for Those Taught by Jehovah.” You will be deeply moved by the drama “Preserving Life in Time of Famine.” Don’t miss it!
On Saturday, demonstrations, interviews, and instructive discourses will provide practical guidance for maintaining peace within the family circle. The program will conclude with the important address “Worldwide Security Under the ‘Prince of Peace’.”
Sunday morning a frank, hard-hitting modern-day drama will be presented emphasizing the need to seek God’s righteousness for survival. In the afternoon, the powerful public talk, “Peace at Last!​—When God Speaks,” will be another highlight of the convention.
Since over 130 conventions are scheduled in the United States alone, there will be a convention not far from your home. Check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the time and place of the one nearest to you.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">On the Caribbean island of St. Lucia, a storekeeper in the capital city obtained a copy of the book <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em>The person from whom she received it writes:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Before the week was out, she called me into her store three times as I would pass in front of the store. She had read portions of the book and wanted further explanations about hell, the soul, Mary’s not being the mother of God, and so on. Although she was a busy storekeeper and not given to reading to any extent, she read the book in two weeks, and to quote her: ‘I have never read so much in my life. Even when my head would hurt me from reading, I couldn’t put the book down.’”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The publication discusses practically every controversial Bible teaching, gathering the evidence together in such a concise and understandable way that the answers to questions become clear to the reader.

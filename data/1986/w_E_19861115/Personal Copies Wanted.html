<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A mother from Illinois, U.S.A., wrote: “My daughter and I have read stories from your hardbound publication <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>and enjoyed them thoroughly. We had checked this book and its four accompanying cassettes out of our local library.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“In the very back of the book was printed ‘Additional copies of this book may be obtained for $2.50 (U.S.) each, postpaid.’ Is this price correct? Also, where do I order additional copies from? How much is a copy of the book and the four cassettes?”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The four cassettes, including the album in which they come, are only $8. <em>My Book of Bible Stories, </em>which has the same page size as this magazine, is only $2.50. For entertaining Bible instruction, obtain this beautifully illustrated book as well as the album of cassette recordings of the book.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Please indicate by marking the respective boxes whether you want the book or the album of cassette tapes, or both.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">  [ ] I enclose $2.50 for <em>My Book of Bible Stories.</em></p>

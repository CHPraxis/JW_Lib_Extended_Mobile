Personal Copies Wanted
A mother from Illinois, U.S.A., wrote: “My daughter and I have read stories from your hardbound publication My Book of Bible Stories and enjoyed them thoroughly. We had checked this book and its four accompanying cassettes out of our local library.”
“In the very back of the book was printed ‘Additional copies of this book may be obtained for $2.50 (U.S.) each, postpaid.’ Is this price correct? Also, where do I order additional copies from? How much is a copy of the book and the four cassettes?”
The four cassettes, including the album in which they come, are only $8. My Book of Bible Stories, which has the same page size as this magazine, is only $2.50. For entertaining Bible instruction, obtain this beautifully illustrated book as well as the album of cassette recordings of the book.
Please indicate by marking the respective boxes whether you want the book or the album of cassette tapes, or both.
  [ ] I enclose $2.50 for My Book of Bible Stories.
  [ ] I enclose $8 for the vinyl album with the four cassette tapes of My Book of Bible Stories.
(Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

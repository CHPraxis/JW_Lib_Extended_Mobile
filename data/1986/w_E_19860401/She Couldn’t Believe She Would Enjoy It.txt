She Couldn’t Believe She Would Enjoy It
A woman from Pennsylvania wrote: “If anyone were to tell me that I could read a book on evolution and really enjoy it, I’d say, ‘No, a thousand times no!’” Yet, after reading Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creations?, a beautifully illustrated new book, she added:
“You have explained in terms so easy to understand something I’ve had difficulty grasping all my life. This book is written in such a way as to appeal to right-hearted ones whether they be evolutionists or creationists. . . .
“Some of the points brought out I remembered learning in Science and Biology class, but never in such a way as to develop an appreciation for our Creator. I especially enjoyed the chapters ‘Our Awesome Universe,’ ‘The Amazing Design of Living Things,’ and ‘Who Did It First?’”

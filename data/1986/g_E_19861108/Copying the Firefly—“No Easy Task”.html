<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The humble firefly produces “cold light” through a very efficient process of oxidation. Two scientists in the Netherlands have successfully developed a chemical compound that produces light in a similar way after it is dissolved in a liquid.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This compound may work fine as emergency lighting when applied as “light stick,” states <em>Kuzien, </em>the quarterly magazine of the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands. The new chemical compound is stored in a glass tube that is packed in a plastic container filled with water and an organic solvent. When the glass tube is broken, a chemical reaction takes place between the compound and the oxygen in the water, and​—there is light. However, the magazine modestly acknowledges: “Despite the good step forward, it remains a challenge for the chemists to make their system every bit as efficient as that of the humble firefly. There is every indication that this is no easy task.”</p>

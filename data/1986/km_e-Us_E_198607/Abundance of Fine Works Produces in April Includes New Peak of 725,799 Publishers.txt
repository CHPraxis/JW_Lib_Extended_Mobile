Abundance of Fine Works Produces in April Includes New Peak of 725,799 Publishers
Over 1,000,000 Bound Books Placed
The April report brings joy to our hearts! What a privilege to share zealously in so many fine works! (Titus 2:14) We give thanks and praise to Jehovah for prospering our efforts. The extent of the marvelous witness given is reflected in the report below:
Total Publishers: 725,799. This surpasses our March peak by 1,918.
Total Auxiliary and Regular Pioneers: The total number of auxiliary pioneers was 96,084, which was commendable. While this is not a new peak, when this figure is added to the new peak of 45,786 regular pioneers, the combined total is 5,182 over the total of auxiliary and regular pioneers in April 1985.
Total Hours: 15,413,888. This is 977,814 over our peak in April a year ago.
Return Visits: 5,085,665. Exceeds our previous peak in March by 106,943.
Home Bible Studies: 524,548. This is more than 11,000 over our peak last March.
The sum total of our activity for April, when added to what is being done worldwide, represents a fine spirit of godly devotion and self-sacrifice. It emphasizes, as Jesus foretold, that his followers would do ‘greater works’ in giving a Kingdom witness. (John 14:12) May we all keep on sharing joyfully in such “works” to God’s glory.

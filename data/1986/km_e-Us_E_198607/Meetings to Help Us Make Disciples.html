<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>13 min: </strong>Local announcements. Demonstrate following alternate Topic for Conversation. Theme: Living on Earth Forever​—Is It Possible? Use <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:2-56:1:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Titus 1:2</a> to point out that we have a sure promise of everlasting life. Then, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:20-20:2:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:20, 21</a> can be read to show that everlasting life is to be enjoyed on earth by righteous ones.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>17 min: </strong><em>Reasoning From the Scriptures. </em>Discussion between elder and young brother who finds himself attracted to the world. Elder uses material in <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989272/28:238-33$p/E:1101989273/1-26$p/E:1101989274/"><em>Reasoning </em>book, pages 389-93</a>, “Spirit of the World.” Elder defines spirit of the world and explains why being tainted by it is cause for concern. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 5:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Rev. 12:9</a>) Elder draws brother into discussion and reasons along following points: Damage to our spirituality if spirit of world influences our thinking and desires. World’s spirit based on pride and rebellion against Jehovah. What must be done to break free from spirit of world. Need to avoid Eve’s self-willed course and resist tendency to rebel against authority. Ways in which spirit of world manifests itself in conduct of people today. Pitfalls of materialism; its relationship to spirit of world. How improper speech and actions contribute to wrong spirit. Contrast Bible makes between spiritual and physical man. Do not idolize humans. Elder concludes with experience showing we really do not miss out on anything if we do not get involved in worldly activities. In African land, at age of nine, young girl had to leave land where work was banned and move with family to another country where she spent 14 years in a refugee camp. All her teen years devoted to peaceful life revolving around Bible study and meetings. Now she is in full-time service. Although she did not have access to world and its entertainment, did not miss anything! Young brother expresses appreciation for discussion.</p>

Barnabas was known as a warmhearted and generous person. He willingly gave of himself to help his brothers. His visit to Antioch was a stimulus to the new disciples. His warm words and thoughts moved the new disciples “to continue in the Lord with <em>hearty purpose.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:11:23-44:11:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 11:23</a>) Giving encouragement effectively brings results. The recipient benefits by receiving courage, hope, and confidence to face a difficult situation.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn"><strong>25 min: </strong>Using <em>Reasoning From the Scriptures </em>on Return Visits. Talk and demonstrations. Paul compared our work to farmer who not only plants but also waters, then waits for God to ‘make it grow.’ Paul planted by bringing the good news; Apollos nourished and cultivated the field by further teaching. Apollos powerfully used the Scriptures to ‘water,’ and so do we by taking further Scriptural information to interested ones.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:5-46:3:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:5-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:27-44:18:28" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Acts 18:27, 28</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Young brother in audience raises hand, is glad he can now use Topic for Conversation in field but has not yet made return visits; unsure, not experienced in using Bible. What if householder has questions he cannot answer? Chairman invites brother to stage. Explains that Jehovah understands our needs and has provided assistance through organization. Shows how <em>Reasoning </em>book covers variety of subjects and questions. Explains how to locate information by use of index as well as list in front of book. Chairman briefly takes part of householder who expresses belief that when Jesus Christ returns, all will see him visibly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:7-66:1:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 1:7</a>) Chairman then helps locate information on pages 342 and 343. Young brother uses information from book, reasons with householder, and expresses satisfaction at being able to give answer, has more confidence now.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Chairman continues talk. Many people simply take literature without asking questions or showing particular interest. In many cases we can lay groundwork for return by raising a question. Demonstration: After offer is accepted, publisher refers back to topic and asks: “How can we know for sure that these conditions promised by God will come in our lifetime? I would like to stop by in a few days and point out the answer that Jesus gave to that question.” Householder readily agrees. Chairman asks publisher what is planned for return visit. Publisher refers to material under “Last Days” in <em>Reasoning </em>book and some points that will be used to build on what was previously discussed. Following these suggestions in the field may lead to a Bible study.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Conclude by pointing out that a return visit need not be a lengthy discussion, may use just two or three Scriptural points. May take several visits before householder’s spiritual appetite is awakened sufficiently for Bible study. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3</a>) <em>Reasoning </em>book can assist because it contains many points that people often wonder about and uses the Scriptures to answer. Encourage all to schedule time for return visits. Trust in Jehovah to draw honest-hearted ones to the truth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:14-44:16:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 16:14</a>.</p>

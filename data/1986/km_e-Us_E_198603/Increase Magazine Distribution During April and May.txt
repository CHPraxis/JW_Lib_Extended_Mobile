Increase Magazine Distribution During April and May
1 Plan now for increased distribution of magazines during April and May. Four consecutive issues of The Watchtower will feature cover subjects highlighting the Bible as a book of promises that do not fail and as a source of practical counsel for our guidance in a turbulent world.
2 The April 1 cover will feature “The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?” April 15 follows with “The Bible​—A Book for All Mankind.” The cover feature for May 1 will be “The Bible​—Practical for Modern Man?” and “The Bible and Your Future” will be featured on the cover of The Watchtower for May 15.
3 Since many will be enrolled as auxiliary pioneers during these two months and everyone is being encouraged to give these magazines wide distribution, now is the time to order extra distributors’ copies. Additional copies of Awake! should also be ordered according to the congregation’s needs.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">I would like to thank you for the outstanding way in which you dealt with the problem of allergies. (June 22, 1985) I am a doctor specializing in the ear, nose, and throat. The article was so clear and accurate that I put it in my waiting room at my clinic. I wasn’t at all surprised when various patients asked me for a copy. Later on they told me how much they appreciated the information.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">I want to thank you ever so much for your “Young People Ask . . . ?” articles, especially that one “How Can I Improve My Grades?” (December 8, 1984) I wish I would have had this one sooner, because I am spending my second year in the fifth grade. Thank you for the articles and please don’t quit publishing them.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>Reading the Bible</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Thank you very much for the article “Young People Ask . . . Why Read the Bible?” (August 8, 1985) I am 14 years old. I had tried to read the Bible but found myself reading a lot one day, hardly any the next, then I would not read anything for weeks, even months. So I tried out the suggestion you brought out in the article, to read for just 15 minutes a day. This enabled me to read three or four chapters, and I have really enjoyed it. If my mind does stray during my reading, I make myself go back and read the passage again. I find it is easier to understand and much more interesting than I ever thought reading the Bible could be.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>Dogs Man’s Friend?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Your article “They Call Me Man’s Best Friend” (September 8, 1985) says only half of the truth. Last year 15 million children starved to death because readers of Christian magazines had to feed 15 million dogs. Is that in accordance with Bible principles? I think that you should tell your readers that a dog is OK, but only if at least every child in this world has enough to eat.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><em>We agree that there is a lot of inequity in the world today. A lot of resources that might better be diverted to easing human suffering are used for feeding pets, and even for other human luxuries. But we don’t think that killing off all pet cats and dogs would be a solution. There is so much involved in the problem that we believe only God’s Kingdom by Christ Jesus can solve the problem of hunger and all the other problems plaguing mankind.​—ED.</em></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>Stepfamilies</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Thanks for the article “Young People Ask . . . Will Being in a Stepfamily Ruin My Life?” (May 8, 1985) My wife does not share my faith. This brought many strains, even violence, in our relationship, as I tried to compel her to my thinking. Your article has helped me to adjust my way of thinking and to regain true happiness. Actually, the article helps to improve our human relations at all levels.</p>

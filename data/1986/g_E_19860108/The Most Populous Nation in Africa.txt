The Most Populous Nation in Africa
A country where 250 languages are spoken. Here are people who are outspoken but willing to discuss religion. Read about them in the 1986 YEARBOOK OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES.
As you read this report from Nigeria, you will share the fascinating experiences of those who have taught the Bible to idol worshipers, to villagers who shared in demonistic rites to fetish gods, and to practicers of polygamy.
This 256-page Yearbook also features thrilling accounts of Christian faithfulness in Bolivia and the Netherlands, and an up-to-date report on the activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide.
Please send, postpaid, the 1986 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. I enclose $1 (U.S.).

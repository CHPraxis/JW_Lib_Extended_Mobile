Are we prepared to follow up interest so it does not wither and die? Have two publishers discuss use of material under “Evolution” in <em>Reasoning </em>book, starting on page 121. Note especially two points of view as expressed on pages 126 and 127, one expressing belief in evolution and the other acknowledging the existence of a Creator. Show how we can use this information in house-to-house ministry or on return visits. Chairman refers to <em>Creation </em>book, highlights fine material that not only refutes evolution but builds faith. What subject would interest householder? The book is designed with questions to be studied. Chapter 3 deals with familiar material from Genesis. Or perhaps material in chapters 16 and 17 on “Why Would God Permit Suffering?” and “Can You Trust the Bible?” would appeal to householder. If time permits, two publishers can demonstrate starting study by using this fine publication.</p>

Five-minute talk should make clear the difference between the claim of fundamentalists that the six creative days were each 24 hours long and the Bible teaching of creation. When offering the <em>Creation </em>book, we need to be prepared to expose the false viewpoint of fundamentalists as well as the evolution theory. Demonstrate publisher talking to person who does not believe in evolution but thinks the creation took place in six 24-hour days. Publisher uses material in <em>Reasoning </em>book to help householder reason on the matter and see how such teaching has been a stumbling block to people who have some knowledge of the material universe. Householder responds favorably, accepts offer of book, and invites publisher back for return visit. Chairman concludes with encouragement for all to become acquainted with facts in the Society’s publications on the Bible teaching of creation.</p>

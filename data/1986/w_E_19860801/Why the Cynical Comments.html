<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A reader of the <em>Awake! </em>magazine in England wondered why some people make such cynical comments about it, explaining:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Though not of your faith, I am consistently impressed at the insight and clarity of your magazine.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I am often amazed at the cynical comments visitors to my home make when they see a copy laying around. Could it be that <em>Awake! </em>hits too many ‘home truths’ about ourselves?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I was particularly interested last year in your articles on alcohol and, as an ex-drunk, the Bible extract about drink turning ‘like a snake’ confirms to me, once more, the wisdom of that book.”</p>

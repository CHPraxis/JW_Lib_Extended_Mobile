Why the Cynical Comments?
A reader of the Awake! magazine in England wondered why some people make such cynical comments about it, explaining:
“Though not of your faith, I am consistently impressed at the insight and clarity of your magazine.
“I am often amazed at the cynical comments visitors to my home make when they see a copy laying around. Could it be that Awake! hits too many ‘home truths’ about ourselves?
“I was particularly interested last year in your articles on alcohol and, as an ex-drunk, the Bible extract about drink turning ‘like a snake’ confirms to me, once more, the wisdom of that book.”
You, too, will be impressed by Awake! It probes beneath the surface of issues. And being unhampered by advertisers whose toes must not be stepped on, it is free to publish facts. You, too, will enjoy this magazine, published in 53 languages and read by millions of people.
Please send a year’s subscription for Awake! I enclose $4 (U.S.) for 24 issues of this magazine (2 copies a month).

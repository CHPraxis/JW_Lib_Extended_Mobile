How Do You Correct Your Children?
IT ISN’T easy, most parents probably will agree. The parents of children ages ten and seven relate how the books Listening to the Great Teacher and Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It have been a great help.
“When it is necessary to correct our children,” they write, “we talk with them and determine what seems to be the problem, for example, possibly not showing love for a sibling or lack of respect for us as parents. Then we send them off to read, in the privacy of their own room, an appropriate chapter from one of these two books. We also assign them to look up certain scriptures and read them.”
The result? “When they come out to tell us that they are finished and ready to review the chapter and the scriptures with Daddy or Mommy, what a change!” Regarding their seven-year-old, who is inclined to be very strong-willed, they write: “Even though she might angrily stomp down the hallway to her room, she comes out smiling and says, ‘I can see that I was wrong. I am sorry!’”
If you are a parent or know parents who need help in disciplining their children, why not obtain these inexpensive books? They truly can be of great help in rearing children.

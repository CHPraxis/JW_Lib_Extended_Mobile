A Discriminating Burglar
Anyone can be a victim of burglars or thieves. They usually show no partiality, so that anyone can suddenly find himself minus his wallet, his car radio, his bicycle, or any other valuable possession. Obviously, this also applies to Jehovah’s Witnesses. But occasionally a thief with a conscience pops up, as is illustrated by the following experience from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
“One autumn day, very early in the morning, my wife got up and, as was her custom, went to open the back door, only to find that someone had broken the lock of the back room. Although we had some valuable items there, nothing had disappeared. But to our surprise someone had left the following note on the door: ‘Householders of this beautiful home, forgive me for having broken the lock. I am a burglar and came to take away all that is here, but I realized that here are Christian Witnesses of Jehovah, and for that reason I did not do it. I rob the rest, but you I respect.’”
How did the burglar know these were Witnesses? Because in the back room they had their Bible literature and magazines (Watchtower and Awake!). Although the neighbors were burglarized that night, the Witnesses were not.
Jehovah’s Witnesses are subject to ‘time and unforeseen circumstance’ as is anyone else. Yet, on many occasions, it pays to be identified as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.​—Ecclesiastes 9:11.

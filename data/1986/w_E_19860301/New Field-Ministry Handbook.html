<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AT HUNDREDS of “Integrity Keepers” District Conventions during 1985-86, a new field-ministry handbook was released in many languages. It is for use in helping people to get the satisfying answers that the Bible gives to their questions. This is a 448-page book entitled <em>Reasoning From the Scriptures. </em>What are some of its features?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">□ “Introductions for Use in the Field Ministry.” These have been gathered from circuit and district overseers, pioneers, and elders who have had many years of experience and who get good results in their ministry.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">□ “How You Might Respond to Potential Conversation Stoppers.” “I’m not interested,” “I have my own religion,” “I’m busy,” and many more are dealt with here. If these objections are hindering you from giving a witness in your territory, you will find helpful fresh approaches here. This section also contains practical information regarding conversations with Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, and Muslims.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">□ Over 70 main subject headings. Included are “Abortion,” “Drugs,” “Sex,” “Spiritism,” “Holidays,” “Rapture,” “Reincarnation,” “Trinity,” and many more. Under these are suggestions as to how to answer questions of the sort that frequently are asked now in the 1980’s. For example: “How can we be sure the Bible has not been changed?” “Does everyone have a predetermined ‘time to die’?” “Why does God permit suffering?” There are also suggestions on how you might reason with a person who says: “Men wrote the Bible,” “I have my own concept of God,” “I live a good life. I treat my neighbors right. That’s enough religion for me,” and scores more. These have been gathered from 18 countries. Use of the handbook can help you to benefit from the experience that others have acquired over a period of decades in reasoning from the Scriptures.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">□ This book has not been prepared to help anyone “win arguments” with people who show no respect for the truth. Rather, it provides valuable information that is meant to be used in reasoning with individuals who will allow you to do so. Some of them may ask questions to which they really want satisfying answers. Others, in the course of conversation, may simply state their own beliefs, and they may do so with some conviction. But perhaps they are reasonable persons who are willing to listen to another viewpoint. If so, this book can be very helpful in sharing with them a clear presentation of Bible truth. Do not hesitate to show them what the book contains and read from it with them.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">□ In harmony with the example set by the apostle Paul when preaching in Greece, appropriate use is made of quotations from secular history, encyclopedias, religious reference books, Bible-language lexicons, and so forth. Everything is right there at your fingertips.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">□ A seven-page index of subjects and scriptures is included to help you find answers quickly.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">□ Carry this valuable handbook with you regularly in the field ministry. Offer it to Bible students who show a desire to talk with others about what they have learned. It will not ordinarily be offered to the public. But if someone asks if he may have a copy, do not hesitate to obtain one for him.</p>

Bearing Up Under Superhuman Pressure
Do you feel that this is what you are doing? Many people do. And they are helped by knowing how others cope. A woman from Bettendorf, Iowa, writes that she relates experiences from the Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses to persons with whom she studies the Bible, “helping them to see that ‘the same things in the way of sufferings are being accomplished in the entire association of your brothers in the world.’”​—1 Peter 5:9.
Read the 1986 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It can help you to be firm for righteousness and happy about doing what is right. It contains detailed reports about the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Bolivia, the Netherlands, and Nigeria. It also gives an up-to-date picture of their work worldwide.
Please send, postpaid, the 256-page, hardbound 1986 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. I enclose $1 (U.S.).

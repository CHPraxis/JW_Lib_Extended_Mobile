Worldwide Security Under the “Prince of Peace”
Worldwide security under the “Prince of Peace” is an absolute certainty. The Almighty God assures us of this in the prophecy about the birth and career of the “Prince of Peace” at Isaiah 9:6, 7: “His name will be called . . . Prince of Peace. To the abundance of the princely rule and to peace there will be no end . . . The very zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.” How readers of this book can prepare to enter into the abundance of the rule of the “Prince of Peace” is set forth in this volume.

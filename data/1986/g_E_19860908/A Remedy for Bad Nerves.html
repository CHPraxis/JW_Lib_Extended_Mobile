<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">With all the problems people have these days, it is little wonder that there is so much stress-related illness. A grandmother from Canada describes her situation and how she receives relief.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I am raising an 11-year-old grandson and recently took on the responsibility for my 14-year-old granddaughter. I have bad nerves, but I just wanted to let you know that when I get to feeling down, I not only pray to Jehovah but do something else that is really helpful.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I drop what I am doing and lie or sit down with the Kingdom Melodies tapes on. I close my eyes and push other thoughts out of my mind by recalling what I can of the words as the music is played. When I get up, I feel much better and am once again able to carry on.”</p>

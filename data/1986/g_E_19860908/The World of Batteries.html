<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A BATTERY is a battery, right? Wrong! Depending on application and size requirements, there is a world of difference in the world of batteries.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Basically, a battery is a device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy. The two major types are called <em>primary </em>and <em>secondary </em>(or storage) batteries. The difference is that the latter can be recharged, which means that the chemical reaction producing electricity can be reversed, thereby restoring the batteryâ€™s electricity-making capabilities and greatly extending its period of usefulness. Because of the greater expense, buying a rechargeable battery is practical only if it is to be used often, as in a radio used daily, in contrast with a flashlight used only occasionally. One should not overlook, moreover, what is involved in recharging.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The more common primary household batteries include the following four:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Regular: </strong>The oldest and cheapest form. It has a short life and deteriorates particularly fast in extreme heat or cold. It is also susceptible to leakage.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Heavy-duty: </strong>Generally considered an improved version of the regular battery. It therefore costs more.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Alkaline: </strong>Performs better in extreme temperatures, lasts longer, is not as susceptible to leakage, and is the most expensive of the three types.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Miniature (button): </strong>Used in devices requiring small amounts of power (hearing aids, watches). It has long life but is expensive.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong><em>Battery Buyers, Beware of the Following:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Buying batteries solely on the basis of price. If your power drain is moderate to heavy and fairly constant, it will pay to buy a more expensive battery (alkaline), which will last much longer. For things used only occasionally (flashlights, seldom-used radios), a cheaper battery will suffice.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Buying batteries that have lost strength by long storage on store shelves. To ensure getting fresh batteries, look for a shop with rapid turnover of stock.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Storing unused batteries where it is warm or wet. Batteries keep best in a cool, dry place, for example, sealed in plastic bags in a refrigerator. Before removal from the plastic, however, let them come to room temperature, so as to avoid having the terminals rust from condensation.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Thinking that the staying power of all batteries is the same. Standard or heavy-duty batteries will run an appliance (portable TV set, video camera, cassette player) well when fresh, but since alkaline batteries maintain a more constant voltage, they will offer good service right up to the end, rather than slowly tapering off.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Mixing new and old or mixing different types of batteries. The mix will last only as long as the weakest battery.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Forgetting to remove worn-out batteries promptly to prevent leakage. Batteries should also be removed when devices are not in use, or are to be powered by household current over a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Putting button-type batteries in your mouth or allowing children to play with them. If swallowed accidentally, internal burning can result in serious injury or even death.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">So the next time you need to buy batteries for your portable radio, clock, calculator, tape recorder, or some other appliance, remember that in the world of batteries, there is a world of difference.</p>

A Remedy for Bad Nerves
With all the problems people have these days, it is little wonder that there is so much stress-related illness. A grandmother from Canada describes her situation and how she receives relief.
“I am raising an 11-year-old grandson and recently took on the responsibility for my 14-year-old granddaughter. I have bad nerves, but I just wanted to let you know that when I get to feeling down, I not only pray to Jehovah but do something else that is really helpful.
“I drop what I am doing and lie or sit down with the Kingdom Melodies tapes on. I close my eyes and push other thoughts out of my mind by recalling what I can of the words as the music is played. When I get up, I feel much better and am once again able to carry on.”
You, too, can benefit from these healthful, refreshing musical arrangements. Each of the six cassettes, Kingdom Melodies 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, costs only $2 and has a playing time of about one hour. Receive the cassettes that are listed below by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.

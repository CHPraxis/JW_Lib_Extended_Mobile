<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Humans have proved unable consistently to predict the future. Yet, if man originally was created by God, then the purpose of God determines what the future holds for mankind.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">You can learn about the bright future that God promises by reading the 256-page, beautifully illustrated book <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em>It provides convincing evidence as to why we are here, why we grow old and die, yet how humans will live forever on earth in Paradise. More than that, it explains why God has permitted wickedness to exist until now. Fill in and mail the accompanying coupon, along with $2.50, and receive your copy.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Please send, postpaid, the hardcover book <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em>I enclose $2.50 (U.S.).</p>

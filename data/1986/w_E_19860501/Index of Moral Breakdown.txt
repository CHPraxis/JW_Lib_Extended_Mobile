Index of Moral Breakdown
SOCIOLOGISTS attribute today’s ever-worsening breakdown in morals to a variety of causes. Cunningham Geikie, a 19th-century Bible scholar, however, pinpointed quite accurately where the blame should fall. He astutely observed that “it is for ever true that the character of a nation’s religion is an index to its national health and vigour.” Interestingly, the Holy Bible portrays false religion under the guise of a harlot with an identifying name on her forehead​—“Babylon the Great.” In her hand is a golden cup full of disgusting things and unclean things of her fornication. Obviously, it is the quality of this Babylonish false religion that is the true index of today’s pernicious immorality and appalling wickedness.​—Revelation 17:1, 2, 4, 5, 15.

Like an Exhilarating Ride
That is how one reader described her perusal of the fascinating, beautifully illustrated new publication Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? “Turning its pages one by one,” she wrote, “I have just taken a brief ‘trip’ through it. What an exhilarating ‘ride’ that was! . . .
“My husband and I agree that it isn’t just a book​—it’s an encyclopedia! The children are already arguing over whose turn it is to look at it next​—we’ll have to have more copies!
“Believe me, the excellent points, so logically and clearly made in favor of creation, positively leap from the pages. The book has a compelling authority, a sparkling power, that remains to the last page.”

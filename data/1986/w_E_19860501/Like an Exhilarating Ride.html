<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is how one reader described her perusal of the fascinating, beautifully illustrated new publication <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>“Turning its pages one by one,” she wrote, “I have just taken a brief ‘trip’ through it. What an exhilarating ‘ride’ that was! . . .</p>

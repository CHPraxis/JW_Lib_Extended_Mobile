<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● On Saturday, May 3, the Brooklyn Bethel home and factory and Watchtower Farms buildings will be closed for spring cleaning, so there will be no arrangements for tours or to pick up literature on that day.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● Since the Memorial celebration falls on a Monday this year, most congregations may not need to make adjustments in their regular meeting schedule for the week. If it is considered necessary to cancel a meeting, it should be the Congregation Book Study, scheduling half of the material the week prior to the Memorial and half the week following the Memorial.</p>

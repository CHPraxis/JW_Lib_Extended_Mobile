Help Others to Find True Peace and Security
1 All over the earth there are still many sincere people who are not yet servants of Jehovah but who are “sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done” in Christendom. (Ezek. 9:4) They long for the time when true peace and security will replace today’s terrible conditions. Such people need the comforting hope of the incoming New Order with its Paradise of complete peace and security.
2 For such honest-hearted ones, the book True Peace and Security​—How Can You Find It? is being published. This is a revision of an earlier publication on the same theme. The book thoroughly answers questions about why there is no true peace and security now, how it will come, when we will know it is near, and what we should do about it individually. It alerts people to the significance of world events. It shows them whether or not they should place any confidence in man’s efforts for peace. The True Peace book takes note of the declaration by the United Nations that the year 1986 begins special efforts by world leaders toward ‘peace and security.’ Referring to this declaration, the True Peace book says: “This, no doubt, is a step toward the fulfillment of Paul’s . . . words. . . . Yet the prophecy shows that the time will come when the nations will declare that they have achieved a measure of ‘peace and security.’”​—1 Thess. 5:3.
3 Jehovah’s organization has planned a special worldwide distribution of this fine publication in April and May. While there will be more information about it in Our Kingdom Ministry for March and April, we encourage all congregations to order their supplies now, if they have not already done so, in order to have them on hand for the distribution beginning in April.

The Trials of Job
Now you can hear the dramatic Bible presentation of Job’s sufferings and endurance, how supposed comforters accused him, and how he answered them. Listen to the correction provided, first by Job’s friend Elihu and then by God himself.
The two cassettes, read from the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, have a playing time of 2 hours and 20 minutes, and are only $3, postpaid.
I enclose $3 (U.S.) for the two cassettes of the Bible book of Job.

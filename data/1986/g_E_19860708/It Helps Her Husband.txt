It Helps Her Husband
Are there members of your household you would like to help in a spiritual way? There is a powerful source of help​—the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. A wife writes:
“My husband, who had tried to listen to the reading of other books but just couldn’t get interested, has been listening almost every night to a chapter and he loves it! The style of writing is so appealing, so logical, so interesting that it’s a real pleasure to see what’s coming in the next chapter!”
The book’s 256 pages, the same size as those in this magazine, are filled with over 150 teaching illustrations, most in beautiful color. Order now. Only $2.50.

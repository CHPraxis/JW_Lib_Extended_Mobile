‘You Have Brought Me Much Courage’
In a letter requesting subscriptions to the Watchtower and Awake! magazines, a woman from Quebec, Canada, wrote:
“I have been reading your literature for some years now, and I find it simply tremendous. How often you have comforted me or very often corrected me or brought joy to my heart. You have also brought me much courage. . . . My four daughters and I say ‘thank you.’”

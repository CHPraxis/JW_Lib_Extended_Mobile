Now Volume 2 of the “Old Testament” on 21 Cassettes in One Handy Album
The Hebrew Scriptures, from 1 Samuel through Psalms (New World Translation), are now available on cassette recordings. Listen to them in your car on your way to work, while you are doing housework, or when you are sick and bedridden. The 21 cassettes, along with the attractive brown vinyl album that holds them, are only $33.25.
Please send, postpaid, the brown vinyl album with the cassette recordings of 1 Samuel through Psalms. I enclose $33.25 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

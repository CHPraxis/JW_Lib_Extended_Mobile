<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Beginning with its January 8, 1987, issue, <em>Awake! </em>joins <em>The Watchtower </em>as a four-color publication. In addition to making individual copies more attractive, this should enhance our presentation of the subscription offer in the future. As we anticipate a wider distribution of these two magazines in the months ahead, congregations are encouraged to increase their distributors’ orders in accord with local needs. This should be done without delay.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The special four-color editions of <em>Awake! </em>published last October were well received by the brothers and by the public in general. They contributed to the success of the subscription campaign at that time. Now that all issues of both <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>will be in full color, we anticipate a wider distribution, with significant increases in the placement of individual copies as well as the number of subscriptions obtained.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>May we all share enthusiastically in the distribution of these excellent publications that continue to play a major role in making Jehovah’s name known everywhere.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">I would like to thank you immensely for the article “A Salty Drink That Saves Lives!” (September 22, 1985) A young man’s mother was struck with diarrhea and vomiting, and he bought some drugs for her treatment. Hearing about this, I showed him the prescription for the oral rehydration drink printed in your article. Instead of using the drugs he bought, he used this prescription. Within one hour his mother, who was near death, revived and gained strength. His father also took ill and was given the remainder of this mixture. He recovered immediately.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>The Catholic Church and Marriage</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">I am writing in connection with the article “The Church’s View of Sex and Marriage.” (November 8, 1985) For six years I studied at the seminary of Our Lady of Fatima, but I left because of the great negligence on the part of our superiors in teaching us how to serve God and man and also because of the homosexuality practiced by those attending. On leaving the seminary, many of us had difficulty in adjusting to married life because what we had been taught degraded marriage in that sexual relations in the marriage arrangement were considered a sin. Continue to publish such upbuilding material.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>Peace in the Family</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">I am writing to express my thanks for the article “‘It’s All His Fault!’​—Peace Despite Differences.” (January 8, 1986) My husband reads your magazine though he does not share my faith. After having read the article mentioned above, he was compelled to clarify a question that had put a strain on our relationship, and he embraced me tenderly. This, thanks to your articles that deal with actual facts and give advice that touches the heart.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>Horoscopes​—Helpful or Harmful?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">I must protest against the ignorance of your article “Horoscopes​—Helpful or Harmful?” (September 8, 1985) The moon can exert a pull on our vast oceans, yet we so-called intelligent humans don’t want to admit that there may be some effect on us as well. Serious astrologers do not profess to be able to read the future by looking at the heavenly bodies. They believe the stars can help us to become aware of when it is time to apply caution, to stop a negative behavior pattern for instance. The constructive use of astrology helps us to come to terms with and consciously transform the more difficult or negative sides of our nature.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><em>To accept that our relatively close moon can exert a physical gravitational pull on bodies of water on earth in no way supports the thought that stars located many light-years away have any influence on human behavior.

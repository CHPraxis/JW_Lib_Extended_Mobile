<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">All the activity previously described is supported by volunteer workers, thus keeping costs down. The house-to-house ministry and distribution of literature is done voluntarily by Jehovah’s Witnesses. They pay for their own expenses. The elders who supervise the congregations, assisted by the ministerial servants, receive no payment for their services. They cover all their own expenses.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Even the members of the Governing Body and all others who work full time in the preparation and production of Bibles and Bible literature receive only their room and meals and a small reimbursement for expenses. The same is true of the full-time traveling overseers.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Our literature is published to aid persons who show genuine interest in the Bible. The basic costs of materials, production, and shipping are covered by voluntary donations made by interested persons and are supplemented by contributions, bequests, and so forth, made by Jehovah’s Witnesses themselves.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At all meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses, whether local or at assemblies, there are contribution boxes available for those who wish to make contributions. No collections are taken. There are no dues or tithes that have to be paid. As laid down in the Scriptures, each one can contribute as he has resolved in his heart.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:12-47:8:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 8:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 9:7</a>.</p>

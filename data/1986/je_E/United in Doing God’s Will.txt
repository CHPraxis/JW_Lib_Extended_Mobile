United in Doing God’s Will
We hope that the information presented in this brochure about the ministry, meetings, and organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses will encourage you the reader to associate more fully with them in worshiping God. We invite you to learn about the Witnesses firsthand by personally associating with a congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses and attending their assemblies. This will contribute much to your understanding of God’s will at this time.—Titus 2:11-14.
As you conform your life to the Bible’s standard of fine works, you will also have the privilege of sharing with Jehovah’s Witnesses in their activities. In addition to enjoying the warm fellowship of a worldwide association of brothers, you will be able to look forward to surviving the end of the present system of things into a new system where peace and righteousness will dwell.—2 Peter 3:13.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Vatican Rule in New England</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ In Connecticut the Catholic governor distinguished himself by lashing out against the American public-school system; the chaplain of the state senate went out of his way to pray lengthily for Pope Pius XII, and eight days later, after an act had been rushed through the Connecticut legislature before the court adjourned, it turned out to be an authorization of legalized gambling for church societies. After another twelve days Archbishop Spellman, of New York, also panned the American public-school system. On the same occasion, one of Archbishop Spellman’s fellow speakers, “Rev.” William A. Scully, referring to the public school, said that the children who attended them had been allowed to grow up without religious safeguards. This was a hot one; for, while Catholics make up only 11 percent of America’s adult population, they furnish 33 percent of all the criminals in the nation. In New York State 56.6 percent of the criminals are Catholics, while the annual report of Sing Sing Prison shows that there are 848 Catholic prisoners to only 572 of all other sects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Lowell, Massachusetts, a public school was rented to a Catholic parish for use as a parochial school for the princely sum of $1 a year. Thus the taxpayers built a school wherein are taught doctrines wholly incompatible with the institutions upon which America was founded; and they thus accomplish their own ruin and enhance the prestige of a foreign power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A dispatch from Washington says: “A bill introduced by Senator David I. Walsh, of Massachusetts, a Catholic, would extend the federal old-age and insurance benefits of the Social Security Act to cover more than a million lay persons (nuns, monks, etc.) employed by religious and charitable organizations throughout the country.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Artlessness of Youth</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">FRIEND in New England writes that a good wife was narrating to her husband at some length the witness to the Kingdom which she had been privileged to give that day to a tradesman who called at the door. Her little four-year-old daughter, seated at the table, had been taking it all in until the conversation was finished. Then she brought down the house by saying, demurely, “Mother, you talk too much; you should use the phonograph?’ By the way, have you ever talked yourself out of a placement of literature by continuing to talk after the party had decided to take the literature ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mrs. Louise Pittroff, of Massachusetts, writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In making a back-call in territory not visited for some time, I found a lady who had been a Catholic until some four years ago, when she started reading the Watchtower literature along with her Bible. Her husband still claims to be a Catholic, though he has not been to church for five years. They have two girls, seven and nine. The mother had been teaching these children for about six months, when her husband insisted upon sending them to the Sunday school in the Catholic church, and they went. When the nun came to the place in the Catechism where it teaches the false doctrine of the Trinity, the child of seven said quaintly and pointedly, “That is a damned lie; how can three gods be one?” Then the little girl continued to unfold the truth as her mother had taught, whereupon the nun said, “You cannot be a Catholic if you talk that way.” The little girl replied, “I don’t want to be a Catholic; it is the Devil’s own mess; I want to be a Christian.” That ended the Sunday school ; a model Bible study is now in progress in the home, and it is a thrill to see the youngsters dig in and study. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font3"> No. 2 is just the thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In the Grip of the Hierarchy</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason that Jehovah’s witnesses are having such a warm time in New England is that so many of the officials there are under the control of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The Roman Catholic </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Register,</span><span class="font5"> in a single issue, stated that Governor Murphy, of New Hampshire, had been made a member of the Catholic Order of the Knights of Malta and that Governor McGrath, of Rhode Island, had assisted at mass early in the morning of the day in which he was inaugurated governor of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you live in New Haven, Connecticut, and you want your children to come home to you bearing scars they will carry throughout life, you might try sending them to St. Stanislaus parochial school of that city. One parent, Walter Remian, is suing the outfit because one of the teachers, carefully not named, but assuredly either a priest or a nun, held his little boy on a hot radiator last February, burning him terribly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Red Mass hocus-pocus, relic of the Dark Ages, when all judges were supposed to be mere clerks of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and to do as they were told with the lives, liberties and consciences of their fellow men, was introduced into the United States in 1928.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This grotesque and foolish performance has thus far been pulled off in New York, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and in the District of Columbia, and, most recently of all, in Massachusetts, where the governor, the mayor of Boston, the Supreme Court and some lawyers were in attendance. The objective is to make it appear that America is a Catholic country, which it is not, and that all courts are subject to Roman canon law, which they are not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rifts in the Clouds</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every now and then an honest man realizes that there is something seriously wrong. Thus James F. Shea, Indian Orchard, Massachusetts, a courageous and honest Catholic, wrote to the Springfield </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Republican</span><span class="font5"> of that state a scathing denunciation of “accursed, sanctified, gambling joints”, designating them as a “shame and a disgrace in the name of the church”. He called on the clerical gamesters of Holyoke, Ludlow, Springfield, Chicopee, Chicopee Falls,. Aldenville and Willimansett to clean up. He is, however, wasting his breath. It is impossible to clean up anything that is rotten from skin to core.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Torrington, Connecticut, hard-working street laborer accumulated $18,000 during the course of his life, and you might be interested to know that he left it all to the “Very Reverend” Matthias Faust to be used in saying masses for the repose of the souls of the poor. This is the more pathetic not only because the dead are dead and already in absolute repose, but because of the way this money was earned. The York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Herald-Tribune,</span><span class="font5"> that ever-faithful servant of the Hierarchy, explains that the money will be split up among thousands of Franciscans to buy 18,000 masses, and that “the offering for a low mass is $1, which pays for the supplies that the priest uses”. The supplies, it should be explained, consist of a little cracker and a swallow of wine for the priest, of a possible total value of one cent. The remaining 99c is pure velvet. If you heard about the Franciscans in Germany and your memory is good you can guess about how much influence any performances by sodomites would have with the Almighty, Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Writing from one of the largest cities in New England, Hazel Henderson, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have had a wonderful time in this section, as you may judge from the enclosed subscription orders. One is for the mayor and one for the chief of police. The mayor has been on our back-call files for six months. I had hard work to reach him at first, but found him to be a person of good-will toward Jehovah God. He has taken some books and many booklets, has subscribed for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font3"> and I am welcome to call on him often. He is a Protestant. As to the chief, he is a Catholic, but is a very broad-minded man. He also is on our permanent back-call list. When I called for his subscription he told me he would never bother us unless we actually started trouble. He also told me I did not call often enough, and that he hoped I would call often, and he would give me his time and attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The People Catching On</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work of Jehovah’s witnesses is helping the common people to catch on to the hypocrisy of the clergy. There is no limit to the conceit of the clergy and the preposterous things that they expect the people to believe. Thus, in an address at Boston, the Jesuit “Rev. Father” Richard J. Hegarty made this absurd statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When a baby is born into the world, it lives with merely human lite. Take that same infant to the font and watch the priest as he pours the water and says the words of baptism.. The first channel of divine life streams into the child’s soul. The child now rejoices in a second nativity, for now it is a child of God. Little boys and girls grow up. They need special strength to fight the temptations of the world. In confirmation the bishop taps for them another channel of divine life and the children become strong with the strength of Christ. If boys and girls die a bodily death, there is no recall from the grave. When mortal sin kills the life of God in the soul, in the sacrament of penance another channel of divine life restores to it divine vitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Providence </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Visitor</span><span class="font5"> says that when you kiss the ring of your own bishop you get down on your right knee, but when you kiss the ring of some other bishop you don’t have to kneel. All you have to do is to bow down' low. In other words, the people of Providence don’t have to kneel to the “Most Kev.” James Cassidy, D.D., bishop of Fall River, Massachusetts, which is almost next door to Providence. Mr. Cassidy, realizing that many of the American Legion are Catholics, recently denounced the American Legion convention held in his city. He stated that they had left the public park in a condition “worse than any circus ground ever abandoned by any circus” and that during the convention “no woman who really realized the danger dared to venture into the city”. The “Most Reverend” ought to know: it is his baby; and if Jehovah’s witnesses were to put on a big drive in Fall River to tell the truth about the racket he himself is operating, like as not the American Legion would be the first tools that the bishop would call on to make trouble for the decent Americans and the law-abiding Americans that go to make up the witnesses, and that are so opposite to the American Legion in cleanliness and honesty and true patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Helping Brother Catholics</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Experience shows that those who have been Catholics are most helpful to their brother Catholics when, the eyes of their understanding opening, they begin to sense something of the length and breadth and height and depth of the love of God which passeth human understanding. (Ephesians 1:18) This is brought to mind by a communication of A. L. MacDonald, of Massachusetts, in which he mourned the failure of the Boston </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font5"> to tell more than one side of a story for fear that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy might be grieved. It is a fixed rule of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy that their church must never be mentioned except in praise, no matter how black or filthy its record. This is a sorrow to MacDonald. He told about a hearing before the Cambridge, Massachusetts, School Committee, regarding the expulsion of little Mary Richards for refusal to salute the flag. The dialogue was between MacDonald and Carr and was treated with great timidity by the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American,</span><span class="font5"> but as it is of public interest it is given below as it occurred:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">MacDonald: On behalf’ of Mary and her father we desire to express our gratitude to the Cambridge School Board for arranging this hearing.- In these days when the rights of individuals are so trampled upon and denied in totalitarian countries, how thankful we all should be that we are living in a country whose laws are so jealous for the rights of individuals that even a little child, expelled from school, is guaranteed by law a hearing before her peers. We feel that this board has a friendly sympathy and interest in Mary and her problem, as it is inherent in all Americans to love children, and especially to have love and respect for children who have the courage of their convictions, even if we do not agree with them. Because of the publicity given the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses in recent years, we feel that this board is convinced that Jehovah’s witnesses are honest, sincere and law-abiding individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Carr: We are not convinced of any such thing (holding up a book .Enemies).. This is their publication. Do you call this law-abiding? Page 190: “The foregoing evidence proves conclusively that religion is a racket, and that those who practice it for gain are racketeers, and that the chief ones among all racketeers are those who make up and form the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, who rob the people of their money,” etc. Page 192: “The Roman Catholic Hierarchy have .‘houses’ all over the earth within which they practice fraud and deceit, carrying on their racket,” etc. Is that law-abiding? Page 274: “The harlot, that is, the Roman Catholic organization, goes up and down the earth with her instruments of sound under the leadership of the Devil and in opposition to the faithful followers of Jesus Christ.” Is that law-abiding? I call it scandalous libel. (And on and on, in indignation, he read all through the book, punctuating each reading by asking, “Is that law-abiding?”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">MacDonald; You have asked the right man, and you will get an answer in love and without partiality. You see, John F. Fitzgerald, exmayor of the city of Boston, is my third cousin, and all my cousins on that side are Catholics, and naturally I have a great love for the Catholic people. I am glad you have brought up this matter of the Catholic church, for while it apparently has nothing to do with flag saluting, every one in this auditorium now has t^e opportunity to see just what the sore spot is. You have let the cat out of the bag. This same thing happened at the State House in Boston, at a hearing appointed before a committee appointed by the State Legislature, on the proposed bill to amend the Massachusetts State Flag Salute law, so that children who had conscientious objections to saluting the flag might be excused. Mr. Judson for Jehovah’s witnesses had just finished his plea in favor of the amendment when Mr. Melley, the member of the House of Representatives from Chelsea, put this question to Mr. Judson: “Do you subscribe to the statement of your Society that the Catholic Church is Public Enemy No. 1 ?” Mr. Judson replied, “I do.” Mr. Melley, the member of the House of Representatives, said, “That’s all I want to know. In other words, if you insist on such a statement about my church, I am sitting on the Committee and will see that your children continue to salute the flag or else—.” Now here it is again tonight. Because the Catholic Church can not refute these plain statements of Jehovah’s witnesses, and because they cannot stop the parents, they are actually holding their children as hostages, taking it out on innocent children. Now as to the matter of legality, it is perfectly legal and is also law-abiding in America to criticize the Catholic Church. The church in these United States is not untouchable. In this country you can criticize the mayor, the Boston Elevated, or the president and still be law-abiding. The Supreme Court has recently ruled, in the Cantwell case, that it is perfectly law-abiding to criticize the doctrines and actions of the Catholic church, even if it angers members of that church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mr. Carr: Do you call the language used in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> book law-abiding ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">MacDonald: Those statements are quotations from the Catholic Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Carr: The Catholic Bible says that about the Church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">MacDonald: You probably refer to the statement about the Catholic Church’s being a harlot. That’s from the Catholic Bible. Take the prophet Nahum, for instance. In the Catholic Bible he speaks about the bloody harlot that sells out nations and families through her whoredoms. You and I have got to get rid of this clannishness and face the truth. Here is a clipping from the Boston </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Globe:</span><span class="font3"> “German Catholics Urged to Pray for Victory of Reich. Berlin, April 3. (AP) German Catholics in several dioceses are admonished to pray for 'victory in the German struggle for liberty’ in new prayer books containing for the first time special 'war prayers’. A foreword asks the faithful to say prayers especially for 'the protection of our courageous soldiers in the enemy’s country’ ”. Do you realize that right now, while we sit here, hordes of Nazis are thundering against the Greeks and British to destroy those two democracies, and the German army has the prayers of the Catholic prayer book for their victory? You are offended because the Catholic religion is referred to as a racket. Do you know of any meaner racket than the “Purgatory” racket, which takes money to get poor creatures out of a place that doesn’t exist ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chairman, Mr. James Fitzgerald, put an end to the argument, and to his credit he said that he had allowed Mr. Carr to make remarks that were not relevant to the subject, and for that reason he permitted Mr. MacDonald to reply, but that this must now stop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An interesting question was later asked of little Mary by a member of the School Committee, “Weren’t you baptized at St. Catherine’s ?” The answer was “Yes”. Also, her father, Mr. Rich-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSOLATION </span><span class="font5">ards, was asked, ‘‘What were you before you became a Jehovah?” and the answer was, “A Roman Catholic.” Another interesting episode was when MacDonald asked Mrs. Macklin, the school teacher, of what the opening exercises in the school consisted. She replied, “Singing, reading the Bible, and the flag salute.” When asked if she would excuse a little child from the Bible-reading exercise, if he so requested because of ‘religious’ scruples, she replied that she did not know what she would do, as that occasion had never arisen. That gave witness Fowler the opportunity to read from the Massachusetts General Laws, chapter 71, section 31, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Bible to be read ih the schools.</span><span class="font5"> A portion of the Bible shall be read daily in the public schools, without written note or oral comment, but a pupil whose parent or guardian informs the teacher in writing that he has conscientious scruples against it shall not be required to read from any particular version or to take any personal part in the reading. The School Committee shall not purchase or use in the schools schoolbooks favoring any particular religious sect.” This gave a splendid opportunity to show the Board the inconsistency of permitting a child, because of scruples, to be excused from the reading of God’s Holy Bible, but a child could not be excused from participation in a man-made ceremony of saluting a man-made emblem, even if he sincerely believed that doing of it is a violation of God’s commandment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Newspapers on the Spot</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The newspapers are in a tight spot. Many of them feel that it is a matter of life or death with them to stand by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and that means that they must take sides against Jehovah’s witnesses. In other words, they must line up either with the “sheep” or with the “goats”, and are doing that very thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Reverend” Stanley High, Noroton, Connecticut, feels that he must do what he can to make Jehovah’s witnesses appear odious to their fellow-Americans. Many will be interested in what judgment was visited upon him for his malicious article in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post.</span><span class="font5"> An Anchorage, Kentucky, family, Mr. and Mrs. William C. Moorehead, sued Mr. High and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post</span><span class="font5"> for $40,000 damages for that story. The Mooreheads contend that in the article “Armageddon Incorporated” (September 17, 1940) “Reverend” High attacked and ridiculed Jehovah’s witnesses, and in it printed a picture of the Mooreheads beneath which was the caption : ‘Witnesses look like average Americans, as, in fact, they are. A typical Louisville family of witnesses.” Then the Mooreheads go on to say that they are not Jehovah’s witnesses, and never were, and that the article exposes the organization’s membership to ridicule, contempt and disgrace, and so caused the Mooreheads to be humiliated, embarrassed and their reputation damaged to the amount stated. Well, it’s “Reverend” High’s baby; let him nurse it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Almost all newspapers, at one time or another, take dirty cracks at Jehovah’s witnesses, because it is so pleasing to the Hierarchy. For example, the Boston </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font5"> which knows better than to use such a headline, had this mean caption to a mean and un-American as well as illegal performance, “Put Jehovahs over City Line: Police Order Four out of Roxbury.” In America no police have a right to do anything of that sort. The article gave the credit of this piece of bigotry to police lieutenant Michael T. Clougherty. He was, of course, trying to please the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> isn’t wholly unfair. It had a letter from Frank A. Ray in which Mr. Ray said to the editor:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">saw in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font3"> recently an account of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">little girl who refuses to salute the flag. Who am I, or any other man, that we should determine what a man should hold conscientiously ? As for myself, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I do not believe some</span><span class="font3"> things taught by Jehovah’s witnesses, but I know them to be honest, upright, good citizens, believing and practicing what our glorious flag represents: liberty and justice for all. Those people say to salute any flag is a violation of the second commandment of the Decalogue. Should we persecute them for their belief? I answer No, and if there is a law to compel people to salute any flag it should be erased immediately. Let us remember that we are living in the year 1940; and not in the Dark Ages, when liberty of speech and even liberty of thought was prohibited. In persecuting those people we violate what the flag stands for: liberty and justice for all. Sometimes the persecuted is wrong, but always the persecutor is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Two Common-Sense Editorials</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here and there is an editor who has both courage and common sense, sees the issue, and is not afraid or ashamed to put down in black and white what he honestly thinks. Two such editorials follow. The first is from the Quincy </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Patriot Ledger,</span><span class="font5"> and the second, from the Harwich </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Independent.</span><span class="font5"> Both of these are Massachusetts papers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Quincy has two flag salute cases on its hands. It has a teacher and a ten-year-old student who refuse to salute. Both of them apparently are good citizens except for this refusal to salute the flag. The teacher has been suspended from her position; the boy is not allowed to attend class. As the state gets more and more of such cases, it becomes increasingly obvious that some kind of policy must be adopted in regard to the religious groups that cross the paths of civil authority. Shall we deny these people of all civil rights? Shall we send them to concentration camps? Shall we jail them for violation of the civil code? Shall we ignore them and let them go merrily on their way ? If we decide to prosecute them to the full extent of the law we would be forced to do likewise with other nonconformists and prevent such things as the conscientious objection to bearing arms, a right enjoyed for years by the Quakers. We have an increasingly serious issue building up, and it should be settled as quickly as possible before it gets troublesome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Most of us thrill at the very sight of the Stars and Stripes, yet there are some people who believe themselves to be good citizens, yet are opposed to saluting anything. It is on moral grounds that the parents of the Falmouth boy object to having their son salute at all. They are sincere in their belief that it is not necessary to prove his patriotism or love of country, especially by saluting the flag every day. The Falmouth school committee believe they are right in enforcing their interpretation of the law which requires the flag salute in the public schools of Massachusetts. Many others in town are just as firm in their belief that the school committee is doing more than the law expects in refusing to permit him to remain in school and receive his education. As we see it, the youngster, in following the commands of his parents, believes he is a dutiful and obedient son. He is in the process of learning to think for himself, and until he has a’mind sufficiently developed to know what he personally prefers to do in such matters we believe he is justified in listening to his parents. We wonder how much better citizen he will make if he is forced to do something contrary to the wishes of his parents. He cannot have as much respect for the flag if he is forced to salute it against his conscience, and the only good it can do him or any immature child is to do so with a genuine thrill of patriotism. We do not believe that compulsory saluting can breed patriotism. That comes only from within the breast and, to be of value, must be genuine and come from a heart so grateful that it comes under the protection of the Constitution and the Stars and Stripes that it thrills with real American pride at every opportunity to<sub>z</sub>renew the pledge so sacred to all Americans. We do not believe that patriotism can be legislated into any human being, and a false salute might actually breed contempt and ultimate hatred for the flag. The Falmouth school officials ought to exercise American tolerance in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Real Americans Cherish Liberty</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Real Americans cherish liberty, and the best of them do not hestitate to say so. Zechariah Chafee, Harvard Law School professor, has been studying freedom of speech for 21 years. Let him have the final say in this matter of the rights of Jehovah’s witnesses in New England. In an interview in the Boston </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font5"> March 9, 1941, he said something that true Americans should ponder:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">.1 think our Supreme Court will stand firm for protection of freedom of speech. I think the Jehovah’s witnesses’ decision against the pupils who did not salute the flag was a special case. No utterance was involved, just a patriotic ceremony. Still I think it was most unfortunate and unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As I’ve thought this thing over for twenty years, it’s grown on me how important'open discussion is in making the kind of country you want to live in, in contrast to a country where neighbors spy on each other and everybody looks around before he speaks his mind. Arthur Garfield Hays tells a story of an old slave who met his former master long after the Civil War. The master asked him if he was as well off as before his freedom. The slave had to admit his clothes were frayed, his room leaked and he fared poorly for meals. “Well, wouldn’t you rather be a slave than live in this kind of freedom?” the master asked. “No, suh,” was the answer, “there’s a looseness about this freedom that I likes.” “Well, I think a lot of us feel that way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Penalize Godliness?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">❖ Some person signing himself merely “M. C.” writes an interesting letter to the Bridgeport (Conn.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> October 7, 1941, regarding the dismissal from school, of a thirteen-year-old boy for conscientious refusal to salute the flag, and sets forth the following excellent reasons why such act by a school board is unChristian totalitarianism in reprehensible defiance of God’s law. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To begin with, the parents of the boy say they are devoted to our country and respect its flag. Hence, the question to be asked is: What clearly is the motive behind the refusal of the boy to salute the flag? The answer is— Conscientious Godliness. But as there is scarcely a market for this aforesaid quality in our times, I fear such motive will not be viewed or examined with due and proper consideration—and in any way under the blazing but right way, to wit, the Bible, which contains God’s infallible word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Who is properly constituted to be an arbiter in this matter? Hardly mere man. When this matter is calmly and candidly considered in the light-of the Scriptures, an entirely different side of the argument is at once seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These Bible facts are not brought out by the newspapers. These facts, indisputable as they are, would incline one to see this model student in the true light and would help us to conclude more wisely on the subject, thereby being fair to all. In a government of libertyloving people, such as ours, a person is entitled to conscientious conclusions on all things and is unique in this respect when contrasted with dictatorial nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Liberty is an American possession and is cherished today more than ever before. In fact and actuality this right is the very principle of which the flag is emblematic, and, therefore, should be held dear to all real Americans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To cause a young school lad to violate his sincere convictions—in America—now—or anytime—is an incongruity not easily digested by Americans unless they have a constitution that would put to shame that of a rhinoeerous—to be sure. And when I come to think of it, that it is a young boy so treated, why, my trusty pen fails me to say more except that he should most certainly be given the benefit of the Bill of Rights’ guarantee of complete religious freedom, before it is too late. The boy is an 'honor student’-—and, in these dark and dangerous days, such a student should not be led to look upon his Creator without proper respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every day we read about public prayers directed toward the Most High for relief and guidance because of the prevailing abominations practiced by ungodly rulers. When publie-school officials are'confronted with this flag-saluting problem and similar cases, then let them turn to God in this hour of war and rumors of war—men’s hearts failing them from fear of the things coming to pass—these conditions aggravated by sway of brute compulsion; and by the free exercise of free men’s minds correctly and studiously applied to the Lord’s consoling revelations, and thereby granting to harmless children all that we Americans love and hold dear—and above all, “Let Freedom Ring!”—all four of them— for all. It cannot be otherwise if this nation puts its 'trust in God,’ as its nickels and dimes say it does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the school board convenes for a hearing to argue the case of the Clark lad, it will do well to consider the inexorable and unchallengeable law of God, voiced by the inspired psalmist, David, to wit (Psalm 2) : ‘Be wise, therefore, 0 ye kings, dictators, presidents: be instructed, ye judges, officials of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear and trembling, lest He be angry, and ye perish in the way when His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that fear Him and put their trust in Him.’ “Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The grim joke in this case is that the school board banned this thirteen-year-old boy from school without ever enacting any requirement that pupils must salute the flag. Ephraim E. Sinn, a member of the school board, made this statement and objected to the arbitrary action of the other members of the board. Mr. Sinn is a lawyer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Barring a Child from School</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Referring to the barring of a sevenyear-old child from school because she loves God and cannot disobey Him by saluting any flag, the “Reverend” Robert Y. Johnson, pastor of Elm Street Congregational church, Southbridge, Massachusetts, when asked his opinion concerning the exclusion of the child from school, made the following statement :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To force a person to salute the flag whose conscience forbids it is a denial of one thing for which our flag stands. In my opinion this child should be encouraged and permitted to express her love for America in other ways, ways that do not violate her religious training. An American is defined not by his conformity to outward ceremonies, but by his actual devotion in daily life to the ideals of freedom and equality. How many of us who salute the flag do so, always, with clean hands ? I am sure that one way to increase the love of Americanism among us all would be to show toward this child something of the graciousness of Lincoln, also his sense of humor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“Interfaith” in New Haven</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The New Haven </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Register</span><span class="font5"> contains a huge advertisement (10 inches by 16 inches) stating: “New Haven churches invite you. World-wide communion Sunday, October 5; a testimony of unbroken spiritual fellowship across the barriers of hate and prejudice; join in common penitence; add your faith and prayer. Only united spiritual forces can rebuild a just and permanent world. Synagogues observe Yom Kippur Tuesday evening, September 30; day of atonement Wednesday, October 1! Auspices: New Haven Council of Churches; New Haven Interfaith Committee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Interfaith Committee is composed of Catholic clergymen, Jewish rabbis and representatives of some but not all of the 210 varieties of Protestant clergy. What is it that all these have in common? Is it faith in “the only name under heaven, given among men” whereby any may approach to Jehovah God? Not at all. Is it faith in Jehovah’s Kingdom, for which Jesus taught His followers to pray? No. Is it a belief that Jesus alone can and will “make all things new”? No. The clergy expect to do that themselves; and as far as the Jews are concerned, they expect to do it without any help whatever from Jesus, whom they do not own as their Savior and Lord. Is there any one thing that all these diverse religionists steadfastly hate ? Yes; just one thing. What is that? It is the pure truth of God’s Word, as taught from door to door by Jehovah’s witnesses. Themselves all guilty of teaching subversive doctrines, unscriptural doctrines, and unreasonable and preposterous doctrines, they seek to justify themselves in their iniquity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">South America</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Walked 20,000 Miles</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ A Venezuelan boy, Julio C. Berriz-beita, finished a walk of 20,000 miles and sailed for home after hoofing it into 47 of the 48 states of the United States, and much of Mexico, Central America and Colombia. He started with five friends, but after one of them had been killed by hostile Indians, the four others gave up the trip and Berrizbeita went on alone. He left home with $50 in cash and a guitar. The latter was his means of livelihood. He sang and played in hotels and night clubs along the road. Fifteen years of age when he started, he was 19 when he returned, and with a fund of information that will be a joy to him and his friends for the rest of his life. Much of the way he was able to follow the Pan American Highway, the 16,847-mile route of which is now largely completed. He wore out 50 pairs of shoes on his four-year journey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">German Legation in Bolivia</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The Bolivian Congress is not able to figure out why it should require more than sixty employees at the German legation in La Paz to look after the business between Bolivia and Germany when there is not a particle of business to look after. It is simple enough. The sixty are merely perfecting plans for taking over the country, as soon as Germany finishes up with the Eastern Hemisphere, if, as and when she gets away with that still rather large job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Japanese Schools in Brazil</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The Brazilian Department of Education discovered 78 Japanese schools, within barricaded enclosures, where Japanese is taught from Japanese books, Japanese flags decorate the schoolroom and the picture of Japan’s emperor adorns the walls. In some of the schools books were found which explained how to make bombs and airplanes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Only Portuguese Papers in Brazil</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The Brazilian Government, following up its closure of 2,000 schools that did not employ Portuguese teachers, has decreed that all papers published in Brazil hereafter must be in the Portuguese tongue. This affects 180 newspapers and periodicals which have heretofore been published in German, Italian and Japanese. The newspapers of the world are a great source of danger to the common people of every land. They are for the Hierarchy and always against Labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Air Mails to South America</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ It is now possible for businessmen to send air-mail letters from points in the United States to Buenos Aires and get answers back in a business week. By steamer this would take 30 to 32 days. The two Pan American systems operate 26,000 miles of air routes over South America, while the German and Italian lines operated some 21,762 miles, operating under various names and well supplied with planes and parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">An Attempt to Promote Homesteading</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ In a praiseworthy attempt to promote homesteading, Brazil is now making marriage loans, the repayments of which are spread over twenty years. In addition, there is a reduction of 10 percent of the initial sum upon the birth of each child. When the child is ten years of age there is a further reduction of 10 percent if the parents can give proof that the child is receiving proper care and education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Japanese and German Schools Closed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ In the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, 78 Japanese schools were closed because the children, born in Brazil of Japanese parents, were taught all about Japan but nothing about Brazil. Two or three years ago 200 German schools were closed for the same reason. There are said to be 600,000 Japanese in Peru alone.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Spain</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Franco Stands by Hitler</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ In 1937 Franco the Butcher made the statement: “Spain will follow the structure of the totalitarian states, such as Germany and Italy. She will adopt corporative forms, for which the greater part of the formulas can be found in our own country, and it will exterminate the liberal institutions which have poisoned the people.” This promised extermination is on the way. Passengers passing through the Canary Islands (from which place Franco flew the British-owned airplane that started the rebellion against the Spanish Republic) state that if they throw a piece of old bread to the children on the docks, they fight for it like wild dogs. Meantime, Spain has shown its undying appreciation of Hitler for helping to ruin the land by acting as the agent for supplying Germany with toluene for its T.N.T., and cotton linters and pulp for high explosives, and by the millions of pounds at that. The governments that made it possible for Franco to pull off his stunt in Spain know all about this traffic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Spain’s New “Scholars”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Now that the liberty-lovers have all been killed off, Spain is back about where it was 400 years ago. This is demonstrated in a new book put out by a doctor of divinity and a professor of geology and mineralogy in which they dissect the book of Genesis. According to their calculations the first epochal day lasted 20,000,000 years; the second, 2,000,000; the third, 1,500,000,000; the fourth, 160,-000,000; the fifth, 70,000,000; and the sixth, 30,000,000. They think mankind is now in the seventh creative day, and in that they are correct, and it is the only one of their statements that is correct. At this point, and as showing how much more beautiful is truth than error, consider the following from page 24 of Judge Rutherford’s book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Creation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures divide the creative work into seven days, or periods of time. While God could have done this work in seven days of twenty-four hours each, had he so desired, the facts show that he did not do so, but that.the term “day” is a period of time covering many centuries. This creative period has no reference to a twenty-four-hour day. Since the Lord has divided the creative periods into seven, it is reasonable that these creative days, or periods of time, are of equal length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The law of God later given to man provided for a week of seven days each, each day being twenty-four hours long. Each of these days being of the same length, it is reasonable that the seven creative days or periods would each cover the same period of time. The Scriptures, together with subsequent facts which are indisputable proofs beyond a doubt, indicate that the seventh day or epoch of creation, mentioned in Genesis, covers a period of seven thousand years of our time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If then we assume that each of the creative days was of the same length, we must conclude that the period of time that elapses from the beginning of the creative work to the end thereof is a period of forty-nine thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Honors from Bloodstained Hands</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Although both Britain and America are still appeasing, General Franco with cash loans, food, cotton, and other materials, the Spanish dictator is now recognized as another Fascist enemy of democracy. All but the Hitlerite and other Fascist war correspondents in Spain reported authentic atrocities committed by Franco. H. R. Knickerbocker, of the proFranco Hearst press, wrote how he saw grandmotherly women murdered by Franco officers, but Hearst editors changed the story so readers could not tell which side committed these atrocities. Catholic war correspondents of Libre Beige, La Croix, and German newspapers admitted Franco murders.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In Fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rocky Mountain States</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Indians Want Obedience to Laws</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The Kootenai tribes of Indians in Montana want Uncle Sam to live up to his own laws. Many years ago, the Indians made a treaty by which they were to have exclusive hunting privileges in certain territory, and now the white men, with whom the treaty was made, want to make laws for the Indians. The situation seems to be that the white man does not live up to the law (of the treaty) but wants the Indian to live up to the law which is binding only upon the white man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Six Niagaras in One</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ It seems hard to visualize a water power six times as efficient as that at Niagara Falls; but that is the Grand Coulee dam in the state of Washington, now completed two years ahead of schedule. Standing at its full height of 550 feet, this dam is the greatest structure built by man. The lake created is 151 miles long, extending to the Canadian border. Irrigation will be provided for an area of 2,000 square miles in the center of the state of Washington, all rich land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Parachute Jumpers in Washington</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Don’t be disheartened. There are parachute jumpers in the United States, but they are engaged in a good work: forest fire extermination. They land anywhere, guiding themselves somewhat to a preferred landing spot. They,are equipped with radiophones, which enable them to keep in touch with the aviators that carried them. These useful citizens are characteristically referred to in the state of Washington as “smoke-jumpers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Oregon Loggers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Oregon loggers are, in the language of the woods, also called by the artistic names of “jungle-buzzard”, “timberbeast,” “timberhound,” “woods savage,” “brushcat,” and “lumberjack”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bunker Hill Mine</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The Bunker Hill gold mine, in the state of Idaho, was discovered by a donkey, which pawed away the sod beneath its feet and brought a rich ledge of gold to light. Several million dollars’ worth of gold was taken out of the earth as a result of that streak of luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who would think that the paw-of a donkey might make all the difference in the world in the fortunes of many, many families, and indeed of a whole section of a state!Think of the possible vanity that donkey’s paw brought into play.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Matanuska Experiment</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ It is said that of the 235 families located at Matanuska, Alaska, 35 have quit and returned to the United States, even though the government has so far expended about $18,000 per family to get the settlement established. Winters are cold, but in the six weeks of summer, when the sun shines 18 or more hours per day, potatoes, string beans and peas will grow as w<sup>T</sup>ell as anywhere. Alaska is now a scene of great activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Shearing Corrals in Utah</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ It used to be that the sheep were driven in from the ranges to be sheared; but not now. The shearers go out where the sheep are grazing, take the portable shearing outfits, woven-wire fencing and clippers along and do the clipping in jig time without interfering with feeding operations at all. And both the range and the sheep are conserved, say the Utah sheepherders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Talk About Water Power</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Talk about water power: the pipes that lead from Boulder Dam to the electric turbine generators are thirty feet in diameter and three feet thick, fabricated by welding. Every inch of eighty miles of these huge pipes was critically examined with X rays, looking for weak spots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Science</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Things at the Door</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ We see new methods for making three-dimension photographs, and the prints of these photos do not require the old-fashioned stereoscope to view them. We see a new synthetic rubber made from gases formerly wasted in oil refineries —a rubber even more stable than natural rubber. And we see a new chemical treatment that makes hardwood soft and plastic while the wood is hot, and then permits a return to natural stiffness and strength upon cooling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Out of our laboratories have recently come liquids obtained from ordinary wood that will likely give us a new raw material for an infant chemical industry; glycerine produced from petroleum; a method by which coal and oil can be made in the laboratory from plant carbohydrates, thus accomplishing in a few hours what has taken nature millions of years to achieve; a computing machine for multiplying and dividing complex numbers—constructed largely of telephone relays and switches; television by radio in natural color, using a single channel; a successful method of transmitting television views from an airplane to the ground; a “pocket size” emergency oxygen inhalation apparatus for parachute descents from high altitudes; a vanishing cream that protects against poison ivy; and a remarkable diet for humans that will provide adequate nourishment for a year at a cost of less than $3, except for the deficiency of one vitamin which can be provided by adding tomato juice.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Industrial Power, </span><span class="font5">August, 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Sweet Mystery of Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ For reasons of His own, and for reasons the scientists have not yet learned, the Creator placed in every human organism minute quantities of aluminum, arsenic, boron, bromine, nickel, silicon, tin, and vanadium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ingenuities of the X Ray</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Maintenance men for the Detroit Edison Company, to be on the safe side, had to condemn and replace many electriclight poles which seemed to be rotting but later proved to be perfectly sound. Now an X-ray machine mounted on a truck peers into the poles where they stand, determines their condition, and thus saves the company a lot of poles and a lot of money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">California and Arizona citrus-fruit growers use 100 X-ray machines to sort their crop. With them, after one severe frost, California salvaged 2,000,000 boxes of oranges which otherwise would have been condemned. The machines had cost $250,000; the oranges they saved for market brought $7,500,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In testing metals, X ray shows up interior bubbles and cracks otherwise never suspected until some machine smashes up under stress. All airplane parts subject to strain are X-rayed. Navy inspectors, X-raying a turbine for a destroyer, discovered that a contractor had filled a crack in a casting with a metal plug and hidden the trick with a plating of metal. All steam tubing for warships is examined by X ray; bursting steam lines mean horrible death for men below decks, and might cripple a ship in battle. One of the biggest X-ray jobs ever tackled was the examination of 80 miles of welds on Boulder Dam penstocks.—Webb Waldron, in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Readers’ Digest,</span><span class="font5"> October, 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Declining Infant Mortality</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Studies of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company reveal that infant mortality has declined by 45 percent over a period of twenty years, and the death rate among children from one to fourteen years of age has decreased by 60 percent. The improvement was much accelerated in the last decade over that of the one previous.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Crime in the United States</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Every twenty-two seconds, hour after hour, day after day, a crime of desperate proportions—robbery, assault, burglary, rape, kidnaping, manslaughter, murder —was committed in the United States. Over a twelve-month period nearly one million five hundred thousand such major crimes were committed—a crime against one out of every eighty-four American citizens, affecting one out of every sixteen American homes. Thirteen thousand five hundred of our citizens were murdered. That was at the rate of thirty-seven per day. Sixty thousand were robbed and over forty-five thousand assaults were committed last year. And the menace is growing every day. The science of crime prevention, in spite of all the, strides we have made, is still in the horseback stage of its development. —Homer S. Cummings, United States attorney general, 1933-1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Churchianity and Gambling</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The Institute of Public Opinion undertakes to ascertain what the public think on any question. It recently made a study of who favor and who do not favor the churches’ raising money by lotteries and games of chance. The figures follow:</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">Favor Oppose</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Catholics &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;42%</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Where the Money Goes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ A survey of 14,469 wage-earning families in forty-two cities discloses that of the average income for the group of $1,515 the sum of $508 a year went for food; $367 a year, for housing, including heat and light; $160, for clothing; and $87 a year, for the purchase, operation and maintenance of an automobile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Poverty Kills Babies</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Studies of the United States Government show that in families with an annual income of less than $500, out of every 1,000 babies born, 168 die, while in families with an income of $3,000 or more, out of every 1,000 babies born, only 30 die. There is an offset. The baby in the family of the poor comes to know that he must “toil terribly” to rise above the station in which he was born. He learns to work, to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">To Keep Sane, Go South</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Your best chance to keep sane is to go south. Life is easier there and there are fewer mental cases than in any other section of the United States. The East is harder than the West: it is harder to keep warm in cold weather, and to get something to eat in any kind of weather. Washington, D.C., is the hardest place in the country. Trying to figure out what the politicians will do next has an unsettling effect on the mental balance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">More Boys than Girls</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Always there are more boys born than there are girls, and it is generally held that food has something to do with it. If food in the family is plentiful there are girls, and if food is»scarce it is more likely there will be boys, bread-winners. Others claim that wars bring a surplus of boys, to replace those cut off in death. A recent conclusion is that surplus vital ity means surplus boys. Who knows?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Too Much Pressure</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ If our institutions for the mentally afflicted are overcrowded, it is because an expensive and inefficient government is bringing so much pressure to bear on the individual that no small number become mad. Would it not be wiser to relieve the pressure and so do away with the need for these institutions?—Fred L. La Rochelle, M.D., in New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lost Books of the Bible (?)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Under the intriguing title “The Lost Books of the Bible” and the “Forgotten Books of Eden” there is being circulated a book which claims to contain fascinating information withheld from the Bible. The book is supposed to give information about Adam and Eve and the boyhood of Jesus, and other things that have been “suppressed”. The advertisement says that “an enlightened clergy has permitted—yes, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">recommended</span><span class="font5">—that they be released”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is nothing new about these “lost” books, inasmuch as they were never lost. They were never a part of the holy Scriptures written under inspiration, but miserable counterfeit writings, the product of human imagination. They are “apocryphal”, though not among the books generally known as the “Apocrypha”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The better known “Apocryphal” books are all included in the Roman Catholic version of the Bible, but were not a part of the Hebrew Scriptures, nor ever circulated as a part of the Bible by the Protestant Bible Societies. These latter books are all added to what is known as the “Old Testament”.—See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> No. 452.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Apocryphal” books are bad enough, but these “lost” books are even worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Refused an Education</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ At the Mary Keppel high school, Alhambra, California, Joan Lawrence, sixteen years of age, .was suspended from school because she refused to undress and bathe in community showers with other girls. This seems a strange reason for refusing a modest girl an education. The probable facts in the case are that the Mary Keppel high school is not a public school at all, but a parochial institution of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Religious Caterpillars</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Processionary caterpillars feed upon pine needles. They move through the trees in a long procession, one leading and the others following—each with his eyes half-closed and his head snugly fitted against the rear extremity of his predecessor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jean-Henri Fabre, the great French naturalist, after patiently experimenting with a group of these caterpillars, finally enticed them to the rim of a large flowerpot, where he succeeded in getting the first one connected up with the last one, thus forming a complete circle which started moving around in a procession which had neither beginning nor end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The naturalist expected that after a while they would catch on to the joke— get tired of their useless march and start off in some new direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But not so. Through sheer force of habit, the living, creeping circle kept moving around the rim of the pot— around and around, keeping the same relentless pace for seven days and seven nights—and would doubtless have continued longer had it not been for sheer exhaustion and ultimate starvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Incidentally, an ample supply of food was close at band, and plainly visible, but it was outside the range of the circle, so they continued along tbe beaten path.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They were following instinct—habit— custom—tradition—precedent—past experience—“standard.practice”—or whatever you may choose to call it, but they were following it blindly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They mistook activity for accomplishment. They meant well—but they got nowhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The motto of these caterpillars was, “Give us more religion.” Some of them were Methodists, some Baptists, some Presbyterians, some Catholics, but all were agreed on the one subject that what they all needed was more religion.</span></p>

The publication of this letter here will also offset, in some degree at least, the distorted statements on the subject that have appeared in the press. These distortions will not be dignified by particular mention. The letter herewith is sufficient reproof. The numerous telegrams received by the </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Society</span><span class="font5"> on this occasion from other zealous witnesses are an'added testimony to the Truth, and some of these are inserted following the letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">January 9, 1942 To all Lovers of The Theocracy :</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On January 8, 1942, our beloved brother, J. F. Rutherford, faithfully finished his earthly course as a warrior for The Theocratic Government and a minister of the Word of God. Knowing of your deep concern and of your prayers to God for him ever since his serious illness prior to the Detroit Convention of July, 1940, we hasten to notify you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was Brother Rutherford’s desire to “die fighting with his boots on”; and this he did. The Lord graciously spared him to complete the report of the 1942 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses,</span><span class="font3"> therein showing that the greatest witness ever given had been accomplished and that the year’s distribution of books and booklets reached the grand total of 36,030,595 copies. He always had foremost in mind to do this one thing, to declare the name of Jehovah and His kingdom, to keep covenant with Him, and to look well to the interests of his brethren.—1 John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To him it was a joy and comfort to see and know that all the witnesses of the Lord are following, not any man, but the King Christ Jesus as their Leader, and that they will move on in the work in complete unity of action, as they unanimously expressed at the Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in St. Louis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All those standing steadfast for The Theocracy will now not mourn or be disturbed or fearful, but will rejoice that their faithful fellow servant and brother has maintained his integrity toward the Lord, in sickness and in health, through evil report and through good report, and has now entered a higher field of service forever with the Lord.—2 Tim. 4: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brother Rutherford’s consistent faithful activity and unbending devotion to The Theocracy, especially, since becoming president of the Society, January 6, 1917, has been and continues to be a true and blessed example to us all as of one who ‘fought a good fight and kept the faith’ and proved worthy of a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name by Christ Jesus; and for this we give thanks to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With you keeping on working, determined, by the Lord’s grace, to let nothing stop us until the Lord’s “strange work” is finished, we are,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your brethren and fellow servants, Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TELEGRAMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Learned of Brother Rutherford’s passing and feel sad at breaking of human ties. Rejoice in knowledge that he finished his earthly journey “blameless in the day of our Lord”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s witnesses, Rochester, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We, the Highland Park [Detroit] Unit of Jehovah’s witnesses, being assembled together in service meeting, and upon hearing the announcement of Brother Rutherford’s advancing on to greater fields of activity, by Jehovah’s grace, make the following declaration: We will follow our leader and commander Christ Jesus in further and increased activities for The Theocracy, continuing to turn the battle to the gate, believing this to be a course that will now prove conclusively that we have not been following any man. We look to a continuation in following the outline of the new work as the means of accomplishing this greater activity and are confident the Lord will continue to direct His organization in His appointed way.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>State, War and Navy Departments</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">From the President’s Quarterly Report </span><span class="font5">♦ Since the beginning of the war, about $4,400,000,000 worth of goods have been exported to the British Empire. Figures alone cannot show the significance of our help. Americans may be justly proud of the way in which the tools they have forged are standing up when tested under fire. An American-made flying-boat spotted the Bismarck and American-made bombers blasted the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau , and they have helped make possible the great raids of the RAF in the Battle of Germany. In the wars of the Western Desert, fighter planes from our factories are in the vanguard of the attack and hundreds of our tanks stand ready to help rout the Nazi scourge from the African continent. The British Empire has received the bulk of our aid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This country has evolved the greatest and most efficient industrial system in history. It is our task to turn the workshops of our industry into mighty forges of war—to outbuild the aggressors in every category of modern arms. Only in this way can we build the arsenal of democracy. On this task we are now engaged with ever-increasing vigor. Planes, tanks, guns, and ships have begun to flow from our factories and yards, and the flow* will accelerate from day to day, until the stream becomes a river, and the river a torrent, engulfing this totalitarian tyranny which seeks to dominate the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Aluminum Muddle</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The more the defense picture is unfolded, the more puzzling it becomes. Take aluminum, for example. As housewives all over the nation were being urged to donate their pots and pans in a drive to alleviate a shortage of this vital defense metal, it developed that over in New Jersey there are 2,000,000 pounds of unused aluminum which is crying for buyers—enough to equip 200 medium bombers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This metal is part of a lot that had been sold to France more than a year ago, before the surrender of Paris. It is now scheduled to go to Russia as part of our program for aiding that country in its fight against Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This aluminum, it is reported, was available when aviation plants were reducing hours because of a shortage of the metal. The Reynolds Metal Company, the owner, repurchased the metal after the fall of France, reported its existence to 0PM, and offered it to the trade at a price lower than the regular list price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">About 1,000,000 pounds was disposed of in this way. Nobody apparently wanted the balance until Russia put in a bid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the other side of the continent comes an even more astounding story. The Mare Island Navy Yard, at San Francisco, offered for sale af public auction more than 3,000,000 pounds of surplus metal, including enough aluminum to build a fleet of bombers of the latest type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are no restrictions on the sale. —Decatur (Ill.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W eekly News,</span><span class="font5"> August 14, 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Years of War and of Peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ In the 3,357 years from 1496 B.C. to A.D. 1861 there were 3,117 years of war, and the balance, 7 percent, were years of peace. In the 115 years from A.D. 1700 to 1815 Britain was at war 69 years; Russia, 68 years; France, 63 years; Holland, 48 years; Portugal, 40 years; and Denmark, 28 years. In the 400 years from 1450 to 1850 Austria was at war for 234 years; England, 198 years; France, 192 years; Spain, 271 years; and Russia, 250 years. Since the world was made safe for democracy in the reign of Woodrow Wilson there has not been a year of peace on earth.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Russia</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Free Religion, but No Freedom of Worship </span><span class="font5">♦ President Roosevelt and other religionists do not see any difference between freedom of religion and freedom of worship; but the two are as far apart as the east is from the west. In fact, they are exact opposites to each another. Mr. Roosevelt drew attention to the Russian constitution, which reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to insure to citizens freedom of conscience, the church in the U. S. S. R. is separated from the state and the school from the church. Freedom of religious worship and freedom of anti-religious propaganda is recognized for all citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All this means, in actual fact and in actual practice, is that any person in Russia who is over 18 years of age, and who wishes to do so, may go to any church building that is yet standing, and where religious ceremonies are performed, and may participate, so long as he does not convey to others his belief that they should do the same. But he can go out on the street corners and orate against the idolatrous and silly and foolish practices carried on in the places where in the days of the czar the people were encouraged to worship cotton saints, and it will be all O.K. with the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Worship of Almighty God is an entirely different matter. If Mr. Roosevelt knew how to talk Russian, and if he were to visit Russia and have with him a quantity of Judge Rutherford’s books and booklets, even so small a one as the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom, the Hope of the World, </span><span class="font5">he would not be let into the country, and if he did get in, and tried to comfort some of those that mourn, he would be given short shrift by the OGPU. Jehovah’s witnesses know this to be true, for that is the way they were treated, and they thus know that freedom of worship of Almighty God is absolutely forbidden in Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Stalin has dissolved the Society of the Godless and snuffed out their publications. That is a gesture to the religionists, but it does not mean that there is freedom of worship in Russia. The only people in the earth that are interested in proclaiming the Kingdom of Jehovah God, The Theocracy, are Jehovah’s witnesses, and they are not even permitted to enter Stalin’s country. So, whatever else may be said about Russia, don’t be foolish enough or hypocritical enough to say freedom of worship is there permitted, for it is not true at all, in any sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even freedom of religion (the exact opposite of freedom of worship, and utterly antagonistic to it) is permitted only in church buildings and in private homes in Russia, and no Russian parent dares teach God’s Word to his children. This is directly contrary to the commands of Almighty God, and is all the evidence one should need that the Devil is still the Devil, as much in Russia as in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Unimaginable Devastation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The Germans say that when they entered the city of Kiev they found unimaginable devastation. The city was left a useless wreck. Railroads, bridges, power stations and waterworks were all blown up. All the machinery of production that could be moved had been taken away. The German soldiers could find no buildings in which to rest, and could not even find a drink of water. The Russian policy is to strip the earth bare as they retreat. They leave the civilian populations behind them as they move eastward, and when the Germans come in they take all the food that is left behind, declaring that the German soldiers shall eat three times a day, no matter what happens to the Russians. The concept of Pacelli-Hitler is a government by brute force in which not one little item of humanity dares show its head.</span></p><img src="g_E_19420204_files/g_E_19420204-2.png" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:75pt;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Origin of Mardi Gras</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ “Mardi Gras” means “Fat Tuesday”, and marks the day before the beginning of Lent. During the forty days of Lent Roman Catholics are supposed to fast, in remembrance of the forty days during which Jesus fasted in the wilderness, and on the day before their fast begins they devote this day to merriment, drinking, etc. The facts are that Jesus fasted in the month of October and the early part of November, and not in the spring, and Lent, if observed at all, should be observed in the fall of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Jewish year started with the new moon nearest the spring equinox. It was divided into 24 priestly courses of two weeks’ service each. The father of John the Baptist was of the eighth course, that of Abijah, and his time of service was approximately sixteen weeks after the spring equinox, or, say about July 1. At that time he was told that he was to become the father of John, and there was no delay in the fulfillment of the Divine promise. John, therefore, was born in the spring, about April 1. It was while Elisabeth was’in her sixth month, or about December 25, that Mary came to her telling of the Annunciation. Jesus, therefore, was born about October 1, as all the attendant facts attest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">John began his preaching and baptizing in the spring of the year A.D. 29, at which time he was thirty years of age, full manhood according to the Jewish law. The baptism of Jesus occurred when He was thirty. It could not have been earlier. It was on time, when “Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age”, i.e., on the date of His birth, no doubt, on or about October 1, A.D. 29. The rest is easy. The evidence is clear and explicit that Jesus’ temptation in the wilderness followed immediately after His baptism, and it therefore follows that His fast occurred in the fall of the year, and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is mixed on this subject as on every other thing it touches. It could not be otherwise. Now read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon him: and there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. And </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">immediately</span><span class="font3"> the spirit driveth him into the wilderness, and he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan.—Mark 1: 9-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would be reasonable, in Palestine, to seek immersion in a stream- October 1, because the waters would still be comfortable; but it would hardly be reasonable on December 25, now would it? Nor in February or March. Mardi Gras is just one more of the Devil’s delusions, and Lent in the spring is another one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Demands on the Little Folks</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ One of my duties was to awaken these poor, little waif children for Mass at five-thirty in the morning. If, on arising, I found that any of them had failed to get up during the night to attend to nature’s call, it was my duty to whip them with a substantial strap, which was provided for that purpose. If some of the larger boys needed this persuasive remedy for their ills, they would be taken to the attic, stripped, and some sister would be there to administer the medicine in prolific doses. With this kind of treatment, it was no wonder that we had to be continually on our guard to keep them from running away. I have known as many as six at one time to run away for two or three days, and sometimes some of them would not come back at all. —From </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Demands of Rome,</span><span class="font5"> by Elizabeth Scholfen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Foreign Conspiracy Against America</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ With regard to the more important matter of the conspiracy, I perceive with regret that the evidence which has been convincing to so many minds of the first order, and which continues daily to spread conviction of the truth of the charge I have made, is still viewed by the editors of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Courier</span><span class="font5"> as inconclusive. My situation in regard to those who dissent from me is somewhat singular. I have brought against the absolute governments of Europe a charge of conspiracy against the liberties of the United States. I support the charge by facts, and by reasonings from those facts, which produce conviction on most of those who examine the matter . . . But those that dissent simply say, “I don’t think there is a conspiracy”; yet give no reasons for dissent. The Catholic journals very artfully make no defense themselves, but adroitly make use of the Protestant defense kindly prepared for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No Catholic journal has attempted any refutation of the charge. It cannot be refuted, for it is true. And be assured, my dear sir, it is no extravagant prediction when .1 say that the question of Popery and Protestantism, or Absolutism and Republicanism, which in these two opposite categories are convertible terms, is fast becoming and will shortly be the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">great absorbing question,</span><span class="font5">.not only of this country, but of the whole civilized world. I speak not at random; I speak from long and diligent observation in Europe, and from comparison of the state of affairs in this country with the state of public opinion in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are asleep, sir, when every freeman should be awake and look to his arms. . . . Surely, if the danger is groundless, there can be no .harm in endeavoring to ascertain its groundlessness. If you were told your house was on fire you would hardly think of calling the man a maniac for informing you of it, even if he should use a tone of voice and gestures somewhat earnest and impassioned. The course of some of our journals on the subject of Popery has led to the belief that they are covertly under the control of the Jesuits. And let me say, sir, that the modes of control in the resources of this insidious society, notorious for its political arts and intrigues, are more numerous, more powerful and more various than an unsuspicious people are at all conscious of. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Y. falls into the common error and deprecates what he calls a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">religious</span><span class="font5"> controversy, as if the subject of Popery were altogether religious. History, it appears to me, must have been read to very little purpose by any one who can entertain such an error in regard to the cun-ningest political despotism that ever cursed mankind. I must refer you to the preface of the second edition, which I send you, for my reasonings on that point. If they are not conclusive, I should be glad to be shown wherein they are defective. If they are conclusive, is it not time for every patriot to open his eyes to the truth of the fact that we are politically attacked under guise of a religious system, and is it not a serious question whether our political press should advocate the cause of foreign enemies to our government, or help to expose and repel them?—S. F. B. Morse to R. S. Willington, Esq., editor of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Courier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Intolerable Conceit</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ One of the most aggravating things about the Devil is his intolerable conceit. Everybody knows that the pope stands squarely behind the dictators that are ruining the world, and that not once has any of them ever been openly rebuked by name, though all are his subjects. Yet, in writing to the Jesuit university of Fordham in New York city, the pope starts off one of his statements with these words, “As Vicar of Christ upon earth and as guardian of His precious heritage to mankind,” etc. If Christ were as helpless and as cowardly as the man who advertises himself as ‘Christ's Vicar’, the future would be dark indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Mixed on the Subject of Murder</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The pope and the Hierarchy are very much mixed up on the subject of persecution and murder. For instance, on August 20, says the United Press, the pope “appealed to Catholics to be brave in the face of religious persecution”, yet it is only forty years ago that in his “Institutiones Juris Ecclesiasticae” published in Rome, 1901, Father Luca, a Jesuit, said, in Volume 1, page 261:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The church has decided upon various punishments for heretics: (1) The secular government must, at the command and by the direction of the church (ex mandato et com-missione ecclesiae), inflict the punishment of death on heretics, and cannot refuse to take charge of those that have been handed over to the secular arm by the church, for death; (2) this punishment is to be inflicted not only on the adults who have fallen away from the faith, but also on those who have been baptized, and with their mother’s milk have imbibed heresy, and when grown up pertinaciously adhere to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Did you know that the pope may commit murder (as was cheerfully done by Sergius III, Benedict VI, and Alexander VI) and nobody can do anything about it? The London </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald, </span><span class="font5">in its issue of February 7, 1941, after drawing attention to the fact that the pope may disobey traffic laws in Vatican City or any other city, and would not be subject to arrest or to judgment in the courts, asks and answers the following question:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What if he commit murder? Of course for such an act he would be responsible to God, but I suppose you want to know whether any human tribunal could try him. The answer is in the negative. Such a court or tribunal would have no legal standing. It has happened in the past that Popes have allowed committees of investigation into their conduct, but such a committee could not pass sentence on the Pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And if the pope wants to start a war, either a big one or a little one, who is to stop him? He has an army, a little one to be sure, but up until recently they had weapons and it was also a fact, according to the Catholic </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Universe,</span><span class="font5"> London, June 13, 1941, that in the year 1859 Pope Pius IX had a small warship fitted with cannon, built for him at the Thames Iron Works. Does not the possession of carnal weapons imply the willingness to use them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Strictly Italian Racket</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Cardinals die off pretty fast, and it may be admitted that this is fortunate for the rest of mankind. Of the present 52 cardinals, 29 are Italians. The archbishop of Gorizia has called upon all Italians to pray for Hitler's success in the invasion of Russia, and inviting all good Catholics “to raise insistent prayers to God to concede the triumph to the defenders of the New Order and justice”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The archbishop likens the invasion of Russia to one of the ancient crusades; so a few facts about the crusades are in order. To induce support for the crusades the church granted plenary indulgence, abolished sin, promised eternal felicity; and at the voice of their pastor, the robber, the incendiary, the homicide, arose by the thousands. Every atrocity the imagination can conceive disgraced the crusaders. Prostitution was not forgotten. Passing through Greece and Bulgaria, pillage, violation and murder were everywhere left as traces of their passage. Capturing Jerusalem, the Jews were burned alive in their synagogues, and 70,000 women, children and babes were slaughtered. Famine and pestilence shared honors with crime and depravity and in the capture of the town of Marra, the crusaders butchered the inhabitants and ate their flesh. Pope Innocent III accused the crusaders of respecting neither age nor sex, nor religious profession, but deeds of fornication, adultery and incest were perpetrated in open daylight in the Catholic camp. Filled with the zeal peculiar to his father’s house, the archbishop of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Gorizia would like to see these deeds emulated in Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mussolini, who is a devout Catholic, and who seems to have many of the traits including sex profligacy which have given the crusaders their place in history, on a hot day in midsummer caused the arrest of a seventeen-year-old schoolgirl because she appeared at a football game in public wearing shorts. Mussolini ! And this after the record you have made which is known all over the earth I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Almost Ready for the Big Shakedown</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Berlin, May 28—The Catholic Church is planning to carry out a collection of precious metals for the benefit of the Reich, it was announced in the German press today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the reports, Catholics have been writing to bishops, suggesting that the church initiate a drive to round up objects of religious art made of gold, silver, and other precious substances in odd corners of churches and monasteries throughout the Reich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such objects, the enthusiastic Catholic patriots contend, often have neither historical, commercial, nor artistic value, and derive to a large extent from gifts and bestowals which have reached the church from private individuals.—Buffalo (N. Y.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Courier Express.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Croatian Kingdom Not “Recognized”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The new Croatian kingdom, it is admitted, is to be a Fascist one, and a Catholic one. It is comical to see the twists and turns by which the Roman Hierarchy tries to avoid responsibility for parenthood of the new brat. The New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> under the engaging subtitle “Pope Withholds Recognition”, devotes 86 lines to this interesting task. It tells how the pope received the new king, the duke of Spoleto, and the ex-assassin Dr. Ante Pavelitch, and the whole Croatian delegation, but he received them at such hours and in such manner that he merely received them as Croatian Catholics and not as representatives of the Croatian kingdom. How the reporter must have gagged to send out that dispatch!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Breeding Fodder and Bead-Counters</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Pacelli and Hitler are of one mind that the thing to do, if they wish to maintain their respective rackets, is to have as many more Germans as possible. Frau Gertrud Klink has charge of the &quot;populating policy’. It is her duty to see that no German women practice birth control. Any woman who has not had a child in 18 months is questioned as to the reason by one of Frau Klink’s representatives. Single women with babies are not neglected. It is considered quite the thing in Germany now for young unmarried girls to have babies. Paternity does not matter, so long as he is or was a soldier. Caging the women and routing the selected “pure Aryans” who are hereafter to rule the world would be a next natural and logical step.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Threatening Deputies and Senators</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The bishop of Granada, Managua, Nicaragua, has threatened all deputies and senators with excommunication from the church if they approve pending legislation requiring civil matrimony before an ecclesiastical one. Adam and Eve had neither one, but it seems to have been valid, or how came the bishop to be here ? The interesting point, however, is that even bishops, according to this, do have the right to excommunicate Catholic officials, and so, to be sure, there is not the slightest excuse for bishops and the pope to fail to excommunicate Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, Salazar and others of their faith who have performed and are now performing such horrid deeds of murder in all lands beyond the seas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Makes for Bad Citizenship</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ That Roman Catholic teaching makes for bad citizenship is illustrated by the fact that though Michigan is only onefifth Catholic yet one-half of all the boys in the “Industrial School” at Lansing are of that sect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(To be continued)</span></p><img src="g_E_19420204_files/g_E_19420204-3.png" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:78pt;">
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">All Things Work Together for Good</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ In July last yeqr, one of the boys got in touch with a man in one of the poor districts of Weaste (Manchester). He was interested in the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> and took it. Two weeks later the witness returned, and started a model study on “Government and Peace”. The husband and wife attended the model study, while the two young children played around the floor. The wife did not seem too interested at first, but after a while put some very good questions and received the answers. Then came the time when the issue was put before them. The wife readily accepted the invitation to accompany us on the work, but not the husband. He just kept on making excuses. Then came the “blitz” on Manchester in December. A delayed-action bomb fell near their home and they had to evacuate. The next night, an oil bomb fell right on their home, and burnt it out. When she saw it, her first words were: “Thank Jehovah that he saved our lives.” Then turning to the children at her side, she said to the boy, “We shall have to go to Auntie’s tonight”; to which the boy of five years old replied: “Naughty Satan, to burn all Mummy’s books up.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This has increased her zeal for the Lord. She now lives in two rooms near by, and less housework means more field service. Last month her hours were 64, and she has four model studies running. The husband is classing himself with the “goats”, but this does not stop her in her service to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">He Wasn’t Lost</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ At the St. Louis convention of Jehovah’s witnesses an adult witness noticed </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">small colored boy standing near him, apparently lost in the crowd. He said to him, “Are you lost, little boy?” and the lad replied, “No, suh! I’s ain’t lost. Only the goats are lost, and I’s a sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Liberal-minded Priest in Cuba</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ At this place, Camaguey, I called at a home and met a priest. The master of the house there told me he cannot read, and asked me to read the testimony card for him, which I did. He then turned and asked the priest if they might listen to</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Chiniquy and the Bishop</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">^VTOUR lordship has congratulated</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">-I- me for having said that Jesus Christ has always granted the petitions of Mary. I want now to respectfully ask you how we can say that Jesus has always granted the requests of His Mother when the evangelist Matthew tells us that He never granted her petitions when acting in His capacity of Saviour of the world ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The poor bishop seemed absolutely confounded by this simple and honest question. In order to help him out of the inextricable difficulties into which I had at once pushed him, I said, “My lord, will you allow me to put a few more questions to you?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bishop—With pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chiniquy—Well, my lord, who came to this world to save you and me? Is it Jesus or Mary?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bishop—It is Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chiniquy—Who was called, and is, in reality, the sinner’s Best Friend? Was it Jesus or Mary?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bishop—It was Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chiniquy—Now please allow me a few more questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chiniquy—When Jesus and Mary were on earth, whose heart was most devoted to sinners ? Who loved them with a more efficacious love—Jesus or Mary?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bishop—Jesus being God, His love was evidently more efficacious and saving than Mary’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chiniquy—In the days of Jesus and Mary, to whom did Jesus invite sinners to go for their salvation—was it to Himself or Mary?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bishop—Jesus has said to all sinners, “Come unto Me.” He never said come or go to Mary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chiniquy—Have we any examples in the Scriptures who, fearing to be rebuked by Jesus, have gone to Mary and obtained access to Him through her and been saved through her intercession?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bishop—I do not remember of any such cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chiniquy—To whom did the penitent thief, then on the cross, address himself to be saved—Jesus or Mary?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bishop—It was to Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chiniquy—Did that penitent thief do well to address himself to Jesus on the cross rather than to Mary who was at His feet?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bishop—Surely he did better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chiniquy—Now, my lord, allow me only one question more. You told me that Jesus loved sinners when on earth infinitely more than Mary; that He was infinitely more their true friend than she was .; that He had infinitely more interest in their salvation than had Mary; that it was infinitely better for sinners to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font5"> to Jesus than to Mary to be saved: —Will you please tell me if you think that Jesus has lost in heaven, since He is sitting at the right hand of His Father, any of His divine and infinite superiority of love and mercy over Mary for sinners; and can you show me that what Jesus has lost has been gained by Mary?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bishop—I do not think that Christ has lost any of His love and power to save us now that He is in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Chiniquy—Now, my lord, if Jesus is still my best Friend, my most powerful, merciful Friend, why should I not go directly to Him? Why should we, for a moment, go to anyone who is infinitely inferior in power, love, and mercy, for our salvation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The bishop was stunned by my question. He stammered some unintelligible answer, excused himself for not being able to remain any longer, on account of some pressing business; and extending his hand to me before leaving, said: “You will find an answer to your questions in the Holy Fathers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Can you lend me the Holy Fathers, my lord?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He replied, “No, I have them not.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Fifty Years in the Church of Rome </span><span class="font5">(Page 480).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Southern States</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Negro Soldiers in Arkansas</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">♦ The American Guardian</span><span class="font5"> records what took place when 1,100 colored men, the 94th engineers from Fort Custer, Michigan, were marching through Arkansas, near Prescott. The account says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A police officer ran down the road, ordering the men into the ditch. He ordered the white lieutenant off the road, and then pushed him when he did not move fast enough. The lieutenant continued toward the main group of police. There a police sergeant was saying he was ‘going to teach these----niggers to re</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">spect white people.’ The lieutenant started to explain that he had been with the men and that there had been no disturbance, but he never got to say it. One police officer snatched off his glasses with his left hand and struck him in the jaw with his right fist. The lieutenant spat blood, and one of his teeth was loosened. While this was going on three policemen with riot guns and two with drawn pistols covered the lieutenant and two military police officers. Several trucks of military police were present, but they were unarmed and unable to do anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Five-Year-Old Donnie Maixner</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Near Wichita, Kansas, five-year-old Donnie Maixner lost his balance and fell thirty feet into the family well, which at that time held six feet of water. Donnie got a gash on the head, but was not made unconscious. He pulled himself out of the water, braced himself, removed his shoes and slowly climbed until he hit the smooth concrete wall near the top of the well. Then he shouted to his ma and she came and got him out. It was a marvellous achievement for anybody, let alone a child of five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Load Off His Mind</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Oklahoma City has a youth who had such long hair when he was born, and so much of it that he had to have a haircut when he was only four weeks old to get the load off his mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Maury Maverick Defeated</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Talk is cheap. Mayor Maury Maverick, San Antonio, Texas, referring to a proposed Communist meeting in his city, made the statement, “We will grant a permit to any group of citizens to meet and exercise their freedom of speech and assembly whenever facilities are available and they pay the required fee. What’s more, we are ready to give them police protection.” That was on May 1; but see how quickly a politician can change his mind. Within a month after that the same mayor, Maury Maverick, publicly denounced the finest Christian men and women of his own city, Jehovah’s witnesses, stating that they could not have the use of the municipal auditorium for their convention, July 24-28, which auditorium they had engaged for that purpose. What is the answer? The answer is that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have no particular antagonism against the Stalin dictatorship, or any dictatorship, but they have a most dreadful antagonism against the Word of God, which Jesus stated is </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the truth.</span><span class="font5"> Manifestly the heat was put on Maverick to not let Jehovah’s witnesses “exercise their freedom of speech and assembly” in San Antonio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Maury Maverick, of San Antonio, Texas, famous for professions of granting free speech by Communists, and of his denial of the same rights to Jehovah’s witnesses, sought re-election to the mayoralty of his city and was defeated by ex-mayor Quin. The priest conspicuous in Maverick’s hostility to Jehovah’s witnesses died shortly thereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Starvation in Texas</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ It is humiliating to know that 101 persons died of starvation in Texas in 1938 and that there are 12,000 families in the state whose members have from 3c to 4c each to spend on each meal and are therefore at starvation’s door.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Blue Laws in Delaware</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Wilmington, Delaware, had a gay time on Sunday, March 2,1941, enforcing blue laws passed in 1740. A preacher who wanted the laws left on the statute books went on the air to give his reasons and thus violated the law by making it necessary for a radio operator and announcer to work on Sunday. It was discovered that the speaker of the Delaware House had a drugstore open, and that was against the law also. It was a crime to drive a taxicab for hire, deliver milk, or sell a newspaper or a quart of gasoline. Over 500 people were arrested, and the law was repealed in the very same week in which the arrests took place.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">♦ At the National Defense Nutrition Conference, held in Washington, Paul V. McNutt, Federal Security administrator, drew attention to the great necessity of uplifting the general nourishment standard. Deftly he implied that while cream separators are a good thing for the people that skim off the cream, they may not be so good for the common people that have to take what remains of the milk. He added the common-sense and truthful observation that “even the recently advertised ‘enriched’ type of flour has not achieved the level of whole wheat”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Interdenominational Church Service</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">♦ They had what they call an interdenominational church service at Washington. It was addressed by a Roman Catholic who believes that all Protestants are doomed, a Protestant who believes all Catholics are doomed, a Jew that both Roman Catholics and Protestants believe is doomed, and a Univer-salist who believes that not even the Devil is doomed. A good time was had.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">British Comment</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">By J. Hemery (London)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Margaret Wilson Becomes a Brahman</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ One after another the idols fall. Margaret Wilson, daughter of Woodrow Wilson, toured the United States with mighty poor singing during 1915-1917, at which time her father was president of the United States. Woodrow blew up in 1919, just after he had decided that all political prisoners in the United States, except Jehovah’s witnesses, should be given their liberty. Now Margaret has fallen by the wayside, and instead of believing the heathen doctrines of the “trinity” and of “eternal torture”, as did her Presbyterian father, she now believes that Brahma has four heads instead of three, and has joined a Brahman colony in India. She wants to get away from a world headed by the three-headed god, the Devil, and imagines she will find rest of heart by moving in to a place where they tack on one more head. Margaret is wrong, but has lots of company. She needs the information that “to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him”.—1 Corinthians 8: 6, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Know What a Banaban Is?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Do you know what a Banaban is? He lives in Banaba, 1,800 miles northeast of Australia, and is a well-to-do citizen. The reason that he is so well off is that the little island w<sup>T</sup>here he lives contains some 20,000,000 tons of phosphate, for which there is always a good market, and for which the Banaban receives a royalty. The Banabans recently sent $50,000 to the British war chest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ The Vatican has been greatly worried about the fate of Italian civilians in Ethiopia, fearing that Protestant Britain’s Coptic Christian allies would take revenge on their former Catholic Fascist conquerors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Chicago </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News,</span><span class="font5"> of March 19, reported that the Vatican had appealed to the British Government to remember its traditions of humanity and civilization and to exert all possible influence to control the savage instincts of the Ethiopians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was immediately pointed out in London, the report continued, that the Vatican had never felt called upon to protest “when the Italians were slaughtering Ethiopians by aerial bombs and gas in 1935, or even in February, 1936, when in one horrid day and night 6,000 people in Addis Ababa were slaughtered by the Italian garrison.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Converted Catholic.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ In the copper mines of South-West Africa, where, the climate is deadly, a native is paid 25 shillings a month; and if he works hard at long hours for a year, he can go to his home at the end of that time with the proud sum of £5 ($25) for his labor. So says </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The American Guardian</span><span class="font5"> in reviewing Negley Farson’s book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Behind God’s Bach.</span><span class="font5"> Farson seems to think it would be just as well for the rest of the world if some of the whites who have been exploiting Africa would remember that God hath made of one blood all nations that dwell on the earth, and that the assumed right of the white to enslave the black does not exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Looking Out for the Little Folks</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Looking out for the little folks, and realizing that they have to eat, the Australian government put a 2Uperoent tax on incomes of more than $5,000, so that mothers of more than one child may have an income of five shillings a week,' or about $1.25, toward caring for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Attack by Fire</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ When we read of Sudanese archers shooting blazing arrows into the thatched roofs of an Italian military post at Asowa we may think of this method of attack as “primitive.” Yet except in scope and technical refinement such an attack scarcely differs from an assault by German planes scattering incendiary bombs on London or British air squadrons dropping phosphorus “visiting cards” on German industrial centers. Fire from the air is one of the oldest forms of attack in history. Ancient bas-reliefs show that the Assyrians were familiar with liquid fire, which they may have developed by using seepages from the present oil fields of Iraq. The Greeks and Romans knew how to throw fire over the walls of a besieged city with catapults. Our own Indians often attacked frontier blockhouses with flaming arrows.—New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">South African Priests Freed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ In South Africa 150 priests and brothers of the Roman Catholic church were interned for work among the natives which the Government manifestly believed to be against its interests and in favor of Hitler. But after a little while, says the N.C.W.C. (National Catholic Welfare Conference), the Apostolic Delegate to South Africa got them out; and out they are. They may go to certain places but must keep away from the natives and avoid all contact with them. That will be a real benefit to the natives and the government as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Burning Off the Stubble</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Burning off the stubble of Australian wheatlands is a ticklish job, but it has to be done, for the good of the land and for safety sake. The day chosen must be hot and the wind must be right. Firebreaks are plowed around the field. The fires are skillfully started and controlled and in ten minutes a field or paddock of a hundred acres will be a blackened, smoky stretch of earth bereft of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Trials in the Libyan Desert</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ It is difficult to make it plain just what the troops went through. Heat? You pick up a rifle and the barrel burns like a poker fresh from the fire. Thirst? You try to ease the parching ache in your throat with water, half boiling, from a gasoline can, a salty, brackish, filthy-looking liquid which nevertheless eases the pain of cracked lips. Hungry? You open a can of corned beef. The meat comes in lumps, cooked by the sun to a tasteless, greasy mass in 120-degree heat. Dirty? You find a little tainted water and rub sand and rubble along with soapy lather into smarting skin and eyes. Tired? You can lie down amidst prickly camel thorn and risk the bites of scorpions. If you want shade there is none till evening except under an oily, hot munitions truck.—Richard D. McMillan, United Press correspondent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Apes at Gibraltar</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The United Press carried a dispatch that there is a legend in Spain that the British w<sup>T</sup>ill lose Gibraltar when the last simian has disappeared from “The Rock”. This is probably a sly poke at the British themselves, and one which the Catholic UP would enjoy giving, yet' the story goes on that all the cows, goats and sheep on the Rock, along with all the horses, dogs and other domestic pets, were recently slaughtered as a military measure, but the fortress’ monkeys were spared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A Misinformed Elephant</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ In the heart of Kenya, British East Africa, a misinformed elephant got into an argument with an automobile, burned his trunk on the radiator, and then tore off the headlights, the radiator and the hood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">U.S. Fighter Planes in Libya</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ United States-built fighter planes are credited with having had considerable to do with holding back the German march through Libya toward Suez.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Next Stop, Suez</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Those that are trying to figure out what will be the next move of the “Abomination that Maketh Desolate” seem well agreed that Suez will be a next objective, and are trying to prevent it from going the same way as Europe has gone. Reports from Cairo are that more than twenty shiploads arrived at about one time, and that American tanks are coming in completely assembled, fueled and ready for the big fight when it arrives. The Germans have a big start. They have Pacelli op their side, and so have a fifth column almost everywhere. Also, they use the Catholic soldiers of one country to help them conquer another. But the farther they spread out, the longer the haul and the more enemies they make. And if they get Suez they will pay a big price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Belgium in the Pincers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The raw materials of the Congo region that used to go to Belgium now go to Britain instead. The factories not having raw materials are largely closed and the men are shipped to Germany by the trainload, to help make German munitions.- Meantime Belgium must pay the German armies of occupation $100,000,-000 annually. Also, it must provide those armies of occupation with three times as much food as is available for the needs of its own people. The German military commander at Antwerp has forbidden Jews to loiter in the streets, or enter public parks or baths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Soldiers Need Superior Shoes</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ In a test march of 130 miles in Australia some soldiers, all of whom started with new shoes, had the soles of the shoes flapping in 27 miles; others wore out two pairs in the jaunt. The Australians on the march take ten percent fewer strides per minute than the British regulation of two every second, but they cover more distance in the same length of time on account of using the longer stride which is better suited to their greater height.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">British, Germans, and Khamsin</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ There are three contestants for victory in Cyrenaica, the British, the Germans, and the khamsin, and the last named is the most powerful fighter of them all. He comes north across the desert in all his fury, filling the air with burning, acrid saffron smoke, which cuts like a knife; and he blows trucks off their wheels. The air is so impure that salves and ointments only make matters worse. They furnish landing grounds for the sores which then fester and make the unacclimated wish they were somewhere else. The khamsin is the desert wind, the “wind of fifty days”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Suez Canal Closed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Bombing operations frequently closed the Suez Canal off and on from February, 1941, onward. The canal is very narrow and all that is necessary to close it temporarily is for a single vessel to be bombed in transit. Mines have been effectively dropped from planes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What a remarkable thing it is, when one comes to think of it, that both Africa and South America are cut off from other continents by isthmuses pierced by canals, now main objectives of a warring world!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">South Africa’s Part in the War</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ The South African, News Bureau reports that the Union of South Africa now has a population of 10,250,000, of whom 2,250,(K)0 are whites. The nation has one of the largest dynamite plants in the world and several large munition plants that would not be easily found by enemy bombers. The present output of war munitions in South Africa is four and a half times as great as it was when World War I was m its early stages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Mediterranean Considered Safe</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ After the British began to back the Italians out of Libya, they considered the Mediterranean so reasonably safe that war risk insurance on merchantmen passing through the Great Sea was resumed in London.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

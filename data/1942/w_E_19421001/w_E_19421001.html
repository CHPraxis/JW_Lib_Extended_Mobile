<p><span class="font7">“And all thy children shall be taught of Jehovah; and great shall be the peace of thy children.&quot; - </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">hatch 54:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH Is the only true God, Is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power In heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JESL'S was made human, and the man Jesus suftered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION Is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus Is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed In the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and Is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act Is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to ’‘fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“WATCHTOWER” STUDIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is the desire of the Society to aid the students of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> m their study of this magazine. To this end the Society will supply questions on the leading article in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">These questions will appear at the bottom of each column for the paragraphs that appear in the column These questions should be used in the company studies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Proper procedure in the conducting of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> study would be as follows: The study conductor of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">study will select a person to read the questions, and another capable reader to read the paragraphs. First the question will be propounded on the paragraph discussed. Those attending the meeting having comment to make on the question will raise their hand, and the chairman will call on them to make comment; not to read portions of the paragraph, but to express in their own words the thought they have on the question. Several comments should be made on each question. If certain scriptures in the paragraph are not quoted in the paragraph, and time permits, the chairman should ask those in the meeting to read these scriptures. After this is done the summing up of the questions on the paragraph should be accomplished by reading the paragraph itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">All </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> studies should be one hour in length. The study conductor can control this easily by scheduling his time, allotting a certain number of minutes to each column of the assignment for the week and so marking each column as to how far along in the hour that column should be studied. By so scheduling his time for discussion on various paragraphs, equal emphasis will be put on every part of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the study meetmgs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It is suggested that, in your personal reading and study of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> before you attend these study meetings, you first read the paragraph carefully, look up the scriptures cited but not quoted, and then read, at the foot of the column, the question pertaining to that paragraph, and answer it in your own words. If you cannot answer the question on the paragraph it would be well to read the paragraph again, so as to be sure to get the proper thought from it. Then proceed with the next paragraph; and do likewise until you have finished </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> article. By so doing you will become thoroughly acquainted with the material set forth for the aid and comfort of all persons who love righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Having m mind that all things were written aforetime for our learning, it behooves everyone to give diligent study to those things that the Lord sets on His table for our sustenance and upbuilding. It is hoped that this arrangement will aid all persons to give diligent study to those things brought forth in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and that it will help them, too, to make these truths their own so that they will be able to express them to others as opportunity affords.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font8">way of life on earth for ever, and let the politicians and religion remain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>4</sup> This earth is but a minute part of an immense, measureless universe. When the politicians speak of world domination they think the issue is something just affecting this earth on which they live, and for whose surface they fight. The real issue is far more extensive, as vast as the universe and its inhabitation. The primary issue is universal domination. Therefore men and political organizations and their armies will not decide the issue, but the Almighty Ruler of the universe shall. “Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing. And Lebanon [the cedar forests on its mountainsides] is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering. All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity. To whom then will ye liken God! . . . that bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.”—Isa. 40:15-18, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’ On the issue of universal domination all the nations are against Jehovah God. Although each group at war claims God is for its side, and though each side prays to the same God, they do not desire that God’s will be done on earth as throughout all the universe. They are all for continued man-rule on earth under religion, as opposed to the direct rule by Jehovah God through his great Executive Officer, Christ Jesus, the King. This brings the issue down to simply this: Man’s proposed new order of the federated world or the Kingdom of Jehovah God by Christ Jesus, The Theocracy: which shall it be over earth! The mighty and chief opponent of the Lord God in this universal issue is Satan the Devil. Those who are not on the side of Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government under his Son must be on the side of the great enemy, Satan the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">4. Does the real Issue effect only this earth, end, therefore, who shall decide the Issue?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">6. (a) On the real Issue are the nations </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Id</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> favor of God, or of what? (b) Who is God's chief opponent on the Issue, and la any neutral position guaranteed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ml</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">TEHOVAH has the right solution to the great I problem over which all the nations are divided </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font8"> and, many of them, fighting desperately. For long centuries the nations have chosen their own way of life and government, and politically, racially and religiously it has been a divided world. Since 1918, marking the close of the first world war, a great change has come, affecting the destiny of all nations, and none of them can escape the certain result. Prior to that there had long existed a balance of power between the leading nations and the great continental powers, with more or less friction and frequent violent clashes, as was to be expected in a selfish world. Since 1918 the problem of world domination has been forced to the front to become the chief issue before every nation and people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>2</sup> Back of the forcing of this issue to the forefront stands religion, innocent-looking and pious-appearing, but having political ambitions for a totalitarian world with all nations bound together by the tie of religion, and Rome to be the world center and seat of a federated-world government. Along with such federated world under totalitarian dominance there would go the federating of all religion under the domination of the strongest religious organization in the world and whose headquarters is at Vatican City. Eventually would come the swallowing up or forcing out of all religions not acknowledging the Vatican as the super-national power and head of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’ Nations committed to the democratic way of rule now fight their great political opponent They declare their aim to dominate the earth with a world democracy, but they also bow superstitiously before religion, particularly Rome’s. They allow for religion the chief place in the proposed “New World order”. By this concession to religion they salve their conscience and think that Almighty God will compromise with them and approve their own chosen</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Since 1918 what great problem of the nation* baa been forced to the front, and who has the right solution?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Who la back of forcing this Issue, and because of what ambitions? 3 Do nations committed to democracy make allowance tor religion In their proposed &quot;New Order”, and. if so, why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Devil, the prince of demons. There is no neutral position. “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad,” said the King of God’s Righteous Government. (Matt. 12:30) In 1815 the nations of earth guaranteed the eternal neutrality of Switzerland; but no such position is guaranteed to any nation or individual in this universal issue. Each must choose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’ According to the above rule all the nations are under and on the side of the “god of this world”, and are a part of his world. (2 Cor. 4:4; John 14: 30) They are all on the one side, regardless of political disagreements. The vast majority of people think that the decision must be made by each individual as between totalitarian rule and democracy. The “god of this world” and all his demon hosts would keep the people in ignorance as to the real issue: that it is between this world of which he is god and Jehovah’s new world under The Theocracy of his Son Jesus Christ. The main question also takes in this related one, namely, Who are the Higher Powers, the religious-political rulers of this world or Jehovah God and Christ Jesus! The battle of Armageddon, which is near, will answer these throbbing questions, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">* The time for individual decision is therefore limited. Each one must take the consequences of his choice, either destruction with Satan’s world or everlasting life on the victorious side of the Theocratic Government of the new world of righteousness. Satan and his demons would keep “Christendom” and all humankind in dark ignorance of the real issue. Being unable to see Jehovah God’s side of the issue, they would not see the way of escape from Satan’s doomed world, but would continue to be entangled in its political-religious disputes and conflicts. Since 1918 the dividing of the people has been on, for life or death. The people who love righteousness and seek life in peace and happiness must learn the issue of highest importance, that they may choose life and good and live. It is Almighty God’s will that they shall know, and nothing can keep them from learning. The “gospel of the Kingdom” is the means of informing them. Therefore Jehovah sends forth his witnesses to announce the established Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’ The result of the proclamation of the Kingdom, or Theocracy, which result will be reached before the settlement of the issue at Armageddon, is positively foretold at Isaiah 59:19: “So shall they fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory</span></p>

(b) What Is the Kingdom, and who is the mother of it and Its members? </span><span class="font8">from the rising of the sun; when the adversary shall come in like a flood, the spirit of Jehovah will lift up a standard against him.” </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Rev. Ver.,</span><span class="font8"> marginal reading) It is those of good-will toward Jehovah and his Righteous Government who learn to fear </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font8"> before Armageddon, wherever the sun shines. The Kingdom is Jehovah’s capital organization under Christ Jesus, and it shall dominate all the universe, including our earth. The capital organization is pictured as a chaste woman who is joined in unbreakable wedlock to her King, Christ Jesus. Those who are bom in this heavenly organization and united with its King as his bride are 144,000 in number. They are redeemed from this earth and from among men and follow his footsteps faithfully unto death. (Rev. 14:1-4) He is their Redeemer and King and Bridegroom. These are the firstfruits unto God, being taken from among the redeemed ones who shall live forever on earth under God’s capital organization. The capital ruling body is God’s offspring born from his universal organization, which organization is symbolized as his woman named “Zion”. The name “Zion” therefore applies to the great mother organization in her privilege of bringing forth the capital city under Christ.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">’ The year 1914 was a year of universal importance; for then the capital organization was established in heaven by the enthronement of Jehovah’s king thereof, Christ Jesus. Satan and his demons were opposed to the exalting of the capital to power. They fought to destroy it, but were whipped and cast out of heaven and down to the earth. This debasement has greatly maddened the great adversary and his demons, and therefore they have come in like a flood upon the earth’s inhabitants to sweep them away from God’s established kingdom and into destruction. They make the remnant yet on earth of the 144,000 their chief target, because these keep God’s commandments and give forth the testimony of Jesus Christ. (Rev. 12:17) The adversary, who is against Jehovah’s universal domination, seeks to deceive the whole world concerning the true issue upon which everlasting life depends. Therefore he has released a great and mighty flood of propaganda by the most up-to-date means of newscasting. By such he blinds the people to the issue, fixes their desires upon the religious, political and commercial things of this world as worth seeking for and preserving, and turns their hearts and minds away from and against Jehovah’s kingdom in operation under Christ Jesus.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">10. What has the Lord raised up in resistance to the flood of demonlsm. and who has the privilege of holding It aloft? </span><span class="font8">devoted remnant and all persons of good-will and loving righteousness to keep their feet and resist the flood of demonism, the spirit or invisible power of Jehovah God has raised up a standard against the adversary. This standard raised up is the “testimony of Jesus Christ” concerning the Kingdom, or Theocratic Government. The privilege of offering this testimony to the world he shares with his remnant on earth, and he commands that “this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations”. (Matt. 24:14) The obedient and faithful remnant lift up this standard of the Kingdom that the people may discern the primary issue confronting all nations and may choose the side of life eternal. They are determined never to let that standard drop or permit any of the adversary's agents to snatch it from their grasp. The spirit of the Lord is upon his remnant and the men of good-will who rally to the standard to keep it aloft without apology or compromise with the foe.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THE DELIVERER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>11</sup> Down to 1918 and for a brief time thereafter those who make up the remnant in line for the Kingdom were affected somewhat by religious influence. Religion is ungodliness. Who can deny that all religion is opposed to Jehovah God and his rule of this earth by his Theocracy under Christ! As long as the remnant acted according to the view of “Christendom” that the political powers of this present evil world are the “higher powers” ordained of God there was a measure of ungodliness. It led to submission to ungodly men who were against God’s kingdom and his commandments concerning the preaching of the gospel. Jehovah God had chosen his redeemed ones for salvation. Therefore such ungodliness must be exposed to his devoted remnant, that they might turn and be cleansed therefrom. Only thereby could such maintain their integrity toward God and finally be made a part of God’s capital organization. Therefore God fulfilled his word pronounced long ago by his prophet Malachi (3:1-4) and sent the King and Redeemer to the temple to do the judging and purging work. “And the Redeemer [or, Deliverer] shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord.”—Isa. 59:20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>12</sup> The apostle Paul quotes this prophecy, at Romans 11:25, 26. He applies it to the time the remnant of Christ’s followers and body members are brought in from among all nations or Gentiles in order to make up the fullness of the 144,000 who will be the bride or Kingdom body under Christ</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">11 What was the ungodliness with which the remnant were affected, and how were they turned from It?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">12 (a) To what time in the development of Christ’s body does the apostle Paul apply Isaiah 69:20? (b) By whom does this application show the Lord’s standard must be raised on high, and in behalf of whom? </span><span class="font8">Jesus. The remnant are begotten of God’s spirit and are therefore spiritual Israelites. Hence they are pictured by Jacob, who was surnamed Israel. After mentioning the coming in of the fullness of the Gentiles at the end of the world, the apostle Paul quotes the prophet Isaiah, saying: “And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.” This proves that the standard lifted up by God’s spirit against the adversary must be raised on high by the remnant of “Jacob” in behalf of the people of good-will who seek life and truth but who do not find such in the standards paraded on high by the religious, political and commercial propagandists of the world. The standards of worldly propagandists for the “New World order” show a total omission of Jehovah’s Righteous Government administered directly by Christ. Hence such standards forget God and mislead the nations into the ditch of destruction. This is unmistakably the fatal course warned against at Psalm 9:17: “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">” Religion makes the nations of “Christendom” forget God Jehovah in all their schemes and counsels. Therefore all their purposes and plans run counter to Jehovah’s purpose by his Theocracy, and they religiously fight against Jehovah and his Kingdom. The religious clergy have persuaded the nations to believe they are “Christian nations” and that the ruling factors are the “higher powers” ordained of God because crowned in cathedrals and “blessed” by the religious Hierarchy. Hence the nations of &quot;Christendom” command that Jehovah’s remnant lower the standard of the new world of righteousness and its Theocratic Rulership. But the Lord’s remnant have been turned from transgression and all ungodliness of religion, and they recognize now that Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are the “Higher Powers” to whom Christian souls must be absolutely subject or else be destroyed. They unhesitatingly choose to “obey God rather than men” and to follow the example left by their Leader, Christ Jesus. The standard of Jehovah's Supreme Government remains aloft because the spirit of the Omnipotent God is behind it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">UNSILENCED TESTIMONY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">” The standard of Jehovah's name and kingdom will never be lowered until the flood-like onrush of the adversaries has been halted for ever at the battle of Armageddon and all human standards have been destroyed, as false, deceptive, and antiKingdom. This is not the mere idle boast of men.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">13 . Why do the nations of &quot;Christendom” command the remnant to lower the standard, and do the remnant obey?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">14 . Will that standard ever be lowered, and what covenant-promise of Jehovah gives the reliable answer?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">It is the solemn promise or covenant of the Supreme Power. It is stated through his faithful witness, the prophet Isaiah, unto us at the end of the world, namely: ‘‘And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith Jehovah: my spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith Jehovah, from henceforth and for ever.” (Isa. 59: 21, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font8"> This is the Most High God’s declaration. It is his unbreakable covenant for that faithful remnant whom the King at the temple turns away from all transgression and ungodliness unto the righteous service of God. Jehovah keeps his covenants, and he neither recalls them nor alters them. This covenant to his faithful standard-bearers is therefore sure to be carried out.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>15</sup> Isaiah, here addressed in the covenant, is the one who under inspiration declared: “Behold, I and the children whom Jehovah hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Jehovah of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion.” (Isa. 8:18, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font8"> The apostle Paul applies those prophetic words to Christ Jesus and his body of footstep followers, the 144,000. (Heb. 2:13) Hence the Greater Isaiah is Christ Jesus the King, and “his seed” is the “little flock” of 144,000, to whom Jehovah God is pleased to give the Kingdom with Christ Jesus. (Luke 12:31,32) Besides these who were redeemed by Christ’s blood for the heavenly kingdom there are “other sheep”. Them he likewise redeems, and to them he gives life eternal on earth, thus becoming their “everlasting Father”. (Isa. 9:6) Concerning these prospective earthly children Christ Jesus said: “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and they shall become one flock, one shepherd.” (John 10:16, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font8"> Inviting them into the Kingdom’s blessings on earth he shall shortly say: “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” (Matt. 25:34) These “other sheep” being redeemed in a secondary order unto life under the heavenly Theocracy, they are the ones mentioned to the Greater Isaiah as “thy seed’s seed”. He now gathers them to himself.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">*’ What, then, is the divine covenant to the Greater Isaiah and his “seed” and his “seed’s seed”? This: that the invincible spirit of Jehovah God is now upon and will ever be upon the Greater Isaiah, who is Christ Jesus the reigning King of The Theocracy, and the word of Jehovah God concerning that Theocratic Government He has put in the mouth of Christ Jesus, “the Faithful and True Witness”; and that</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IS Who Is addressed In Jehovah's covenant-promise, and who are meant by his &quot;seed'' and his &quot;seed’s seed&quot;?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">16 What, then. Is the substance or modern meaning of Jehovah's covenant concerning his spirit and his word? </span><span class="font8">spirit and that word shall not depart from the remnant of Christ’s body nor from the companions of the remnant, the “other sheep”, “from henceforth and for ever.” That means that Jehovah God will have a remnant keeping their covenant with him to the death and standing immovable for The Theocracy and keeping themselves in integrity, “unspotted from the world” and its new order; and that therefore Jehovah will never have cause to remove his spirit of power and his word of witness from them. It means that their companions, the “other sheep”, will continue to march forward side by side with the remnant and in indivisible unity, joyfully and gratefully bearing their share of the burden of work, holding up their end of the battle line against demonism and showing the same degree of faith, faithfulness and devotion to Jehovah and his Kingdom as do the faithful remnant. The spirit upon the Greater Isaiah, Christ Jesus the King, is the spirit to victory over the forces of demonism and to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The word which fills and pours forth from His mouth is not the propaganda of religion. It is the revealed message of God setting forth the great issue of universal domination and foretelling the settlement of that issue permanently to the glory of the Most High.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1T</sup> To be filled with that spirit and that word is our only safeguard against being invaded and overpowered by the spirit and propaganda of this world, which is demonism in its most deceptive and alluring form. That spirit being upon the remnant as upon their Head Christ Jesus, it is their commission to preach, a commission direct from God and through Christ Jesus, and not through any religious theological seminary. Therefore they say as did their Head: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach.” (Isa. 61:1; Luke 4:16-18) That spirit being also upon the devoted “other sheep”, they have the moving power and the authorization and command to preach the same message as do the anointed remnant, and they pass along the message and say, “Come!”— Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">” The anointed remnant from and after 1918 have had the temple experience of Isaiah. This prophet saw Jehovah’s messenger or representative seated upon the high throne in the temple surrounded by the seraphim ascribing holiness to Jehovah and announcing His purpose to fill the earth with his glory. The lips of those of the remnant were once unclean through fear of men and failure to preach the pure message of God’s name and kingdom, and, like Isaiah at the glorious temple vision, they have cried: “Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">17 . What la oar only safeguard against invasion by demonlsm, and what does it mean for God's spirit to be upon creatures today*</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">18 What experience like Isaiah's at the temple have the remnant had, and what have they received from the Lord for responding to his call? </span><span class="font8">unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips, for mine eyes have seen the King: the Lord of hosts.” Their eyes were enlightened to see the kingdom of Jehovah God, The Theocratic Government, and they had been silent about it because of the people of unclean lips round about them who put them in fear and under restraints. But today the message of the King of Eternity must go to the people. Now Jehovah God by his great Messenger has burned the uncleanness from their lips by the fiery coal of the spirit of God from off the altar of zealous service to God. At the Lord God’s call for willing volunteers, they have without any compulsion responded, “Here am I; send me.” Not from any earthly religious institution, but from the all-highest One, the King of heaven and earth, come the words of their commission: &quot;Go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed”; even tell the people who refuse to understand and to see and to make tender their hearts and be healed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">” How long shall such willing volunteers keep going and telling! Till dictators, till totalitarian rule, till the new order of the “abomination of desolation”, come into power and start regimenting all nations! No, but till they go out of power, being junked in “the lake of fire and brimstone”. The specific command from the great Commissioner of Jehovah’s witnesses is: &quot;Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate, and the Lord have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.” (Isa. 6:1-12) That means till the door-to-door work is useless because there are no people in the houses to answer your doorbell ringing, because God has wiped out all who have refused to heed his message by his witnesses; and the cities that mischievously framed laws and mobbed you out of town have suffered the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah. (Matt. 10:13-15) Here, then, is the “Go ahead” signal from the Highest Authority to keep going on in his &quot;strange work” of witness no matter what happens before Armageddon comes and desolates the earth of the “goat” class. Fear not what may stare you in the face. The spirit of the Lord upon you He will not remove; that invincible power will stay with you and bring you off more than conquerors by Christ Jesus. His word in your mouths will not fail you, as long as you keep your lips clean from paralyzing fear of creatures and clean from religion. Men may take away from you the Watch Tower publications explaining God’s Word, but then you will have the Bible itself to use from house to house. That is more than the faithful disciples had in the days of Jesus and the apostles.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">19 . Bow long shall such service volunteers keep going, end what will equip and empower them to do </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">m?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>10</sup> Worldly authorities under the influence of religion may even rule that Jehovah's witnesses do not know how to use the Bible and it is injurious in their hands. So they may take away from you God’s own Book, but then you will have the word of God in your mouths, and they will have to muzzle your very mouths to silence the spoken word. That will not come until the protecting hand of the great Builder of the new heavens and new earth permits it; for He says: “I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.”—Isa. 51:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ARISE, SHINE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">” It would be foolish were God to put his spirit upon his devoted people and his word in their mouths and then approve when worldly governments assume to be the “higher powers” because ordained by the religious clergy and order God’s people to stop speaking His word and fulfilling their commission to preach by his spirit. God cannot deny himself, and is not the author of confused orders. His order stands written beyond recall, and was reserved for this day of world darkness, and it is this: “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of Jehovah is risen upon thee. For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples; but Jehovah will arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.” (Isa. 60:1,2, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font8"> Do puny men crowned or ordained by the religious Hierarchy or receiving their power from the consent of the governed people think that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font8"> can prevent the carrying out of this covenant of Almighty God Jehovah! Has his word of command ever returned to him void in failure to accomplish that which he pleased! As well let such self-important worldly rulers try to keep God’s creation the sun from rising in the morning of the new day as for them to try to successfully block the carrying out of the divine command to get up and shine with the light of Jehovah’s glory. (Isa. 55: 10,11) If the rulers loved the light of truth and righteousness they would not be prejudiced and rebel against it just because it comes from Jehovah God and not from religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ But to whom is the command “Arise, shine 1” directed! and who is in position to respond because Jehovah’s glory is risen upon such one! Is it the religious organization of “Christendom”! Impossible ! “Organized religion” of “Christendom” has for fifteen centuries tried to convert the world to its reli-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">20 Will removal of the Bible itself silence the message, and may it yet be silenced?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">21 . (a) Does God approve of governmental interference with bis orders to. his people, and what order has he reserved for the time of ^torld darkness<sup>7</sup> (b) Can governments block the carrying out of this order? 22. (a&gt; To whom is the command “Arise, shine<sup>1</sup>&quot; addressed, and who is qualified to respond? (b) How has Jehovah's glory risen upon her<sup>7</sup> </span><span class="font8">gion, and the world was never in as black a darkness as right now, and “organized religion” has no message from God’s Word for the people. With her traditions of men she gropes around in the blackness with the worldly elements, not knowing whither bound. And in their darkness, which they love, they fight against Jehovah’s witnesses. Jehovah’s command at Isaiah 60:1,2 is directed to someone in the feminine gender, and hence to Jehovah’s “woman”, that is, his organization “Zion”, and to whom he now says: “Sing, 0 barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, . . . For thy Maker is thy husband; Jehovah of hosts is his name.” (Isa. 54:1, 5, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font8"> The glory of her “husband” has risen upon Zion because the long period of travailing in pain waiting to be delivered ended in A.D. 1914. There God’s “woman” gave birth to the glorious capital organization long promised, Jehovah’s Righteous Government of the new world and of which his Son Christ Jesus is the installed King and Head. (Rev. 12:1-5) The Theocratic Government is born unto life eternal. The Theocracy, the Kingdom of God by Christ Jesus, is the light of the new world. Jehovah’s glorious light shines with approval upon that Government as the Rightful Rule, and light from Jehovah God upon his holy Word, the Bible, comes only through that glorious Government. All those who turn their faces away from that Theocratic Government and who look to the religious-totalitarian “New World order” of men are in death-dealing darkness.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">“ Who possibly could be opposed to such a blessed Government of light and life? Satan, who is “the god of this world”, and all the demons of which he is the “prince” are wickedly opposed to it All human creatures, rulers and ruled, who oppose that Theocratic Government and who advocate for some man-made political substitute put themselves on the side of and under the power of the demons, whether they like to be told that fact or not. It is their own decision, and there are only the two great opposing governments in the universe between which to decide. Because the world rulers have listened to the propaganda of religion and, with religion’s approval and “blessing” and backing, have held on to their rulerships and scornfully rejected the administration of the earth by God through his Son, therefore the darkness now covers the earth, that is, the visible organization operated by worldly officials. Through their co-operation with religion in refusing to submit to the direct rule of the Theocratic King Christ Jesus the peoples are kept in gross darkness, as thick as that which covered the earth at its creation. (Job 38:9) It is not Jehovah God that would keep it thus</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">23. (ft) Who oppose the Theocratic Government of light and life, and in what mental condition doe* their opposition put them? (b) What choice, therefore, are individuals now responsible to make! </span><span class="font8">dark, for he commands his organization to arise and shine. It is the demons that would keep all mankind in pitch-black darkness, and they use religious leaders and political rulers that lend themselves to the demons as instruments to keep the peoples in the dark concerning the Rightful Rule of the earth. It is now the responsibility of individuals among all peoples to choose whether to obey men and stay in the darkness or to obey Jehovah God and come into the light. To remain in the darkness means to abide under the wrath of God, and to abide there means death and destruction at Armageddon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">** Jehovah’s witnesses, upon whom he has put his spirit and in whose mouths he has put his word, must obey God and rise up and shine. The enemies of the light and truth of The Theocracy tried to keep them down by dealing them what seemed like a knock-out blow at the climax of the World War in 1918. But the Redeemer came to Zion and its temple and raised them up out of the dust and darkness. Now keeping God’s command, they will never again obey opponents of his kingdom and lie prone in the dust. Zion has arisen to shine for all time, because, by the King’s coming to the temple, Jehovah has arisen with favor upon his organization, particularly the faithful remnant thereof on earth. His glory is seen upon the remnant in that he has honored them in making them his witnesses and the ambassadors for his established and acting Government. They are privileged to receive its light and transmit it on to others who sit in darkness longing for the light. They must “shew forth the praises of him who hath called [them] out of darkness into his marvellous light”. (1 Pet. 2:9) To fail or refuse to do so would be falling down on the terms of their commission. The non-performance of their God-given commission would mean annihilation, being cut off from God’s organization and from life. Regardless of the course of individuals, Jehovah God will have an organization that will never fail to shine reflecting His glory light. Blessed are all those who keep integrity and abide immovable in that organization. “O Jehovah . . . they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glory of the majesty of his kingdom. Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion en-dureth throughout all generations.”—Ps. 145:10-13, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>

Those who have long groped in darkness of religion have difficulty for some time in adjusting their eyes of understanding to the light. However, the light is Jehovah God’s light, and there is healing in its beams. There can be only one result to the continual, steady, persistent shining of that light. True, it will cause the demons and all their bedarkened dupes to range up in hostility and to order a universal blackout. But no earthly creatures can black-out the sun or the moon, neither the heavenly light of the Kingdom of glory. The sure result of the shining is foretold in the Word of God and must have fulfillment, namely: “And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising. Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side. Then thou shalt see, and flow together [become bright (Koun/s)], and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee. The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall shew forth the praises of the Lord. All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.”—Isa. 60:3-7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>16</sup> That prophecy denotes a great contest between the power of darkness and the power of light. That prophecy was spoken with God’s full foreknowledge that the “abomination of desolation” would be set up by world rulers and be made to stand in the holy place and try to eclipse the light of the true kingdom of God. When God spoke he knew that the totalitarian “king of the north”, with “the king of the south” consenting, would plant the tabernacles of his “new order” in between the “mountain” of God’s kingdom and the “seas”, to prevent the abundance of the “sea” from being turned to that kingdom. (Matt. 24:15; Mark 13:14; Dan. 11:45) Lift up your eyes round about, then, and see. Has the prophetic assurance of the infallible Jehovah God been fulfilled?</span></p>

(Rev. 20:4,6) It is so declared at Revelation 21: 24: “And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it; and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it.” Christ Jesus enthroned is the “prince of the kings of the earth”. (Rev. 1:5) Besides those of the remnant, now gathered and who are the sons and daughters of Zion, being spiritual Israelites, do you see being gathered to the brightness of Zion’s rising the “Gentiles”, that is, persons of good-will ‘out of all nations, kindreds, people and tongues’? Do you see an abundant number converted from the “sea” of the peoples alienated from God and supporting the Devil’s organization? Do you see the Good Shepherd bringing in his “other sheep” into the fold? and are they coming with their offerings of heart devotion and zealous service which find acceptance upon Jehovah’s altar? Has Jehovah glorified the temple of his glory so that these choose to serve him day and night in the courts of his temple, serving as witnesses of Jehovah in company with the remnant of the temple class? The honest answer of all persons informed on the facts and observing the proclamation of the Kingdom message and the results thereof must be a decided Yes! And were there nothing more than what has already been attained, it is marvelous in our eyes, it is Jehovah’s doing, and it would seem sufficient to constitute a fulfillment of prophecy in vindication of Jehovah’s word and name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">DENSE AS A CLOUD, SWIFT AS DOVES</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ There may, however, be still larger results to the fulfillment of the prophecy, and well may we so expect. By God’s grace the work is not yet finished and his witnesses refuse to quit as long as the Lord provides work, blessed work. This is suggested in the prophet’s next exclamation: “Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?” (Isa. 60:8) This is a cloud of witnesses, witnessing to the power and glory and presence of the Lord as a literal cloud in the sky does. This cloud, though, is different from that cloud of witnesses the apostle Paul mentions as composed of the faithful men of old who shall shortly be given a better resurrection out of death and be made “princes in all the earth” under The Theocracy.—Heb. 12:1.</span></p>

Doves were offered as sacrifices by the poorest of the land, and the figure “doves” may mean that such flight of further Kingdom publishers shall come from the people who have been greatly impoverished by the total war for world domination, especially those who are “poor in spirit”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>so</sup> There are multitudes of isles, and if these are to yield up those who have waited for God’s Rule to come, then there must be a multitude of such. The ancient ships of Tarshish made long journeys to far points, and the use of them as symbols would show that persons who have by circumstances been separated far from the Lord by previous opposition through blindness and misunderstanding of the Lord shall be brought into relationship with Jehovah’s organization. All such shall come and have part in the educational and constructive work of the Lord’s organization; for the time of God’s favor is come for all those seeking his organization. This is suggested in the following words of the prophet: “Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the Lord thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee. And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.”—Isa. 60: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>11</sup> Likening Zion unto the city where Jehovah has placed his name and where his King of The Theocracy reigns, Jehovah addresses her and says: “Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought.” (Isa. 60:11) The gates open continually day and night signifies freedom from fear of all enemies and that the angel guards are on the job. It means that Jehovah’s “strange work” of ingathering will go on day and night by his publishers and that the refugees escaping unto the Lord from all nations or Gentiles will steadily be brought in before Jehovah’s Chief Executioner destroys those outside, and that the enemy action will not close those gates to any fleeing there during this “day of salvation”. (Isa. 49:8; 2 Cor. 6:2) It is expected that Jehovah God, shortly before Armageddon breaks, will grant the faithful men of old from Abel to John the Baptist to be raised from the dead.

<p><span class="font8">“ All organizations of men, whether national, religious, or commercial, that do not turn to Jehovah’s capital organization will be blotted out at Armageddon. Let those religious leaders and public officials who guide in the counsels of the nations and who advocate for a political, man-run “New World order” consider the next words of the prophet addressed to Zion: “For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.” (Isa. 60:12) As for God’s organization, there shall be no desolate and waste condition therein. Says Jehovah to Zion: “The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.” (Isa. 60:13) The “glory of [mount] Lebanon” was its forests of trees here named, clothing its sides, exhaling a healthy, refreshing fragrance, “the smell of Lebanon” (Cant. 4:11), while, high above, the peaks of Lebanon, the highest in Palestine, glistened with patches of snow both in summer and in winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ Such evergreen trees beautifully picture God’s anointed witnesses who are commissioned by the anointing of his spirit of power to preach the good news of the Kingdom, “that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that lie might be glorified.” (Isa. 61:1-3) The place of Jehovah’s sanctuary or temple is in his organization Zion, and there his feet stand as he wields universal domination through his anointed King, Christ Jesus. (1 Chron. 28: 2) The King is the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, and through him Jehovah makes the place of his feet glorious. The other “trees of righteousness” share with Christ Jesus in the vindication of Jehovah’s name and in proving the Devil a base liar. The remnant thereof on earth stand like evergreens as witnesses to Jehovah’s name and kingdom. No ax of the enemy will ever be able to cut them down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ Jehovah’s anointed remnant and their companions have endured great persecution because they uncompromisingly stand for the worship of Jehovah and give their devotion totally to The Theocratic Government and persistently and boldly proclaim the Kingdom to all nations as God commands. Today they are hated of all nations, without exception, proving that they are not friends of this world and are no part of it. They are of the new world of God’s creation and wherein dwells righteousness.</span></p>

What is symbolized by the trees with which Jehovab beautifies the place of bis sanctuary, and bow does be glorify tbe place of bls feet’ 34 Why are Jehovah's remnant and companions hated and afflicted every* where, and what is prophesied concerning some of those at present taking part in mistreating Jenovab’a people?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">They are afflicted, despised, avoided, and forsaken, and called by names which the religionists invent to misrepresent them and increase the persecution upon them. Many honest persons, like Saul of Tarsus, have been misled by religion to take part in such mistreatment of Zion’s children. But Jehovah God is gracious during this short period before Armageddon. If any of those misled ones faces the light, gets his eyes opened, and turns in repentance and conversion to Jehovah and his King and subjects himself to these “Higher Powers”, Jehovah permits him to find refuge under the capital organization Zion. Many of suchlike have already come. The prophecy indicates there are yet others to come. “And the sons [children of organizations] of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee The city of Jehovah, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel. Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man passed through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations. Thou shait also suck the milk of the nations, and shait suck the breast of kings; and thou shait know that I, Jehovah, am thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”—Isa. 60:14-16, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot; The remnant of Zion and their earthly companions now know that fact clearly. They repeat Psalm 3:8: “Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah: thy blessing be upon thy people.” </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font8"> It would therefore be a violation of their clear knowledge and also of their enlightened consciences for them to do reverence to earthly creatures and things and to ascribe salvation and protection to such. On that issue there can be no halting between two opinions, no compromise. “Salvation to our God . . . and unto the Lamb.”—Rev. 7 :10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THE RIGHT RULE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">” At the actual establishment of The Theocratic Government (in 1914) and the coming of its King to Jehovah’s temple or sanctuary (in 1918) for the judgment of the house of God, there must come an all-round improvement in the earthly, visible part of God’s organization, the remnant of Zion. There must be a taking away of all that which the King at the temple judges to be religious wood, hay, and stubble, which do not stand the fire of divine judgment. That which is durable and approved and precious to the Lord God must be brought in. All confusion and controversies within must be done away with, and right order must be set up, that peace,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">35 What fact do the remnant and companions now know concerning salvation, and what course of action would be a violation of such knowledge and enlightened conscience?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">36 After the Lord’s coming to the temple in 1918 what all-round improvement In the visible part of God’s organisation must follow, and how did Isaiah’s prophecy describe this? </span><span class="font8">prosperity and righteousness may prevail in the organization. The Theocratic rule is the only rule that befits Jehovah’s organization and that secures these desired things. This rule from the Higher Powers in heaven was set up over the remnant of Zion and their companions, particularly from 1938 onward. The disturbers, the “elective elders” and the “evil servant” class who violently smite their brethren and cause waste and destruction to the Kingdom interests, and other “workers of iniquity”, the Lord cleared out by his angels. This taking the situation in hand for the betterment of the organization and to His praise Jehovah symbolically foretold in the next words: “For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness. Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shait call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.”—Isa. 60: 17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">” Statesmen, economists and clergymen predict the reconstruction of this present evil world as due to follow this war for world domination. Trusting in their own brains and arm of flesh, such worldbuilders look forward to building an international organization with military walls of defense which men may call their salvation. When and if you enter the gates of this “New World order” you will, as a condition, have to praise the organization and its super-government and its religious, political, commercial builders and the “god of this world”, or else you cannot live and get along in it. The people now hearing the Kingdom message must determine whether to go along with and look to such worldbuilders for relief and deliverance, or to turn to the glorious Theocratic Government which Jehovah has builded and seek refuge under it. ‘As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so Almighty God Jehovah is round about his organization,’ and therefore its walls are salvation unto life eternal in prosperity, peace and perfect health. Those who enter its gates do not forget God and praise creature men, but they praise Jehovah the great Theocrat and Christ Jesus his glorious King of righteousness.</span></p>

We shall see the day when the sun of our </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font8">prien is the sun of righteousness, and when that sun will rise with healing in its wings.’ ” There is no report that the religious clergymen there assembled objected to such human, nationalistic interpretation of the sacred prophecy concerning the “sun of righteousness”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">&quot; The reader is now privileged to compare that with Jehovah God’s own interpretation thereof as given in his next words addressed to his organization Zion: “The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but Jehovah will be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; for Jehovah will be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.” (Isa. 60:19,20, A.R.F.) The corresponding prophecy at Revelation 21: 23 reads: “And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb [Christ Jesus] is the light thereof.” Soon, therefore, the “rising sun” of Japan and the religious-political rule of all nations forgetting Jehovah God will set at Armageddon; but the heaven-</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>40</sup> Walking henceforth in the light of Jehovah as reflected by his capital organization under Christ Jesus, the faithful remnant and their loyal companions will never put forth their hands to the unrighteousness of this world and its “new order” and will never be moved away from The Theocracy. For their comfort the promise is made to Zion: “Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified. The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one a strong nation: I, Jehovah, will hasten it in its time.” (Isa. 60:21, 22, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font8"> Now appears to be the time; and if the Lord God Almighty </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">hastens</span><span class="font8"> the things promised in this time, then the time is short. The Lord can and will give strength to the remnant of his “holy nation” to carry on under all conditions to the finish of the “strange work”. If the ingathering of the “other sheep” seems small compared to earth’s vast population, Jehovah, who gives the increase, can make one to “become a thousand”. Let us have patience, then. He will hasten what He has purposed, at the right time in the near future. Let us be faithful to his command to “arise and shine”. Let us keep on reflecting the only light in the darkness of this world, that “he might be glorified”.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark26"></a>BAPTISM</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font7">HE prophet Elisha was anointed as prophet in the room of Elijah, his companion. Elisha, when approached by Naaman the leper to be cured, instructed him to wash in the Jordan river seven times. Naaman the Syrian obeyed, dipping himself seven times beneath the Jordan’s waters, and was healed. That was a water baptism.—2 Kings 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By the prophet Malachi God prophesied that he would send the prophet Elijah before the coming of the great and terrible day of Jehovah. (Mal. 4: 5, 6) To the father of John the Baptist God’s angel foretold the child’s birth and applied to him that prophecy. Thirty years later Christ Jesus applied to John the same prophecy, saying of John: “And if ye will receive it, this is Elias [Elijah], which was for to come.” (Matt. 11:14) John as the forerunner of Jesus came baptizing the repentant Jews in the waters of the Jordan, and warned of wrath to come, a baptism of fire of destruction. Thus the prophecy concerning the coming of Elijah was fulfilled in miniature. (Matt. 3:1-12; 17:11-13) John’s baptism was for individuals of the nation of Israel, which nation was unfaithful to its national baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fifteen centuries before John the nation of Israel was baptized unto God’s prophet Moses, who led them forth from bondage in Egypt out into the freedom of God’s chosen people. That baptism took place when the miraculous cloud of God’s guiding presence covered them from the pursuing Egyptians; and under cover of this cloud they followed Moses through the divided Red sea, with walls of water on each side of them. Thereafter, when the Egyptians were on the way through, the waters of the Red sea closed in upon them. That too was a baptism, but unto destruction, because the Egyptians were not baptized unto Jehovah’s prophet but were violently opposed to him and sought the destruction of Jehovah’s baptized ones. Concerning this the apostle Paul says: “Brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.” (1 Cor. 10:1,2) That was the baptism of a whole nation at one time. It was unto the prophet whom Jehovah had raised up to foreshadow the Greater Prophet yet to come, namely, Christ Jesus. (Deut. 18:15-18; Acts 3:20-23 ; 7:36,37) It took place before the destruction of the Egyptian persecutors, and which destruction foreshadowed the climax of the battle of Armageddon at the end of the world. There was, however, a still earlier baptism than this one at the Red sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first baptism in human history was upon all those who should escape the destruction of the old world and enter alive into the cleansed earth. This was in the days of Noah, who built the ark at God’s command, to survive the great flood. Noah was also a “preacher of righteousness” and he warned of the terrible baptism of destruction that was to come. Before the breaking forth of the flood seven persons, namely, Noah’s household of his wife and married children, came to him in the ark, “and the </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord </span><span class="font7">[Jehovah] shut him in.” (Gen. 7:13-16) Thus, being covered in the ark and thereby hidden from sight of all the world outside, those seven were baptized unto Noah. Concerning this the apostle Peter says: “The longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water. The like figure whereunto, even </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">baptism,</span><span class="font7"> doth also now save us, (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.” (1 Pet. 3:20,21) That baptism unto Noah in the ark was unto salvation from destruction with the world. The overflowing of all those outside the ark with a watery deluge was the baptism of a whole world in destruction. This becomes of vital meaning to us today in the light of Jesus’ words concerning the end of the world: “And as it was in the days of No'e, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.” (Luke 17:26,27) Since 1914 the world has been in its “time of the end” and the great deluge of fire of the world’s destruction at Armageddon is impending. Therefore the greater need appears for the persons who want to escape that baptism of fire to enter into the ark of God’s organization and be baptized unto the Greater Noah, Christ Jesus. He is Jehovah’s Savior for those who will be spared through Armageddon and inherit life in the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In 1918 Jehovah’s Messenger came to the temple to begin judgment at the house of God. For forty years before that date he was preparing the way before Jehovah God with the end in view of making ready a people for Jehovah’s name who should be his witnesses, to declare His name and kingdom throughout all the earth. That preparatory work was called the “Elijah work” of the church. Because John the Baptist in his day did a work in miniature fulfillment of the prophetic work of Elijah, that forty-year preparation was also called the “John the Baptist work”. Just as the prophet Elisha was raised up in the room or stead of Elijah, so, after the Lord’s coming to the temple, the “Elisha work” was begun. It was carried on in the stead of the Elijah work which had been taken away or killed by the enemies in 1918 in the throes of the World War. Elisha did a work in connection with God’s anointed one, Captain Jehu, who became king of Israel. Jehu was anointed and used of Jehovah to destroy wicked queen Jezebel and all the Baal-worshipers in Israel. Jehu also took into association with himself a man whose heart was right, namely, Jonadab, and together they rode in the chariot to the slaying of the religionists or devil-worshipers. Such slaughter work foreshadowed the destruction of the religionists and of Satan’s organization, his “woman”, at the end of the Elisha work, or Jehovah’s “strange work”. Such “strange work” is still going on, and the part which the men Elijah, Elisha, and John the Baptist had to play in foreshadowing that “strange work” and the preparatory work preceding it lays further emphasis on the importance of being baptized unto Jehovah’s Deliverer, Christ Jesus, now, before Armageddon. Not only spiritual Israelites, but also the modern Jonadabs, have need of such baptism unto salvation through God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Perfect Pattern for baptism is Christ Jesus. He was not baptized for the purpose of his own salvation, because he was “holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners”. (Heb. 7:26) Why, then, was he dipped beneath Jordan’s waters by John the Baptist? And was he baptized with “John’s baptism”? (Luke 7:29; Acts 1:22; 19 : 3. 4) His sinlessness answers No to that question, because John’s act was a “baptism of repentance” and Jesus had no sins whereof to repent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Furthermore, John was not sent to baptize Gentiles, but those of his own nation, the Jews, who had been brought into covenant relationship with God through Moses their mediator. The natural Jews had fallen away from their covenant through disobedience and religion, and now the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, was at hand. Therefore the Jews needed to be brought to a condition of repentance and to return to covenant-keeping, in order to be prepared to receive and be baptized unto the Greater Moses. Just as the animals sacrificed on Israel’s atonement day were pictorial and their blood did not actually take away human sin, so the immersion in water did not actually wash away the sins. It was merely symbolical of repentance and a turning away from sin and religion and coming into covenantrelationship with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus, being without sin and being the Greater Moses and Mediator of the new covenant, was therefore immersed for a different reason than the repentant Jews were. The fact that John objected to baptizing Jesus and said that, instead, he ought to be baptized by Jesus, proves this. What, then, did Jesus’ water baptism symbolize? and is it confined only to the Jews after the flesh? The prophecy of the Psalms and also God’s own interpretation thereof by his inspired apostle Paul gives us the correct answer. Quoting from Psalm forty, verses six to eight, the apostle writes of Jesus at the time of his baptism, at w’hich time he was laid as the foundation of the new world: “Wherefore, when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering [with animal victims] thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me. In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure: then said I [Jesus], Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, 0 God. Above, when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure therein ; which are offered by the law; then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, 0 God.” (Heb. 10: 5-9) Hence, when John objected to dipping Jesus, that Perfect One answered, “Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.” That Jesus did no wrong in offering himself for water immersion is proved; for, when he came up out of the water, God’s voice came from heaven, saying : “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” —Matt. 3:13-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is clear, therefore, that the water immersion of the Son of God was an open symbol before witnesses of his consecration to God and his agreement thereby to do Jehovah’s will even to the death. The covenant and laws of Israel were prophetic and foreshadowed God’s will for the future, and Christ Jesus entered into a compact with his Father to do God’s will as expressed in God’s covenant with his people. Jesus’ being plunged beneath the water symbolized his death and burial unto his human will. Being raised out of the w’aters pictured his being raised by God’s spirit (or power) to do the work and will of God set before him henceforth. Thus the water act was preceded by Jesus’ real baptism inwardly in his heart. This real baptism led to great suffering on his part, and to this his apostle refers, saying: “Even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin.”—1 Pet. 2:21,22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus’ example for us, therefore, includes water immersion. Whoever, therefore, would walk in his footsteps, following his example, must first undergo the real inward baptism, by denying himself and coming to do God’s will. Said Jesus: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” This is because he is the propitiation for our sins. (John 14:6; 1 John 2:1,2) Also it is written concerning pleasing God: “Without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.” (Heb. 11:6) Hence, before anyone can receive water baptism he must become acquainted with Jehovah God and believe that He is. He must accept God’s Word and believe that Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s Son and is the Lamb of sacrifice for our sins and must seek approach to God through Christ Jesus. Then with such faith in Jehovah God and Christ Jesus his King, and repenting of all past sins and converting or turning from sin and the world, he gives himself completely to Jehovah God to forever after do God’s will as revealed in his Word and through his Kingdom. Only this Scriptural course will lead to acceptance with God and to having one’s act of consecration acknowledged by him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of his acts of doing God’s will should be, as early as possible after consecration, to do as our great Example Jesus did, namely, be immersed in water, to give outward symbolic testimony of having devoted himself to God and His endless service. Such water baptism is not a symbol of one’s being baptized into the spiritual body of Christ, with hope of life in heaven. Whether that shall follow later, after one has proved himself in God’s service, is for God’s will to determine. The one baptized makes no bargain with the Lord and does not attempt to dictate what God’s will shall be concerning himself.—Rom. 6: 3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus sent forth his disciples with the instruction: “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy [spirit] ; teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you.” (Matt. 28:19,20) Therefore this water baptism toward you is performed in the name, that is, by the authority, of Jehovah God the Father and through Christ Jesus the Son, and with the spirit or holy power of God, which spirit of power is the commission of authority to do this. Hence, when you present yourself to the one baptizing in water, your baptism will be performed with this understanding and in the spirit of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before proceeding with your baptism it is proper, first, that you answer affirmatively these questions to show you are taking this step with the Scriptural understanding thereof and are fit for baptism as a devoted servant of the Lord, fully responsible to Him:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7">(1) Do you believe in Jehovah God the Father, that “salvation belongeth unto Jehovah”, and that Christ Jesus is his Son in whose blood your sins are washed away and by whom salvation comes to you from God?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(2) Have you therefore confessed your sins to God and asked for cleansing by Christ Jesus, and therefore turned away from sin and the world, and consecrated yourself without reservation to God to do his will?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">Your answer, being Yes, is testimony that you are worthy and in line for water baptism in obedience to God’s will.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark27"></a>WHY IS THE TRUTH OPPOSED?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH, the Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, is righteous and all things with him are righteous. “The </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font7"> is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.” (Ps. 145:17) “For the righteous </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord </span><span class="font7">loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.” (Ps. 11: 7) Likewise Jehovah’s beloved Son is righteous, holy and pure; and because he loves righteousness at all times Jehovah has exalted him to the highest place next to the Almighty himself. “Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.&quot;—Ps. 45: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Who could hate Jehovah God, and who could plant hatred in the mind of another against the Almighty God, who is love? Only the wicked one, Satan the DeviL His name Satan means adversary or opposer of God. Satan is the prince of the world, from the time of Eden onward to Armageddon, and the entire world is under the power and influence of Satan, that wicked one. (John 12: 31, 1 John 5:19) Therefore all creatures that hate Jehovah, the Almighty God, are the servants of the Devil. All who hate the Lord Jesus Christ are likewise servants of the Devil. All who hate the faithful servants of God and Christ are also of the Devil. These scriptures should convince all sincere persons who desire righteousness that those who hate Jehovah’s witnesses and persecute them are instruments of “that wicked one”, who hates God and Christ, and that all such opposers of Jehovah and his kingdom are doomed for destruction. But why does the world hate the Lord Jesus Christ, as stated in the Bible? His answer is: ‘The world hateth me because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.’ (John 7:7) The world hates all who faithfully follow in the footsteps of Jesus by giving testimony to Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What is meant in these texts just cited by the term “the world”? The people and nations of earth that are under the influence of demons, of which Satan the Devil is the prince or chief of demons, constitute the world that lies in the wicked one. (1 John 5:19, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott')</span><span class="font7"> The world is made up chiefly of three ruling elements, to wit: religion, politics, and commerce; and all persons who thus rule practice some kind of religion, which is demonism, because their practice is contrary to God’s Word. The world, therefore, consists of the organization of the peoples of earth into forms of government which are dominated by the power and influence of the invisible overlord, Satan. The new world will consist of all people who survive Armageddon, and who love righteousness and hate wickedness, and such will live on the earth under the supervision and control of the invisible, righteous overlord, Christ the King. Thus it is seen that all people and all nations must now be separated or divided into two classes, that those who love righteousness and who serve righteousness shall live, and that those who choose wickedness shall be destroyed. “The </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font7"> preserveth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.”—Ps. 145: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The name Devil means traducer or slanderer. The name Jehovah God means the Almighty’s purpose toward his creatures. The Devil began to defame the name of Almighty God when he told the first lie to Eve. From that time till now the Devil has constantly slandered the name of Jehovah, and the Devil has caused multitudes of creatures to become slanderers and haters of the name of Almighty God. For this purpose the Devil put Nimrod forward as one equal to or above God, and hence Nimrod was honored as “a mighty one” “before the </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord”.</span><span class="font7"> (Gen. 10: 8-10) Nimrod was the leader of the first organization of religion following the flood. The Devil and his servants have continuously reproached the name of Jehovah God; and His beloved Son, Christ Jesus, has always magnified the name of Jehovah. For that reason the Devil has continuously reproached the name of Jesus Christ. For this reason it is written of Christ Jesus: “The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.”—Ps. 69: 7, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every creature who has been faithful to Almighty God has suffered reproach, slander, opposition, persecution and cruelty. The faithful men of old, from Abel onward, suffered all manner of reproach and cruel punishment for the reason that they were for and declared the name of Almighty God and his coming kingdom. No one who loved God could be guilty of inflicting punishment upon those faithful men who proclaimed the name of Almighty God. The Devil was the one who brought reproach upon them and caused their suffering, and this the Devil did because those faithful men proclaimed the name of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the very day that Jesus began to proclaim the name and kingdom of Jehovah the Devil opposed him and sought to bring about his destruction. (Matt. 4:1-11) The Devil and his associate demons continued to reproach, slander and persecute Jesus, and to falsely charge him with erime, and finally brought about his crucifixion. The faithful servants of Jesus Christ spend their days declaring the name of Jehovah and Christ Jesus the King, and the Devil and his agents constantly reproach them and persecute them. And why? Because they uphold the name of the Lord and joyfully proclaim his name and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">D E C LARATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Knorr:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Declaration unanimously adopted on Saturday, July 4, 1942, reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“By the Lord’s grace, we, 2,250 of Jehovah’s witnesses in Greater London, stand together as a body wholly united and fighting for The Theocracy. Jehovah gives us much strength, joy and a large portion of his spirit to enable us to stand firm in these times of great distress. We can testify how Jehovah answers the prayers of the righteous: ‘For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.’—1 Pet. 3:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“We thank the Lord for the continued stimulating truths so abundantly provided through </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> We will prove our faith m The Theocracy by our works. We refuse to break our covenant vows. The ‘abomination of desolation’ can never take away from us the joy of praising Jehovah’s name. Doubtless many dark days are ahead. The people of good-will look to Jehovah’s witnesses for comfort. We cannot forsake them. We seek to be diligent and obey the Lord’s invitation ‘Feed my sheep’ We declare our determination to use every possible opportunity now to do this work. We will stand blameless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“As a city compact together we face with full confidence in the Lord the threatening Assyrian entry into the land of Jehovah Victory lies with The Theocracy, the Holy City. Come what may, we are ready and willing to bear whatever reproaches and persecution the Lord may permit to the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“As another season of spiritual refreshing from the hand of the Lord, we keenly look forward to the convention in September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“We express to you and our American brethren our warm love and greetings. Unitedly with our brethren world-wide we shout ‘Hallelujah’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;THE WISE” TESTIMONY PERIOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The month of October is known by Jehovah’s witnesses as “The Wise” Testimony Period. During that month the servants of Jehovah will put forth an extraordinary effort to magnify the name of the Lord and to advertise his kingdom in the earth. It is good to serve the Lord and to aid others, and those persons who are wise will put forth every effort to aid those who love righteousness to seek the truth. In Proverbs, chapter 8, verse 31 onward, this thought is brought to our attention, “Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. Blessed is the man that heareth me, . . . for whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the Lord ” During “The Wise” Testimony Period Jehovah’s witnesses will offer to the people the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hope, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on a contribution of 25c, so that the people of good-will may receive instruction and be wise. All persons who love righteousness and want to help others find the way to life and learn of Jehovah’s kingdom will share in the witness work during this period If you are not already associated with a company of Jehovah’s witnesses and would like to be, write to Watchtower, 117 Adams St, Brooklyn, N. Y., and we will get you m touch with the nearest company, so you may share with these servants of the Lord in the proclamation of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">gdom In these perplexing times the wise man will seek the Lord and share his knowledge with others, so “that we may be able to comfort them which are m any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">VICTORY IN LOUISIANA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The judge would not let us three special publishers out on bond, pending our trial, unless we would promise not to go in the witness work until our trial. This we would not do; so we stayed in jail from June 13 until June 23. We appeared before the court June 22. After the prosecution presented their witnesses and evidence we filed the first motion to dismiss. The copies of the court decisions sent us by the Society were presented in support of the motion to dismiss, and the two Louisiana Supreme Court decisions were read aloud. We reminded the court that these two decisions were controlling in spite of the more recent U. S. Supreme Court decision. The judge said he wanted time to look into these and would give his decision the next day. Apparently much pressure had been put upon the judge by the rest of the officials, but the following day in court he made his position very clear and let it be known that he could not- let public opinion or prejudice or even his own personal feelings influence his decision. He is a devout Roman Catholic, but stated that even though his belief was not like ours it was still his duty to uphold the law; that he had to abide by the Louisiana Supreme Court decision, since the U. S. Supreme Court decision is not final and, upon a rehearing, may be reversed. He also read in court the article on ‘Religion’, from the June 22 issue of T----. This judge was really put ‘on the spot’ by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">rest of the official element, but so far he seems determined to uphold American principles. This experience has made us realize more clearly than ever before that ‘the arm of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font7"> is not shortened’ and that the </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watchtower </span><span class="font7">is His visible organization. We hope that this will help the people of good-will here to boldly take their stand for Jehovah and his Theocracy. We three were found ‘not guilty’ and released June 23.” (Natchitoches, La.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">IF THE CONDUCTOR GOES TO JAIL (HENLEY, ENG.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A lady with whom I have been conducting a regular Bible model study promised to arrange for a meeting on Sunday evening, inviting some friends of hers. When I arrived there were eight persons present, and we quickly got down to a study of ‘The Soul’. All had Bibles and booklets. After our study together all were greatly impressed and interested. They seemed to fully appreciate the truth as shown in the Scriptures. One said it was a pity the ‘Rev.’ was not present, which was followed by much laughter, and statements to the effect that he would not dare come anyway; he had recently told them to burn the books of Jehovah’s witnesses. After I left they had a discussion on the matter, and one lady said: ‘Now, what do you think of this? I have been burning the books which I should have read. This is just what I have been wanting.’ They are all realizing what a great fraud religion is. At the time, these people said they would not miss next Sunday for anything, although it meant they would have to miss their usual meeting at the local chapel. When next Sunday came, all were present. The question was asked: “What shall we do if Mr. R---- [myself] is removed to prison!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The answer immediately came from one of the others: 'We have the AfodeZ </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Study</span><span class="font7"> booklets and the Bible; we can continue ourselves.’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">PROGRESS IN NORTHERN IRELAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“In Holywood we have commenced a group study. One person of good-will with whom we have a model study did not know of our work before we first met her two months ago, and she has now opened her home for the study. The Society’s representative was with us to start the study and there was a total attendance of seven, including four persons of good-will whom we recently found. One of these came out in the service with us this week. She enjoyed the experience so much that she said, ‘Where will you be working at the week-end! Could I join you!’ and so was with us Saturday and Sunday, reporting seven hours of field service this week. Many persons who were first prejudiced against us are now appreciating the truth and defending it before others. We find many of the ‘goat’ class, but the few ‘sheep’ that we meet make up for all the opposition we encounter, and we carry on rejoicing in our privilege of full-time service for The Theocracy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">AFOOT! (SWEETWATER, TEXAS)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“In spite of the disadvantage of not having an automobile to cover the rurals, we have overcome that difficulty. Within a period of one week we covered a radius of eight miles from one point. During that time approximately ninety miles was covered, entirely by walking. We were accosted by the sheriff the first day out. He warned us that if he received another complaint he would make immediate arrest. As a result of our efforts 150 booklets and 4 bound books were placed. Evidently he did not get another complaint. This shoWs how territories can be covered in spite of shortages and wartime restrictions.” —Two pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“THE LAW” MAKES A VISIT (OKLAHOMA)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;At one of my back-calls several gathered at a home to hear the lectures played. The last one played was ‘Religion’; we had present colored, white, and Indian, twenty-one in all. Among them was one who was an American Legionnaire. After the lecture was through I asked if anyone had any questions. No one had any, nor made any remarks. I invited them back for the following Wednesday night, telling them to be sure to bring their Bibles, as we were to have a Bible study. The next Wednesday we were there as usual. It being a cold night, not many came out. Just before starting, a well-dressed man came in and was introduced. The lady of the house whispers across the room, ‘The law!’ I rather suspected it was, when he came in. We passed out the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font7"> booklet No. 1, together with the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered.</span><span class="font7"> It being our first study, the first few questions were very good. We commented to our visitor that we were sorry he did not have his Bible. After the meeting ‘the law’ remarked that he came out to see what was going on. I made no reply. Then he said: ‘I am 100 percent with you, as anyone that is trying to help the people to do better I am with them.’ Then when one of the men finished paying for his Bible ‘the law’ said he could make a contribution too. For the same he was given a sample copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and the booklets </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn.</span><span class="font7"> I invited him to come the next Wednesday night and bring any of his friends that he cared to. He has not been back. We have from six to eight attending, and more coming.”</span></p>

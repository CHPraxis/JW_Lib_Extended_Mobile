<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font5">HIS REPORT is made following the usual custom of this organization, and is made for the enlightenment, information and benefit of those who love God and Christ, and made a portion of the history of the human race, which has been confronted with the greater question for determination, to wit, world domination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Covering a period of many centuries the question of paramount importance has been constantly presented before the sane and thoughtful people who look and hope for a rule of the nations that will be for their benefit and bring humankind many blessings. ‘One generation cometh, and another generation goeth. Blessed be the name of the Lord !’ AU these years and generations there has persisted a determination to support that which is right, that a righteous government might be in the earth. Some have placed their individual benefit above that of others, while the great majority have had before their minds the consideration of what wifi result to the best welfare of aU.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where shaU creatures place themselves with respect to the two sides of the controversy? This question must be decided by each individual Where the advice and direction of humankind is f oUowed, it always leads to disaster, but where God’s Word is followed as the authoritative and sure guide, the result is always satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font5">The customary annual report has been delayed in issue this year, due to conditions over which the one who now attempts to dictate part of it had no control. A report presumes that there has been activity, and 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">when the activity to perform the work assigned by the Lord’s commission and as therein described has come to an end, the report must be made, but it is not always possible to make it in due time. The one to whom report is made, and the ones receiving it, having the same zeal toward the great Creator, will rejoice to have this report at whatsoever time it is possible. Certain fixed historical facts, the authenticity of which cannot be questioned, are here appropriate to restate, and their restatement and understanding is an essential to have a keener appreciation of what the report contains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The creation of the garden of Eden by the Almighty God, the great JEHOVAH, had come to an end, the wicked had risen, and, the conclusion of Jehovah’s judgments having been entered, the first man and his companion were expelled from Eden. The great rebel thought that he had succeeded in defeating the purpose of Almighty God. He had not! In sorrow, sickness and decay Adam and Eve had begun to perform their work as assigned to them, but little or no joy accompanied that service. The Devil, of course, was invisible to human eyes, but those of the human creation were visible. The invisible leader, Satan, the chief of demons, was pushing on. Approximately 1600 years had passed away, and rapidly the human race had increased, at which time the chief of demons, Satan the Devil, together with the other demons under his direct command, had brought about the debauch-ment of all humankind save Noah and his obedient children. Then came the Flood.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>CLIMAXES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">What had necessarily brought about the climaxes, rebellion and the Flood? The answer is, World Domination. Such was the issue, and continues thus to be to this hour. Under the terms of the divine mandate, restated by Jehovah to Noah, progressive work on behalf of those who served Almighty God continued to increase. In all the years of effort put forth to oppose Almighty God, God had used his faithful servants and witnesses. Religion has been the means employed by Satan to work on the sentimentality of the people, and he has used it in connection with his scheme to grab world control. As a result of his efforts to do so the greatest climax of all time is here, and the final showdown stands at the door. Let this be kept in mind by all, that the issue of predominating importance, from beginning to end, is and will be World Domination, and in this final climax every creature, by force of circumstances, will be compelled to voluntarily choose whether or not he shall place himself exactly in line with those faithful men who have preceded, with reference to the two sides of the controversy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>BEGINNING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is the very personification of right, righteousness, liberty and life. All organizations of creatures have failed to give such to mankind, and there is but one other place where all human creatures that live can find these blessings and benefits, and that is, The Theocracy. The end of demon rule is at hand; and what shall bring about the final end by Jehovah God? It is the same as that which stood up at the beginning of the rebellion, to wit, religion or demonism. Those who will stand “in that day” will be only the ones God describes by the words of Daniel as “the righteous”, that is to say, those who are unselfish supporters of The Theocracy, and who follow the lead of the great God of Eternity, and who are diligent at all times to hold up the banner of truth. Religion was the chief instrument in the building of Babylon; and the arbitrary rule that followed thereafter and since was the same as that which oppresses the people today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The unbroken line of prophecy and its fulfillment shows that the moving cause of the “Axis powers” is religion. Associated with religion are politics and commerce, because such are things upon which demonism has seized to carry out Satan’s purpose. The liberty-loving people, desiring peace, joy and righteousness, have operated the nations of the earth under the name and title of “democracies”. Their purpose was good, but the demons, Satan being the chief, overreached them, and the consequences are that now in these last days the demons stand in control of all worldly governments on earth, and no human government is operating without demon control and without religion. The second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ was that to which the people have looked forward, because Jesus emphasized it and because the apostles magnified his second coming. Upon earth there are a few Christians, whose hearts are set solely and fully upon the coming of The Kingdom, and about sixty years ago these organized themselves into a working body for the purpose of spreading “this gospel of the kingdom” according to God’s commandment. And now it is this organization, first known as “the Millennial Dawn”, and then International Bible Students Association, and then some other name, particularly Jehovah’s witnesses, that the Lord has chosen as his visible organization, its object being to make known the second coming of Christ.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ORGANIZED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">To hold title to property, both personal and real, that they might use the same for the support and onward movement of proclaiming the message of truth, that little body of Christians, in the year A.D. 1884, organized a corporation under the name of Zion’s Watchtower Society. Later the corporate name was changed to Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. That organization was incorporated under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania. To further aid the work of these Christian people, the Peoples Pulpit Association, a corporation, was created and organized under the membership corporation law of the State of New York and duly came into existence in the year 1908. Later the name of that corporation was changed and now is the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Incorporated, of New York. In the year 1914 a corporation, under the name and title of International Bible Students Association, was created and organized under the laws of Great Britain. The purposes of these three corporate bodies are exactly the same. They are similar to three living persons working together in different parts of the earth. The purpose announced in their charters respectively, is, to wit: “The dissemination of Bible truths by means of publication, in printed form, and other lawful means.” Such corporations are merely the instruments or tools of Jehovah’s witnesses, that is, men and women who act harmoniously as God’s servants and carry on his work of witnessing to the truth in various parts of the earth. Such corporations are charitable and benevolent, because the people who use the same are moved by love, or unselfishness, in their devotion to God and his Theocratic Government to carry on such work; and because to know the truth of and concerning the great Theocratic Government is absolutely essential to the peoples of the earth. The organization of Jehovah’s witnesses using the corporations above named is known under the generic term “The Society”, that is to say, a company of persons who have but one objective and that to do the will of Almighty God. The authority or ordination or commission of Jehovah’s witnesses is given to them exclusively by Jehovah God and through Christ Jesus, the King of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>ORDINATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">That ordination or commission of authority was first conferred upon Christ Jesus, and through him extends to all his true followers. To be ordained means to be appointed by the proper authority to a position or office to perform the duties specifically assigned. Jehovah’s witnesses being selected by Jehovah, it follows that Jehovah is the authority that ordains the servant. Therefore it is written: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings nnto the meek: he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.”-—Isa. 61:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That scripture states the commission of authority given by the Lord God to those persons who are selected by him and made his witnesses. The commandment given to those followers of Christ Jesus is contained in the Scriptures specifically at Isaiah 43: 9-12, Isaiah 62:1, 2, and other like scriptures. &quot;And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) As Christ Jesus is ‘The faithful and true witness” of Jehovah God, so all who are the true followers of Christ Jesus in faithfully giving testimony to the great Theocracy, to the name of Jehovah God and to his King Christ Jesus are Scripturally labeled and designated “Jehovah’s witnesses”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thereafter such persons must be obedient to God’s commandments; as it is written; “Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice.” (1 Sam. 15:22) “Study to shew thyself approved unto God,” and not unto man. (2 Tim. 2:15) As the follower in the footsteps of Jesus Christ such person must be obedient to the commandments of the Lord and thereby prove his integrity toward Almighty God. His eternal existence now depends upon full obedience to God’s commandments. To such persons the rule is announced by the Lord: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.” (Rev. 2:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.) As</span><span class="font5"> Christ Jesus, when on the earth, continuously proclaimed the name and kingdom of Jehovah, so all his followers must proclaim the name and kingdom of Jehovah in order that they may prove their integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The body of Christians now on the earth and known as Jehovah’s witnesses are a united body, operating together as one, that is, in full unity, in fulfillment of Ephesians 4:13,15. As a body of Christians following in the footsteps of Christ Jesus they carry forward their work harmoniously to the praise of Jehovah. To aid them in doing so and to work to the best advantage that body of Christians have the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society to act for them and in their behalf. That Society carries forward the work of these Christians in an orderly manner. To each one who gives evidence that he is fully devoted to God and his kingdom and that he is wholly devoted to the service of God, in obedience to His commandments, the Society issues a card of identification showing that such person is recognized by the body of Christians composing the Society as an ordained minister and servant of the Lord. Such card of identification is issued by the Society only to those who are the representatives of such Society. With such person the Society co-operates in the publication of the name of Jehovah God and of his kingdom. This does not mean that no one else is an ordained minister who does not receive such card of identification. The real ordination comes from Jehovah God himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All of the covenant people, whom Jehovah has taken out for his name and sent forth as his witnesses, the Almighty God by his spirit has ordained or commissioned to proclaim his name and his kingdom. God has made them preachers or ministers of the gospel. Such are duly ordained ministers appointed and commissioned by the highest authority, regardless of what men may do, say or think. The words of ordination, commission and authority God has caused to be recorded for such covenant people at Isaiah 61:1, 2, above quoted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus, the great Judge at the temple since A.D. 1918, as Jehovah’s Executive Officer, sends forth such ordained ministers with the order and command that they must declare the good news or “gospel” that the Kingdom of Jehovah is here and that his kingdom is the only hope of humankind. (Matt. 24:14) This testimony to the name of Jehovah and to his Theocratic Government must be given by his ordained ministers immediately preceding the time of great tribulation, which is Armageddon. (Matt. 24:21) There is no distinction between male and female (Gal. 3: 28), but all who are chosen of God and taken into a covenant with him and sent forth are ordained ministers to preach “this gospel” of the great Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No earthly power has any authority to set aside this high ordination and commission. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, as the organization acting in behalf of and with Jehovah’s witnesses in order to do things orderly and carry on the work in an organized and orderly manner, sends out such witnesses, and thus an earthly ordination is provided, but that is always subject to the ordination of the Almighty God. Such persons are the true representatives of the Lord and the true ministers of God on earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>COURSE OF STUDY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s specific commandment to one who represented his visible organization on earth was, to wit: “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. But shun profane and vain babblings ; for they will increase unto more ungodliness.” (2 Tim. 2:15,16) In many cities, towns and communities throughout the earth classes or companies of Jehovah’s witnesses are maintained and those companies or classes regularly meet, many times during the week, to engage in careful and prayful study of the Bible; and to do so they use the publications of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, which shun the profane and vain babblings of demonized religionists, and in order that they may study the Scriptures in an orderly way and get a better understanding of the will of God concerning his servants. Such persons are real students of the Scriptures and, being unselfishly devoted to The Theocracy and guided by the spirit of the Lord, they learn the Scriptures and the meaning thereof. These study classes are led by persons of the company who are more mature and are well qualified and apt to teach. Every person who loves righteousness and who desires to learn of God and of his kingdom is welcome to attend those studies and participate and receive instruction. Such schools of instruction in the Scriptures are held and conducted each and every week of the year to the great profit of those who attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The time for the mere placing of books- is past. Now is the time to feed the Lord’s “other sheep”. In no better way can this be done than by the publishers’ calling back on those who have shown interest and organizing more study classes, using the Lord’s provided literature.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>MEANS OF PREACHING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">“To preach” means “to proclaim or publish”. All of Jehovah’s witnesses are publishers of the message of Jehovah making known his name and his government. Such publication is done by word of mouth, by distribution of the printed message, by the reproduction of recorded speech by means of electrical transcription and phonographs, and by the radio, all of which brings to the attention of the people that we are in a transition period, the passing away of the demon rule and the coming in of the rule of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘Preaching this gospel of the kingdom of God’ (Matt. 24:14) means the proclaiming to others the Scriptural truths of and concerning Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. Each and every one of Jehovah’s witnesses commissioned as aforesaid is commanded to preach God’s message of truth to all who will hear. Such is the means of bearing witness to the name and kingdom of Jehovah. They are not witnesses for any human organization, but are witnesses for the- Most High, the great Theocrat. Having received a commission from God to preach, and being commanded by him to preach, such consecrated persons must engage in preaching or proclaiming to others who will hear. That message delivered must be that which is proclaimed in the Scriptures, particularly with reference to the kingdom of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the express will of God that his covenant people are and must ever be separate and distinct from the world, that is, from the things and from the powers that attempt to rule this evil world. To such the Lord says: Te are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.’ (John 15:18,19) Jesus is the Faithful and True Witness of Jehovah (Rev. 3:14) ; and all his followers, taken out from the nations for Jehovah’s name, must likewise be faithful and true witnesses to the name and kingdom of God and therefore must ‘keep themselves unspotted or separate from the world’.—Jas. 1: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the nations of the present world are against The Theocracy. There are amongst the nations of earth two mighty factions which claim the right to rule, and which world powers are designated in the prophecy of Daniel as “the king-of the north” and “the king of the south”, and both of which are against the rule of the world by Christ Jesus, who is Jehovah’s King, holding full authority. The covenant people of' God are on His side and entirely devoted to his purpose, and therefore must be and are at all times neutral in all things of controversy between the nations of this evil world. If the nations of this world see fit to engage in war, that is for the nations themselves to determine and it is their responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When the law of men, made by nations of the earth and put into force, commands the doing of that which is directly in conflict with the commandments of Jehovah God addressed to his covenant people, what is the position of Jehovah’s covenant people with reference thereto? The apostles of Jesus Christ, Peter, John and others, were sent forth to preach and to represent The Theocracy, and, being in a covenant with Jehovah God and therefore governed strictly by the will of God, answered the foregoing question, and which answer is the one given by all of God’s covenant people to like questions. That answer is: “We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5:29) “But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.” (Acts 4:19) One’s obligations under his covenant require him to faithfully follow this divinely announced rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those faithful apostles of the Lord, because they persisted in keeping their covenant with God and obeying God’s commandments rather than men, were arrested, ill-used, thrown into prison, and beaten. When released from prison they went straightway forward in preaching the gospel in obedience to God’s commandment. They did not fear what man might do to them. They feared God and obeyed Him. Suppose they had taken a compromising course by obeying the commandments of men, and had done so in order to avoid bodily punishment and yet preached the gospel on the sly, when rulers might not find it out. That would have been a course of compromise and would have constituted a failure to keep covenant with God. Such would have been breaking their covenant because of fear of men. The fear of man leads into a snare of Satan, which means everlasting destruction. That same rule applies to all of God’s covenant people today. —Prov. 29:25; Rom. 1:31,32; Rev. 21:8.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>COVENANT-BREAKERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">A person who is not in a covenant with God is in a position far different from that of the person who is in a covenant to do the will of God. Those not covenant people of God are not here considered. Only those who have entered into a covenant to do the will of God are here considered. The obligation of such is that they must keep the terms of that covenant, the keeping of which is of vital importance. With Jehovah a covenant is a sacred thing, not to be broken or altered with impunity. How God regards and treats covenant-breakers may be correctly seen by reference to the treatment of such as is recorded in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No one can break God’s covenant and escape the penalty prescribed for so doing The Scriptures tell of men who broke covenant with God because of fear of man, and that such covenant-breakers suffered the penalty of death. One of such was the prophet Urijah. That prophet was deterred from performing his covenant obligations because of the threats made against him by men; and, fearing man, he fled. God did not protect him and he was seized by his enemies and killed. Thus God shows that he does not protect coyenant-breakers.—Jer. 26: 20-23.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>COVENANT-KEEPERS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In striking contrast to unfaithful Urijah is the prophet Jeremiah, who was a faithful witness of Jehovah. Jeremiah refused to compromise with the government of the unfaithful nation of Israel, and held fast to his covenant with Almighty God. Jeremiah proclaimed the name of Jehovah and warned the people as God had commanded him to do. Even though he was repeatedly threatened with death, he steadfastly went on obeying God. In doing that work Jeremiah was a type or prophetic pattern picturing Jehovah’s witnesses now on the earth who declare the name of Jehovah and his Theocracy. The rulers of Jerusalem, including the religious teachers and leaders, sought to have Jeremiah put to death because he held fast to the performance of the obligations of his covenant with God. “And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.” The religious leaders had stirred up the people against him as an excuse to demand that Jeremiah be put to death. That part of the divine record referring to the same is: “Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes, and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears. Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes, and to all the people, saying, The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house [temple polluted by religion], and against this city [unfaithful Jerusalem], all the words that ye have heard ... As for me, behold, I am in your hand; do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you; but know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof; for of a truth the Lord hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.”—Jer. 26:11-15.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>FEAR GOD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jeremiah did not fear man nor what man might do unto him; and in this he pleased God, and God manifested his power in Jeremiah’s behalf. One who is in a covenant with God, and who fears what man might do to harm him, and for that reason yields to the point of violating his covenant, is unclean and cannot receive God’s approval. As is shown in the case of Urijah, so with all covenant-breakers: such unclean ones must suffer death at the hands of Jehovah. God’s covenant people who continue faithful to the end in fulfilling their obligation are, of course, those who do not fear men. They do fear God. “The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever.” (Ps. 19: 9) Those who have godly fear put their full trust in the Most High. All those who are in a covenant with Jehovah and are therefore for The Theocracy continue to fear God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God announced his rule concerning those who break their covenant, in these words: “Jehovah thy God is a devouring fire.” (Deut. 4: 24, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.')</span><span class="font5"> That means that those who because of fear of man fail or refuse to perform their covenant obligation suffer destruction at the hands of Jehovah’s Executioner. The faithful apostle repeated those words above quoted, which are addressed to all who are in a covenant with God for the Kingdom. His words apply to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">those who are assembled at the temple, to which the Lord Jesus Christ has come for judgment. His words are addressed to God’s covenant people, applying at a time when all the world is in great distress and turmoil and at the time when God is permitting to he shaken out of his kingdom everything that can be shaken. These words thus recorded for the benefit of God’s covenant people are: “Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear: for our God is a consuming fire.”— Heb. 12:28,29. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As it was with Jeremiah, so it is now with God’s people on the earth who are in a covenant for the Kingdom. The worldly powers put forth strong endeavors to cause Jeremiah to violate his covenant by conforming himself to worldly ideas. Jeremiah remained steadfast. Likewise today the worldly powers endeavor to force God’s covenant people to repudiate their covenant and to break the terms thereof by conforming themselves to the things of this world, which things are contrary to Jehovah’s commandment. God’s, faithful covenant people remain steadfast to Jehovah, faithful to the terms of their covenant and The Theocracy, regardless of all threats or acts leveled against them. Jeremiah’s experiences are recorded for the’ benefit of God’s covenant people now on earth, .as stated at Romans 15:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The totalitarian ruling powers, composed of Nazis, Fascists and big religious leaders, now stand where, they ought not to stand, claiming the right to rule the world, and demanding that Jehovah’s covenant people; shall hail and bow down to totalitarian rulers, join their armies, and fight under their banners, and when Jehovah’s covenant people refuse to do so they are imprisoned and many put to death. In the face of all this God’s covenant people stand firm on the side of The Theocracy even though they see other faithful ones being imprisoned and sent to death. Although the law of such nations declares that a minister shall not be required to do military service, the acting authorities &quot;who have to do with carrying the law into operation say to these faithful covenant people of God: &quot;We do not recognize you as a minister, nor that you are a sincere, conscientious objector to engaging in war; therefore you must join the fighting forces and serve under our banner.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful covenant people of God answer: “We cannot do so; we are in a covenant with Almighty God to do His will. To obey your commandment we must violate our covenant with God; and if we do so we shall suffer eternal destruction at the hands of Almighty God. We willingly conform ourselves to every law of the land that does not cause us to violate our covenant with Jehovah, as He has commanded. Almighty God has made us his witnesses and his ministers to preach this gospel of his kingdom by informing the peoples of the world of his name and his provision for peace and life for mankind. Almighty God has ordained us thus to preach. We have covenanted to do his will. To him we will remain faithful and true, regardless of what men may do to us. We do not wish to suffer imprisonment or other punishment at the hands of men. We know that the worst punishment to which we may be subjected by men of this world is death; but that means only the death of our human life. If we suffer death because of our faithfulness to Almighty God and the terms of our covenant, we have the sure promise from God that he will resurrect us to eternal life. If we violate our covenant with Jehovah God we suffer eternal death, from which there is no resurrection. For us there is but one choice, and that is to faithfully perform our covenant obligations to Jehovah and his King. If you choose to punish us because of our faithfulness to God and our covenant, that is your responsibility, and you must bear it. Be assured of this one thing, however: if we suffer punishment at your hands because we stand firmly and perform the terms of our covenant with. Almighty God, the Lord God will duly punish you and you will find no way of escape from that punishment. We will do harm to no one, but the Almighty God, whom we serve, will see to it that if we are wronged we shall be avenged, because he has so promised and he always keeps his promise.”— Luke 18: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That which is recorded concerning the firm, immovable stand of Jeremiah for Jehovah was there written and recorded for the purpose of encouragement to the covenant people of God now on the earth. (Rom. 15:4) The faithful covenant people of God now have in mind the words of Jesus Christ spoken for their comfort, to wit: “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”—Matt. 10: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful covenant people of God will not fear man nor what man can do. They do fear Almighty God, and obey him and serve him. The power of wicked men ends with death. The power of Almighty God is eternal. If one dies unfaithful to God, that is the everlasting end of him. If he dies because he is faithful to Jehovah and to the obligation of his covenant Jehovah will resurrect that faithful one to life eternal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why should a man hesitate to faithfully keep covenant with Jehovah, regardless of all human opposition or punishment, threatened or applied? The person who has not made a covenant with Jehovah God, and who therefore does not know God, cannot understand and hence cannot answer the question. The man who is in a covenant with Jehovah, and who has partaken of the knowledge of the good things to be given by the Lord, does not permit himself even to debate in mind as to whether or not he should obey man and thereby break his covenant. He is determined to keep his covenant obligations faithfully to the end, regardless of what may be done against him by any human power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah never breaks or even alters his covenant. Those who serve God faithfully, and who receive his everlasting blessings, must and will faithfully perform covenant obligations and will not break or alter the terms of that covenant. For the covenant people of God, both of the remnant and their companions, the Lord’s “other sheep”, the time of climax is here. Whether permitted to remain free to preach this gospel of the Kingdom as God has commanded, or restrained of all human liberty; whether walking through the land and doing that which God has commanded, or behind prison walls because of faithfulness to covenant obligations, the Christian in the covenant with God will regard but one thing worth while, and that is that under all conditions, and in whatever state, he will hold fast his integrity. There is but one thing for him to do. He will consider nothing else. That one thing is faithfully keeping covenant obligations prescribed by the covenant he has made with Almighty God, and to do so faithfully unto the end, having always in mind the precious promises of the Lord addressed to him, to wit: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.”—Rev. 2:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In obedience to the specific commandment from the Lord to advertise The Theocratic Government and to thereby “comfort all that mourn” (Matt. 24:14; Isa. 61:1,2) Jehovah’s witnesses go from place to place and from house to house, calling upon the people and informing those who will hear of the good news that The Theocracy is here. Unlike religious denominations, which meet in houses and perform certain formal ceremonies, Jehovah’s witnesses go to the people and talk with them. They take to the people books, booklets, magazines and other printed matter and also recorded speeches concerning the Scriptures which enable the people to find in the Scriptures the full and complete proof of this good news and that the Kingdom is at hand, and thus the people are enabled to stay in their own homes and learn of God’s gracious provision for them. Throughout all the earth where there are companies of Jehovah’s witnesses each individual, as opportunity is afforded, engages in thus preaching “this gospel of the kingdom”. The corporations above mentioned do the printing and manufacturing of such literature as is distributed and manage the witness work in an orderly manner. All this work is done without pecuniary profit to any person. Furthermore, persons who do engage in this witness work contribute their own money to carry on the work. There is but one purpose in our lives, and that is to make known Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus and the blessings it will bring to humankind.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>OPPOSITION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Every person who maintains his integrity toward Jehovah God must be a witness to the name of Jehovah and his government, The Theocracy. Every such person, therefore, is opposed by the Devil, the adversary of God and of The Theocratic Government, and that wicked one sees to it that they are severely persecuted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The hour has come in which every person must now declare himself either for or against Jehovah’s kingdom, because now is the day when all the nations are before the great Judge of Jehovah, Christ Jesus, who is separating the people, putting the approved on one side and those disapproved on the other. This is therefore the time of great crisis of the nations. If a person has taken his stand on the side of The Theocracy and declared himself for Jehovah and Christ, he must from that time forward expect to be persecuted by those who are of the world and who are therefore on the side of the Devil. The persecutors, therefore, compose the great mass of the people, because, as it is written, The whole world lieth in the wicked one.’ (1 John 5:19, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> The wicked do not persecute one another who are wicked, but they do persecute those who declare the name of the Righteous One, Jehovah, and his King of The Theocracy. Which side of the great controversy between the wicked Satan and the righteous Almighty God have you taken ? and on which side do you desire to remain ? If you are on the side of The Theocracy, then know for a certainty you will receive persecution at the hands of those who are against The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If one declares himself as having taken the side of The Theocracy and then attempts to escape persecution by declining or failing to bear testimony to the name of the great Theocrat and his King, that is evidence that such a person is not a child of God but that he is on the side of the enemy and is designated in the Scriptures as a “bastard”. (Heb. 12:5-8) God cannot be deceived. He knows the secret intent and purpose in the mind of each and every creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today Jehovah’s witnesses are hated by all who are in opposition to the Theocratic Government of righteousness. We are at the end of the world, and the words of the prophecy uttered by the great Prophet, Christ Jesus, now specifically apply to all who are on the side of God and Christ, to wit: “Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you; and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.”—Matt. 24: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The facts today completely fulfill that prophecy uttered by Christ Jesus. Are men hated today because they are called “Christians”? No, not that. Those persons of the most powerful religious organization on earth, which men are bent on ruling the earth contrary to God’s will, are called Christians, and those hypocritical men are the ones that manifest the greatest hatred against Jehovah’s faithful servants. Jehovah’s covenant people now on earth are very small in number. They are even so small in number that religionists speak of them with great contempt. If they were religionists they would receive no notice, because of their smallness, and it is certain that they would not then be persecuted. Why, then, is there so much opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the countries of the earth, and why are they so grievously persecuted in all these countries? Are they dangerous to any nation? They are not dangerous, because they have no desire or inclination to do harm to anyone. Are the ruling powers of the nations afraid of Jehovah's witnesses and companions as to what they might do to overthrow their power? No, not at all; because Jehovah’s witnesses and companions could do them no injury. Surely the armies that destroy thousands of human lives every day have no fear of falling at the hands of Jehovah’s witnesses and companions. Then why are Jehovah’s witnesses hated in all nations and so cruelly ill-treated and persecuted<sup>?</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The answer is plain and is easy of comprehension. It is because these people, faithful to Almighty God and in obedience to his commandments, announce to the world that The Theocracy is the only hope of humankind; because they declare God’s vengeance against all that oppose The Theocracy. The faithful followers of Christ are hated today by all nations that are under Satan’s control, and that hatred is because such are witnesses for and advocates of the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. It is a part of the same conflict begun long ago, the Devil against righteousness. Now the King of righteousness has begun to exercise his power as King and the climax foretold by the prophetic drama of Job has come; and this is exactly in harmony with the admonition of the apostle addressed to the faithful ones now on earth. That admonition of the apostle emphasizes the fact that at the second coming of Christ Jesus those who will receive God’s approval' must hold fast their integrity, or blamelessness. Desiring that his faithful brethren might receive the full approval of the Lord, the apostle says: “So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment.”—1 Cor. 1:7-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All who receive God’s approval must, as Job did, hold fast their integrity and stand blameless before the King. The suffering of Job foretells a climax of suffering of God’s faithful witnesses at the present time and that amidst all of such suffering the approved ones must hold fast their integrity. They must “all speak the same thing”, that is, this gospel of the Kingdom, The Theocratic Government, and they must be in complete unity in action, perfectly joined together in their activities for The Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The anointed remnant are the willing servants of the Lord and joyfully declare the name of Jehovah, of Christ, and of the Kingdom. The Lord’s “other sheep”, the Jonadabs, who will form the “great multitude”, have put themselves under the command of the Lord and are therefore his servants, and they join with the remnant in declaring the name of Jehovah and his King. Both the remnant and the Jonadabs, therefore, have taken the name of Jehovah and Christ. To all such the words of Jesus now apply, to wit: “Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.”—John 15:20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Otherwise stated, if a person is on the side of the Lord and firmly remains there and maintains his integrity, he must openly and boldly declare the name of the great Theocrat and his King and must expect to suffer as Christ Jesus suffered. In thus proving his integrity he is certain to be the object of attack by Satan and by all those who are blindly doing the bidding of Satan, and that includes all the totalitarian states and.those who are moved by the totalitarian or arbitrary spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The all-important thing to do is to give the testimony to the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government. The perfect wisdom of the Lord directs the best way for his covenant people to take. When faithful testimony brings reproaches and persecutions, then joyfully bear the same with the determination to remain true and steadfast to your covenant and prove faithful to Jehovah and to his King, and do this under all conditions. Each one must decide as to which side of the controversy he will take. On which side do you desire to be? Of course, you will say, My desire for myself is to be always on the' side of Jehovah God and Christ his King. To have that desire, therefore, means that the ones receiving it must suffer reproaches and persecutions, by which reproaches and persecutions they advance into the Kingdom. Such persecutions and reproaches are therefore not worthy to be compared with the blessings that shall come to those who maintain their integrity toward God and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the sole purpose and work of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions is to announce the name of Jehovah and his Government of Righteousness by Christ Jesus, and this for the benefit of mankind and to the glory of God; and since they are entirely neutral, they hold themselves aloof from the warring nations. Why does the Almighty God permit them to suffer so many indignities at the hands of their enemies? The answer from God’s Word is, to wit, in order that each one of his covenant people may now be permitted to prove his full devotion to The Theocratic Government and thus hold fast his integrity. (Heb. 12: 6; Job 2:3) This test must continue to the end.—Rev. 2:10.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>LEADER</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Pointing to Christ Jesus, the King of The Theocracy, Jehovah by his prophet says: “Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people [God’s covenant people].” (Isa. 55:4) The apostle then and the faithful witnesses of the Lord Jesus now proclaim this prophecy, at Revelation 20:4, to wit: “And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.” Those words mean that such faithful ones have no human leader, but that they have given up their own head and look only to Christ Jesus as their Head and Leader that they might bear witness to the name of Jehovah and to his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. It is the enemy that accuse Jehovah’s witnesses falsely of having a mere man as leader. That Jehovah’s witnesses look above to God’s announced Leader for his covenant people was forcibly demonstrated at the Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in St. Louis, Missouri, in August, 1941. Addressing directly the gathering of several thousand pioneers, with the rest of the Assembly of several scores of thousands also present and listening in, the president of the Society said: “Of course, the enemy, because they head a sect or cult themselves, insist on calling Jehovah’s witnesses a sect or cult. That is all nonsense. A sect or cult is that kind of people that are led by some human institution, led by some men for selfish reasons; but Jehovah’s witnesses could not be such, because they have no human leader on this earth.” This statement the entire Assembly roundly applauded. The president then called attention to a picture published in a newspaper convention report, and said: “The caption reads, ‘This is the leader.’ I am glad the Lord understands. He knows that this is not the leader, but this is just one of the boys fighting along with you.” Again the vast Assembly applauded in hearty approval and agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord tested his people again on this same issue on the final day of the Theocratic Assembly, after the public address attended by more than 115,000. Addressing the great throng for the last time, the president said: “I want to let any strangers here know what you think about a man being your leader, so they won’t be forgetting. Every time something rises up and starts to grow, they say there is some man a leader who has a great following. If there is any person in this audience who thinks that I, this man standing here, is the leader of Jehovah’s witnesses, say Yes.” The Assembly’s response to this was an impressive silence broken only by several emphatic, loud “No’s”. The speaker continued: “If you who are here believe that I am just one of the servants of the Lord, and we are working shoulder to shoulder in unity, serving God and serving Christ, say Yes.” In full unanimity the Assembly roared out a decisive “Yes!” This was not the decision and stand of merely Americans, Canadians, Mexicans and others of the Western Hemisphere there present. At a like Theocratic Assembly held in Leicester, England, the following month and attended by more than 12,000 on the final day, and when a copy of the above address was read to them, the British brethren responded in exactly the same manner as did those at St. Louis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No man on earth within the visible part of God’s organization is heiled or followed or obeyed as the leader of Jehovah’s witnesses. They refuse to compromise with any part of Satan’s organization, and, regardless of all earthly persecution and opposition, they remain -true, steadfast and blameless before the Lord. Such blamelessness consists of their complete devotion to the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. Their integrity is put to the test, and those who receive the Lord’s approval will hold fast their integrity under that test. They are being disciplined by the Lord, and they are determined to not yield to demon influence, but that they will remain faithful to Jehovah God and his Government of Righteousness, come what may.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The crucial test, which must persist until Armageddon, is proof that now is “the last time”. The words of the apostle now apply to the Lord’s faithful servants, to wit: “Little children, it is the last time; and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.” (1 John 2:18) The antichrists, many of which now appear, are all those against the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus the King, and, says the apostle, ‘thereby we know that this is the last time.’ The words of the apostle here clearly mean that the end of Satanic rule has come: “And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.”—1 John 2:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is therefore clearly to be seen that the crucial test is here, and thus Jesus says to those who follow him: “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.” (Matt. 24:13) “Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.” (1 Cor. 15:58) “Do all things without murmurings and disputings; that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.” (Phil. 2:14,15) Stand fast for The Theocracy &gt;&nbsp;It will be folly to now turn to the beggarly totalitarian ruling elements. (Gal. 4:9) Give ear always to what the Lord says: “I will hear what God the Lord will speak; for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints; but let them not turn again to folly.” “The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.”—Pss. 85: 8 and 29:11.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>THE ISSUE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Now there stands out in the universe this great question at issue, World Domination, and God’s people, well knowing that “the Axis powers” are against God and his Kingdom, and that the democracies have taken the position that results identically, take their stand unequivocally for The Theocracy. The Society, the above-named organization, and which in the last ten years has more particularly been known as “Jehovah’s witnesses”, has been in operation separate and distinct from the worldly political powers. So there are really three great organizations : The democracies, the Nazis, the first called “the king of the south”, the next being called “the king of the north”; and the third, the great Star and Light of brilliancy, that stands out over the entire universe and causes “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” to fade into insignificance. Everyone who loves Jehovah and Christ Jesus is privileged to receive the benefit of this glorious Star. This Light is called in Revelation 'the King from the place of the sunrising’. (Rev. 16:12) It is Jehovah’s creation, and is bright. This Light is also called “The King of Eternity” because in it resides all the light in the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The question, then, before the minds of the people, which must be settled now, once and for all, is this, World Domination. No man can decide that for another, but this question must be decided by Almighty God Jehovah; and before its decision is finally reached, information or “gospel” must be spread throughout the earth notifying the people. “The king of the south” and “the king of the north” are both against the great Light above mentioned. And what is that Light? It is The Theocracy. It is the government of Jehovah God that shall rest upon the shoulder of Christ JesusJ (Isa. 9:6) It shall know no end. Its peace shall endure forever. It will dash to pieces the two great opposing powers, and it shall stand forever. (Dan. 2:44) The objective or purpose of the Society, working under the supervision of the Lord, has been and is to hold to a position of absolute neutrality so far as the two organizations mentioned are concerned, to have nothing to do with these, but to spend all of its time, substance, energy and money and life, everything, in the interest of The Theocracy. Those who will compose The Theocracy have done this very thing, and now they stand and behold the salvation of the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, pointing the people to The Theocracy as the only hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By reference to the last </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> it will be seen that the following nations were represented and made</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">the fact that within the past twelve months ending September 30, 1941, a majority of those nations maintaining a Branch office have been removed from that list, due to restrictions imposed by totalitarian governments assuming control or to war conditions. And while God has used another means of proclaiming the Theocratic message by continued activity of individuals, the record as herewith published would, on the face of it, show that the Theocratic witness work on earth is about done. If that is not so, let this be emphasized: We know that the arbitrary powers above mentioned are in no wise interested in The </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocracy, and yet the Theocratic witnesses know that their great privilege is to go on advertising The Theocracy, to enable the people to make their choice, whether on God’s side and on the side of Christ his King or to fall with demonism. The Kingdom, or The Theocratic Government, is here, and the peoples of earth shall know that shortly. Within a very short time the nations shall know that the final issue is here. Who is going to win? God himself answers that question at Daniel 2:44 and Isaiah 9:6,7, and at many other appropriate Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And now these warm, enthusiastic, heart-rejoicing facts are set forth, to which the people are directed, and with confidence we expect every person of goodwill to hasten to The Theocracy, and life and blessings shall be the portion forever of those who do.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>OFFICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The executive or administrative offices of the Society are situated at 124 Columbia Heights,* Brooklyn, New York. The publishing office and factory are situated at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn. The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, that is, the Pennsylvania Corporation; and the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Incorporated, the New York corporation; and the International Bible Students Association, the British corporation, are all managed and directed by the administration office at 124 Columbia Heights. The appointments of various places in the Theocratic organization on earth are made from the administration office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The office and factory force, while small in number when compared with the duties performed, are earnest, zealous, trustworthy, faithful and hard workers, giving attention to the Kingdom interests or “goods” of the Lord. All of them render their services voluntarily and without compensation except food and shelter and a small amount, $10.00 a month, for incidental expenses, furnished by the Society. They work regularly five and one-half days of the week at the office and factory, and at stated times they work Saturday afternoon and evenings of other weekdays, as will appear from the report below. Usually on Saturday afternoons and Sundays every one of that force and of the Bethel family engages in preaching “this gospel of the kingdom” by calling on the people and presenting to them the Kingdom message or otherwise carrying on the work of the Society. When the day’s work at the office, factory or Bethel home is completed, they attend or conduct Bible studies at various points in New York and vicinity. All these Bible studies that are held in and about the city of New York and elsewhere are led by ordained ministers competent and apt to teach. These call on the people in the evenings at their homes, and where there is a group in any vicinity desiring to organize a study class this is done and a competent person is appointed from amongst the ordained ministers to conduct and lead and instruct such class. The Bethel family includes all of those at 124 Columbia Heights, at Watchtower, and at the Farms. All of these are doing one and the same thing, to wit, preaching the gospel and incidentally doing that which is necessary to carry on the work. They are God’s ministers and servants, and they delight to serve him day and night. They will keep on working, and let nothing stop them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At its offices in Brooklyn the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society keeps a list of men who are made the special representatives of the Society and to whom is assigned specific work. These men are representatives of the Society, and all of them are ordained ministers of the gospel. They have received the divine ordination or commission of authority from Jehovah God, as herein set forth, and they have also been appointed and commissioned by the Society as ministers of “this gospel of the kingdom”, to look well to certain specific duties assigned to them. There are many other ordained ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AMERICA (U.S.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the report of the office and factory servant at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn, made to the administration office at the end of the fiscal year, September 30, 1941, the following is taken, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under the direction of the great Theocrat this year has been the most blessed. We clearly see Jehovah, through His organization, instructing His people in their forward march, drawing ever closer to the final battle. His anointed and their companions are continually strengthened by the bread of life. With brilliance now can be seen the issue of world domination. Those standing for The Theocracy hearken unto the words of the Most High, “My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproach-eth me.”—Prov. 27:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This report shows that those maintaining their integrity are working at unity to the end that Jehovah’s name and word shall be completely vindicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Production</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The demand for the Kingdom message in printed form during the past year was greater than our normal daily production; this in spite of the fact that shipmerits to foreign countries have dropped off by nearly three million copies of books and booklets, due to countries’ banning them or closing their import doors to the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With an average of 154 brethren for the year, the factory operated 267 regular working days of 8| hours a day, 5J days a week. Extra time necessary to keep the schedule of production required 45 days of evening work of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2%</span><span class="font5"> hours and 10 Saturday afternoons working 4 hours each afternoon. All in the Bethel family esteem it a great privilege of service to share in the manufacture and distribution of the Theocratic message, and are glad to work any time to accomplish it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The grand total of books and booklets and magazines manufactured in 1941 is the greatest ever reached in the Brooklyn factory: 45,823,929 copies. This is over 5 million more publications produced in 1941 than completed in 1940. Increased production in booklets alone was 4| million over last year. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">magazine reached a new all-time high of upward of 8 million copies printed. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation’s</span><span class="font5"> increase over last year’s production was 320,000 copies. The people of good-will are seeking the truth, and, by the Lord’s grace, we have the privilege to print it for their aid and comfort. The following is a detailed production report:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The above printing was produced in 28 different languages and required the handling of 2,565 tons of paper, 139 tons of chipboard, 213,464 yards of cloth, 39,200 yards of crash, and thousands of pounds of other materials and supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this time of war among the nations it is constantly becoming harder to get these supplies, and at the same time the profiteers are taking all they can lay their hands on, and prices rise. By the Lord's grace we are still able to get those things needed, and because of the efforts put forth on the part of the brethren certain savings in production costs have, been effected. These savings, along with the donations on the part of the people of good-will to the Theocratic Organization, make it possible to continue distribution of the books and booklets at the same contribution previously asked by the publishers. In our plant we are now making, at a considerable saving, many of our products which were previously bought; such as 35,356 pounds of ink, 360 gallons of paint, 100 pounds of putty, 96 barrels of paste, 14,602 pounds of glue; and hundreds of printing rollers have been made for our presses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Machinery</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Handling hundreds of tons of material weekly, the Society’s trucking equipment must be of the best. The president of the Society, seeing well in advance the difficulties of obtaining trucking equipment, arranged during the past year to trade in all our old equipment for new. During the year two new Mack trucks were obtained, which are used daily in the unloading of cars, bringing materials into the factory, and then delivering freight to the depots for distribution throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society also turned in their old station wagons for new ones, which are used daily to make light deliveries and pickups, as well as by the family every evening and week-ends in the field service. These station wagons are of great advantage in taking many brethren into the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society also installed an oil filter and reclaimer. Thus it keeps clean the oil used in our Deisel engines and motor vehicles and cuts down on the purchase of new oil for lubrication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some other machines were required so that we could complete the production on the new vertical-type phonograph; such as a punch press and electrical welding equipment. All this work in former times we had done on the outside; but because all machine shops are taking on defense orders it is now impossible to get things made when and as one wants them. The machine shop of the Society has been very busy, and several brethren had to be transferred to this department to complete new parts and equipment for the new phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Shipments</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our biggest year for shipping out literature has been 1941. All previous records have been surpassed in reaching the grand total of 31,568,922 books and booklets sent out. The publishers in the United States used the greater portion of this amount in their field activity. The branches still operating throughout the world took about one-fifth of this grand total. The shipment of 6,643,656 books and booklets to branches is considerably under that of previous years. In fact, it is three million copies less than that of last year. It is also noticed in our shipping records that most of these 6 million were dispatched during the first three months of the fiscal year. Since then almost all countries have closed their ports to the entry of the Theocratic message; this to the hurt of the people who love righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The shipment of bound books totaled 2,444,667. Of this total, 631,077 went to branches. The book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion </span><span class="font5">took the lead over all others, reaching a grand total of 940,417 being shipped to the publishers. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children, </span><span class="font5">released at the St. Louis convention, in but two months’ time reached a shipping total of 491,326 copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The booklet distribution went ahead by leaps and bounds, reaching a new all-time high for booklet shipments, namely, 29,098,179. Of this total, 3,052,833 were printed in foreign tongues, and more than 2 million of these foreign-language booklets were shipped to branches. This unprecedented total in booklets shipped out is due mainly to two things—a special offer on the part of the Society of 7 booklets on a contribution of 10 cents, during December, and several new booklets released. Of these new booklets, it is noted that 6J million copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font5"> have gone out, 5 million copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied, </span><span class="font5">3J million copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy,</span><span class="font5"> nearly 4 million copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State,</span><span class="font5"> and at the close of the year </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn</span><span class="font5"> was released and this had already reached a shipping total of 3,100,000.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In the 301,574 letters received at the Brooklyn office are found many requests for literature, this due to the wide distribution already made and advertisements appearing in the various publications. As shipped direct to the public, the report for the year shows that 136,249 pieces of literature went out. Many back-calls were made on these persons. Announcements of new publications in the magazines bring in many of these orders. New publications shipped out during the year in the English language were the 1941 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses, Children,</span><span class="font5"> and the new booklets </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn, Jehovah’s Servants Defended, God and the State, Model Study</span><span class="font5"> No. 3, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy, </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the close of the fiscal year the shipping department has been the busiest it has been in all of the past year, and this is due to the shipment of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font5"> which is having a marvelous distribution. Many companies and pioneers have sent in their third and fourth orders. Each day at closing time every book that has been manufactured during the day is on its way to the publishers. It has been impossible for the manufacturing end to keep up with the demand for this wonderful book, and we are now approximately two weeks behind in filling orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The carrying charges, cartons, and other supplies required during the past year for the shipping of books, booklets and magazines amount to $142,836.34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Shipments of Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The new vertical-type phonograph which was introduced in July, 1940, was enthusiastically received by the brethren in the field. Unfortunately, it has been difficult for us to manufacture and ship out as many of these phonographs as we should like to have made and shipped; however, 1,202 phonographs have been dispatched to the field; and it is hoped that during the coming year upward of 4,000 more can be completed, for now we have most of the parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Recordings</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The handling and shipping of recorded lectures takes considerable time, and as the years have gone by the demand for recorded speeches by the president of the Society has been on the constant increase. These records have been a great aid to the publishers in assisting them in preaching this gospel of the Kingdom, and the people of good-will who hear them receive real comfort. During the past year it has been our good pleasure to ship out 225,774 discs. These recordings consisted mainly of the lectures “The End” and “Religion”, which were released at the close of last year. 217,691 were English recordings; 6,415 in other tongues; and 1,668 quartet and organ records used by the publishers in opening public meetings at their Kingdom Halls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The importance of the use of records, and the blessings bestowed upon the people of good-will by this means, can be better appreciated when one knows that since the lectures of the president of the Society have been recorded on phonograph records 1,159,083 doublefaced discs have been distributed throughout the world from the Brooklyn office. These records have done their share in sticking into “Eglon” the dagger that exposed the “excrement”, so well picturing the wickedness and corruption which the religionists so long sought to hide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Much to the joy of all publishers also was the announcement at the close of the fiscal year of three new series of records. Simultaneous recordings were made of Brother Rutherford's speeches “Integrity”, “Comfort All That Mourn,” and “Children of The King”. These are now in course of manufacture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was the president’s great desire to furnish the publishers with a special record that the publishers could use in presenting the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> to the people as they go from door to door. Due to illness on the part of Brother Rutherford, he had delayed the making of the two records “Children” and “Theocracy”; but knowing of the shortness of the time in which to do the work and the need of this message in the field he got up from his sickbed to make these records. The test records have already been received, and those having heard them expressed real delight and joy in the wonderful message they contain. All are anxious to get them so chat they can present </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> to the people by means of the friendly, sincere, and kind voice of Brother Rutherford. Of all of these new records the Society has already placed orders for 207,000 discs with the manufacturers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Publication</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The field activity for the year 1941 was very richly blessed of Jehovah. As the battle grows hotter and the end of demon rule gets nearer those in a covenant by sacrifice and those in the “cities of refuge” stand shoulder to shoulder following the admonition of our God, “Keep my commandments, and live.” (Proverbs 7:2) Jehovah, by his Son, Christ Jesus, is gathering his “other sheep”, and these have made themselves manifest during the past year more than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Outstanding in the year’s report of field service is the great number of publishers engaging in the field A peak of 64,947 publishers went forward at one time preaching the gospel of the Kingdom. These publishers have, by the Lord’s grace, performed the greatest witness ever given in the United States. Operating under the direction of the Higher Powers, spurred on by the “food convenient” for them, the convention, and intense persecution, all moved forward to give the greatest witness ever proclaimed in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Month by month, campaign after campaign, more publishers came into the field, and by September, the last month of the fiscal year, there were 60,094 company publishers and 4,853 full-time workers. The time that all these brethren put in in the field in one year amounted to 14,533,140 hours, or more than two million more hours witnessing for the Kingdom than in 1940. It is no wonder that, with such effort put forth by the servants of Jehovah, much physical persecution and the wrath of men was brought down upon His witnesses; for they are surely hated by the Devil’s organization. During 1941 the ‘pile of stones in the midst of the river Jordan’ was made even higher, as the report herewith indicates.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hours. The one thing that a publisher has and can devote to the Lord is time. While the aggregate of 14,533,140 hours is a tremendous amount of time, there is room for great improvement on the part of all the publishers, both company and pioneer. Brother Rutherford has brought this to the attention of the brethren time and time again through special letters. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> has pointed out the need of more time, and as the days become more perilous and the time shorter, every one of the servants of The Theocracy should endeavor to do more in the “strange work” that the Lord has committed into our hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The company publishers, of which there was an average of 52,696 each month, devoted 14.7 hours per publisher. This is far from the 60-hour quota toward which all company publishers should strive. Pioneers devoted, on the average, 106 9 hours for each of the 4,049 reporting monthly throughout the year. This can be greatly improved by striving toward that 150-hour requirement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Literature. Outstanding in the year is the report of literature placed in the field. We exceeded 1940 in the placement of books and booklets, the grand total for the year being 20,182,645. One of the outstanding events in the year which helped to bring this total to such unprecedented heights was the release of the </span><span class="font5">new book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font5"> which had a very wide distribution. The booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font5"> and other new publications added up to 18 million booklets distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the month of December the Society arranged a special offer of booklets, 7 on a contribution of 10c, and in the month of December and during the first twelve days of January the report shows that over 7 million booklets were distributed. This in the middle of winter! The campaign which began this distribution was called “‘Courage’ Testimony Period”, and Jehovah’s witnesses did show forth courage in pressing the battle to the gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another feature of the year that brought high the distribution of bound books was the special offer made in June of 3 bound books on a contribution of 35c. In that month alone 630,000 bound books were placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then came the convention in August, with the release of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children;</span><span class="font5"> and every book that could be made before the end of the year was practically placed in the hands of the people, which added to this wonderful total of nearly two million copies of bound books placed in the United States alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Magazines. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine is now the most important publication we have in feeding the “other sheep”. Continually the great truths brought forth from the Lord’s storehouse are furnished to all the people of good-will through this means. A little over a year ago this magazine, along with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation, </span><span class="font5">was first introduced on street corners and route work was organized. During the past twelve months the publishers really pushed this phase of the work, and distributed 6,215,856 copies of the two magazines, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> taking the lead. These six million copies of magazines were distributed in addition to the twenty million books and booklets; and this grand total of 26 million books, booklets, and magazines placed in the hands of the people has done a marvelous work in awakening the “Jael” class, and showing them the course to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Outstanding in the year was the campaign from February to May beginning with “Ehud’s Sword” Testimony Period, which introduced the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">'Watchtower </span><span class="font5">magazine to the householders on the basis of a year’s subscription. The quota set was 100,000 new subscriptions ; and this was well surpassed. During the entire, year the brethren obtained in the field 128,771 new subscriptions for the magazines </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font5"> The wide distribution of publications is cutting deep into ‘Eglon’s old belly’, and the “other sheep” are now discerning the wickedness of religion and are pulling away from it. The fact that 115,000 persons attended the Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses proves that the people of good-will are seeking after the Lord and are forsaking religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Back-Calls and Model Studies. Every branch of the service in the report given above shows an increase, with the exception of the sound attendance. Back-calls go ahead by nearly a million more than in 1940, but the attendance for those hearing the recorded lectures dropped; and this can be explained by the fact that much of the sound-car work is gradually being discontinued because the equipment is wearing out and not being replaced. The principal work announced by the Society is that of back-calls and model studies and the use of phonograph records in the homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year 2,897,810 back-calls were made. This is by no means what it should be. Brother Rutherford has often pointed out the importance of back-calls and model studies being conducted by every person representing The Theocracy. While the witness is in itself tremendous and irks the enemy because of the continual moving forward of the Lord’s organization, this phase of activity can be greatly improved. The company publishers have averaged only 3 back-calls month per publisher; which should be 12. The pioneers have averaged only 20.5 back-calls for fulltime workers. This should be no less than 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the release of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> Study Course followed up by back-calls and model studies, and the organizing of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> study groups, this work should be greatly increased and of necessity must be, in order to assist the thousands upon thousands of people of good-will yet to be reached. There are more phonographs in use in the field than at any time heretofore, and a greater assortment of records. There are now three </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study </span><span class="font5">booklets, No. 3 being released during the year; and this should help increase this activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even though individual averages are low compared with what we should be doing, we exceed by far any previous year’s activities in back-calls and model studies combined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Memorial time, in the spring of the year, the report shows 61,449 attended Memorial services and only 13,889 partook. This indicates that the remnant is growing smaller in number and their companions are taking on the burden of the &quot;strange work” and pressing on with joy and gladness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is interesting to note that in the United States the number of partakers at the Memorial decreased more than 2,000, as compared with the previous year, whereas the attendance showed an increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocratic Work. Moving on month by month the Hierarchy and the enemies of the Kingdom continued to use their vicious influence to hinder the work, and constantly, throughout the year, much trouble occurred in Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona, and Indiana, and many other places. From one end of the country to the other the Devil’s servants manifested their bitter hatred of the tremendous forward push of The Theocracy and tried to stop it at every turn; but the result was an awakening of a greater number of people of good-will than ever before. More persons are now attending our meetings and studies and more have taken a definite stand and are joining in the proclamation work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Advertising. The servants of The Theocracy are the best advertisers in the world, and they have the </span><span class="font5">greatest thing in the world to advertise, God’s Kingdom. Not only do they advertise the Kingdom with the books and booklets and magazines and phonograph and by word of mouth, but many other instruments are provided by the Lord, among which is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News.</span><span class="font5"> Over 18 million copies were distributed throughout the year. Placards, used in advertising meetings on special occasions, were used extensively. Folders describing the latest publications of the Society were put out to the extent of 13 million from door to door. The bookmark has been a helpful instrument, and half a million of these were placed with the books as they were distributed in the field; and these direct the reader to the regular meetings of the local companies. A new form of advertising was introduced during the year, namely, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> Study Course. The whole purpose of this is to get the people to read the literature they have already obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the advertising is measured in its greatest volume by books, booklets and magazines, millions upon millions of copies of leaflets and folders were also distributed, and by word of mouth a tremendous witness is given to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers. During the year a series of special letters were sent out to all companies, calling attention of the brethren to the wonderful privileges of service set before them in the full-time work. The response to the call to, pioneer service was excellent. The campaign started in March, and month by month the ranks of the pioneers grew. The first month it increased by 103 pioneers; April, 127; May, 302; June, 307; and July, 464. In August almost everybody went to the convention, but there applications were filed for pioneer service by over 700. By the end of the year a grand total of 2,093 new pioneers had been enrolled. In closing the records of the Society at the end of the year it was found there are 5,463 actually enrolled in full-time service. This is the greatest number ever engaged in this field in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pioneers in their activity did remarkably well, and it is a real pleasure to examine the foregoing comparative report of full-time service and the work they did, compared with company publishers, and that which was accomplished by them in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This small band, which is growing month by month and which we hope will soon reach 7,000, witnessed for more than 5 million hours, made nearly a million back-calls, and placed over 7£ million books and booklets as well as 1,700,000 magazines All of this far exceeds that work accomplished by pioneers in the previous year. While many pioneers are enrolled, some of them have as yet not reported, and, therefore, we look forward to a new peak even greater than the 4,853 reporting during September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Organization. The country has been divided into regions of 25 or 26 zones, or 155 zones in the country. The zone servants have been visiting the companies, helping them to become better organized, so that the witness can be carried on to greater extent. There are now 2,860 companies organized in the United States, and all of the 52,000 company publishers are associated with these companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where it seems necessary, pioneers have been assigned to company territory to assist in the work. The regional and zone servants have been making regular visits, and, due to their activity, the general organization throughout the country is found to be in better condition than some years back. A better co-operation exists between the pioneers and companies, and unity is prevalent throughout the entire country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While we have 2,860 company organizations in the United States, there are still approximately 1,900 towns and cities with a population of over 2,500 where there are no company organizations. In fact, there are 1,184 cities that have a population of 4,000 or more without any representatives of The Theocracy in those cities. Consequently there is much work for pioneers in organizing companies there, and greater activity must be shown on the part of company publishers in their territory, so that the people of good-will everywhere may have an opportunity to study and take a stand for The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While 1941 has been the greatest of all years as far as the proclamation of The Theocracy in this country is concerned, we look forward, since the Theocratic Assembly at St. Louis, to even a greater witness on the part of the servants of the Most High God. As long as the Lord permits His people to go forward with the proclamation, even though the opposition is great, by His grace, with His help, and under His protection a greater witness can be accomplished to His glory and to His praise. We look forward to the coming year with its joys, its privileges of service and greater opportunities, and the maintaining of our integrity, all to the vindication of Jehovah’s name and word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Other Countries Reporting to the Brooklyn Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of the countries where the number of publishers is too small to maintain a Branch office and which are under the direction of the Brooklyn office, reports have been received from 15 countries and territories. Some of the countries from which reports were sent in last year have been so affected by the war conditions that it was impossible to receive reports this year; however, even in these benighted places the faithful continue to hold high the banner of truth and comfort those that mourn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Notwithstanding the fact that many of the brethren in these isolated places have never been visited by zone and regional servants, it is very gratifying to note the all-round increase in the outlying countries. It is a joy to see the number of publishers has almost doubled in the course of the past year, and this, no doubt, is due to the increased efforts put forth by the brethren in the back-call and model-study work and the use of the phonograph. A combined report and also individual reports are set out herewith for the countries reporting to the Brooklyn office:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>CUBA and PUERTO RICO</span></h2>
<p><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font4">This report shows a marvelous increase over that of last year, and once again most of the work has been done in Cuba. Cuba is receiving a very fine witness and the brethren there are carrying into operation every feature of the Kingdom activity. All companies in the island are visited regularly by a zone servant, and this has contributed to the efficiency of the isolated publishers especially. Magazine bags have been provided for the publishers, with the titles and prices printed thereon in Spanish, and the street work with the Spanish magazines has progressed well, much to the dismay of the instigators of Catholic Action. More than four times the number of individual magazines were distributed during 1941 as compared with 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During a good portion of the past year the radio has been used to good advantage in parts of Cuba. Two radio stations have freely donated time to the spreading of the Kingdom message, and this has been a great blessing to the people of good-will. One station has given a half hour each day for our program, and stubbornly refuses to yield to the pressure of the Catholic Hierarchy brought to bear to have the truth suppressed. The management has stood firmly with the brethren, and there is every indication that the radio will be used effectively during the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is much work still to be done in Cuba. Transportation facilities are none too good, and this has been an obstacle to the brethren, but gradually the isolated sections are being reached. As m most parts of the earth where the Hierarchy rule, the people of Cuba are oppressed, many illiterate and poverty-stricken; but the people of good-will rejoice in learning the truth and are taking their stand on the side of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society maintains a depot at Havana; and this has been a boon to the publishers m getting their supplies of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Puerto Rico has very few publishers, but these few are faithfully making an excellent witness. There is one company in this island, consisting of two publishers, and also two pioneers. House-to-house witnessing, magazine street work, use of the sound equipment, and back-calls, are being pushed with great zeal by these few publishers. Placements of literature have been very good, and it is expected that soon others will join in the work.</span></p>

In these scattered islands there are three companies of Jehovah’s witnesses and seven pioneers. The many difficulties imposed by wartime restrictions have made it more difficult to carry on the witness work; but, nevertheless, the brethren are carrying on and giving an excellent testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As he does wherever possible, the Devil tried to create dissension among the brethren through the “evil servant” class; but the brethren have separated themselves from these unfaithful ones and are going along in peace, serving the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The countries in Central America, as in other parts of the world, have reported increased activity in all branches of the service. In British Honduras there is one small company, at Belize, and a pioneer. That the work they have carried on is having its effect is shown in the fact that the clergy have made efforts to cause the police to stop the work of these servants of the Theocbat, but without success.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font4">In Costa Rica six companies and one pioneer are bringing the message to the enslaved, poverty-stricken populace, and a good witness is being given. In many cases the people are so poor that literature is placed with them and contributions made on time, thus necessitating the publishers’ making a considerable number of calls; but every obstacle that presents itself is conquered through the determination on the part of these brethren. The Society maintains a supply depot in Costa Rica, and this has benefited the publishers there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Panama and the Canal Zone there are three companies and a pioneer. The ■work here has shown a large increase, and it is a pleasure to report that the brethren are consistent m their activity. This undoubtedly accounts for the blessings of the Lord as borne out in the final results. Every feature of the work is being taken care of.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There are three companies witnessing regularly in Egypt, as well as six pioneers, at Cairo, Alexandria and Port Said. It is now impossible to make shipments of literature to Egypt; but just prior to the opening of hostilities in the Mediterranean area a large shipment of literature was made to Egypt, and now the brethren are busily taking the message to the people. Of course, the brethren have to witness under war restrictions; but, by the Lord’s grace, they have been permitted to continue with their work and report regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in the year an attempt was made on the part of the Hierarchy to buy up all the stocks of publications, their object being to destroy the literature and prevent its circulation; but in this they did not succeed. The sound work with the latest recordings takes well m Egypt and brings a real blessing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The government m Newfoundland has refused the entry of the Society’s publications into that land, and this has retarded the work in some ways. However, the brethren who love the Lord have faithfully pressed on with the literature and recordings at hand and continue to tell the people of the coming final battle and the blessings of The Theocracy. There are seven companies and two pioneers m Newfoundland, but, due to the accuracy of the censorship, it has been impossible to get reports through regularly. During the year some Bibles were shipped to St. John’s and Cornerbrook, and this will aid the brethren to continue with the work for a while longer. Numerous are the transportation problems and other hindrances, but, despite these, the work moves on. Some of the pioneer brethren have been using a boat to go from place to place, and this has been of considerable help. In one village the religionists circulated a rumor that they were spies, and caused the brethren much inconvenience, but, as a result, a far greater witness was given to the honor of the Lord’s name. There is a depot at St. John’s, where a few supplies are still available to carry on the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Iceland, now the site of much military and naval operation, is receiving its witness. A faithful pioneer continues alone to bear witness, taking the message to the ones of good-will without a letup In the summer he travels inland on horseback, visit--ing the isolated inhabitants; and thus the message is spread far and wide in this land.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The members of the Bethel family greatly enjoy their privileges of service in the field as well as in the factory or in the home. In the last year, through an arrangement by Brother Rutherford, the Bethel family was assigned a special section of the city of New York, which is now their territory, and it is their privilege to take care of the new interest and people of good-will and arrange book studies, and bring the people into the company organization. The unit formed is known as the Flatbush unit, and during the year a good increase was seen. This unit, which includes all the members of the family in Brooklyn, sets out its report below for field activity:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Last October the Bethel family rented a hall, cleaned it and painted it, and then began extensive advertising in that territory, and during the year upward of 60 new publishers have begun the work in that section of the city. Several </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> book studies have been organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The field activity mentioned above is in addition to their work in the factory, and often their field activity is interfered with because of the necessity of working nights and week-ends in order to fill the orders of the brethren in other parts of the field. It is noticed in the monthly reports for the Bethel family that when much extra time is put in at the factory nights and week-ends their report in hours in the field drops, but as far as hours in the service are eon-cerned, these are being devoted to manufacture of literature so that the 60,000 publishers throughout the country can keep busy with the distribution of the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bethel family is very grateful to the Lord and to Brother Rutherford for the arrangements made in taking all the members of the family to the convention. Each was assigned work to do there. The family is grateful, too, for the arrangements of the new unit, thankful, too, for family </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font5">book studies and for ail of the gracious provisions made at Bethel for their care and comfort. Many are the expressions on the part of the brethren one to another of their appreciation of working together at unity with Brother Rutherford and all other Kingdom publishers to the end that the Lord’s name may be glorified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The religionists, and particularly the Hierarchy, aren’t howling quite so much about 'getting Rutherford off the air’. They never did get him off the air. The Lord’s organization just used new strategy in getting the message to the people, and after two years of not using the radio extensively the Hierarchy has just awakened to the fact that we are reaching more people now through the phonograph and door-to-door setups with the records than we did when radio was used. The radio has done its good work. Many of the publishers in the field are told, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“We</span><span class="font5"> no longer hear Judge Rutherford on the radio,” and this gives the publishers an opportunity to arrange for a back-call with the latest records. No longer is it a time for people of good-will to just drink it in and take it easy and do nothing about it, but the time has come for them to take a stand for the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">WBBR, in Brooklyn, New York, is heard regularly throughout the New York metropolitan area, and Brother Rutherford’s lectures are the chief features of the programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Personal Visits</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Calling at the homes and meeting with the people is the important thing at this time This has been stressed often by Brother Rutherford, and during the past year, in a letter to the servants of The Theocracy, of January 8, 1941, Brother Rutherford pointed out the need of back-calls and studies. Quoting Brother Rutherford: “Wherever interest is shown, fail not to arrange for a back-call. As opportunity affords be sure to start a model study. A knowledge of the Kingdom alone will now help the people to see the way of escape. The responsibility is laid upon the witnesses of the great Theocrat to see that the people have opportunity to receive such knowledge. Do your part.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He further pointed out in this letter, “Study classes should be started using the books explaining God’s purpose.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A greater number of personal visits were made than at any time before in the United States, and the grand total of back-calls was 2,897,810; and this is nearly a million more back-calls made by the publishers than during the previous year. In these personal visits thousands of model studies were conducted in the homes of the interested people; and in order to take care of these home studies there were shipped out 210,918 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font5"> booklets Nos. 1, 2, and 3. Many thousands of records were used in these model studies, and particularly those on “The End” and “Religion”. The phonograph and these records played an important part in helping the people of good-will to understand what course of action they must take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is essential that all publishers regularly attend the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> studies, service meetings and book studies so that they will be thoroughly equipped with knowledge concerning God’s purposes, so that when they make these calls they will be in position to answer the numerous questions that the people of good-will are propounding in this day of great distress. Personal visits made by the publishers of the Kingdom have proved to be the most important work today; for this is one way of really meeting and aiding those who will eventually be of the “great multitude”. Brother Rutherford has for years seen the importance of this “personal visits” work, and stressed it in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and special letters to the publishers, and looks forward to even greater activity in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Use of Records</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today we have 292 4|-minute recordings made by the president of the Society and which are used in door-to-door witnessing, back-calls, and model studies. Many of these recordings are in series. Others deal with individual subjects which answer the numerous questions of the people of good-will. Special records have been made from time to time by the president of the Society so that these may be used from door to door to introduce the recent publications or the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine, or to show the importance of studying the booklets. Recently the president of the Society made two special records, “Children” and “Theocracy”. They are now under process of manufacture, and, without question, these will be a great aid to the brethren in properly presenting to the people the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font5"> and, further, to show the importance of allowing the publishers to call regularly at their homes to conduct studies. It has taken years for some of the publishers to really appreciate the use of the phonograph, but as time goes on those publishers who have been in the truth for a long time begin to see that there is an advantage in the use of this instrument that the Lord has provided. During the year 9,795,879 persons have heard lectures by means of the phonograph records. Without question, the recordings have played a great part in aiding the people of good-will to take their stand and bringing them to the point of being publishers for the Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There should be even a wider use of the records during the coming year, with the new series now being prepared on “Integrity”, “Comfort All That Mourn,” and “Children of The King”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Special Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year certain full-time publishers, totaling 104 on the average, have been used in the capacity of special pioneers These brethren have been sent to small companies to help organize them and take care of the interest developed in the cities and various towns. Others have assisted zone servants where companies were not getting on so well. The work of the special pioneer is to use extensively the phonograph in his regular door-to-door witnessing, follow through with back-calls and model studies, and try to assist other brethren in the company to do likewise, arrange for book studies and develop within the city an organization that would carry on to a greater extent the work of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the preaching of this gospel of the Kingdom the one instrument that plays the greatest part in the proclaiming of the Kingdom message is the use of the books. The placing of the literature in the homes of the people and having them read this literature and study it with the Bible is the one thing that will bring them a knowledge and understanding. Those who seek meekness, which means to learn the truth, must study. Those who seek righteousness, which means to find out God’s way, must then do that which the Word of the Lord commands; and that is forcibly brought to their attention in these books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font5"> released at the Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses on August 10 before an audience of 115,000, has been accepted by all servants of the King as a gift from Jehovah and His instrument to be used to the glory of His name. The announcement of this book and its initial release will never be forgotten. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> is an outstanding publication, and by the people of good-will it is greatly appreciated. The spirit of the Lord was poured upon Brother Rutherford when he was privileged to write this book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reader’s attention is held constantly throughout; and when one has completed the book, if he is seeking meekness and righteousness, he will take the same stand and do the same things as John and Eunice did. This is a wonderful publication to aid the people of good-will in holding Bible studies; and the more </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> book studies that can be arranged throughout the country, the better it will be for the lovers of righteousness. The beauty, simplicity, and gracious words of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> are a joy to every reader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another new publication brought to us during the year, and which already has </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> wide distribution, is the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn.</span><span class="font5"> This sets out clearly the issue of world domination and for the first time reveals to us who “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other publications that have had their release and a wide distribution during the past year are </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State, Satisfied, Model Study</span><span class="font5"> No. 3, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy. </span><span class="font5">The colored-cover booklet, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy,</span><span class="font5"> sets out clearly the meaning of The Theocracy, and what it is, and how the people can seek refuge in it. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font5"> booklet was taken to all non-Catholic clergymen in the United States, they again being given an opportunity to take a proper stand. In this they have again failed. A copy was also sent to every newspaper in the United States. They spurned it! They much prefer that some “nitwit” reporter get the “news” from their “pettieoated” confessor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah's Servants Defended</span><span class="font5"> will be of real use in the courts from time to time. It sets out therein many eases which show that as long as the United States remains a democratic country and is operated under its present Constitution we have a right by law to preach the gospel of the Kingdom. However, Jehovah’s witnesses do not depend on this right by law to preach, but they follow the commandment of God and obey Him rather than man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 1941 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah's witnesses,</span><span class="font5"> released early in the year, setting out daily texts and comments, along with the report by the president of the Society, was appreciated by all those serving The Theocracy. Over 55,700 copies of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> were printed and sent out during the year, most of them being used in the United States because publications of the Society are banned in many English-speaking countries. A blessing is in store daily to each reader of the texts and comments as set out in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font5"> and it is strengthening to each one of us as we go forth daily to serve the great Theocrat. Books being distributed to the extent of 20,182,645 copies in the United States alone are surely a flood that is sweeping away the refuge of lies. To the enemy, new books sound louder their death knell; to the people of good-will, peace, comfort and hope of life under The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil and his representatives hate the onward progress of The Theocracy, and they are doing everything possible to stop, interfere with, or retard the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. This again was very manifest in all the arrangements for the convention of the Lord’s people, August 6-10, 1941. Not only the convention itself, but the preliminary arrangements, greatly disturbed the enemies of God’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Usually those representing big business are anxious to have crowds of people come to their city, because it brings to them more money. To this end the moneyed men have set up chambers of commerce and convention bureaus to solicit conventions. In making preliminary arrangements for the St. Louis convention, the Society’s representatives called upon the Chamber of Commerce and presented them with the facts of the coming assembly. These brethren were then directed to the Convention Bureau for proper handling. There the Lord’s people were given the cold shoulder. Of course, the Convention Bureau did not believe that 75,000 people were coming to St. Louis; but, whether it was 5,000 or 75,000, we were a “nation not desired”. As an excuse Mr. Rein, of the Chamber of Commerce Convention Bureau, said that he had to take it up with the other members of the Bureau as to whether they would invite the Society to have its convention at St. Louis and give the co-operation that one would normally expect from businessmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No answer came from the supposed meeting, but from then on every effort was made on the part of this body to thwart the arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Through political influence and by the maneuvering of the Hierarchy, this religious crowd has succeeded in getting their men in top positions; and this was very manifest at St. Louis. The Chamber of Commerce covered up all information relative to the convention at St. Louis and never did let the businessmen know in advance of the coming of the greatest throng of people ever to assemble in that place. Wherever the brethren dealt directly with individual businessmen they received the best co-operation and the businessmen were amazed that the Chamber of Commerce never informed them of this convention; but they had been informed of the convention of the Church of the Nazarene where the attendance was to reach a grand total of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">one ^hundred</span><span class="font5"> delegates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under Catholic influence, and aided by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and after the Society had signed a contract for The Arena, efforts were made to have it canceled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Failing in this, propaganda was circulated through the Catholic churches amongst housewives to cause them to refuse to rent out their rooms to Jehovah’s witnesses. Hotels had been misinformed by the Chamber of Commerce, which stagnated progress there. Newspapers played right into the hands of the Hierarchy, whom they delight to please. Union stooges tried to interfere in every manner with the preliminary work in and about the grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of the union officials, when told plainly the kind of work we were doing and the purpose of the assembly, were very pleased to co-operate fully and give us a clean slate to go ahead and do our own work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The cooks’ and waiters’ unions were very kind to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The electricians’ union, however, did everything they possibly could do to stop the assembly, by interfering with the public-address system, and their cooperation, even after hiring the union men to do the work, was very much lacking, and the racketeers on the job stood around and watched our own brethren do the real work. How could it be expected for them to be otherwise, being brought up under the training of the greatest racket ever in operation, the Catholic Hierarchy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even with the ready co-operation of the electricians’ union the public-address system would have been a big job. It was anticipated at the time of signing the contract that a new and very efficient public-address system would be installed in The Arena by the 1st of August; but despite considerable pressure brought to bear by the brethren upon the manufacturers and engineers in charge of installation, the new equipment was not installed in time. The much repeated excuse, “national defense,” was the reason given for the delay in getting the equipment. Neverthless, the difficulties were overcome and a temporary loudspeaker equipment was installed in ample time for the opening of the convention, though at considerable expense to the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many tables had to be constructed for the cafeteria, territory assignment booth, bookroom, and other departments, but, due to union pressure, this could not be constructed on the Arena grounds. Consequently the brethren arranged to construct all the tables at the farm of a person of good-will, and these were then hauled by truck to the convention grounds. The pioneers helped considerably in this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As further proof that every attempt was made to interfere with the convention arrangements, members of the local decorators’ union voiced their strenuous objection to having our brethren, who, of course, were not members of their union, tack brown wrapping paper on the tops of rough tables, declaring that this</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">came under the heading of decorating and must be done by union decorators only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The plumbers’ union demonstrated clearly that they were the instruments of the Roman Hierarchy, those children of Satan, and tried in every way to prevent the necessary installation of pipe for the cafeteria. They would not permit a union plumber to take the job. Finally, after approaching plumbers all over the city, arrangements were made through the co-operation of a newly interested brother, who is a building contractor, to have two of his men do the job in the evenings. One of these plumbers approached the union for four or five good men to help out, and when told what job they were needed for the union officials stated, “There are no men for that job. It is not going to be done.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But it was done. With all, the obstacles that could be put in the way of the Lord’s people, the power of the Lord cleared them away; for He purposed that a convention be held to the glory and honor of His name. Brother Rutherford, commenting on all of the trouble and difficulty of making the arrangements for the convention, expressed it as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Of course, all of this trouble is by the permission of the Lord, and doubtless He will see to it that it results ultimately to His own glory and to the further advertisement of The Theocracy, and we want to be in a position to do our part.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This statement proved to be correct; and never before in the history of any convention of the Lord’s people was such advertising given to a convention as occurred in St. Louis, Missouri, and never before have the Lord’s people done their part so effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prior to the convention, of course, things were kept so quiet by the Chamber of Commerce that even the mayor of the city did not know of the assembly before July 23, just two weeks prior to the opening date of the convention. It was not yet time for the Lord’s people to start convention advertising; the Lord was directing everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">All</span><span class="font5"> arrangements for the convention moved steadily on, and as we drew closer to the opening day the problems seemed to get greater, but one by one each was surmounted and we could see the Lord’s maneuvering of the whole affair to His praise. Three days before the convention opened there were already thousands of people present, and the cafeteria, which we planned to open August 6, was opened Monday, August 4, and continued open until the convention closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brethren coming in from all parts of the country began to assemble at the trailer city as early as August 2, and by the 6th this new city that grew up in three days had a population of over fifteen thousand. In those three days toilet facilities, water supply, electric lights, public-address equipment, a cafeteria, and all other needs of the city were set up so that the brethren could be as comfortable as possible in these quarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The great day to which everyone was looking forward for so many months had arrived, and, to the amazement of everyone, The Arena, a mammoth place, was packed out an hour before the convention opened, every seat being taken and persons standing in the aisles. The adjoining buildings, where thousands of extra seats had been placed, were all filled, too. In fact, when the final count was taken at the opening day’s meeting there were assembled 64,000 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At three o’clock in the afternoon the assembly was brought to order by the chairman, and then Brother Rutherford was introduced to deliver the opening speech of the convention, “Integrity,” and which was the keynote of the convention. Never before had we so clearly seen the issue, universal domination, and the explanation of the Job prophecy as it related to this issue. Jehovah, at the opening session, poured out upon His people a rich blessing, and all could see clearly that there lay ahead of them a great work of witnessing to be done, and that by so doing they would maintain their integrity, though they be hated of all men and worldly organizations, and by the demons, who on every hand oppose their activity. Surely the hatred of all those that had influence in St. Louis, the Boman Catholic Hierarchy, the Chamber of Commerce, the union officials, and their 'stooges’, manifested which side they were on; and now the opportunity was afforded to all of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions to help those people of St. Louis and vicinity who were of good-will to get clearly before their minds the real issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The assembly was greatly cheered by the lecture by Brother Butherford, on &quot;Integrity”, and they were prepared to go right down the line to the finish, come what may. The field activity of the convention proved this in the remaining days of the Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This lecture was carried by direct wire to the recording studios, and there it was transcribed, later to be prepared for phonograph use in making back-calls and conducting model studies. This lecture was also broadcast over station WBBB, to the delight of thousands in the East who were unable to get to the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the close of this stirring lecture the chairman of the convention introduced </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> No. 9, entitled &quot;Victories in Your Defense”. This was received with real delight, and the two million copies of this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> taken to the convention from Brooklyn were shortly disposed of after the meeting to anxious workers, who soon took them into the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The convention now being under way, everyone attending was alert to do his part, either as a voluntary worker in some part of the convention organization in and about the grounds and trailer camp (which required more than 8,000 workers) or to be out in the field visiting the people and bringing to them the bread of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An interesting sight on the convention grounds was the registering of children by the parents at the Children Begistration booth, and everyone was looking forward with anticipation to the great public meeting on Saturday and to the assembly of the children on Sunday and the talk at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From Wednesday to Saturday the brethren worked diligently in the field, advertising the public meetings, “Comfort All That Mourn” and “Children of The King”. Every available means was used, with the exception of the newspapers and local radio stations, to advertise these two talks. Hundreds of the streetcars and buses had large placards on them. The 130,000 regular weekly passes that are sold by the streetear company each week advertised these public lectures during that week. Millions of handbills were distributed from door to door. Sound-cars did their share. People were spoken to on the streets by magazine publishers extending personal invitations for them to come to The Arena. The thousands of automobiles of the publishers bore colorful advertisements. Every home within fifty miles was called upon, many of them every day, and the inhabitants thereof received a welcome invitation. Information walkers bearing placards were visible wherever you’d look. Never before was such tremendous advertising given to two lectures as was employed for “Comfort All That Mourn” and “Children of The King”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The public meeting was announced for Saturday, “Comfort All That Mourn,” and this proved itself to be directed of the Lord. Not only had Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions swelled the-crowd by that time, but, due to the adverse publicity on the part of the newspapers and the contrasting truths given the people by Jehovah’s witnesses, thousands of the public attended the sessions Saturday afternoon and heard the lecture “Comfort All That Mourn”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As was previously announced by the Society, we fully expected 75,000 to be at the convention. When Brother Rutherford came onto the platform to deliver his lecture, at three o’clock, August 9, 105,000 packed out The Arena, jammed every nook and corner of the auxiliary buildings, and the lawns were literally covered with people, and the driveways between the buildings were filled with people. The trailer camp, eleven miles away, had a great audience, this camp having been connected by private wire with The Arena, and everything that occurred at The Arena was heard at the trailer city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the jubilation of all those attending, the 11th chapter of Daniel was made clear. Understanding now who “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” are, the audience was eager to hear more, and when the hour had passed everyone wished that the speaker would continue to talk and explain further the wonderful prophecy. However, being given a work to do, immediately after this marvelous lecture on “Comfort All That Mourn”, showing the end of the Axis powers, the brethren went forth in thousands upon thousands with this lecture, which was released in printed form immediately thereafter. Knowing full well that the newspapers would garble anything that the speaker said, the brethren were invited to go immediately throughout all of St. Louis and vicinity with copies of the lecture and distribute them to the people of good-will who desired to read the truth. 450,000 copies of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn </span><span class="font5">were immediately taken away, the greater portion of which were placed in the hands of the people that very day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only was Brother Rutherford privileged to deliver this public lecture to thousands of his fellow Missourians, but this privilege was passed on to every publisher to call upon those who did not get to The Arena. This sudden surprise sprung upon the people of St. Louis undoubtedly aroused their interest in the next day’s session in The Arena, which meeting was just as widely advertised, “Children of The </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">g”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sunday morning, August 10, which was previously announced as “Children’s Day”, the children who had registered at the Assembly were gathered together into the main Arena. Months before the convention began it was thought that if eight thousand to ten thousand seats had been reserved, this would be ample space for them. But more than half of the space in The Arena had to be reserved for the children; and when this morning session opened 15,000 children had been assembled in The Arena and at a space specially reserved in the trailer city for these young folks between the ages of 5 and 18. It was a sight that is beyond description in words; and this session of the convention made one feel glad more than ever that he knew the Lord. Looking at these children, with their beaming faces, youth, and gladness of heart, it just did something to one that couldn’t be expressed; but it brought to mind the words, ‘Out of the mouths of babes Jehovah has perfected praise.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then Brother Rutherford, in his clear, kind voice, spoke to the entire audience as a good father would admonish his children, and brought to everyone the counsel and instruction from the Lord’s Word that was so timely. Description of the paternal Government of Christ Jesus made glad the heart of everyone, knowing that when that Government is in full power there shall be no more religionists, politicians, commercial racketeers, labor unions, chambers of commerce, Hierarchy, or any other wickedness under demon control. Everyone could clearly see the enemy pushed out and The Theocracy established in all its glory and beauty. The speaker showed how the “sheep” will inherit the earth, and then the blessings of the Kingdom were set out. What a prospect was set before the great multitude that had assembled at this place by the thousands! The Lord had gathered them from every nation, kindred and tongue, from all parts of the earth, and brought them to this one place to hear this comforting message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After addressing the convention in general, Brother Rutherford directed his remarks to the 15,000 children assembled before him, and everyone was eager to hear what he had to say to these children. What he said and the way it was said can be appreciated only by hearing the -wonderful recording that was made of this lecture and to which all will listen time and time again with real pleasure and joy of heart. One thing that will always stand out in the minds of those who attended the convention, especially when they hear the recordings over and over, will be the sight of these children rising in response to the statement, “All of you children who have agreed to do the will of God and have taken your stand on the side of the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus and have agreed to obey God and His King, please stand up.” They rose as one body; and then Brother Rutherford exclaimed, “Behold, more than 15,000 new witnesses to the Kingdom!” The very timbers in the roof of The Arena rattled because of applause and shouts of joy. It was a sight never to be forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To climax it all Brother Rutherford then introduced the new book, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font5"> Again there were shouts of joy and tremendous applause. Then came a moment that is unforgettable, when Brother Rutherford presented to each one of these children who had signified their devotion to The Theocracy a gracious gift from the Lord, the new book, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font5"> Arrangements had been made throughout this great Arena and the trailer camp for these children to march out in an orderly manner and receive this book. The platform was so arranged that a double line of children could walk up past the speaker and receive their copies. The smiles upon the faces of these children were that of sincere appreciation and gratitude to their Creator, and to Brother Rutherford, the one who had imparted to them the message which they, their parents, and others of the 115,000 present there, will never forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was quite some time after this lecture before Brother Rutherford left The Arena, because it was one of those moments in one’s life which one hopes would never end. Finally The Arena was cleared of the children; all had received a copy of the book. As Brother Rutherford rode away from The Arena in the shining sun, he drove down a roadway lined solidly with children, thousands of them having gathered along the route of Brother Rutherford’s departure just so they could see him more closely, wave to him, and thank him for the gracious gift. It was a thrilling sight io see these children expressing their gratitude and fully appreciating this “Children’s Day”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immediately thereafter, throughout the entire grounds and everywhere one looked, children could be seen reading their new book, anxious to absorb more of the gracious words sent to us on this day of days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brother Rutherford returned to The Arena in the afternoon to again address the audience extemporaneously, and it seemed as though every one of the conventioners remained at the grounds to again hear what he had to say. It was a delightful season, and everyone went away from that meeting with a determination to serve The Theocracy and to take the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> to the many “other sheep”. At that afternoon meeting Brother Rutherford released 150,000 copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> to be taken immediately to the field, and it was fortunate that we had a bookroom one block long to accommodate the crowd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are so many things that could be reported of the great Theocratic Assembly and its blessings but which space does not permit here, but the details have been set out in an 80-page brochure entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Report of the Jehovah's witnesses Assembly.</span><span class="font5"> The pictures in this report, and the story, will find wide distribution through the coming year, and all people of good-will who read </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> will eventually want to read of this great occasion and the day of the release of the book and the other features of the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The organization, the unity of the brethren, and the activity in the field all bespoke the spirit of the Lord manifested upon His people. Here were assembled at one place thousands of representatives of The Theocracy; and how different was this assembly when compared with those of the Devil’s organization! To all opposers it was a witness against them; and to those who were misinformed, an awakening. The message that began at this convention will go to the ends of the earth. A work was begun at this assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses that will be of great aid to the people of good-will to take their stand. The lectures that were delivered, having been recorded, will be heard by millions more; and so the message of God’s Kingdom goes forward with a greater impetus than ever before. The gulf between the Devil’s organization and that of the Lord becomes wider; and every person who loves The Theoceacy has a keener appreciation of the two organizations and that it is our great privilege to stand firmly on the Lord’s side, maintain our integrity, moving ahead with the witness work as the Lord directs, giving no quarter and asking none. With plenty of hard work yet to be done, all left the convention determined to aid others of the people of good-will to take their stand now, so that other “sheep” may join in in singing praises to the Lord Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">International Campaigns</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the spring and fall of each year the Society arranges to compile reports from all countries; and these reports are most interesting. They show what most of the publishers throughout the world accomplished in but one short period of time concentrating on the work that the Lord has outlined for His people to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">October, 1940, was designated “Challenge” Testimony Period. The Devil’s organization had just completed a year of destruction and had put forth every effort to, destroy the witness work, but the Lord’s people accepted the challenge and moved ahead to a great witness in October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again, in the spring of the year 1941, “The Sign” Testimony Period, around the time of the Memorial, was another season of rejoicing; and the report below, while not showing as many countries as in previous years, because reports do not get through, is gratifying:</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Report on Special Testimony Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Theocratic publishers look forward month by month to the next Testimony Period, because these periods aid greatly in the onward march of the Theocratic work. The names that designated the months added stimulus to the work. As set out in the calendar, the fiscal year’s testimony periods were entitled “Challenge”, “Courage,” “Ehud’s Sword,” “The Sign,” “Theocratic Ambassadors,” and “Pure Language”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each of these testimony periods, a month in duration, accomplished a special work. During the “Challenge” the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> was heralded forth in great volume. “Courage,” in midwinter, December, found the brethren offering seven booklets on a contribution of ten cents; and in but one month they placed five million throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Ehud’s Sword” Testimony Period drove deeper the sword of the spirit into the vitals of Eglon’s belly, exposing the wickedness and corruption of religion, beginning the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watch tower</span><span class="font5"> Campaign, the greatest ever put on. The campaign extended right through “The Sign” Testimony Period, in April, and greater pressure was added to the campaign. During this time well over 100,000 new subscriptions were obtained and almost 400,000 bound books were placed, most of which were </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In June, the “Theocratic Ambassadors” TestimonyPeriod had another special offer, and m but 30 days 630,000 copies of the bound books were placed in the homes of the people. The year closed with the final Testimony Period, “Pure Language,” culminating with the convention and the release and distribution of the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font5"> The thousands of people brought together at the Theocratic Assembly spoke a pure language. All understood one another, appreciating fully the purpose of their being there. Their one hope is to share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Regional Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To facilitate the work, the United States had been divided into six regions and 155 zones, with approximately 25 zones to a region. All the servants who made regular visits to the zones or companies within the zones are ordained ministers of the gospel Their duty is to look well to the interests of the Kingdom and to aid the brethren in their further activity, pointing out the importance of more time in the field, making the back-calls, and how they should be conducted. Their counsel has been very helpful in advancing the work and bringing about greater unity. The zone and regional servants traveled an aggregate of 2,748,658 miles, at an expense to the Society of $42,326.84.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Increased encounters with the enemy in the courts, with a record number of eases in the higher courts, and unabated mob violence, have marked 1941 in many respects as the most outstanding year thus far. The approximate total of arrests of persons engaged in preaching the good news of Jehovah’s Kingdom has exceeded three thousand, and instances of mob violence against such persons numbered more than three hundred. Most of the mob attacks were in the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona, and Indiana, where the fight is still raging on all fronts. Generally, police officials joined with or connived at mobsters in those brutal assaults against Jehovah’s servants. Such mob encounters occurred almost exclusively while publishers engaged in street magazine work; thus showing that that branch of the witness work enrages the Devil and his dupes more than any other. Occasionally the mob has gathered against brethren engaged in door-to-door activity, and even at their own homes In Texas and Oklahoma mob violence has also been particularly against the zone assemblies, especially when held in smaller towns, resulting in wholesale arrests of the brethren at various times. During those violent outbursts there has been much destruction of property, also bloodshed of the brethren and some of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In spite of the fact that thousands of affidavits have been filed with the Department of Justice, showing repeated violations of the United States Code (sections 51 and 52 of Title 18) by public officials and others participating in wrongful arrests of Jehovah’s witnesses and assaults upon them, up to this time the Government has failed to act to enforce this law and prosecute any of the wrongdoers, thus tacitly encouraging the gangsters to anarchy and further violence. In every one of the 48 states prosecutors have deliberately refused to accept charges against active participants in the mobbing of Jehovah’s witnesses, contrary to their oath of office and in plain violation of law. Thus it is manifest that law and order are fast breaking down in America, with the country rapidly sinking to the level of totalitarian rule, under the same spirit prevalent here in the “land of the free” as in Nazi Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many so-called Bill of Rights and Civil Rights Committees of the bar associations of the various states, established to protect and preserve constitutional liberties, have failed to come to the aid of Jehovah’s witnesses and to defend the Constitution which they profess they were set up to defend, although opportunity was open to such committees to do so. The most flagrant example of this dereliction is in Texas. The Bill of Rights Committee of the Texas Bar Association, in face of wide publicity as to violations of civil liberties and mob violence throughout the entire state, in July, 1941, made public its report stating that there had been no violations of civil rights in the state and because of that the committee had no reason to function. In that report the committee offered to make its appearance forthwith in any court in behalf of any person asserting a denial of civil liberties. When tendered the privilege of appearing in behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses, the chairman responded that the committee had been dissolved and that he and the members no longer had any connection therewith; thus refusing to act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Oklahoma, Texas and other southern and southwestern states it has been extremely difficult, if not impossible, to engage attorneys, because of fear to represent the brethren, at any price. A few lawyers, however, who love righteousness have dared to come to the fore with their services, in bold representation of the Lord’s people. These instances have been rare. This emphasizes the need and importance of each publisher to be ^prepared and willing to make his own defense when in court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Out of the great mass of arrests this past year, the majority of cases have been won by the brethren acting as their own attorneys in the trial courts. Many cases have been summarily dismissed without trial, upon their submitting proof that the Supreme Court has said that the Constitution guarantees to Jehovah’s witnesses their rights freely exercised in doing good to the people by publishing the Kingdom message. In this the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Advice for Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font5"> has proved most helpful, and it is clearly an instrument provided by the Lord and should be diligently considered, constantly, by every publisher, as part of organization instructions applying to every one of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The minor portion of the three thousand-odd arrests of the year have been vigorously pushed with demoncontrolled cunning, in localities where officials continue to yield themselves to the anarchy influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the American Legion, and other law violators. Hundreds of these cases have been appealed from police courts to the superior, circuit, district, county or common pleas courts of the various states, resulting in the greater number of such cases being thrown out on a trial </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">de novo</span><span class="font5"> (anew). Cases not thrown out have been sustained by demonized and Hierarchy-influenced sophistry on the part of the courts, under the guiding voice of Hierarchy agents determined to &quot;stamp out” Jehovah’s witnesses and to destroy constitutional liberties of all people. This conspiracy and insane determination to convict, in face of the many Supreme Court opinions and other decisions presented to such judges, has been attended with expressions such as, “The Constitution and the Supreme Court do not rule here; we have our law to enforce and we will enforce it; the Supreme Court cannot tell us how to run our town.” Thus magistrates and judges flout Jehovah God, the Constitution, and the decisions of the nation’s highest court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In keeping with Brother Rutherford’s statement to fight every case to the last ditch, the legal desk has endeavored to supervise, either directly or indirectly, the appeal of literally scores of cases to the higher appellate courts; and this has resulted during the past year in many useful decisions by judges who love righteousness and the fundamental principles of freeedom of worship and of speech for which this country was founded, as shown in the cases cited in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> No. 9 and in the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Servants Defended,</span><span class="font5"> prepared under direction of Brother Rutherford and released in August at the Theocratic Assembly. Those instruments are provided now for the brethren to use in making their own legal argument in support of their motions to dismiss complaints against them when they represent themselves in court without attorneys. Also, these publications are useful to attorneys in fully presenting the appeal of cases on behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the close of the service year 1940 only two injunctions against municipal officials had been obtained from United States District Courts, At that time, however, many other suits for injunctions were promised. At present, injunctions granted by the federal district courts number in excess of seventeen, with others in immediate prospect These useful decisions, vindicating Jehovah’s witnesses and “handcuffing” the officials who have unlawfully interfered, are keeping opposers from further attempting to carry out their wicked conspiracy to ‘get Jehovah’s witnesses’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In one suit injunctions were obtained against four municipalities of Pennsylvania; and in another suit an injunction was obtained against state-wide enforcement of the sedition statute of Kentucky. Also, two federal courts have granted the extraordinary and unusual federal court remedy of habeas corpus to brethren unlawfully held by state courts. This stand in behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses by the federal courts has given wide publicity to the Theocratic Government and aided much in removing prejudice resulting from lies circulated by the Catholic Hierarchy and its American Legion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The policy of pushing the battle to the gate, irrespective of continued mob violence, vicious assaults and arrests, has been carried on by the brethren with great boldness in the strength of the Lord, which has terrified the enemies, who realize that no type of persecution, nor even death, can stop the onward march of The Theocratic Government. Thus the brethren have outworn the efforts of the enemy, and in many instances where injunction suits were contemplated they have become unnecessary because the continued bold stand of the brethren has completely removed such open opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the past year, direct help has been rendered to the brethren by the legal desk in scores of difficult cases in various sections of the eastern and central states within reasonable travel distance of New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is significant to note that in addition to the usual “peddling” charges, the nature of charges now being laid against Jehovah's witnesses in some localities grows more serious, such as (1) blasphemy, (2) holding persons up to ridicule on account of religious profession, (3) riotous conspiracy, (4) sedition and inciting to violence against the government, (5) criminal breach of the peace, (6) criminal syndicalism, (7) desecration of the flag, and (8) desecration of the Sabbath. Also noteworthy is the fact that sentences imposed now are being increased in severity. Many whose eases are pending in appeal courts are under sentences of ten, four, three, two and one year's imprisonment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During 1941 the courts have ruled in six eases that failure to salute the flag, resulting in expulsion of children from public schools, does not constitute a violation of the truancy or delinquency laws by parents or children. In all but five states of the Union children have been expelled from school under such and similar charges. It is also interesting to note that the higher courts in a number of cases have sustained the right of brethren who acted in self-defense against thugs and mobsters, while engaged in preaching the Kingdom message. Thus the decisions of the courts harmonize with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> of September 15, 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the end of this service year, as of September 30, 1941, there are pending approximately twenty eases in the higher appellate courts of sixteen states, undetermined. The Lord’s will has been clearly demonstrated in the defense and appeal to the highest state courts, because the majority of eases so appealed have been there won, as previously shown. However, even some of the higher state courts have fallen into error under demon influence, along with three federal courts, in ruling against Jehovah’s witnesses contrary to the Constitution. These errors are demonstrated to the United States Supreme Court in seven appeals and petitions for certiorari pending before that court at the opening of its 1941 October term. For that court, as it now appears, this will be a crucial term and a turning point for better or for worse, so far as righteousness and preservation of liberty for the people are concerned. We trust implictly in the Lord as to the disposition of those seven important cases. They are all being handled by Brother Rutherford and members of the legal desk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Regardless of what turn is taken by the courts, we know full well that Jehovah can and will direct the issue, for His honor’s sake, and therefore, by the Lord’s grace, His servants will continue boldly to lift up His standard for all persons of good-will toward Him, amidst all types of opposition, fighting for their brethren and companions to the last ditch as long as the courts remain and even thereafter, until He says it is enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Watchtower”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is this magazine that keeps alive and active the publishers of the Kingdom. Food is essential to life. That which Jehovah would have His people feed upon is set out in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font5"> W</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">atchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and to all readers thereof who love righteousness it is strengthening and builds them up in the most holy faith. Rich have been the blessings poured upon His people during the past year through this journal; the “Victory Song” of Barak and Deborah, “Integrity,” “Demon Rule Ending,” and numerous other articles have been a joy to the anointed and their companions. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is now being sought by many because of its comforting message; and this is proved by the tremendous increase in its circulation during the fiscal year. At the close of the year there were 356,740 copies of the English </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> alone being distributed from the Brooklyn factory. Some of these are going to foreign lands, but very few, because at the ports of entry they have been confiscated. If in other countries the doors were still open to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">magazine, upward of 70,000 more copies would be dispatched of each issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the English subscription list there are 17,747 subscribers getting </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> in the following languages out of the Brooklyn office: Greek, Italian, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Ukrainian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Witnessing on the streets and from door to door has aided greatly in the increase in number of subscribers, and in order to supply the demand in the field </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazines to the number of over 8 million have been printed and shipped out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Totalitarian rulers in many countries have set up censorship boards, and in every instance the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> magazine is one of the first to be banned. But, in spite of their efforts, the work goes on, and the Lord, in his own way, sees to it that the truth gets to His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Consolation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> magazine has had a slight increase during the year, and its regular circulation runs around 235,000 copies dispatched of each issue in the English language. It is also published in the Greek, Spanish, and Ukrainian, the total number of subscriptions being 13,731. This magazine too has been placed on the blacklist by most foreign countries, and the greatest portion of its circulation is in the United States. The total number of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> magazine printed during the year at Brooklyn runs around 5,700,000 copies. This magazine was previously published in several European editions, sueh as Polish, French, and German, but these ean no longer be exported to the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The witness of the past twelve months in the United States and that territory under the direction of the Brooklyn office has far exceeded any previous year’s report. It has been a joy to everyone having to do with it and with the manufacturing of the literature and the work here at Bethel. The more work there is to be done, the greater is our joy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In embattled Britain the faithful followers of Christ Jesus the King have had a trying year, but a joyful one. Jehovah in his loving-kindness has seen fit to keep the door open there in order that the work might continue. The people of good-will in the British Isles are seeking after the Lord and taking their stand for The Theocracy. During the past fiscal year there has been a wonderful increase in the number of persons now associating with the Lord’s organization and also heralding the message of the Kingdom. More companies have been organized, more publishers are, in the field, and the distribution of the greatest quantity of literature ever placed in one year was accomplished in the service year of 1940-1941. During that same time all of the literature in the company organizations and in storage at the main office has been put in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nearly 50 million copies of books and booklets, besides magazines and other printed matter, have been distributed in the past several years, and now it is the privilege and opportunity of the publishers there of The Theocratic Government to call upon these persons who already have the books on their shelves and to aid them in studying such literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the greater part of the year it was not possible to ship any literature to England, because of the impossibility of getting space on ships, but, by the Lord’s grace, our brethren are using to a greater extent the printing equipment that was on hand at the Branch office and are now publishing their own </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, Kingdom News,</span><span class="font5"> and some small booklets. As they have opportunity to engage outside printers to publish books for which they can obtain paper, they place orders for as large a quantity as the manufacturers can furnish. It is difficult to obtain paper in England, because of the war conditions there, but the work moves on to the glory of Jehovah and in the interest of The Theocracy. The Lord will bless his people and direct them in pushing on with the witness to the end that the “other sheep” of the Lord may have an opportunity to take their stand before Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An outstanding event of the year was the thrilling Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s covenant people at Leicester, during the early part of September. There, as in America, Jehovah poured out upon his faithful servants in Britain a great blessing and further instructed them, thereby stimulating them to greater activity in the field on their return to their respective homes with grateful hearts for the grand privilege of the Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The British report submitted by the Branch servant is of real interest, and will gladden the hearts of all those maintaining their integrity in God’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The British report for this fiscal year discloses a new high record of Theocratic activities in the long history of the Lord’s work in this land. The everlasting arms of the Most High God, JEHOVAH, have sustained his servants yet another year as they vigorously pressed forward in the proclamation of the glorious hope of The Theocracy in the midst of the &quot;Battle of Britain ’ ’. “ Salvation to our God, . . . and unto the Lamb ’ ’ was a most appropriate year’s text expressing our continual confidence in the Theo or at and in the leadership of his Field Marshal, the Greater Barak, Christ Jesus. In these days of gross demon violence we relied wholly upon the Higher Powers to grant us preservation to perform his will. To the God of our salvation we ascribe all thanks and praise for the privilege of having an uninterrupted share in singing the ‘ ‘ Victory Song ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work of Jehovah is ever pleasant and a joy, regardless of conditions, circumstances or hardships. The close of this fiscal year also marked the completion of twenty-five months of modern hideous warfare made on this nation; ‘ ‘ the king of the north’’ warring upon the land of &quot;the king of the south’’. The Lord in his goodness to the inhabitants of these islands has performed a mighty work. During the twenty-five months of war Jehovah’s servants were used to place 13,254,114 pieces of literature comprised of Bibles, books and booklets to comfort the people. This amounts to more than one piece of literature for every home in the land, or 28 percent of the 47,047,368 books and booklets placed in the twenty years since 1921. (These figures do not include the millions of magazines also placed.) Surely the Lord has been favorable to the British people, and now it remains to be seen whether large numbers of people of good-will will show their appreciation by taking their stand for The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The &quot;Battle of Britain’’ which raged from September, 1940, to May, 1941, has by now been fully reported throughout the civilized world: of how London and numerous other large cities of Britain were the chief objectives of the Devil’s Luftwaffe which showered thousands of tons of Nazi bombs in the most savage indiscriminate attacks ever recorded up to that time upon civilian populations. Death and destruction rained from the skies In continuous fourteen-hour raids the whole air seemed alive with demons. Nights and days filled with violence and great fear was the order. Jehovah’s witnesses were thrown in the midst of this death struggle continuing as preachers of the Gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord’s people did not entirely escape from this battle unscathed, although many brethren had miraculous deliverances. Three company publishers and one pioneer lost their lives. Several brethren were injured and disabled. Many homes of the brethren were totally destroyed, and others rendered uninhabitable for a time. Three pioneer homes were bombed Kingdom Halls and supplies of literature were destroyed in the following cities: Plymouth, Coventry, Bristol, Cardiff, Birmingham, Glasgow, Nuneaton, Hull, Swansea, and Southampton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An incendiary bomb pierced the roof of Central London Kingdom Hall, Craven Terrace, and set up a blaze inside amongst the furnishings This fire was quickly brought under conti ol by the Bethel brethren on fire watch duty. That same night seven fire bombs fell on the Society’s premises where the Bethel home and office are located. To show how the demons made the London Bethel a target, in three months twenty-nine high-explosive bombs have fallen within a few hundred yards of the Society’s office, the nearest being across the street thirty yards away. One of the largest bombs which caused a city record for damage dropped only seventy yards to the rear of the Bethel. The office was twice threatened with raging fires consuming buildings fifteen feet in back of Bethel. The Bethel home has rocked many a time just as in an earthquake. Cracks in the walls have had to be repaired. There have been nights of horror and death which no members of the family will ever forget. In spite of all this the “strange work’’ in London and throughout Britain progressed as never before, bringing hope, consolation and comfort to thousands who are seeking true refuge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Spiritual Food Supplies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The life line of spiritual food from Brooklyn to London was maintained continuously during the year. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">regularly visited each subscriber. When certain issues were lost at sea through the “Battle of the Atlantic’’ the reserve supply printed at the London office was available immediately in time for the studies. Nearly five hundred </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies are held each week throughout the land, feeding upward of twelve thousand on this rich, abundant, refreshing spiritual provender prepared by the Lord. For the four months’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign (February to May inclusive) a marvelous total of 21,677 new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscribers were obtained. What a feast to set before these thousands who will soon identify themselves as members of the “great multitude”! Never in the history of the work in this land did we have such a magazine campaign. For the year the total distribution of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> reached 1,233,780 copies, or an increase of fifty percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the Lord’s grace we in Britain are kept up to the minute with precious new truths as they are revealed from the temple through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> We wish to hereby acknowledge to our heavenly teachers and express our gratitude for such nch provision. Daily do we receive strength for the battle now raging on the issue of The Theocracy. How thrilling and exhilarating were the precious series known as the “Drama of Vengeance” and the “Victory Song”! Our hearts and loyalty are pledged to the Greater Barak and Deborah today, ana our determination Is to render aid to the “Jael” class who are now to strike dead religion in their own lives and in the lives of those to whom they will witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How beautiful are the various parts of the ' ‘ Victory Song ’ ’ as recorded at Judges 5th chapter, especially that part which says, “My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people: Bless ye Jehovah”! During the year there were some who identified themselves as those who ‘ride on white asses’ and departed from the active warfare for The Theocracy. On the other hand, most of the brethren and the thousands of new Jonadabs who joined the ranks during the year showed the zeal as those of the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali who ‘jeoparded their lives unto the death upon the high places of the field’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Other </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font4"> we acknowledge as giving particular instruction and strength are entitled “Obedience”, “Noah’s Day,” “Covenant Obligations,” and “Integrity”; the latter of which shows us so clearly that the great issue today is that of universal domination. In fact, every issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> is “meat in due season”, but the ones mentioned above gave timely instruction enabling us to meet issues currently involved. For instance, seveial weeks prior to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">on “Covenant Obligations” the issue of alternative service was confronting almost all of the Lord’s people in this land. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> gave us a direct lead in this matter exactly on time, similarly as to the timely advice given on the issue of “Neutrality” last year. The manifest leadership of the Lord amongst his people m these last days is marvelous beyond words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Obstacles</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There were obstacles confronting almost every phase of the field work during the past twelve months. There was a continual striving against the demons to keep the way open for the Theocratic witness. Just to name a few of the problems to solve: There was a limitation of imports on literature supplies and magazines, shortage of paper supplies for pi inting; loss of stock m air raids; fourteen Kingdom Halls destroyed; government labor service difficulties; police interference with street witnessing; transport dislocations in dispatching goods; rising costs of operation in every way; press opposition and misrepresentation by our enemies; Catholic Hierarchy continued its attacks; assaults in the field and abuse; educational authorities challenged right of children to engage in the street witness work; fire watching controversy; m</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:line-through;">i</span><span class="font4">l</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:line-through;">i</span><span class="font4">tary tribunals; several legal actions against enemies of The Theocracy; loss of sleep and energy due to air raids; repairing damaged equipment due to air warfare; answering of hundreds of Government inquiries affecting the work and publishers throughout the land; rate exemption court cases with reference to Kingdom Halls; appeals on behalf of the brethren in the Dominions and Colonies with their respective government, authorities in London; evacuation problems and assistance to brethren losing their homes; applications for licenses for every form of supply and the control of same. By the Lord’s grace, all these obstacles were overcome, resulting in the greatest witness ever given in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The field-service report reveals an immense witness for this field. A total of 701,276 bound books were placed, to compare with 799,098 books last year. This is excellent when it is considered that for nine months of the year we were unable to import books, and were unable to print any large ■quantities due +o paper shortage. Booklet placements for the year were 5,951,529, which is an increase over last year’s figure of 5,401,184. Thus the grand total of literature placements, 6,652,805, exceeds last year’s record output of 6,200,282. The peak number of field publishers reached a new all-time high figure of 11,024, of which 1,283 were pioneers. 3,221,642 field hours were spent by these faithful &quot;locusts” in the field work. This is an increase by one-third on last year’s effort. New magazine subscriptions more than doubled: 25,935, to compare with 9,284 of the year previous. Placement of individual magazines shows a decrease because of the inability of keeping up the importation of bulk supplies. Nevertheless, 770,392 magazines were placed, to compare with 825,111 for 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the brethren were rationed as to their supplies of literature, there was no rationing in the use of the antitypical “trumpets”, the sound machines and phonographs. We were unable to make any new phonographs during the year, but the old ones were put to full use, especially during the sound campaign held during the months of July, August and September. We are pleased to report a total sound attendance of 1,855,038 listeners; an increase of more than half a million listeners over last year’s figure of 1,340,085. This is the greatest sound report ever rendered by this field. As with the sound work so</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">with the hack-call service: there was no rationing in this service. The back-call work almost doubled the previous year’s effort. During 1941 the British brethren made 628,223 back-calls, to compare with 363,322 during 1940.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The brethren have worked hard and overcome many difficulties that their share of the Lord’s work might be borne. The Lord has blessed their efforts abundantly. In their stewardship they have faithfully protected and advanced the Kingdom interests placed in their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More than a thousand valiant front-line fighters for The Theocracy have reported regular field service each month. The actual monthly average of pioneers reporting was 1,184, and the peak number reporting, for the month of September, was 1,283. Over two hundred brethren enrolled for the full-time Theocratic service at the Leicester convention, thus bringing the ranks up to 1,521 at the close of this fiscal year. At the beginning of this year the quota of fifteen hundred pioneers was set, and this has been exceeded. With the new work now being organized for the new year it is quite likely that the two thousand mark will be seen by the end of 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pioneers have been abundantly favored by the Lord and given the freedom in the midst of a war-torn nation to render their </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">nn s</span><span class="font4">ei fish service in comforting all those that mourn. The pioneer service in these days is the most blessed work ever undertaken by a servant of the Lord. The pioneer report for the year shows an advancement m every item, including placement of books and booklets. 468,306 bound books and 2,793,770 booklets were placed by these full-time servants. They spent 1,655,861 hours in the Lord’s work. Their new subscriptions amounted to 10,982; their magazine placements, 271,159 copies; sound attendance, 777,215 listeners, and they made 290,010 back-calls. The fact alone of the Lord’s sustaining such a large army of twelve hundred full-time servants in the midst of a nation at war should prove conclusively to any lover of righteousness that the Lord provides for his own and this can be relied upon as recorded at Luke 12: 22-34.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Ever since the Dominion governments of Canada, New Zealand and Australia banned the activities of the brethren, the opposition in this country has been repeating these false charges and crying that we in this land are subversive to the interests of the state and consequently should be controlled or silenced. On Sunday, January 19, 1941, two thousand of the brethren residing in the greater London area gathered together at the Golders Green Hippodrome and passed the attached resolution which we suggest become a part of this annual record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RESOLUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses residing in Greater London, in assembly at the Golders Green Hippodrome, Sunday, January 19, 1941, considered and unanimously adopted the following resolution:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Whereas the press has reported that the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses have been considered subversive in Canada, New Zealand and Australia and that their legally constituted organizations, namely, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and the International Bible Students Association, registered in London, have been declared illegal— Be it resolved—</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. That we greatly deplore the action taken by the Canadian, New Zealand and Australian governments in recently banning the Christian activities of Jehovah’s witnesses m those lands.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. That the charges of being “disloyal”, “causing disaffection, ” “ deliberately calculated to destroy national morale and hamper the war effort ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ denouncing citizens of the British Empire as followers of Satan” cannot be true and must be without foundation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. That as Jehovah’s witnesses we are loyal, law-abiding citizens of Britain and fully render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and render unto God the things that are God’s.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. That we are not engaged in a work of spreading disaffection. Our Christian activities are confined solely to preaching the Gospel of Christ’s Kingdom, The Theocracy, which is the only hope of mankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5. That the purpose of our Christian service which has been carried on in this country for the past sixty years is to bring comfort, hope and consolation to people of good-will who love righteousness; that this Christian work conducted in Britain during the past sixteen months of the war has strengthened the hopes and courage of thousands of persons who had lost faith in God because of the hypocrisy of religion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">6. That as an organization, Jehovah’s witnesses have not counselled nor encouraged its associates to become ‘conscientious objectors’; that such a charge, when made, is wholly false as well as any charge that we have ‘hampered the war effort’. (There are many in the forces today who favour the message of the Kingdom of God under Chnst yet are loyally serving in the various services.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">7. That the policy of the Society representing Jehovah’s witnesses is never to denounce a person for his beliefs. The Society has never violated that principle and has never denounced any citizen of the British Empire or any citizen of any other government Jehovah’s witnesses have denounced the evils of organized religion and the religious efforts of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy at Vatican City in supporting such wicked forms of gangster rule as Nazism and Fascism.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">8. That Jehovah’s witnesses are not pacifists; but believe in combating and exposing the evils of this day by using the sword of the spirit, which is the Word of God, and are wholly determined to continue to fight against the Cathohe-Nazi-Faseist element.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">9. That Jehovah’s witnesses in Britain who themselves have lost thousands of pounds’ worth of property and goods, and some of them even life itself, are co-operating with their friends and neighbours in defending their homes and property against the wicked Nazi demons’ air warfare.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">10. That the false accusations brought against Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada, New Zealand and Australia have evidently been brought about by leading Catholic religionists in those lands; that such continued persecution of innocent Christians in those countries will certainly bring upon such the disfavour of Almighty God. (Do Canada, New Zealand and Australia desire to follow the Fascist policy of the Catholic-controlled countries of the continent where they have suppressed the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses because of their stand for true Christianity? Do Canada, New Zealand and Australia desire to join Nazi Germany in their wicked persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses? In Germany alone today six thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses be m Hitler’s concentration camps, and some have been foully murdered, martyrs to their Christian cause. See Sir Neville Henderson’s report in the British White Paper Cmd. 6120.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">11. That as Jehovah’s witnesses we commend the stand of the British Government against the rehgious-totalitarian combine and appreciate their kindness in permitting us to faithfully carry forward our Christian work of preaching the Gospel and in continuing to grant us the right of the freedom of assembly and worship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">12. That as Jehovah God’s servants we champion his name, and are this day resolved to renew our covenant relationship with him, the Almighty God, and are determined to be found faithful unto the end in performing his commands; that we will faithfully continue the work of the apostles, and the Protestant reformers in exposing the iniquity of the Boman Catholic Hierarchy, and continue to help people of good-will to serve Jehovah’s glorious heavenly government, the Theocracy under Christ.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Leicester Theocratic Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By far the event of surpassing importance during the past fiscal year was the great Theocratic convention held at Leicester September 3 to 7. To hold a large convention in wartime was considered by many as folly and an impossibility. However, the Lord purposed a great gathering for his people and it was held at the time appointed. Bor weeks prior to the convention brethren throughout the land studied the booklet “Assembly for &quot;Worship’’ and made their plans to attend. Ten thousand brethren came and worshiped together their great God JEHOVAH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The beautiful De Montfort Hall and Gardens in Leicester were chosen as the gathering place for Jehovah’s consecrated. Arrangements were made to serve ten thousand or more for this assembly. The Hall and the adjoining amphitheatre seated about seven thousand. The Society erected on the grounds several large tents (marquees) which held a further three or four thousand. Accommodation was found for all the thousands who attended in the homes of the people of Leicester. Transportation to Leicester was a great problem, but solvable. Likewise the catering for such a multitude on wartime rations was thought to be impossible. If the Lord could feed the five thousand at Galilee he would likewise sustain his servants at Leicester. The Society undertook the feeding, marvelously obtained the food, and served it to the brethren through several large running buffets in special tents erected on the grounds. No one went hungry. A caravan camp known as “Camp Gideon’’ was set up on the outskirts of Leicester housing about 750 of the brethren. This was our first experience with a convention trailer camp, and it was a great success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The attendances at the convention were as follows: &quot;Wednesday, 7,000; Thursday, 7,500; Friday, 8,500; Saturday, 10,000; and Sunday, 12,000. Brother Butherf ord’s three recorded speeches given at the St. Louis convention were perfectly reproduced in the hall and throughout the grounds and tents, accomplished by brethren who are sound engineers Brother Rutherford’s two informal speeches given at St. Louis were also presented. All these talks by our beloved president thrilled the brethren and filled them with the zeal for The Theocracy. An orchestra of 45 musicians and a chorus of 250 led in the songs of praise. There wasn’t a hitch in the program of the entire five-day convention. The Leicester assembly for worship was organized and planned as an extension of the St. Louis Theocratic convention and was thus identical in every respect, even to a heat wave for the first two days of the assembly. There was a surprise in store for the brethren every day. Enthusiasm for The Theocracy mounted as the days of the convention progressed. All brethren testify that this was undoubtedly the greatest convention ever held in Britain, filling everyone with the spirit of the Lord and enlarging each one’s vision of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On Saturday afternoon the great public meeting was scheduled where Brother Rutherford’s speech “Comfort AH That Mourn” was presented. His speech was as bold and dear as ever before. The brethren were thrilled beyond words at the key giving the revelation of the great prophecy of Daniel 11. What joy there was to learn of the end of the “Axis powers”! There was much Scriptural conjecture in Leicester that night tr</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">ying</span><span class="font4"> to figure out the entire prophecy. But everyone agrees that it cannot be fully understood until </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> pubbshes the whole fulfillment, which we are now beginning to receive in Part 1 of “Demon Powers Ending”, the September 15 issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> On the Wednesday afternoon, as the opening of the convention, Brother Rutherford’s lecture “Integrity” was presented to an eager and attentive audience. There we learned that the great issue now facing the world is that of universal domination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sunday was the climax of the convention. It was entitled “Children’s Day”. Two thousand children of the consecrated assembled in the front part of the De Montfort Hall to hear Brother Rutherford’s beautiful lecture “Children of The King”. All these children answered Brother Rutherford’s question as to whether they would take a stand for The Theocracy and have a share in its proclamation. They all shouted affirmation, and broke out m great applause at the announcement of the beautiful new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font4"> </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">All</span><span class="font4"> children who attended have been presented with a gift copy of this latest provision of the Lord. The new booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn</span><span class="font4"> was also released at this convention, immediately following the Saturday lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Space does not permit here to tell the whole wonderful story of this convention, its blessings, the howl of opposition that arose in Leicester and indeed nation-wide, of the results in the field work, and of the “new work” announced for the coming year. All this has been covered in a comprehensive report now being published in a British edition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a matter of record, on the Sunday afternoon an important Declaration was unanimously adopted by the brethren which should be included in this annual report. Copies of this Declaration have been supplied to all the Dominion governments concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">DECLARATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ten thousand Jehovah’s witnesses assembled in convention in Leicester hereby declare their purpose to continue to witness to the establishment of the Theocratic kingdom of Almighty God, and to maintain their integrity in the commission given to them by Jehovah, as stated at Isaiah 61: 1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We affirm our faith in the Holy Scriptures as the Word of God, and our fullest confidence in the unfolding of his prophecies given to us for our salvation and for his service in these last days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We declare our conviction that JEHOVAH, the great Theo-crat, has already set his King upon his holy hill of Zion (Psalm 2: 6) and that Jehovah is now bringing the nations of the earth to his judgments (Joel 3: 2; Zech. 14: 2); also that by his witnesses he is giving the nations warning of the crisis of Armageddon, near at hand, and, by the same means, is giving the people of good-will toward God and righteousness the opportunity of salvation, and the blessings of life in happiness and peace in that </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom, soon to be set up on the earth; that people of good-will proving their faithfulness to God will have the privilege of carrying out the divine mandate to fill the earth with a righteous race of people to the glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We deplore the actions of the Dominion governments of the British Commonwealth of Nations and of the governments in certain of the Colonies, in banning the service of God and this proclamation of the gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Aware that these repressive actions are in the main the result of Roman Catholic influence and pressure, and that the Papacy is Satan’s chief agent in the earth for the suppression of the truth of the Holy Scriptures and is seeking to get all men into its bonds of darkness, we declare that we shall not cease to witness against it, by the means which God has provided, that men may know of this scheme of the Devil to blind them to the good news of the Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We aver that Jehovah’s witnesses are loyal subjects in every land; that the witness they give is never “subversive” as its enemies declare; but the message they proclaim is one of hope for all men of good-will who love Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Signed) A. P. Hughes, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">•‘Kingdom News”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To further answer the framers of mischief, our religious enemies, the London office published two issues of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> during the year. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> No. 8, dated January 15, 1941, was entitled “Jehovah’s Mandate to His Servants— Witness Against Papal Home - Nazism - Fascism - Enemies of Christianity”. Over a million and a half of these were printed and distributed throughout the land. It was the most powerfully hard-hitting </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> we have had, and it accomplished its purpose. Many brethren have asked for further copies, but paper supplies will not permit a greater circulation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On April 1 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> No. 9 was released for special distribution m Scotland to answer the many wicked attacks made on the Society by the Church of Scotland The issue was entitled &quot;Where Does the Church of Scotland Stand?” Three hundred thousand were effectively distributed by the faithful Scotch brethren. In April the Society also released a special leaflet entitled &quot;Judge Eutherford versus ‘Empire News’ ”. This leaflet set forth the entire controversy between the Society and this large Sunday newspaper and was distributed to all the press and rulers in the land together with copies of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy.</span><span class="font4"> From June 1 to June 15 a copy of the timely booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font4"> was dehvered into the hands of all the Protestant clergymen in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature Supplies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Obtaining supplies of literature during the past twelve months was almost a miracle. For the first three months of this fiscal year we imported under government hcense 189 tons of books and booklets and magazines, as well as some recordings. Only four tons (not included in the above figure) were lost through enemy action either at sea or at the docks. This again demonstrates the great power of the Most High in granting us safe deliveries for such a large percentage of our goods. Our losses were only 2.1 percent, which is considered extremely low by importers. These imports consisted of 230,000 bound books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches;</span><span class="font4"> 1,692,600 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy; </span><span class="font4">568,800 magazines; and 26,500 recordings. This abundance of equipment was sent as gifts from our American brethren, for which we in Britain are very grateful. By a miracle a large consignment of the recordings was salvaged from debris after an air attack on the London docks. We have put these wonderful new recordings &quot;Eeligion” and &quot;The End” to good use in feeding the &quot;other sheep”. The year previous our imports amounted to 351 tons, without any loss to speak of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In January, 1941, the Import Licensing Department refused to grant the Society any more import licenses; and so once again we were cut off from our source of supply, the Brooklyn factory. The president’s office again issued instructions for printing to be contracted for inside the country. In spite of an acute paper shortage, the Lord made it possible for us to have printed in this country 3,026,543 booklets and 46,500 bound books. The publications we have printed and distributed here consist of the following: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied, Theocracy, God and the State, Comfort AU That Mourn, Model Study</span><span class="font4"> No. 3, 1941 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tearhook,</span><span class="font4"> and the beautiful new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font4"> Also 140,000 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> were re-printed by the London office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Branch Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The London Branch office has been kept extremely busy throughout the year. All sorts of problems and situations had to be solved, and a lead given to the brethren. 52,186 letters were received and dealt with. The outgoing mail amounted to 69,304 pieces. By your kind direction, Brother Rutherford, a good secondhand printing-folding machine was purchased. This has proved a great boon to our work here. Our printing department has been busier than ever in view of the printing of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and some of the booklets by us. Our presses are being kept busy ten hours a day, and occasionally throughout the night. The printing department has turned out a total of 4,957,111 items.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The shipping department received the 189 tons of literature and records from Brooklyn m good condition. They also received the more than three million booklets and 46,000 bound books made in this country. This department dispatched into the field during the fiscal year 154,279 parcels. This is the largest stock-handling we have made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The factory department made numerous phonograph repairs and completed assembly of eighteen electrical transcription machines which had been on order. They also made over five thousand magazine bags, m addition to stitching nearly a hundred thousand booklets and all the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The crow</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">nin</span><span class="font4">g task for the London office was the organizing of the Leicester convention. This was a colossal job, and all the brethren can verify that all the arrangements operated smoothly to the honor of the great Theoceat’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The twenty-seven members of the London Bethel family have worked very hard and given of the best of their endeavors at all times. In spite of the terrible strain of the nightly air raids, the increased office and factory duties, and the many wartime inconveniences, the health of the family has been maintained The wisdom of the Lord in providing for the Kingdom Farms before the war is now clearly manifested. The good, fresh food therefrom and the good-quality food generally supplied the family has contributed largely to the health and vitality of the household during these hard times. You will also be pleased to learn that the family’s field service is 30 percent greater than for the year previous. The blackout does not hinder the family from serving The Theocracy almost night and day. Below is the field report for the Bethel family.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Society’s twenty-nine zone servants faithfully continue to serve the 480 companies organized throughout the land. In the course of their duties they have traveled 218,810 miles. The companies in the field operate 1,527 weekly studies, conductors for which are appointed by the London office. Public meetings to the number of 1,790 were held during the year, with an attendance totaling 48,720, of which 13,038 were stiangers. 1,477 brethren symbolized their consecration during the year. Twenty-eight personal assaults were committed upon the brethren in the course of their Kingdom service. Seventeen brethren were arrested and taken to police headquarters. During the year 646 court cases and tribunal hearings gave the brethren opportunity to testify as to the faith that is in them. Fiftyseven brethren are restrained of their liberty for their faith and conscience, and have spent a total of 2,894 days of imprisonment. This is a great increase over last year’s report, when twelve brethren spent a total of 507 days of detention. The Lord will surely strengthen those who are being sorely tested as to their integrity to The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the close of this glorious year of Theocratic activity, at the Leicester convention Brother Butherford outlined by letter a new plan of action for the British field. We quote partly from his letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“My dear Brethren:—Present-day events disclose that Jehovah’s ‘strange work’ is rapidly drawing to an end and this is to be followed by deliverance of those who have devoted themselves to the great Theocracy by Christ Jesus. It is manifest from the present conditions that those who are fully devoted to The Theocracy must adopt some other method in the British Isles of publishing the Kingdom message. The printed literature is very much </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">limi</span><span class="font4">ted. But there are in the hands of the British people almost fifty million copies of books and booklets containing the Kingdom message, and these can be used to the blessing of all of those who give heed to what is therein contained. The Society, therefore, submits a new plan of action to be taken by those devoted to the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This new plan of action consists chiefly of a model study campaign in the homes of the people, and was loudly cheered and accepted by the brethren at the Leicester convention. The London office has now worked out the details for the greatest home Bible-study campaign ever organized for Britain. The 1942 quota for the British field has been set for three million model studies and twenty thousand field publishers. The Lord has given us all the equipment, even a modest supply of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> which can be used in the field to loan to people of good-will and to study this splendid instrument to their edification and stand for The Theocracy. It is confidently expected that this marvelous new work will open the eyes of thousands of the ‘ ‘ other sheep ’ ’ who will join us m this great nation-wide home Bible-study effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible is beyond question the greatest book ever compiled. It is the Word of the living God, Jehovah. The Bible has enjoyed a greater distribution amongst the people of this country than m any other land under the sun Almost every home in Britain has a copy of the Holy Scriptures. Second common to the Bible are the publications of the Society, of which there have been distributed in Britain 48,820,935 copies. Practically every home in the island has some of our publications, and thus the British people have been greatly favored by Almighty God in having the equipment to assist them in getting an undei standing of his Theocratic purposes. Multitudes have some knowledge of the Bible and its contents, but only comparatively few have an understanding of God’s Word. As Jehovah’s witnesses we possess the “key of knowledge” and it is our marvelous privilege now to bring understanding to all lovers of righteousness regardless of previous affiliations of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The founders of the present-day liberties and prosperity of this nation weie lovers of the Bible. They enjoyed a measuie of freedom and liberty of conscience which knowledge of it brings. These were God-fearing men and women. They were champions of the open Bible and many of them suffered martyrdom. By their courage, faith m Christ’s kingdom, and devotion to righteousness, marvelous for the limited knowledge then available of God’s divine purposes, they freed this land from spiritual bondage to Borne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today Britain faces the climax of her history. Her people stand before the judgment throne of heaven. In these last days of religious hypocrisy and “higher criticism” multitudes of honest men and women are perplexed and have been driven to greatly doubt God’s Word, the Bible. A crooked and perverse generation has arisen in the land who have little fear of God and despise the instruction of his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God, foreknowing of this climax, has called his servants out from amongst this modern-day “generation of vipers” that they might be his witnesses, champions of his Word, the Bible, and lift up a standard for the people. Jehovah’s witnesses in Britain are the last of a long line of valiant defenders of the Bible in this land. Jehovah has filled them with a knowledge and understanding of his purposes greater than any of his servants ever before on the earth. By the grace of God may this great nation-wide Bible-study campaign free the nghteous-ness-loving inhabitants of these islands from religious hypocrisy and give them an opportunity to know the truth. There must be many of this last generation of Britons who will become members of the “great multitude” and sing the praises of the Most High God day and night in his temple. The great Shepherd, Christ Jesus, is calling and gathering these his ‘ ‘ other sheep ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This new work set before us is a constructive service, a feeding work, a teaching work, still all part of the “strange work” or the Victory Song now being sung. The importance of the feeding work is emphasized by Jesus when he said to Peter three times “Lovest thou me?” “Feed my sheep.” (John 21) This feeding work promises to be the sweetest portion of our commission to preach the gospel and indeed a most blessed privilege. Surely the best wine has been reserved for the last.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are already many clouds on the horizon to join the gathering storm of opposition to the Lord’s people. But these will be taken in our stride, as we will let nothing stand in our way to carry forward this marvelous new work of feeding the “other sheep”. The Lord is with his people, and he will not forsake them now in this great hour. We have been privileged to share in many Theocratic exploits in the past, and we hope it will be our heavenly Father’s will that we may enjoy participation in still greater duung the eommg year. We are all looking forward to the early return of the princes who will come amongst us as leaders of God’s people. What joyous days and what exploits will then be our portion when these righteous rulers return to be with the children of the King and lead in the building of the “new earth” under The Theocracy!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Be assured of our determmation to maintain our integrity to The Theocracy and battle against the growing efforts of the demons toward universal domination of wickedness. The victory of The Theocracy is assured, and this is our certain hope.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>AFRICA (South, Central, and East)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s Branch office in South Africa has supervision over the work in the whole southern end of this vast continent, and which includes the Union of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Portuguese East Africa, and St. Helena. In this territory the “strange work” has moved ahead under Jehovah’s direction, and a marked increase is shown during the year just closed over that of previous years as to the testimony given in the interests of The Theocracy. Not only has the greatest witness yet in this territory been given, but the greatest opposition to the work has manifested itself. The work of dividing the people is made very clearly to appear. During this service year many newly interested persons took their stand and are now proclaiming The Theocracy, regardless of the persecution brought upon them by the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy have a strong hold in this territory and are shown undue favor by the ruling element. Little do the worldly rulers realize that the Hierarchy have worked hand in glove with the elements composing the totalitarian “king of the north” to bring about the downfall of many independent European nations, to be trodden under by the heel of the totalitarian monstrosity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the report submitted by the South African Branch office the following report is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is with gratitude to Jehovah and with the joy of the Lord in our hearts that the report for the past twelve months is submitted. As the figures bear out, the Lord has gathered a considerable number of his “other sheep” m this part of the field In these days of great tribulation upon mankind, the truth has found lodgment in the minds and hearts of many persons of good-will. Such have gladly responded to the invitation to “take the water of life freely” and with those already in the field have joyfully served the Lord “day and night”. The Kingdom work has been earned forward under ever-increasing difficulties. Each month the fight has grown in intensity. But the witnesses of Jehovah know how to “endure hardness as good soldiers of Jesus Christ” and have pressed the battle to the gate. The Lord has blessed the effort put forth and given the increase. The figures for the past year greatly exceed anything previously accomplished, and for this we praise His name. Although our distribution figures cover only a period of eleven months, there has been a total of 848,052 books and booklets sent out, of which total 104,291 were bound volumes. There were also 220,313 copies of the magazines dispatched, giving a grand total of 1,068,365 books and magazines to compare with a total of 670,404 during the previous twelve months. Had it not been for the fact that our importations of literature were stopped by Government action four months ago, and the further fact that we have been unable to send literature to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Khodesias for the greater part of the year owing to the ban on importation in these countries, our distribution figures for the year would have been still higher. By far the greater amount of literature has gone out as usual in the two main European languages, namely, English and Afrikaans. In view of the fact, however, that there are persons of good-will and honest heart amongst &quot;all nations, kindreds and tongues’’ we have again endeavored to serve all sections of the community; and accordingly the message of God’s Kingdom, The Theocracy, has gone out in 24 different languages in this part of the field. In addition to the literature, we have sent out 2,896 twelve-inch records carrying various aspects of the Kingdom message, 284 Song and Organ records, and 90 phonographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As customary, there is first submitted a report of all fieldservice work reported to the South African office, and such is followed by a detailed report for each country under the care of this Branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Union of South Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Allowing for an increase of 25 percent on our peak figures of last year, we set a quota for the service year just ended of 1,100 publishers and 250,000 hours. It is with much joy, therefore, that we can report a peak of 1,253 publishers reached in May, while the hours of field service amounted to 289,278. The increasing opposition, instead of dampening the ardor of the Lord’s people as, no doubt, was intended, has quickened them to a still more zealous service. We had a full share m each of the special campaigns as they came along. Good supplies of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font4"> and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy </span><span class="font4">were on hand at the beginning of the year, and they had a wide distribution, not only during October, but ever since. December was one of the high spots of the year’s activity. For the first time we had over 1,000 publishers in action; and although quite a few were having their initial experience of Kingdom activity, the company publishers averaged 19.3 hours and 97 booklets, and the pioneers 142 5 hours and 1,019 booklets. The booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied</span><span class="font4"> prepared the ground for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">Campaign and &quot;Ehud’s sword” went through the vitals of &quot;Eglon” with such a mighty thrust in February that our supplies began to be seized the following month. Although handicapped with lack of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> copies, we made up for it in other ways. The announcement that the first shipment seized, and which included our supplies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy,</span><span class="font4"> had been declared &quot;objectionable” came with the opening of the Testimony Period designated &quot;The Sign”—hence it had a special significance for us, a shadow of things to come! During that same month (April) we reached a new peak of publishers and exceeded our quota for the year. By that time we had received your letter of January 8 addressed &quot;To the Servants of The Theocracy”. Its counsel and encouragement were greatly appreciated. It was a word in season for us. Part of the month</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of May was spent in obtaining signatures to the Petition. Every Theocratic ambassador was roused to action, and it was during that month we reached our peak of publishers for the year and the time spent in the field work exceeded by more than 4,000 hours that of the next-beat month. They “willingly offered themselves”. During the month of June we suggested that all Petition signers be back-called upon. All back-call records were smashed and the publishers who carried out the Society’s suggestion had many wonderful experiences. June was easily the best month in the entire year for the placement of bound volumes. To give some idea of the tremendous interest aroused by the seizure of our publications, and also of the manifest blessing of the Lord when organization instructions are carried out, the figures of three company publishers in the Durban company for the month of June are included in this report.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">During June the pioneers averaged 66 back-calls each, and the company publishers 7.1. These figures, while easily the best for the year, could have been improved upon very considerably if all had appreciated the privilege and responsibility of back-calling on the Petition signers. The close of the year finds us “sounding the trumpet” more lustily than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Convention. One of the most outstanding events during the past year was the convention at Johannesburg during the weekend of April 11-14. Approximately 800 brethren assembled, from all parts of the country. The Lord’s blessing was poured out richly and all present were greatly encouraged and stimulated. An excellent witness was given to the honor of Jehovah’s name. Practically all in attendance were m action, and distributed approximately 5,500 books and booklets and nearly 2,000 magazines. The lecture on “Religion as a World Remedy” was listened to with rapt attention by hundreds of interested members of the public. The convention revealed that the Theocratic ambassadors in this land are in good spirit and standing foursquare for The Theocracy. No less than 186 persons symbolized their consecration to do the will of Jehovah. Two resolutions were unanimously adopted at the convention. The first gave expression to our appreciation of the Theocratic organization and our privileged relationship thereto and embodied a message of love to Brother Rutherford. The second declared our allegiance to the Higher Powers and indicated our determination to be true and faithful witnesses of the Most High and to keep the Theocratic banner flying on high so that the people of this country might know where, only, they can find salvation and deliverance. Instruction was given on every phase of Kingdom </span><span class="font4">activity, and ail present were greatly refreshed by the discourses given on the prophecies which have recently been under consideration in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> The Memorial was celebrated on the Friday evening. It was a week-end of intense joy and enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zone Work. There are now 172 company organizations in the Union, to compare with 127 a year ago. Zones have increased from 8 to 10. The zone servants have had a busy year coping with new interest. Zone assemblies have been arranged in ail parts of the country. A public meeting is advertised in connection therewith and the “Beligion” lecture has been put over on each occasion. More attention has been given to back-calls and model studies than ever before, but there is still much to be done in that connection. The companies which have made the best progress during the year are those whose members take those parts of the work seriously and who are accordingly making a real effort to attain the quotas suggested. The increase in some companies has been truly remarkable, and in each instance it has been due to regular systematic back-call and model-study work on the part of the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneer Work. The monthly average of pioneers has gone up from 49 to 60. These faithful brethren have again borne the heat and burden of the day, and averaged 137 houis and 24 back-calls per month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Magazine Work. All aspects of the magazine work were well under way at the beginning of the year and a very effective work was being accomplished when the English magazines were seized. Although we had only bulk suppbes of the Enghsh magazines for a bttle more than half the year, the distribution of magazine copies this year is more than double what it was the previous year. The English magazines were banned under the Customs Act which governs importations. The Minister included </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vertroosting</span><span class="font4"> for good measure; but as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vertroosting </span><span class="font4">is a South African magazine, prepared, printed and published in this country, it would appear that his action in this respect is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ultia vires,</span><span class="font4"> and a test case is now before the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Opposition. Early in the service year reports began to appear in the public press about opposition to the Lord’s work in other countries of the earth. This apparently was the signal for agents of the Boman Catholic Hierarchy and other religionists to re-double their efforts in this country, and both pubbely in the press and secretly they began to bring pressure on the authorities and to incite them to take action against us. In its issue of October 2, 1940, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Southern Cross,</span><span class="font4"> chief organ of the Boman Catholic Hierarchy in South Africa, carried a leading article which first called attention to what had taken place in Canada and then made the malicious and lying statement, to wit, “The activities of these people, who condemn loyalty to the authority of either the State or the Church, are even more dangerous in a country like South Africa, with its huge Native population. The Government should certainly curtail the spread of their propaganda here, which has not ap-paiently ceased since the war.” Immediately thereafter subscribers’ copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> began to be seized by the Censorship authorities. On making inquiry we were informed that detention was taking place by direction of the Chief Censor, acting under powers conferred upon </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font4"> by Government Notice No. 125 of 1940, which proclaimed that all communications by post, telegraph or otherwise were liable to censorship. In his letter the Controller of Censorship stated, “The circulation of the publication in question is, in the opinion of the Censorship, not desirable, and consequently it is regretted that your application for its release must be refused.” Requested to state what was undesirable in the pubheation, the Controller of Censorship replied, ‘‘The Censorship is not prepared to enter into any further correspondence as to the reason for detention.” Regulation 11 of Government Proclamation No. 297 of 1939 provides </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">inter alia</span><span class="font4"> as follows:—‘‘It must be clearly understood that they may be stopped, delayed or otherwise dealt with in all respects at the discretion of the censorship authorities and without notice to the senders. ’ ’ In the meantime a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> replying to the Catholic attack had been prepared, and 200,000 were quickly distubuted in all parts of the country. The press continued to publish false and misleading reports of the work in other lands; and m January, following garbled accounts of what had occurred in New Zealand and Australia, a Statement was prepared and sent to every member of Parliament, the Judiciary and the Press. This statement gave the true facts concerning Jehovah’s witnesses and the work in which they are engaged. It bore testimony concerning Tire Theocracy and showed clearly why Jehovah’s witnesses were being persecuted and ‘ ‘ hated of all nations for my name’s sake ’ ’. It was accompanied by the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy,</span><span class="font4"> a copy of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> referred to above and, in the case of Parliament and the Judiciary, a copy of the article which appeared in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> of November 1, 1939. Several months later the Chief Control Officer of the Union, acting upon powers gianted to </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font4"> by the Emergency Regulations, issued an order calling upon the Police to seize all copies of the said </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> article. About the same time subscribers’ copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> began to be withheld by the Censorship authorities. Letters of Protest were lodged with the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Interior. In the letter to the former attention was called to the fact that there had been no general distribution of the article complained of and that copies had been sent to Parliament in order that the position of Jehovah’s witnesses might be clearly defined and an effort made to help the authorities to understand it. It was pointed out that the seizure of our magazines interfered with our worship and service of Almighty God and an appeal was made to him as the responsible head of the South African Government to release them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The day after we received a reply we had an interview with the Chief Control Officer and, in response to his request, prepared a memorandum replying to the various points in his letter and several others raised by him during the course of the interview. We saw him again a few days later and were informed that all the papers had gone to the Minister of the Interior and that we would receive a reply in due course. No reply to our memorandum has been forthcoming. A further issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> was then prepared, protesting against the infringement of our Christian liberties and calling attention to the fact that the Hierarchy of Rome were the real instigators of all the persecution now coming upon faithful Christians m this and other lands. It embodied the points contained in our letter to the Chief Control Officer and set forth clearly the relationship of Jehovah’s witnesses to the Higher Powers and their unswerving devotion to The Theocracy. These things were embodied in a Resolution moved by a veteran of the world war and unanimously carried at the annual South African convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in April. Approximately 250,000 copies of that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> were distributed. As no reply had been forthcoming from the Chief Control Officer or from the Department of the Interior, a Petition addressed to the Government was then circulated in the following terms:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We, citizens of the Union of South Africa, are unalterably in favor of freedom of assembly, of the press, of speech and worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Eor some months now all copies of the journals and Bible study books used by the body of Christians known as Jehovah’s witnesses in their service and worship of Almighty God have been seized on arrival in this country by the Censorship authorities This action is a direct blow at freedom of the press and freedom of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“To maintain the claim and past reputation of this nation in matters affecting freedom of thought, conscience and worship the solemn duty devolves upon Government to prevent all interference with the open, free and wide publication by the printed page and all other lawful means of the truths set forth in the Word of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We therefore protest against the unwarranted action of the Censorship authorities and respectfully petition Government to release this Christian literature and thus restore freedom of worship in this country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the short space of ten days 50,000 signatures of Europeans living in all parts of the Union were obtained. The response was really overwhelming, and all, with the exception of the religious totalitarians, gladly signed it. The number of signatories could have been multiplied tenfold if time had permitted giving all Europeans in the country an opportunity to sign. As it was, even before we were able to send in the Petition with covering letter an official announcement had been made in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government Gazette</span><span class="font4"> ba</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">nnin</span><span class="font4">g both </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font4"> We have received an acknowledgment of the letter accompanying the Petition from the Department of the Interior and a further assurance that &quot;the matter is receiving attention ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the meantime more drastic action was being taken. For some months following the seizure of subscribers’ copies of the magazines our freight shipments came to hand regularly and we were not unduly inconvenienced. Then suddenly the Customs department began to seize our shipments on arrival. This action was </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font4"> taken on their own initiative. They had been handling our Bible study books for years and would not of their own accord stop them. They know very well that there is nothing &quot;indecent, obscene or objectionable” in them. We have good reason to believe that the action was taken by them as a result of an instruction received from the Controller of Censorship to report to </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font4"> before releasing the shipments. It soon became evident that a total ban had been placed on the importation of the message of God’s Kingdom. The very first booklet to be seized was </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font4">—that beautiful treatise on The Kingdom of the Most High and which contains the defense of Jehovah’s witnesses against the false charges being made against them by the Hierarchy and other religionists. Six or seven shipments arriving in quick succession all met with the same fate. Books that had been circulating in the country for the past fifteen years and which had brought much enlightenment on God’s Word and comfort to many a weary soul were regarded in the same way as the newest publications—each and every one of them was declared to be &quot;objectionable”. The Customs Act under which these seizures were made provides the right for the owner to claim the literature seized. A sworn affidavit claiming ownership of each shipment was immediately filed. The Commissioner of Customs has now instituted proceedings in the Supreme Court to secure condemnation of the literature and we cite some paragraphs of our Plea from his Declaration:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Our Plea: Par. 4. &quot;The Defendant has no knowledge of the facts alleged in paragraph 6, and puts Plaintiff to the proof thereof.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Par. 5. &quot;If it be found that the Minister did in fact decide that the printed matter is objectionable, Defendant says that such decision is of no force and effect upon the ground that the Minister acted irregularly, arbitrarily and contrary to the provisions of the Act in that:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(a) No opportunity was afforded to the Defendant to submit its contentions or evidence upon the question as to whether the printed matter is objectionable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(b) The Minister did not apply his mind to the question as to whether the prmted matter is objectionable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(c) If the Minister did apply his mind to such question, his decision was so grossly unreasonable as to be insupportable in law.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Par. 6. “Each and every allegation in paragraph 7 is denied. Defendant says that by reason of the facts set out above the Plaintiff is not entitled to an order for condemnation. Wherefore Defendant prays for judgment in its favor with costs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the opportunity is eventually accorded to argue the matter on the basis of Plaintiff’s Declaration and Defendant’s Plea an excellent witness will be given; for evidence will be required to be produced to show that the literature is “objectionable”, and thus an opportunity afforded to us to submit evidence that it is not. An effort is being made on legal grounds, however, to avoid such taking place; for the attorneys representing the Government have filed an Exception „o our Plea, the gist of which is that our Plea is “vague, embarrassing, bad in law and disclosing no defense to the Plaintiff’s claim”, and states that once the Minister has given his decision “such decision cannot be assailed in this Honorable Court upon any of the grounds alleged in paragraph 5 of the Plea, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">or at all”.</span><span class="font4"> Alternatively Plaintiff says that “all the allegations in paragraph 5 of Defendant’s Plea contained are argumentative and irrelevant within the meaning of Rule of Court No. 28 (14) and Plaintiff accordingly prays that the said paragraph be struck out with costs ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Exception is heard on argument only and without the leading of any evidence, and if the Honorable Court upholds the Exception there will be no real opportunity to test the Minister’s decision at all. The hearing of the “Exception” will take place in a few days’ time. Having done everything within our power we now leave the matter in the Lord’s hands. He can save these shipments of literature containing His Message from the flames if He chooses so to do, but if, on the other hand, the time has now come for those in authority in this land to definitely declare themselves as being against The Theocracy, then so be it. We have the consolation of knowing that the action will be taken with their eyes wide open, and we are grateful for the privilege we have had of making the position clear to them. The message contained in the literature, which is the message of the Bible, is in the hearts and minds of hundreds of persons of good-will m this land, and neither men nor demons, the fire nor the sword will ever be able to obliterate it. God’s truth endureth forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The various newspaper attacks were dealt with as they came along. In a number of instances our reply was published and resulted in a good witness bemg given. If the paper would not do the fair thing we had our reply printed and given a wide distribution in the town concerned. One of the leading dailies, the East London </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Dispatch,</span><span class="font4"> published a particularly scurrilous article taken over from an Australian church magazine and which had been handed in to them by a local clergyman. The article included a libelous attack on Judge Rutherford. We immediately wrote a letter of explanation, which they refused to publish for fear of offending the susceptibilities of the clergyman who had handed in the published article and other religionists in the town. A libel action was then begun and the paper was sued for £5,000 damages. At first they intimated that the action would be vigorously defended, but when they saw we were in earnest they quickly put up the white flag and sought a settlement out of court. In due course they published prominently an apology and retraction and paid all the costs of the case. Knowing that you were not after their money, and in harmony with your instruction, we did mot force them into court or press for substantial damages. Newspaper attacks have been less frequent since!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Catholic press continues its campaign of misrepresentation, however, and one has yet to read of any Catholic litera-ature being banned in consequence of their frequent attacks on Jehovah’s witnesses or for their sneers at democracy. On the other hand, at the very tune our shipments were being seized the press announced that 150 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">foreign</span><span class="font4"> Catholic priests who had been interned had been released by the Government and that all enemy-alien missionaries, priests, brothers, nuns and mission workers, at present working in the Native areas would be allowed to remain in those areas and continue their work among the natives. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Southern Gross,</span><span class="font4"> in its issue of April 2, jubilant over the success of the efforts of the Apostolic Delegate, tendered its sincere thanks to the Government and “especially to the Prime Minister, General Smut’s, who took a personal interest in the solution of the problem . . . The sympathetic attitude of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Native Affairs deserves our special appreciation”. A few days later the Society's European representative in Northern Rhodesia who had been invited to attend a convention at Johannesburg and whose headquarters are at Cape Town was stopped on the border and refused admittance to the Union on the grounds that he was a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘ ‘ Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> missionary ’ ’ I </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">An</span><span class="font4">d he is a British subject! These facts testify eloquently as to the progress being made by “Catholic Action” in this part of the earth! The lesson of what has taken place on the Continent of Europe has not yet been learned, and apparently will not be until it is too late. Meanwhile the literature which has the best interests of the people at heart and which warns of the danger threatening is banned and confiscated. We sometimes wonder what the founders of the South African nation, who fled from Europe to get away from Papal persecution and intrigue, would think now if they could see what is taking place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the purpose of the record we here insert as part of this report one of the Resolutions which was unanimously adopted by those attending the South African Convention:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“1. We recognize that Jehovah is the great Theocrat, that Christ Jesus is His anointed King, installed upon His throne, and that Jehovah’s Government is a Theocracy now in operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘ ‘ 2. We recognize the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society as Jehovah’s visible agency upon the earth, through which instructions are sent to His witnesses, who are now engaged in His ‘strange work’ and who are privileged to enjoy the spiritual food contained in the Watchtower publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“3. We realize and appreciate the fact that this is a time of war between The Theocracy and Satan’s counterfeit, the totalitarian-religious combine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“4. We sympathize with our brethren who in many parts of the earth are now called upon to undergo severe trials, imprisonment, scourgings and physical and mental torture brought upon them by the enemy, and rejoice to note their faithfulness in maintaining their integrity and count it an honor to be the ‘companions of them that are so used’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“5. That, although we see the enemy closing in upon Jehovah’s people in this land too, we desire and are determined to press the battle to the gates of the enemy, to look well after the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom interests in this part of the earth, and to do everything to the honor of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“6. That, having been instructed by the Lord through His Word, we shall recognize ‘The Sign’ when it appears and look forward with full confidence to Jehovah’s triumph, the vindication of His name and the deliverance of all who serve and obey Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘ ‘ 7. We take this opportunity to extend to you, dear Brother Rutherford, our Christian love and greetings, and our appreciation and gratitude to Jehovah that He is pleased to use you to such a great extent in proclaiming the message of The Theocracy and laboring for His people. Be assured, therefore, of our hearty co-operation and prayers in your behalf.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Southern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On November 15, 1940, the Minister of Defense issued a notice in the Gazette prohibiting the importation and distribution of all of the Society’s publications, on the pretext that they were calculated to foment opposition to the war to a successful issue. We immediately lodged a protest, a copy of which was sent to H. M. King George VI, the British Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Governor of Southern Rhodesia, and all members of the Southern Rhodesia Parliament. The letter of protest was published m </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> and there is no need to repeat here. There was no official acknowledgment of the letter, but some days later we had a visit from a member of the local Criminal Investigation Department making inquiries on behalf of the Government of Southern Rhodesia as to the antecedents of the writer! There is, of course, no justification to ban the Society’s literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will be recalled that an effort was made in Southern Rhodesia several years ago to ban the publications and that such effort failed, the courts m both Southern Rhodesia and South Africa deciding in favor of the Society. It is clear, therefore, that the present emergency is being used as an excuse to accomplish something they wished to do in peacetime but were unable to achieve. As the Society publishes, in addition to books explaining the Bible, the New Testament itself in the form of Wilson’s </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott,</span><span class="font4"> it is now a crime to distribute that part of the Bible in Southern Rhodesia also. When men make a law that seeks to prevent the Christian from worshiping God in spirit and m truth and is therefore contrary to the law of God, the Christian obeys the Divine law. This attitude is in full harmony with the teachings of the Bible and is supported by the leading law-writers of the world. Christians in Southern Rhodesia have therefore continued to preach the message of God’s Kingdom in their accustomed manner, and a number of them have been committed to prison for so doing. Some cases were appealed from the local Magistrates’ Court to the High Court of Southern Rhodesia. The advocate representing the Society called attention to the fact that the only books banned in the Colony were the Society’s publications and there was reason to question not only the unreasonableness of the Minister but also his honesty. The Proclamation was attacked from every angle, but the vital issues concerning the supremacy of God’s law and freedom of worship were side-stepped. The Chief Justice, who heard the appeal, recorded in his judgment: ‘ ‘ The appellants in this case have raised issues which are not those which can be considered in a court of justice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Application has now been made for leave to appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa. The brethren in that land, both European and African, have given a splendid testimony before the courts and there has been considerable newspaper publicity. In a long leading article in its issue of June 11, 1941, the Bulawayo </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font4"> amongst other things said: &quot;To those who have to consider practical things the presence of these people in Rhodesia is creating a problem the solution of which is not easy to find. There is, in our view, no injustice in deciding that Jehovah witnesses who defy the law (or, to put it their way, prefer the law of their creed [God] to the law of the State) shall be punished by fine or imprisonment. There is no injustice in saying that a man who is prepared to accept the advantages which citizenship confers should be compelled to accept the responsibilities. The difficulty comes in making the compulsion effective. You can call a man to the army, but that does not make a soldier of him. If he declines his responsibilities he can be imprisoned, but it must be questioned whether that is an effective step. Presumably imprisonment represents some degree of punishment to those who will not face up to their responsibilities, but experience here is showing us that it is no deterrent and that it certainly is not reformative. It is absolutely futile continuously to bring such men before tribunals and magistrates and to issue orders which will be disobeyed and impose punishments which will have no effect. That is merely to bring the law into contempt and to waste time, energy and money on people who will not accept the responsibilities which common decency dictates should be accepted by those who accept the advantages of citizenship of any man-governed State. On the contrary, to take no action would be to agree that a man can contract out of his responsibilities, and in the case of Jehovah witnesses this would mean contracting out of other responsibilities than the responsibility for defending one’s land. Why not take these people and deal with them on their own basis; if they cannot or will not agree to abide by the laws of any man-made State, let them be put aside somewhere to fend for themselves under whatever laws they are prepared to abide by. It could be done in Bhodesia, where there is much land and comparatively few adherents of the creed. Let them be placed in some remote spot where their community can be governed according to the laws which they accept. The State should have absolutely no responsibility for them, for since they do not recognize the responsibilities of a man-made State they can claim none of its privileges. They should be apart from the State and all that it implies (which is the people of the State) and have no contact or dealings with them. They claim the right to be above and beyond the State; let them be so in fact. There could be no injustice m it, for by their own declarations they have renounced citizenship. Let their renunciation be accepted and let them be taken at their word.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such action as the newspaper here recommends the anti-Christian Roman government long ago took when it exiled the faithful apostle John to the penal island of Patmos. However, this action of Pagan Rome did not bind the Word of God or stop the witness to his kingdom; for Jehovah God by Christ Jesus sent to John in exile the prophetic visions of The Revelation, which is the last book of the Bible. (Rev. 1:1, 9) But the men responsible for John’s banishment perished. Furthermore, the apostle Paul, who set forth that Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are “the Higher Powers”, whose law is supreme and superior to human law (Rom. 13:1-10), and which apostle Paul was on numerous occasions taken into custody by officers of the Roman government, never renounced claim to his Roman citizenship and to the civil rights conferred by such natural citizenship. On the contrary, he rightly used such to appeal to Caesar against the efforts of those who religiously sought to prevent him from worshiping God and preaching the good news of God’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus.—Acts 16: 37, 38; and 22:25-29; and 23: 27; and 25:10-12, 21, 25; and 28:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report continues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In those districts where there is no longer a supply of Kingdom literature the brethren go from house to house with their Bibles and make back-calls and hold model studies with the people of good-will, and many of those who mourn are being comforted and blessed with the message of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom. And yet even this is too much for some Rhodesians. In a long letter to the Bulawayo </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font4"> a woman wrote: ‘‘MeLuekie himself came to our house. He came very quietly, clutching a Bible in his hand, and when I answered the door he spoke very courteously, saying 'I have a message for you; would you like to hear it?’ I replied heatedly, ‘Haven’t you people learnt a lesson yet?’ To which he replied, ‘What do you mean? Do you mean because we’ve been in gaol [jail]?’ I said, ‘Yes,’ and called my husband to deal with him. But what could one do; he was so polite and was clutching a Bible, the man of the house could not kick him off the doorstep or even call up the police: there was nothing in his behavior we could complain of. He had us stumped, and went away as quietly as he had come. When another man on the Fred Mine was asked the same question as I and replied ‘No, thank you, I’m an atheist,’ MeLuekie merely replied, ‘ O. K., ’ and walked off. What can one say or do?” And in spite of this glowing testimony eoncermng the admirable conduct of the witness of Jehovah and the admission that she was the one who immediately got ‘‘heated” this correspondent continued her tirade in the newspaper: ‘ ‘ Are we to put up with this sort of annoyance every now and then, and is this a new trick to get a hearing? Surely after a court case so fresh in everybody’s minds they must know that they will not be welcome in this particular spot . . . Can this cancer not be nipped in the bud before it grows beyond our eontiol? Gaoling seems to have no effect; in fact, only fans the flame. It seems to me that something far more drastic needs to be done and to be done quickly, for the Watch Tower Movement is a real danger to Rhodesia. ’ ’ The religionists in that land are certainly feeling the heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of the African brethren have been assaulted and sent to prison for refusing to engage in the idolatrous practice of bowing down to and therefore worshiping creatures. They have made their position clear and called attention to the fact that their course of conduct is in obedience to and in full harmony with the law of God; but, in spite of this and of the fact that they always show proper respect to those in authority, these Christian men have been gaoled. A protest has been lodged with the Chief Native Commissioner. We understand that the National Council for Civil Liberties of Great Britain will investigate this and other instances of willful persecution. The brethren in Southern Rhodesia rejoice in the fact that it has been given unto them not only to testify concerning the name and kingdom of the Most High, but to be hated for so doing. There is not space for the many reports we would like to send, but here is the tail end of one report which is typical of many others: “They (some of Jehovah’s witnesses) were before the Court all day and gave a good testimony, and then at 5: 00 p.m., after being sentenced to three months’ imprisonment, they were taken away in the pickup van, bidding us a good farewell with their faces s</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">milin</span><span class="font4">g.’’ We are reminded of the statement made concerning some Christians nineteen hundred years ago: ‘They left the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name.’ And here is an extract from the first letter written by a brother after serving his three months: “We thank the Lord for his loving-kindness and protection of those who stand faithful to Him. We also thank Him for the wonderful privilege we have had of testifying of Jehovah’s name to others. It is interesting to note the increased number of people of good-will now attending the meetings regularly, and still more coming out.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The peak of publishers went up from 771 to 868 in the early part of the year, but, with many brethren in prison during the latter half, the average for the whole year was 477. They have devoted 206,288 hours to Theocratic activities, and placed 4,412 bound volumes, 22,274 booklets, and 825 magazines. There were 46 phonographs m use, and the sound attendance totaled 60,258. Back-calls were more than twice as many as the previous year, the total being 32,727.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Northern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jesuit and other Roman Catholic influence has always been strong in Northern Rhodesia. Much persecution has been heaped upon Jehovah’s witnesses during the past twelve months. In December, 1940, a Government Proclamation was issued prohibiting the importation and distribution of all of the Society’s literature. Shortly thereafter the homes of many of the brethren were raided in true Gestapo fashion in the early hours of the morning and in a number of instances brethren were sent to prison for having literature in their possession, although at that time it was not contrary to the law to have it in one’s home. In one instance of this kind two brethren were sentenced to one month and three weeks respectively. After sentence was passed and they had been committed to prison a fire was made one day outside the prison. A crowd of 150 from the surrounding district was assembled, and the two brethren were then brought forth and ordered to throw their own Bible study books into the fire The brethren refused. The European District Commissioner, one Rawstorne, sentenced the brethren to six lashes each. A week later this performance was repeated. The brethren again refused to destroy the message of God’s Kingdom, and this time they weie sentenced to eight lashes each. Also during their confinement they were instructed on one occasion to take off all their clothes and were made to dance for twenty </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">-min</span><span class="font4">nies. A protest was lodged both at Government headquarters at Lusaka and also with the Colonial Office in London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lusaka Government appointed a Commission consisting of Mr. Justice G. G. Robinson to inquire and report on the circumstances in which these brethren received punishment while serving their sentences of imprisonment. The inquiry was held in private and in due course it was announced: “The Commissioner appointed to inquire into the eases of Gibson Chembe and Lamond Kandama has reported to His Excellency the Acting Governor, and his finding is that whereas the punishment and treatment of these two men was lawful, the action of the officers concerned was unwise. ’ ’ We have had an acknowledgment of our letter of protest from the Colonial Office and have been advised that Lord Moyne is now waiting the observations of the Acting Governor thereon. At the beginning of March a further Government Notice was published calling upon all Europeans and Africans to surrender all Watch Tower publications to the nearest Boma within two months; failing which, prosecution would follow. No Christian worthy of the name would surrender his own Bible or Bible study books, and many of the brethren in that land are now in gaol as a lesult of their faithfulness in serving Almighty God. The Society’s depot was raided one week after the period of “grace” expired, and all the literature seized. As in Nazi Germany the Kingdom literature was put to the flame, so m Northern Rhodesia it was first cut up and then burned, to make sure it would never be used, either now or hereafter!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society’s European representative has been sent to gaol for six months for refusing to surrender the literature in his possession. The Governor was asked to suspend the operation of this Order until he heard from the Colonial Office in response to the representations we had made. This he refused to do; and two days later, although still a comparatively young man, he dropped dead at a public function he was attending. A similar request was then made to the Acting Governor, but he too refused to extend the period of grace. He has now been petitioned to reduce the sentence of the Society’s representative; but it is unlikely that he will do anything about it. Earlier in the year our representative claimed exemption from military service, both as a minister of the gospel and as a conscientious objector. Although he was clearly entitled to exemption on both grounds, the Man Power Committee presided over by the Roman Catholic Solicitor General turned down the appeal and he was sent to prison for one month for refusing to violate his conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even in districts where there is no longer any literature the brethren are being persecuted because they refuse to indulge in idolatrous salutes to African chiefs. Bowing-down is the favorite salute, although m one district fellows are expected to grovel on the ground and strike themselves on their buttocks when the chief approaches. The African brother who is now caring for the interests of the Lord’s work in that land writes m his most recent report: “The witnessing work is still going on under many difficulties in this country, with the aid of the Bible. The brethren in this territory have set their hearts in supporting the work of preaching the Kingdom message with all means in their power. Though there are many oppositions set up m our way, witnessing work is progressing fairly. The hand-clapping and bow-down to the chiefs is the mam ground in both western and eastern provinces, and the witnesses are receiving punishment which is served unjustly upon them. The hatred of the people is exactly in line with what was spoken by Jesus in His prophecy concerning the present time. We are not surprised; because every prophecy must be fulfilled.’’ In one district alone, in Barotseland, 25 brethren have just been sentenced to one month’s imprisonment for refusing to bow down and worship the Khuta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a recent debate in the Legislative Council one member advocated that the Government take very strong steps to remove the movement from Northern Rhodesia. He is reported to have made the statement, amongst others, that'' it has definitely interfered with recruiting natives for the army.’’ However, in replying to the debate the Secretary for Native Affairs gave this false charge the he direct when he stated that he did not think that there had been one case in which it had been possible to prove that an adherent had deliberately prevented a native from joining up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past year reports received indicate that there has been a monthly average of 1,415 publishers, and a peak of 2,330. These brethren have devoted 493,902 houis to Kingdom service, and placed 11,600 pieces of literature. Back-calls totaled 10,181. There were 31 phonographs in use, and the sound attendance was 52,986.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God’s faithful witnesses in Northern Rhodesia are standing for their lives and continue to pray for the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Nyasaland</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Government of Nyasaland has always adopted a fairer attitude toward the Society and its work of preaching the gospel of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom than have the surrounding territories. Efforts have been made there as elsewhere by Catholic and other religionists to stop the work, but these thus far have been dealt with in the proper manner. In reply to a question put to him by Native Authority Kyungu at a Baraza at Karonga in North Nyasa, on June 3, the present Governor, H. E. Sir H. C. D. Mackenzie-Kennedy, stated, inter alia, “I have known the Watch Tower people for twenty-five years. In some countries I have known them to be persecuted and not recognized. In this country I am not going to stop them from going about so long as they keep the law. ’<sup>1</sup> These are the words of a real man who does not take his instructions from Vatican City. The above news came down from Nyasaland by the usual press telegram about two days after the entire South African press had published the news concerning the ban on the magazines. As far as we have been able to ascertain, only one South African paper carried the Nyasaland item! We wonder why. During the past year the peak of publishers has gone up from 1,428 to 1,775 and there has been a monthly average of 1,548. The work is earned forward under considerable handicap, due to the prevailing poverty of most Africans, but reports show that 5,707 bound volumes and 43,471 booklets were placed; and the total of 49,178 is nearly 9,000 in excess of the figures for last year. The publishers spent 631,042 hours in field service, making 96,325 back-calls. There were 41 phonographs in use, and the sound attendance totaled 240,393. There are now 98 company organizations. These figures all show improvement, and the back-calls have been more than doubled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Portuguese East Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few faithful brethren have given some attention to the Kingdom interests as they have had opportunity. They work mostly on the sugar estates and their secular duties do not afford them much time to serve the King. The number who had a small share has increased from 38 to 50, and they are at six different centers. They devoted 9,016 hours to the field service, placed 205 bound volumes and 162 booklets, made 948 back-calls, and there was a sound attendance of 1,006. Two phonographs were in use. For some time now literature sent from South Africa has been seized on arrival. Accordingly the brethren there must now confine their activities to back-calls and model studies. Efforts are being made to have the literature released, but the Portuguese authorities are not fast workers at the best of times, and the matter is still “having attention”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Helena</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the number of publishers in this lonely isle of the sea remains the same as that of a year ago, namely, 10, they have devoted more time to the service, and the placement of literature and number of back-calls are more than trebled. There are now three phonographs being used to herald forth the Theocratic message, and 1,504 persons received instruction by that means. Eighty-seven back-calls were made on interested people, and 432 pieces of literature were distributed. They report considerable opposition from the usual quarters but are resolved to stand firm on the side of the great Theocrat and will, by the Lord’s grace, continue to bear testimony to His Government as the only means of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have had many eventful years of service since the coming of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">g in 1914, but the past year of Theocratic activity has been easily the most thrilling to date. Our King is marching on, and the brethren working in the office rejoice to be soldiers in His army. It is a pleasure to report that the brethren laboring here have put their minds to the work m hand and the work has gone forward in unity. Naturally we feel it keenly that notwithstanding the fact that Britain and America have won the “battle of the Atlantic’’ we are unable to obtain supplies of the life-sustaining message of God’s Kingdom! The Lord, however, true to His promise, continues to supply “food convenient” which strengthens us for the battle. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger, </span><span class="font4">with its stirring report of the Detroit convention, and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">yearbook</span><span class="font4"> and Calendar, which came to hand later, were a source of encouragement and blessing. Indeed we have had so many blessings that we can truly say, Our cup runneth over.’ There has been much to do, and the joy of the Lord has been our strength. Letters received numbered 9,562; and those going out, 9,807. Letters are received in many languages, but competent and wi</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">llin</span><span class="font4">g translators do the needful. Local </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informants </span><span class="font4">posted out totaled 8,319. There were 2,240 new subscriptions entered. The printing room turned out 97,000 copies of the Afrikaans magazines, 728,000 leaflets, including 486,000 of the South African </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> Nos. 6 and 7; 1,600 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Advice to Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font4"> m English and Afrikaans; 3,000 copies of ‘<sup>1</sup> Questions and Answers ’ ’ on the most recent recordings, and 302,000 copies of office stationery, printed service slips, testimony cards, bookmarks, etc., giving a new high of 1,131,722 pieces for the year. The dispatch desk sent out 3,780 eartons by rail and 4,020 parcels by post. In addition, 37,140 single copies of the magazines were posted to subscribers. The week-ends and many ev</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">enin</span><span class="font4">gs during the week were spent in the field service. More attention has been given to back-calls and model studies, and it is a real joy to report that we have exceeded the quota of 12 back-calls per month. As a result of this report’s being made up several weeks earlier than usual, the field-service figures for the office staff cover only a little over eleven months; but even at that it reflects much zealous</span></p>

They rejoice to be living at this time and to be having a gmall share in Jehovah’s &quot;strange work”. Daily we remember you at the throne of grace and pray that the Lord will continue to give you wisdom and strength and to use you mightily for His name’s sake. The Resolution adopted at Johannesburg well expresses our sentiments. We know the campaign is nearing an end. With keen anticipation we look for the sign. In the meantime we work each month as though it were going to be our last and put the best we know into it, so that when the witness has been completed and we render our final service report we shall be able to say: &quot;I have done as thou hast commanded me.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark53"></a>AFRICA (West)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work in West Africa was practically at a standstill this past year. All of the literature has been seized by the government, and it has passed a law banning all publications of the Society and the speech recordings, and has demanded that the public should hand over to the police officers all literature published by the Society. People of good-will toward Jehovah and his Theocracy are even forbidden to read the Word of the only true and living God as set forth in the Society's publications. This has made it very difficult for the brethren to carry on God’s commanded work of witnessing to his name and kingdom, but, knowing that God’s laws are higher than man’s, they persist in preaching “this gospel of the kingdom” and thereby obey the Most High God rather than men —Acts 5:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren, as servants of the Lord God and Christ Jesus in the territory handled by the West African Branch office, push on against great opposition and amidst trying times. They are the target for the religious enemies and are hated of all men because of their faithfulness to God, “whose name alone is Jehovah.” Despite all the opposition, an excellent witness to the Kingdom was there given, and during the year more than 600 persons symbolized their consecration by water immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report of the Branch servant there again shows the zeal that is peculiar to the Lord’s house.—Ps. 69: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The consecrated people of the Lord in Nigeria and elsewhere in West Africa, having full understanding of the times and seasons and watching for the sign of Armageddon, have during the year shown real zeal worthy of the Lord’s house in proclaiming The Theocratic Government and m warning all to flee from Satan’s organization &quot;before the decree bring forth ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the month of December, 1940, a general and well-attended convention was held m Port Harcourt. During the same month five service campaigns were arranged and successfully earned out. Since then, until recently, campaign after campaign to carry the message of the Kingdom to all corners was arranged, and all the efforts were blessed by the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the space of a year the Nigerian Government made four orders-m-council against the importation of our literature; the fifth and last, being the crowning featuie, was a Begulation made under The Emergency Powers (Defense) Acts, 1939 and 1940. They were made as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No. 15 of 1940 made on May 10, 1940, prohibiting the importation of all books, newspapers, &amp;c.;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No. 30 of 1940 made on September 10, 1940, amending the previous one and permitting the importation of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God, Where Are the Dead?</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dividing the People;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No. 10 of 1941 made on February 4, 1941, prohibiting the importation of all books, newspapers, &amp;c.;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No. 22 of 1941 made on May 28, 1941, prohibiting the importation of the records of the Society;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Begulation under Emergency Powers Act No. 53 of 1941 made on June 17, 1941, banning all the publications and records of the Society and deman</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">ding</span><span class="font4"> that the public should “hand over all such books, newspapers, documents or records to the nearest administrative or police officer”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We state the foregoing to explain that during the time the rulers were sitting m council after council the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion </span><span class="font4">arrived and was confiscated with the latest booklets, and we were deprived of the privilege of getting any </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> from the Post Office since October, 1940. That is the reason why our distribution during the year was 41,928 books and booklets less than m 1940, otherwise we could almost have doubled the output for 1940. But we rejoice to report that the number of the people of good-will who symbolized their consecration by baptism in Nigeria and Gold Coast has been more than 600.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the transpiring events are making all to sense the impending danger, and the right-thinking people are confessing to the truthfulness of the utterances’ of Jehovah’s witnesses, yet the ultra-religionists are relentless m their persecution of the publishers of The Theocracy. When the Nigerian Government made the regulation referred to above, such religionists were among the first to surrender the literature they had obtained from ns (a heart-rending sight for us to see), rejoicing that now the heat must cease. But those who handed their literature direct to the Government obtained receipts for the articles surrendered, thus showing that the Government intends to return such articles to the owners when the war is over, because the only reason known to us for banning the publications is that they are “undesirable” during the war. We heard of many, with pity, who out of ignorance of the Government’s intention and for fear destroyed the books in their own homes rather than hand them over to the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The responsibility of the West African Branch office for the literature of the Society enlightening the people of good-will for The Theocracy was brought to an end on the 31st day of July, 1941, when the Commissioner of Police sent a lorry which on seven trips removed approximately 118,000 pieces of literature and about 700 records to police stores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is gratifying to remark that the brethren everywhere have been expressing their joy under the present condition. The pioneers are worthy of special and honorable mention. They were at all times in the front line of service of the Kingdom, defying all difficulties and privations their duties entailed. When the Regulation which banned all the literature was prematurely put in operation by the officers in the provinces and the books were seized from them at a distance of about 800 miles from their homes, these faithful servants did not grudge, but rather they sent message of joy in their being permitted to carry on the “strange work” to its end, as far as these parts are concerned. In their poverty the pioneers are not disheartened, now that their means of living has been suddenly stopped, because they trust in the provident hands of Jehovah. All the ones faithful to the great Theocrat in these parts, as in other parts of</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Society maintains an office at Buenos Aires, and from that point the work is carried on throughout the lands of Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, in South America. In this territory Spanish is the principal language spoken, but many publications in other languages are placed with the people. The Branch servant down there reports that the Kingdom publishers have had far greater hardships and inconveniences this year than in previous years. The discontinuance of the magazines published by the Society in Europe caused difficulties in this part of South America because the subscribers therefor no longer received their publications, and many inquiries were the result. They desired to be fed with spiritual food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The heralds of The Theocratic Government met with many other difficulties, such as frequent torrential rains, almost weekly, with resulting disruption of traffic and transportation; and it is very difficult to spread the Kingdom message because of the powerful Catholic organizations that exist throughout all the lands, not only as representing the official religion, but also because of exercising great influence in the state’s governmental affairs and civic operations. Every effort is made and every obstacle set up by the Hierarchy to stop the Kingdom publication or to retard it; but, in the face of this great opposition in trying to silence the proclaiming of the truth, the Kingdom message progresses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in Argentina showed a marked increase during this fiscal year just ended over the previous year, there now being 227 publishers in the field, to compare with last year’s 170. There are now ten companies organized in the land, and 234,097 pieces of literature were distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The three other countries under the direction of the Argentina Branch, to wit, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, feel greater pressure due to the European war. Many of the population are unemployed, and great fear has come over all the people. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, to turn away suspicion and investigation from themselves, have basely brought against our brethren the same charge that they have raised in many other countries, namely, that Jehovah’s witnesses are “fifth column” workers. Such Catholic efforts failed in their purpose, because it soon became apparent to the officials investigating that these false charges against Jehovah’s faithful servants were trumped up out of religious maliciousness. Hence our brethren were promptly released and given freedom to go on with the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The children of the consecrated parents have also taken an excellent stand for God’s truth and commandments in these Latin-American countries, and many such have been turned out of the public schools because of their unswerving devotion to The Theocracy and holding fast to their belief in and practice of the principles of truth and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people in general are poor, which has always been noticeable in all Catholic-dominated countries, because the common people are oppressed and what few cents they obtain and have left over must always be turned over to the priest. It is reported that during the year past the conditions are much worse for the common people and that because of the bodily hunger on their part it is hard for them to contribute even a few eents for literature. While wheat is piled high in railroad stations and warehouses, and much more is piled high in the fields and simply covered with canvases, it is left to the rats and other pests to destroy, and the poor undernourished people must go without eating anything. The Branch servant remarks that it is hard to explain how, in the face of plenty, the people must go hungry; yet it is so under the reign of “the god of this world”, who is Satan the Devil. Thank God, conditions such as this will change and will not exist under The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To quote the Branch servant’s report concerning publication by radio: “We have been able to broadcast the message as extensively this year as in previous years, and it has certainly helped us greatly in distributing the literature. It is a great help to the work in the provinces, as the governments of the provinces are more reactionary than the Federal Government; and when some of the friends are arrested the police chiefs are shown that the Buenos Aires government authorizes us to broadcast the message. They then soon see that they should not be suspicious of our work and that nothing is being done that is dangerous for the wellbeing of the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Branch office in Australia has under its jurisdiction a large territory. Not only in Australia does it care for the interests of The Theocracy, but in New Zealand, Burma, Malaya, Netherlands East Indies, Thailand, French Indo-China, Hong Kong, Fiji, and many islands in that vicinity. A very interesting report is submitted by the Branch servant concerning all of this territory. The brethren there have been staunch under the assaults of demonism and have proclaimed well the message the Lord would have them give at this time. There too the witnesses of The Theocracy have been the targets of the enemy. The Hierarchy holds high its head like a cobra ready to strike, and has put forth every effort possible to stop the witness work in these lands. It has compromisingly tied itself in with the pagan religions in order to gain influence Over more victims. This is all a preliminary to the situation when the Roman Catholic Hierarchy shall shout “Peace and safety!” and then, we know, sudden destruction will be brought upon them by Jehovah’s Executioner, and that soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Faithful Christians, no matter where they may be, continue singing the praises of the Most High. While they have breath, and knowing their commission from God to “comfort all that mourn”, this very thing they will do. The witness to the Kingdom cannot be measured solely in the placing of books and booklets and magazines, but can be fairly measured according to the time and devotion personally spent in Kingdom activities. The brethren in the Australasian territory are devoted manifestly to the Lord, and, come what may, they push on ‘doing this one thing’, proclaiming the Theocratic Government of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The comprehensive report now follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s “strange work” goes grandly on in Australasia to the honor of His great name, despite the subversive activities of the enemy. All weapons that have been formed against The Theocracy have failed to prosper, and, in fact, have served only to more widely publicize the Kingdom. Our experiences have been such that with David we may confidently say, ‘ ‘ Some trust in chariots, and some m horses; but we will make mention of the name of Jehovah our God. They are bowed down and fallen; but we are risen, and stand upright.”—Ps. 20:7,8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.B.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year that hag passed Jehovah’s servants in this part of the field have pressed forward to victory with unprecedented enthusiasm and joy. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.</span><span class="font4"> far more effective witness has been given than at any time in the past, with the result that an ever-increasing number of people of good-will are fleeing from the disintegrating system of the Devil to the great “city of refuge”, God’s organization, The Theocracy. At the same time the Hierarchy and its minions have launched more vicious attacks upon us than we have hitherto known, thinking to hinder the Kingdom work, but, by the Lord’s grace, these attacks have utterly failed. ‘Onward to victory’ is our slogan as we go forward, bearing high the banner of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Australasian Branch is made up of twelve countries which extend from Hong Kong in the north to New Zealand in the south, from Fiji in the east to Burma in the west. Eight of these nations have attempted to outlaw the Kingdom message and thus have lined themselves up against Jehovah and his Theocratic King, Christ Jesus. They declared the Society to be unlawful; seized its Bibles, books and records; confiscated its property and persecuted those true followers of Christ Jesus who fearlessly continued with their God-given work. Such was the vigorous attempt made to silence the ambassadors of The Theocracy and put an end to the promulgation of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom message. Like the locusts of Joel’s prophecy, however, the faithful have climbed right over the barriers placed in their pathway and proceed to announce God’s Kingdom on a greater scale than ever before. Jehovah’s witnesses are not banned, nor can they be banned. While each member of The Theocracy has breath he will fearlessly sound the trumpet of warning. The admonition of Paul to the Philippians (1: 28) aptly describes the present situation, to wit, “And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In spite of the incessant attacks of the enemy the Song of Victory swells in volume day by day as the refugees to The Theocracy join their voices with those of the anointed in joyfully singing the praises of Jehovah, and, with one accord, saying, ‘Salvation unto our God and unto the Lamb.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Theocracy Outlawed in Australia</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">About the time of the Theocratic Convention in July, 1940, the Hierarchy began a more vigorous campaign against us in Augtraha. They worked in the pohtical arena and through two of their lickgpittle newgpapers. Thege latter, typical Hierarchy ragg which thrive on murder, rape and divorce, set up a constant barrage of vilification and slander in an endeavor to turn public opinion against us. The net result was that we were widely advertised throughout the Commonwealth and became a topic of conversation in all walks of life. And so the dividing work went on apace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Simultaneously politicians in the various state parliaments took up the cry and repeatedly petitioned the Federal Government to act. The attorney-general, Mr. W. M. (“Billy”) Hughes stated that the nation was fighting this war for freedom and he did not propose to defeat its aim by taking that freedom from a section of its citizens. He said that if and when it became necessary, because of subversive activity, for the Commonwealth to act, he would deal with the individual perpetrators in a manner adequately provided by law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The premier of New South Wales led the political jackals in the fight against God. In October, 1940, he gave the press a false and malicious statement containing many unfounded allegations, and finally a threat that as the Federal Government had not taken action, the State would put in motion the necessary legal machinery which would give them power to act against us. A few months later his government was thrown out on the scrap-heap at a general election.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order that the responsible officials and the people should have a chance to learn the true facts, an open letter from the Society was sent to the premier, and copies to all members of Parhament. Later it was printed in an issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font4">and distributed in all parts of Australia and New Zealand, with excellent results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A Letter To the Premier of New South Wales From Watchtower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Honourable, The Premier, Alexander Mair Esq., M.LA, Parliament House, Sydney, N. S. W.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sir,—</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having read the newspaper report of your remarks in the Legislative Assembly on October 15, I ask that you would be fair enough to consider the facts herein submitted. It is unfortunate that so many public men take the rantings of mediocre newspapers, and fail to ascertain the real facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr. A. MacGillivray, Manager and Attorney for the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society in Australasia, has offered to debate with any person of repute, the question of the loyalty of Jehovah’s witnesses, over a nation-wide radio hook-up. But that challenge has passed unheeded. Apparently the “superpatriots” have gracefully withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The statements made on the floor of the House, being without foundation, are no doubt calculated to turn the people against Jehovah’s witnesses The accusers of Jesus said practically the same thing, as recorded at Luke 23: 2, to wit: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘ ‘ We</span><span class="font4"> found this fellow [Jesus] perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tiibute to Cassar, saying that he himself is Christ a king.” The demonized mob, goaded on by the clergy, demanded the murder of Jesus and were successful in having him crucified. Are you endeavouring to mould public opinion in a like manner! With the psalmist we confidently say, “The Lord is on my side, I will not fear: What can man do unto me!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judge Butherf ord’s lecture, “Face the Facts,” was delivered in September, 1938, at the Eoyal Albert Hall, London, to an international audience of 150,000 people. More than ten million copies of a booklet of the same name are now in the hands of the people Your action, in wrenching from its setting one small quotation and adding words of your own, is odious to fair-minded persons who are not so easily deceived. Back in 1938, Judge Butherford warned the people of Britain of the approach of the totalitarian combine sponsored by the Papacy. He cautioned them to be calm and put their full trust in Jehovah God and the Theocratic Government under Chnst Jesus, who in due time will destroy all his enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You are also reported as quoting from a yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses It is incredible that you should omit to mention that the book was published in 1933, when Hitler first came to power. You well know, Sir, that the ideals placed before the German nation, m fact, the whole world, by Hitler at that tune, and his subsequent course of action are in direct contrast to each other. It was m 1938 that Hitler, at the request of the German Boman Catholic priests, officially dissolved Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany, where there are now more than 6,000 in concentration camps. For confirmation please read H. M Government’s White Paper, Germany No. 2 (1939) entitled “Treatment of German Nationals in Germany”. Can it be that you would deliberately deceive the people by making such statements!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On July 3, 1940, J. Edgar Hoover, Chief of the Federal Bureau of Investigation at Washington, U.S.A., reported to the attorney general that FBI investigations prove that no connection exists between Jehovah’s witnesses and the Nazis. World-renowned Scotland Yard, London, has taken no action against Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Permit me to submit some indisputable facts which show who are the real “fifth columnists”, the real traitors, the real anti-British, pro-Nazi hypocrites. I have at hand a report which may be of interest to yourself and others who are so anxious to pin the “disloyalty” tag on innocent people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On July 3, 1940, eighty-three aliens arrived at a local prison from New Guinea, among them seventeen German priests. Soon after their arrival, the Archbishop of Sydney, Dr. Gilroy, made personal representation on behalf of these seventeen priests, and had the time of closing of their celldoors advanced from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. each day. Six and a half days after their arrival at the prison, the seventeen Boman Catholic priests were removed to a convent near Sydney.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Contrast this, if you please, with the treatment meted out to two of Jehovah’s witnesses. These men, refugees from Hitler’s devilish regime of terror and tyranny, arrived m Sydney long before the war began, and led peaceable, quiet lives. When the department of the Interior authorized the admittance of these men to this country, they knew that they were Jehovah’s witnesses. These men, for whom to return to Germany would be sheer suicide, are now interned, and branded Nazis by a lickspittle newspaper whose one aim is to dish out “Catholic Action” propaganda and drag in the dirt everything that is decent and honourable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hitler announced that on May 12, 1940, he would release his secret weapon. On that date, you will be interested to learn, there was a wholesale evacuation of the Roman Catholic nuns from Sydney. Just prior to that they were issued with civilian clothes and commanded to grow their hair like other women. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Further, there are Roman Catholic churches and institutions where guns and ammunition are stored away in piano cases. Sir Thomas Henley made a statement in the Legislative Assembly to this effect some years ago, but no attempt at investigation was made. Are you really looking for the “fifth column”, Mr. Mair? If you are, do not be deceived by the age-old trick of thief crying “Thief!” in order to distract attention from himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bishop of Chelmsford, according to an AAP cable from London dated October 9, 1940, had this to say: ‘ ‘ The Papacy now, as in the last war—indeed as for 100 years past—is antiBritish and anti-democratic. . . . Any peace proposals from Rome would be fatally suspect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As confirmation, now read what the London </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald </span><span class="font4">published in an editorial, July 12, 1940: “It is not impossible, as the well-informed Diplomatic Correspondent of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Observer </span><span class="font4">suggested last Sunday, that something in the nature of a Latin-Catholic bloc, comprising France, Spain and Italy, may shape itself on the continent. This bloc would endeavour to act on the Catholic populations of Germany and Austria in the hope of at least diminishing the influence of the anti-Christian elements in the Reich so that ultimately an anti-Bolshevik Clnistian-authoritarian bloc may be formed in Western Europe in opposition to the hberal-seeularist-protestant-front tendencies of Great Britain, America, Russia and even Prussia. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Surely that is plain language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So hereafter when anybody howls ‘ ‘ Fifth Columnists ” “ subversive propaganda”, with reference to Jehovah’s witnesses, let them look behind the smoke screen to find the real culprit. Every traitor known to history has been an oath-taking, flagwaving hypocrite!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You are aware, of course, that because of pressure brought to bear on the newspapers, they will not publish anything in favour of Jehovah’s witnesses. Fortunately for the people of good-will, however, the Lord has made ample provision whereby they may receive not only knowledge pertaining to the devilish system that is trying to rob them of their freedom, but also knowledge of the Theocratic Government of Jehovah God. Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin and the Pope are the leaders of the fight against The Theocracy. Do not put yourself in their category by also fighting against God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As Premier of this State, and having taken the oath of allegiance to His Majesty, the King, one of whose titles is &quot;Defender of the Faith”, you owe it to the people to make full investigation of this important matter. The charges of disloyalty are made against Jehovah’s witnesses because of their faith in and loyalty to the Bible, which His Majesty has sworn to uphold. Keep m mind, also, that this is a Protestant country, and has been a haven of refuge for those who have had to flee for refuge, including many Roman Catholics Surely, while Roman Catholics are given hospitality, the least that can be expected of them is civility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And now take notice that the day has arrived when Christ, the Theocratic Governor, has taken his power, and rules amidst his enemies. (Psalm 2) Opposition to his faithful servants on the earth has reached the highest degree of violence. God’s command is that the people of good-will, the &quot;other sheep” (John 10: 16), must now be informed, to the end that they may flee before the expression of his wrath upon the world. When the work of announcing Jehovah’s kingdom is completed and the ‘ ‘ other sheep ’ ’ are gathered under the protecting hand of the Lord, He will loose his vengeance upon all the forces of Satan, including the political-religious totalitarian combine that now swaggers through the earth, and they shall die. Only those who now take their stand firmly for Jehovah and His Kingdom under Chnst, and who sincerely and diligently serve that Kingdom, shall live. Every human creature on the earth must choose for himself which side he will take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In conclusion, let me emphasize that Jehovah’s witnesses do not fear men, nor do they wish for favours from them. They are the servants of Almighty God and his approval alone do they seek. This letter is not an appeal to be freed from persecution, but a plain statement of fact that those who read it may know where they stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Respectfully submitted,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watchtower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, (Signed) Philip D. Rees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">21st October, 1940. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secretary</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Hierarchy continued its wooing, however, and on Thursday, January 16, Prime Minister Menzies prematurely announced in Parhament that he proposed to ban Jehovah’s witnesses. This was his last job before leaving for London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On Friday, January 17,1941, an order-in-eouncil was gazetted, an extract from which is here quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Whereas by regulation 3 of the National Security (Subversive Associations) Regulations it is provided that any body corporate or umneorporate, the existence of which the Governor-General, by order published in the Gazette, declares to be in his opinion, prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth or the efficient prosecution of the war, is thereby declared to be unlawful:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Now therefore I, Alexander Gore Arkwright, Baron Gowrie, The Governor-General aforesaid, acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council do, by this order declare that, in my opinion, the existence of the following bodies, namely:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Organization or organizations known as Jehovah’s witnesses or the Witnesses of Jehovah; the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society; The International Bible Students Association; The Adelaide Company of Jehovah’s witnesses; and Consolation Publishing Co.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">is prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth and the efficient prosecution of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Signed) W. M. Hughes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">for the Minister of State for Defence Co-ordination.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the Commonwealth of Australia outlawed Christianity in the same way that Hitler did in 1933. Can there be any wonder that the good people of this land have lost confidence in their leaders?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The National Security (Subversive Associations) Regulations, above referred to, provide that if a body is declared unlawful it is dissolved and its property forfeited to the Crown. Members are not allowed to meet for study and worship, nor to print, circulate or have in their possession any books or other matter pertaining to the organization, nor to give or receive funds for same. In other words, freedom is no more and regimentation takes its once sacred place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Armed with these powers, the Commonwealth authorities seized the office, factory and storeroom at Strathfield on Saturday, January 18. All departments were locked, with the exception of the residence, where, by the Lord’s grace, the Bethel family are still living Armed guards are on duty night and day to see that none of the property which belonged to the Society, and now claimed as forfeit to the Crown, is moved away. These guards are called ‘ ‘ Commonwealth Peace Officers ’ ’ and they are armed with such peaceful weapons as an automatic pistol and baton All bags taken in or out of the premises are searched, and visitors must state their business before they are allowed into the grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Adelaide and Perth the locally owned Kingdom Halls were also seized and are now locked and guarded. Thus the taxpayers ’ money is used to prohibit Bible studies and the worship of Almighty God as guaranteed by section 116 of the Australian Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Throughout the Commonwealth hundreds of private homes were raided for Kingdom literature, phonographs, records and even Bibles. But, in spite of these “bushranger” tactics, an abundant supply was preserved and is being used to succor the needy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses are commanded to obey all the laws of man that do not conflict with God’s laws. Concerning this Jesus said, “Render therefore unto Cassar the things which be Caesar’s, and unto God, the things which be God’s.” The Scriptures further state, “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve,” and ‘forsake not the assembling of yourselves together’. Consequently Jehovah’s witnesses continue to meet together to worship the Almighty God in spirit and in truth. They still go from door to door and place to place with the Kingdom message searching out the “other sheep” and taking to them the “water of life” which they so much need. Jehovah’s faithful ones also continue to give freely of their time, energy and substance in the interests of The Theocracy as the Lord has commanded they must do. If this means suffering at the hands of the enemy, it is counted an incomparable privilege, the like of which Jesus and the apostles endured for the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this respect the Scriptures record that the Pharisees, referring to Jesus, said, “We found this fellow [Jesus] perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Csesar, saying that he himself is Christ a king.” (Luke 23: 2) Is it any wonder, then, that His faithful servants should now be likewise falsely accused by the God-dishonoring hypocrites?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Legal Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hollowing the Scriptural injunction to take advantage of every opportunity to advertise the Kingdom, legal proceedings were promptly instituted against the Commonwealth in the High Court of Australia. The Commonwealth Constitution is similar to that of the United States, and contains an important clause (116) which forbids the making of “any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth”. It becomes apparent, therefore, that the action of the Commonwealth in declaring unlawful a Christian organization (or religion, within the meaning of the act) is ultra vires of the Constitution and must be invalid. The lawyers whose services are retained by the Society to fight this case are confident that “if there is any justice left we must win”. In any event we know that the Lord’s will shall be done, and with complete trust m Him we press forward to ultimate victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To get some indication of the line of defense which would be adopted by the Commonwealth in this action, application was first made to the Court for a motion of interim injunction. We were quite prepared for the negative decision of the court, but achieved our aim by getting certain information. The main reason assigned by Mr. Justice Starke for his refusal to grant an injunction was that he was ready to go ahead with the trial in the ordinary way without further delay. At the next sittings of the High Court in Sydney, which will be in November, it is hoped that a test case, in which the Adelaide Company is suing for trespass, will come before the bench.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Notifying Officialdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On January 17, soon after learning of the Government’s intention to outlaw Christianity, the Society’s Australasian representative sent the following letter to Lord Gowne, governorgeneral of Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Your Excellency,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“News has just reached me per medium of the press to the effect that the Menzies Government has declared Jehovah’s witnesses an illegal organization. In a country which has ever been a bulwark of liberty this is surely most disquieting and as attorney for the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Brooklyn, New York, I wish to enter a vigorous protest against such arbitrary action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“At the present time and for some weeks past several shipments of Bible helps have been held in bond by the Customs Department. These were printed in America and shipped here after the necessary licenses had been approved at this end for their importation. The action of the Government in banning these must of necessity be considered an insult to the United States, especially since it cannot possibly be proved that they are subversive in any sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I also have the privilege to be the attorney here for the International Bible Students Association, a London corporation closely allied with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. In Britain, Jehovah’s witnesses are, as you are no doubt aware, permitted to go about their business of preaching the gospel of God’s Kingdom without hindrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In a report to the British Government in 1939, Sir Neville Henderson referred to the suffering of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany under the tyrannical hand of Hitler. This information was published in White Paper Germany (Number 2) 1939, ‘ ‘ Treatment of German Nationals in Germany. ’ ’ Already these facts have been brought to the attention of the Federal Government. Does it not seem strange that Jehovah’s witnesses in this country should be declared illegal and at the same time 6,000 of their brethren in Germany, and many others in countries now occupied by Germany, should suffer untold tortures in concentration camps because they will not break their solemn covenant with Almighty God J</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;In my humble judgment it would have been much better if the Federal Government had waited till Mr. Menzies had visited Britain and ascertained the existing position as far as Jehovah’s witnesses are concerned there. We are now faced with a nation divided against itself. In England the Government continues to regard the preaching of the gospel of God’s Kingdom as of paramount importance. In this country responsible persons apparently take the view of Hitler, who was the first to ban Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;His Majesty, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">g George -VI, recently called upon his people to put their hand in the hand of God. Your Excellency and other leaders from time to time have used similar expressions, thus showing faith in the Almighty and absolute dependence upon Him for aid. Hence a witness to His supreme power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Jehovah’s witnesses are neither a sect nor a cult, although the newspapers who are unfortunately controlled in the majority of cases by a foreign power have so referred to them. There is no desire on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses to curry favor from any earthly potentate. It is a joy and privilege to continue to bear testimony to Christ’s Kingdom now being set up, which is the world’s only hope. My purpose in sending this letter is that the responsible persons will choose, with knowledge, whether they are for or against God and His Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Respectfully,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(Signed) A. MacGillivray”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This letter was duly acknowledged, and during the succeeding months several further communications were exchanged. Having received no satisfaction, however, the following telegram was sent to the governor-general on May 6:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Britain in declaring war on Germany gave as one of her reasons the ill-treatment of German nationals, making particular reference to the cruel action of Hitler against Christians known as Jehovah’s witnesses. Since then Britain has continued to show favor to the Lord’s people and the work of Jehovah’s witnesses of comforting the people by means of Bible and Bible helps which has been carried on without hindrance. In contradistinction to this the Commonwealth Government, by order in council, on the seventeenth day of January outlawed Christianity, brought untold persecution and suffering upon Jehovah’s witnesses, and spends one thousand pounds per week to prevent freedom of worship and the carrying on of Christian work by thousands of loyal citizens throughout the land. At this time many are in great distress and in need of comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Commonwealth Government stands responsible before Almighty God for violating the Constitution and opposing The Theocracy.—MacGilhvray. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus warned, the king’s representative in Australia must accept the responsibility of signing an order which was intended to hinder the work of announcing God’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bibles</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to the seizure of the stocks of books, records and phonographs, the Commonwealth seized and locked up thousands of copies of the authorized version of the Bible which were purchased by the Society from the Oxford and Cambridge University Press, London. These Bibles the Commonwealth refuses to release.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society’s representative advised the authorities that London was ready to ship further stocks, but that he required absolute assurance that the shipment would be delivered on arrival. This, according to their reply of May 9, they were not prepared to guarantee. Consequently, on May 12 the following telegram was sent to the attorney-general at Canberra:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Your telegram ninth instant delivered my office while absent. I shall be no party to anything that insults the Almighty God, His servants Jehovah’s witnesses, His Majesty the King of Britain, which, in the words of Churchill, stands now for freedom. Action of Federal Government in declaring Christianity illegal m Commonwealth wholly contrary to British tradition. Any persons who think they can dissolve the Theocratic Government of Jehovah God are either demonized or crazy. Bibles referred to m my telegram will be distributed by loyal British subjects. Be advised that a wave of indignation has spread over nation and that we still have in this country thousands loyal Britishers who will stand by Britain in this hour of need notwithstanding fact that leaders have betrayed her. Please give me assurance in writing that Bibles will be immediately handed me on arrival I have already been humbugged by customs and other officials who are evidently more concerned about serving their foreign controllers at Vatican City than they are about performing duty according to their oath of allegiance to His Majesty the King.—MacGillivray.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The attorney-general, in replying, merely referred back to his evasive telegram of May 9, above mentioned. On May 28 a further telegram was sent as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Replying your telegram ninth May. First portion is quite clear, but latter portion puts restrictions on distribution of Bibles. I am not aware that His Majesty King George, Defender of the Faith, has at any time given his ministers authority to prevent people from receiving copies of the Bible or confined the distribution of same to any particular sect. All Christians are Jehovah’s witnesses (Isaiah forty-three ten); and since Christians are the only ones using the Bible, your edict would mean total prohibition of distribution of the Bible in the Commonwealth. Already the Commonwealth is responsible for locking up millions of Bibles and books containing Bible sermons in rat-infested buildings Mission boats worth thousands of pounds unlawfully taken from their moorings in Sydney have been in the water unattended for four and half months and may now be considered a total loss. My representations to Canberra have been of no avail. Is it any wonder that the good people of this land are beginning to ask whether or not the Government is anti-Christ?—MacGillivray.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having no explanation for hindering the importation of the Bible, the Department let the matter rest there. Stocks have been procured locally, so that those who wish to get a Bible and study it may do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Watchtower”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Knowing full well the value of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> to the servants of God the enemy has tried desperately to prevent them reaching us. Each issue ib seized as it reaches these shores, and if any do happen to get through they are confiscated by the Postal departments later. The hand of the Lord is not shortened, however, by the actions of any creature. The much-needed information contained m these magazines continues to reach the publishers and interested ones in all corners of this vast territory just as before. The faithful are truly thankful for this abundant provision from Jehovah, who is indeed &quot;the giver of every good and perfect gift”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren throughout Australasia celebrated the Memorial in harmony with their brethren elsewhere. Six hundred of the Sydney brethren met for the first time since the ban in the grounds at Bethel, Strathfield, and there participated in the celebration in accordance with the Scriptures. The guards who were on duty stood by and were much impressed with the sincerity and devotion of those assembled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When application was first made for permission to hold the meeting in the grounds the authorities were non-committal and spun a web of red tape around the matter in true departmental style. We pursued the matter, however, and they capitulated rather than be forced into the position of being responsible for the prevention of such a meeting. Thus The Theocracy gained a further victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio Stations</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah has provided four radio stations for advertising The Theocracy in Australia, and in the years gone by they have been a great advantage in the promulgation of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom message. Some of the regular features have been Brother Rutherford’s lectures, readings from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> the daily texts, and Biblical dramas in children’s sessions. The fact that some of Jehovah’s witnesses own these stations has been well known, and, of course, the Hierarchy, has done its utmost to cause trouble. They have done their best to boycott the stations and bring them into bad odor with the people, but, because of the excellent service which the advertisers and the public have been given, these attacks have been of no avail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On January 8, 1941, the Naval Department ordered the stations to close down; and since that date they have not been operating. There has been some mumbling about giving information to the enemy, but no direct charge has been made, nor would it be true if it were made. The matter was taken up at once with the Navy Department, and they agreed to let the stations go back on the air, under certain conditions. These were agreed upon and the Minister for Navy announced on January 16 that the stations would be going back on the air. On hearing that, the prime </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">mini</span><span class="font4">ster said that he could not allow that, because he proposed to ban Jehovah’s witnesses. On the following day the order-in-couneil was made out as referred to above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To say that the radio stations were instrumental in giving information to the enemy, is as false as the Devil himself. Throughout the radio world the Commonwealth’s arbitrary action is looked upon with utter disgust, because it is so obviously the work of the real fifth column, Catholic Action. The radio stations have been included with Jehovah’s witnesses, etc., in the action against the Commonwealth and the postmaster general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Attempted Assassination</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On Sunday evening, July 6, the Branch servant, Brother MacGillivray, his wife and daughter, and his secretary and another member of the Bethel family were returning home by car at about nine o’clock. The guard who should have been on duty at the front gate was not there, and, as was often the case, the car was driven inside the gate so that the passengers could alight more conveniently. As the car stopped two of the guards came running up the driveway, past Brother MacGillivray, who had by this time alighted. He told them that he was only returning home with his wife and family and that everything was in order. Seeing, however, that they were in a very excited state and obviously annoyed about the car’s being inside the gate, he ordered the driver to take it outside; whereupon one of the guards struck at him with his weighted baton. After warding off the blows, he again told the driver to take the car out. The guard then drew his gun and fired two shots, one of which went through Brother MacGillivray’s right arm, traveling about six inches through the flesh. One of the boys in the car then went after the maniac and stopped him from doing further damage. The guard fired point-blank at him, but in the scuffle the gun had jammed and now failed to operate. Because of this action in defending themselves and the women folks, the Society’s attorney and his secretary have now been charged with assaulting a Commonwealth peace officer in the course of his duty, and are at present remanded for trial on bail of £80 each. Brother MacGillivray has issued a counter summons against the guard for inflicting grievous bodily harm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is quite apparent that the demons are using their dupes in a desperate endeavor to destroy the servants of the great Theocrat, but because of His protection they cannot succeed. This shooting episode received wide publicity in the press, and has resulted in a good witness Hundreds of people throughout Sydney are both amazed and disgusted at the Commonwealth’s allowing such irresponsible persons to have and use firearms against defenseless people returning home to their normal place of abode.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Printing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In September, 1940, the Society’s factory produced 250,000 copies of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Judge Rutherford Uncovers Fifth Column. </span><span class="font4">Coming at a time when the Hierarchy press were doing their utmost to pin the “Fifth Column” tag on us, this booklet proved to be a most timely and effective weapon When the Commonwealth seized the storeroom in January all copies had been distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Australian edition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> made good progress during the year, reaching an average of 25,000 copies per issue by the beginning of 1941. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> was of inestimable value to the work in Australia because it afforded an opportunity to ventilate the racket of the Hierarchy’s local representatives, which is naturally of greater interest and importance to the Australian public than news of its activities abroad. The fearless articles that appeared m its columns caused both the Hierarchy and the Protestant dominies much pain and were the means of enlightening many who were beginning to doubt the bona tides of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Calendar for 1941 was printed in Australia from a copy supplied by Brooklyn. The Devil’s crowd thought to keep the Yearbook and the Calendar from us this year, but, by the Lord’s grace, they were frustrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service in Australia</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the five and a half months before the interference with our work by the authorities, that is, from August 1, 1940, to January 17, 1941, the report for Australia showed a remarkable increase over the corresponding period of the previous year. Booklets increased by 70 percent, publishers by 20 percent, magazines by 40 percent, and back-calls by 20 percent. It is certain that if we had been allowed to continue the year’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">report would have far exceeded anything that we had done previously. The five and a half months’ report for Australia,</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In considering these pre-ban figures the fact that our shipments were held up months before the ban is important. All shipments sent from Brooklyn from the beginning of September onward were held by the Customs authorities pending investigations and were finally seized as forfeit to the Crown when the Society was declared unlawful in January, 1941. We received only one shipment of 30,000 of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font4"> since it was first printed, and these were all taken at the Sydney convention in July, 1940. This acute shortage of stock no doubt accounts for the decrease in the number of bound books placed for the year. Additionally we have had no supplies whatever of Conspiracy </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Against Democracy, Satisfied, The Messenger,</span><span class="font4"> or of the recordings “Religion” and “The End”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the ban the little army of Jehovah’s witnesses have concentrated on witnessing with the Bible. All stocks of the Bible held by the Society were confiscated and locked up, but we have been able to get further supplies locally. The publishers have found the Bible work an excellent means of reaching the people, talking to them about the Kingdom and_ arranging to call back on those who manifest interest Ways and means are found to get the books and records to those who are genuinely interested. The result has been that back-calls have now reached the former high figures, and the indications are that they will definitely increase month by month in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year’s report for Australia, including 6i months since the ban, is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Books, 37,032; booklets, 559,511; total literature, 596,543. Average publishers, 2,390; hours, 427,373; subscriptions, 592; magazines, 185,003; sound attendance, 169,907; back-calls, 42,403.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Zealand</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Most High over all the earth.” In these words the psalmist sets out clearly and unmistakably the purpose of the “strange work” now in progress and rapidly nearing its glorious culmination. During the year that has passed this one objective, to magnify the name of Jehovah, has been the driving force behind the servants of The Theocracy in New Zealand. Their bold stand has resulted in a great deal of press publicity. Many persons who formerly treated the Kingdom lightly have now taken a firm stand for it and are themselves diligently passing on the good news to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Without a doubt the hand of the Hierarchy can be traced in every move made against the Lord’s people in this land. In 1939 the Catholic </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tablet,</span><span class="font4"> being truly seized with the importance of preserving the Catholic Action, Fifth Column racket from the “pestiferous locusts’’, advocated that all “good citizens” should write to their respective members of Parhament and demand that our work be stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On October 13, 1940, the Hierarchy adopted more violent action, and, until Armageddon, will get away with it. A small body of Jehovah’s witnesses met on that date in a hall at Oamaru, and there, with a number of persons of good-will, listened attentively to a recorded lecture by Judge Rutherford. Shortly after the lecture had commenced, one, Meehan, a Hierarchy dupe, approached the hall carrying an army rifle with fixed bayonet. Without any warning or the slightest provocation he shot one of the brethren who came through the door to find out what was happening, and jabbed the bayonet into the arm of another. Brother MacAuley, whose right leg was amputated at the thigh, as a result of the shooting, lingered for weeks in hospital, but, by the grace of the Lord, he recovered and is now active again in the Kingdom service. Today he is a living testimony to the courage and determination of Jehovah’s witnesses in their fight against the ruthless, cowardly, demon-controlled representatives of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To the everlasting dishonor of law and order in New Zealand, Meehan, who was indicted on seven counts, including attempted murder, was convicted on only one count, that of common assault! He received a prison sentence of two months; and at the same time several of Jehovah’s witnesses were in jail for three months each, merely for preaching the gospel. What a strange anomaly! It is indeed consoling to reflect on the words of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> “Jehovah will balance the books at Armageddon. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A week after the shooting incident, to wit, on October 21, 1940, a notice appeared in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government Gazette</span><span class="font4"> naming Jehovah’s witnesses as a subversive organization, for the purposes of the Public Safety Emergency Regulations. These Regulations do not allow any person to “participate in the activities of a subversive organization”. “An organization” was defined to include, besides any society or body, “any two or more persons . . . who associate . . . with the object of considering.” This clearly meant that if two persons who were Jehovah’s witnesses spoke to each other concerning The Theocracy under Christ Jesus, such an act would constitute a</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“subversive act” within the meaning of the regulations, and such a person would be liable to three months’ imprisonment. The Regulations left no opportunity for redress in a court of law; and as New Zealand has no constitution, we had no chance to prove we were not subversive. This conviction without trial was in direct violation of Clause 30 of the Magna Charta, which is the basis of British justice. Jehovah’s witnesses in New Zealand weie outlawed and condemned unheard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The police conducted an organized raid on the homes of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the north and south islands, and on October 26, 1940, seized, amongst other things, 25 copies of the common version of the Bible at a Christchurch home. A cable setting out this deplorable state of affairs was immediately dispatched to His Majesty King George VI at London, and a copy sent to the governor of New Zealand. Within a few days of the cable’s being dispatched the prime minister gave instructions for the Bibles to be returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After making several applications, the Society’s New Zealand representative was able to meet the prime minister, the attorney-general and a representative of the commissioner of police on November 27, 1940. A Memorandum which demanded noninterference with the Lord’s work in New Zealand and the same liberty for Jehovah’s witnesses as is enjoyed by our brethren in Britain was placed before them After our case the ministers both apologized for the way in which we had been treated, saying, “We did not intend the ban to be so sweeping,” and “Governments, like men, are not infallible. We did .not intend that the police should act so stupidly”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Finally it was decided to allow the Society to import Bibles in its own name and to have our import license renewed. Also, the attorney-general was instructed to draw up an amendment to the Regulations which would give us the right to meet for worship of Almighty God with song, prayer and Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The flag-salute issue reached a climax in New Zealand when on January 28, 1941, Miss Grace Kennedy, one of Jehovah’s witnesses and a teacher at the Waikino Public School was dismissed by the Auckland Education Board for failing to salute the flag after being ordered so to do by the headmaster. An appeal was duly lodged on behalf of Miss Kennedy by the Teachers Institute, and on June 7 a decision was given in her favor. The New Zealand </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font4"> of June 9, 1941, reported the following from the reserved judgment of the Stipendiary Magistrate, Mr. Freeman:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In giving his judgment, Mr. Freeman said the board dismissed the appellant for her persistent refusal to salute the flag when ordered to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Mr. Freeman said that, while it could not be disputed that persistent refusal to obey a lawful order might amount to gross misbehavior, he did not think it necessarily did so. 'Gross’ meant ‘flagrant, glaring, or monstrous’. To refuse to salute the flag, if actuated by motives of disloyalty and accompanied by expressions or gestures expressive of disloyalty or contempt, would undoubtedly amount to gross misbehavior. In the present case, however, the evidence showed that the appellant was courteous but firm in her refusal. She affirmed her loyalty and offered to stand at respectful attention, which was m itself an attitude showing respect and loyalty. It was evident that she possessed deep religious convictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘ ‘ Mr. Freeman said that, considering all the circumstances, it would be straining the language of the Statute to hold that her acts amounted to gross misbehavior. The fact of the words ‘gross misbehavior’ being coupled with ‘immoral conduct’ and drastic powers given to the board indicated that something of a glaring, flagrant or monstrous character was intended before action should be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In Mr. Freeman’s opinion, the appeal should be allowed. Each side was ordered to pay its own costs.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This decision was a real victory for The Theocracy in New Zealand, and, being widely published in the press, resulted in a mighty witness to the name of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It should be recorded here that in the Roman Catholic schools of both New Zealand and Australia, neither the teachers nor the children are required to salute the flag. This of itself reveals the inconsistency of the “super-patriots”, who are so anxious to bring Jehovah’s witnesses into disrepute. Their eyes are shut to the activities of the fifth column, Boman Catholic Action, and they themselves thus become guilty of subversive activities which are inimical to the welfare of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In April, 1941, it appeared imperative in the interests of the work for the Branch servant to go to New Zealand and attend to several legal and other matters there. A glorious convention was held in Wellington and the brethren returned to their homes resolved to press on to victory with the utmost vigor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An amendment to the order declaring the Society illegal was gazetted on 8th May, 1941. Permission was given therein to hold meetings, but only members or former members are supposed to attend. The Society’s funds, originally frozen, are now able to be used in respect of such meetings. These are well attended and are becoming widely known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the Lord’s grace, many concessions have been made although not gazetted. Shipments of Bibles ordered from London and Brooklyn in the name of “Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society” have been safely received. Meetings are held, to which many new ones come. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies are conducted as before. The number of back-calls continues to increase, with the result that thousands of people are being given an opportunity to learn of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom m their own homes. In fact, we have almost forgotten that a “ban” exists, except that no literature is apparently available for public distribution.</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font4">A fact which must be taken into consideration when reviewing these figures is that since mid-Oetober 1940 there has been no literature available for pubhe distribution. The publishers now use the Bible for their door-to-door work and arrange to get the necessary helps to those who are interested, as opportunity is afforded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Burma</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the last four years a tremendous amount of work has been done amongst the peoples of Burma. Practically every home has had the opportunity of receiving the life-giving waters of truth, and there has been a gratifying response from the people of good-will throughout the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As in other lands, the “old lady” of Vatican City has been busy, and on May 26, 1941, the Strathfield office received a cable from Burma stating that all publications had been banned and stocks seized by the local authorities. Thus another dominion ignored the attitude of Britain toward Jehovah’s witnesses and adopted Hitler’s idea. The Burmese Government will find, as Hitler has done to his sorrow, that Jehovah’s witnesses will never cease to preach the Gospel but will continue so doing even until their last breath. While there are still people of good-will amongst the Burmese the banner of The Theocracy will fly in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Towards the end of the year it was possible for three pioneers from Burma to get through to Chungking, China. They traveled the famous Burma Road, spreading the good news of the Kingdom as they went, and are now busy amongst the population of the capital of Free China. It will be difficult to keep up a continuous supply of literature, especially now that Burma has capitulated, but we are confident that some way will open up for this to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The figures available from Burma cover the first eight months’ work. They are as follows: Books, 1,599; booklets, 32,068; average number of pioneers, 8; company publishers, 32, subscriptions, 75; back-calls, 436; sound attendance, 10,406. In comparing this eight-month report with the similar period last year it is noticeable that the total output of literature has increased from 26,133 to 33,667; hours, from 7,225 to 9,880; and magazines, from 1,657 to 4,198.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is difficult to estimate what work will be done in Burma during the new year, for the reason that the brethren who went there from Australia are now threatened with deportation. However, a thorough witness has been given throughout the land during the past three years and there are many Jonadabs there to continue with the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Malaya</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Under the heading &quot;Malaya” are included the Straits Settlements and the Federated and the Unfederated Malay States. The Society maintains an office at Singapore, from which point the work is conducted throughout the Peninsula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past year three pioneers covered the whole of the territory and were able to leave the Kingdom message in thousands of homes. By the Lord’s grace a thorough witness has been given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">First indication of trouble in Malaya came towards the end of 1940, when a prolonged campaign in the newspapers, particularly the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Straits Tvmes,</span><span class="font4"> aroused public opinion against us. Needless to say, the Hierarchy-controlled press refused to publish anything of our side of the case, nor would any printer undertake to print a leaflet containing the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the 17th January, 1941, an order was published in the Straits Settlements </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government Gazette</span><span class="font4"> whereby it was prohibited to import, sell, publish, distribute or reproduce 16 publications named, issued by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. Even possession of the literature was made punishable with up to two years’ imprisonment and heavy fines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Coincident with the order made in the Straits Settlements, the Federated Malay States Government made an order of similar import embracing the sixteen pubheations listed and also all other books, etc., issued by the Society or written by Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On April 28, 1941, a further order was published in the Straits Settlements </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font4"> listing all other pubheations of the Society and banning them. The Special Branch (Secret Pohee) seized all stock at the depot in Singapore and had it all pulped for war purposes. All shipments that had arrived in the interim and were lying on the wharves pending permission to land them were likewise seized and pulped. Strong protests were made to the Colonial Secretary, but without avail. Under the ban order, the Government had given itself the right to seize the hterature and dispose of it in whatever manner it saw fit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Phonographs, records, Bibles and the Society’s office equipment were not confiscated. The brethren in Malaya therefore continue to witness with the phonographs and Bibles, and they still meet twice a week for study. The Lord has continued to feed His people with the spiritual food from His table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In June, 1941, three Australian pioneers working in Malaya were deported by the Colonial Office at Singapore. The only reason assigned was that these brethren were executives of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. A petition was made to the Governor to have the order rescinded, but without success. The Society’s Branch servant subsequently took up the matter direct with the king, and on August 1 sent the following cable to His Majesty at London:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Responsible British officials in Malaya, evidently acting under foreign influence, have unlawfully deported missionaries Mr. and Mrs. Wieke and Mr. Linke and, without assigning any reason, have destroyed thousands books property Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Brooklyn, New York, which Society they represent. Case is most serious, requiring immediate investigation, especially in view friendly relationship between ■United States and Britain. I shall be pleased to receive advice of action taken and arrangements made for said missionaries to return Malaya to continue work of preaching gospel God’s Kingdom early as possible.—MacGillivray, Attorney Watchtower Society.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The report for eight months, August to March, 1941, inclusive, is as follows: Books, 4,231; booklets, 28,402; total literature, 32,683 (eight months last year, 27,983). Publishers decreased to 14 from 23 last year; hours, from 7,717. to 4,717. Other totals are: Subscriptions, 20; magazines, 1,270; sound attendance, 672; and back-calls, 181.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Netherlands East Indies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Celebes, Bali and the other Dutch possessions which go to make up the Netherlands Indies have long been steeped in the ignorance of rebgious superstition. Idol-worshiping and other heathen practices have been skillfully combined with the traditions of the Roman and Protestant churches to form a religion which is palatable to the natives, but an abomination in the sight of God. Thus the words of Jesus to the religionists may well be applied, “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. ’ ’—Matt. 23: 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people of these countries, however, have not been left without the opportunity to learn of God’s Kingdom. Jehovah’s faithful servants have taken the Kingdom message to all parts of this vast field, and now there are companies operating in five of the large towns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The enemy thought to disrupt the witness work in Batavia, and have imposed heavy legal restrictions. The publishers, however, continue to give the testimony, and will continue as long as an avenue remains open. The year’s placement of literature is a record, as is the total of production in the pnntery. All publications of the Society are now refused circulation, but the Kingdom servants are still able to go from house to house with the Bible and to conduct model studies in the homes. A pioneer placed 50 Bibles in one day, 40 of these being left at a school where the teacher was approached on behalf of the children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Throughout the year, difficulties were encountered over the importation of literature. The authorities in one instance were approached several times over a shipment of Chinese books and booklets, but no decision was reached until a good-will official was contacted. He informed us that the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> was refused entry due to a pre-war edict to the effect that the book contained anti-Nazi propaganda. Holland was now at war with Germany, but apparently the same excuse still held good! The official arranged that the literature should enter the country. Two weeks later he was assigned other duties, with the result that restrictions were re-imposed and further consignments had to be sent on to Burma. At one stage, police authorities permitted the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> to come in, provided the papal hat was deleted from the picture of the &quot;old lady’’ and the ‘ ‘ beast ’ ’, and a complete blackout administered to the painting of the Pa pa l -Co</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font4"> erci a 1 -Pol i ti cal combine!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society’s headquarters for the Far East is situated in the main street of Batavia, several doors from the GovernorGeneral’s palace, and for some time has carried a huge sign, &quot;Watchtower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.” This appeared to annoy the priest-frequented Cathohc bookshop opposite. In course of time, the Procureur-General’s office advised that the sign must be removed, but would supply no reason. The sign was not removed. On the following evening, four Malay police and two plam-clothes men came to forcibly remove the board, but so great was the force used that the sign fell with a crash on the head of the officer-in-charge. Verily he had his reward</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In March, the Dutch editions of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> were banned, and it was decided to sell the printery. One week after the completion of the sale the Malay journals were banned, and the Assistant Resident arrived, complete with uniform, sword, white gloves, plumed hat, and three policemen, to seal the printery for the duration of the war. His pomp suffered an eclipse when he found there was nothing doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During July, a record placement of 10,000 pieces of literature was made. On July 28 all the Society’s publications were banned from circulation. The American consul supplied complete details to his own government, including a 40-page letter compiled by the Dutch Government and a 10-page statement by the Society’s representative. The situation is having the attention of the United States Government and copies have been sent to Her Majesty, Queen Wilhemina of Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society’s printing plant at Batavia was able to turn out some good work before it was finally disposed of, as mentioned above. Figures show that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> were printed both in Malay and Dutch to the aggregate of 14,555. Additionally, 2,000 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied</span><span class="font4"> and 10,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees </span><span class="font4">were printed in Hollandish </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> was published in Malay in the form of several booklets The number of complete books printed was 2,100.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While still on the press the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font4"> was banned, and 8,000 partly finished booklets confiscated. Fortunately, however, 2,000 copies were taken away beforehand, and these were distributed amongst the people before action could be taken to prevent it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Netherlands authorities labeled Jehovah’s witnesses antiNazi and anti-American, but they hesitated to cry “anti-Roman Catholic” for fear that the Papal fifth column might be revealed as instigator of the entire unholy affair. They may cry “Peace and safety”, but a grand work is now being done with the Bible itself, and the old “whore” will live to learn that the tropics can become unbearably hot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The twelve months’ figures for the Netherlands Indies are as follows: Books, 6,042; booklets, 41,503; total literature, 47,545; average number of publishers, 35; hours, 17,565; subscriptions, 249; magazines, 8,724; sound attendance, 624; and back-calls, 732. The corresponding totals for last year were: Literature, 41,729; publishers, 35; hours, 16,630; magazines, 18,150; back-calls, 910.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Thailand</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Four pioneers have been active in Thailand during the year, and their work has been richly blessed of Jehovah. The number of persons manifesting an interest in the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom continues to grow as the work goes on unrestricted. A company has been organized at Bangkok.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A definite step forward was made when arrangements were finalized to print </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in Thai for the benefit of the brethren of that nationality, many of whom are now taking a firm stand for The Theocracy. Booklets are also being printed in the vernacular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The major difficulty in Thailand at the present time is the lack of books. A shipment of 166 cartons on its way to Bangkok in July was confiscated at Singapore, although it had nothing to do with the authorities there. Cables protesting against this deplorable state of affairs were sent both to the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr. Churchill, and to the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Shenton Thomas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A report from the brother who is looking after the Society’s interests in Thailand contains the following interesting experience of the local brethren. A group of Thai brethren were concluding their </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study, when two American missionaries came to retrieve their wayward congregation. As they began to lay down the law, one of the most newly interested jumped up and said, ‘ ‘ We’ve had our study, now let us do some witnessing.” They marched out leaving the dominies breathing “fire and brimstone” after them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The eight months’ report (August-March) for Thailand is as follows: Books, 2,366; booklets, 13,777; total literature, 16,143; pioneers, 4; company publishers (average), 5; hours, 4,824; subscriptions, 51; magazines, 817; sound attendance, 348; and back-calls, 114. In the corresponding period last year 6,928 books and booklets and 354 magazines were placed by 3 publishers in 1,533 hours; and back-calls numbered only 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">French Indo-Chlna</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The invasion of French Indo-China by Japan has cut off communication between the pioneers there and the Strathfield office. The last reports from Saigon indicate that they are pushing on with the work although encountering many difficulties. The brief report available shows that 129 books and booklets were placed m 17 field hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Hong Kong</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An Australian pioneer spent four months of the fiscal year working m Hong Kong According to his report for that period, 462 books and 642 booklets were placed and a total of 429 hours were spent in the field. Back-calls to the number of 57 were made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneer was finally ordered to leave the colony, but before so doing he was able to get two publishers started in the work and they are carrying on the best they can under the existing difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">FIJI</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren in Fiji continue to pass on the Kingdom message to those who will hear. Their greatest difficulty is the shortage of books, as there have been no shipments allowed in the Colony since 1936. The Lord, however, sees that provision is made for those who love him, and his arm is not shortened by the subversive activities of the enemy. The officials of Fiji have been repeatedly warned that their course of action against The Theocracy would bring dire results. Their continued opposition is an indication that they have ignored the warning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The field service report for Fiji for the first three months of the year shows that six publishers placed a total of 371 books and booklets in 74 hours. 760 persons heard the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom message from the sound-car. Meetings are still being held in Suva, and are well attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Combined Field Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the years gone by it has been possible to estimate the effectiveness of the witness given by the quantity of literature placed with the people. Last year, 1939-40, a total of 1,364,129 books and booklets and 496,601 magazines were distributed in Australasia, and indeed it was a bumper year for The Theocracy in these lands. The work done in 1940-41, however, is different. It is impossible to measure the vast advertising work done in the old manner. It can safely be said that, although the results are less as far as actual placements are concerned, the witness given has far exceeded that of any previous year. Every newspaper and every radio station have many times earned the words “Jehovah”, “Jehovah’s witnesses,” “Watchtower ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ Theocracy ’ ’ to all corners of this far-flung territory. Most times these news reports have been false and calculated to do harm, but the honest-hearted are not easily deceived and such stories merely cause them to seek more keenly for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The 1940-41 figures for Australasia are as follows: Books, 62,525; booklets, 734,838; magazines, 213,565; average publishers, 2,261; hours, 576,184; sound attendance, 195,746; and back-calls, 51,146.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We, in Australasia, are confident that now we have adjusted our service organization to suit the prevailing conditions, the Kingdom work will rapidly increase and the number of publishers, hours and back-calls will show a meteoric rise in 1941-42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord has arranged that, although the enemy has come in and taken our books, equipment and property at Strathfield and other places, the Bethel family is still intact and, at the time of writing, living at 7 Beresford Road, Strathfield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the strenuous days of the year that has passed each member has faithfully and fearlessly pursued his task and remembered his covenant obligations before Jehovah. Some have been privileged to endure terms of imprisonment, but without a murmur they have shouldered their responsibilities and faced the enemy with a determination to remain steadfast and preach the gospel at every opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The family has been busy both in the field service and also, at week-ends, on the near-by Kingdom farms. Their joyful attention to duty is of great help to the brethren with whom they come in contact.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In this vast republic of South America a greater witness than at any time heretofore has been given during the service year just closed. The brethren in Brazil have encountered much opposition, as foretold for servants of Jehovah in all nations, but because of the firmness on the part of the faithful and their persistent efforts in behalf of the interests of The Theocracy the witness work continues. There are now associating with the Lord’s organization many new ones, including devoted children. The report of the Branch servant shows a constant, onward movement of the Theocratic organization, and is set out herewith :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publication of the Kingdom message increased under the most thrilling and the most difficult circumstances that we have yet had to face. There is not the slightest room to doubt that it is Jehovah’s “strange work” and not that of any man. To Him we give all credit and glory. We realize, however, with grateful hearts, that He has used his earthly organization, the stronger part of it, to support the weak, and we are thankful to acknowledge the great assistance, both financial and in abundant provision of new literature in the Portuguese language, received from the headquarters in Brooklyn, especially for the personal, keen interest of our president m all our problems, as busy as you are with ever-increasing activities and problems world-wide; also we have been supported and strengthened by wise counsel and instructions as to the proper procedure in these perilous times, in letters, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> and these we have endeavored to pass on to those of the organization here as quickly as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Supplying the “Meat”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the Lord’s help, in addition to the monthly publication of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A Atalaia, Consolacao,</span><span class="font4"> and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informants,</span><span class="font4"> we were able to translate and send on promptly to Brooklyn the following booklets in Portuguese: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy, Satisfied, Judge Rutherford Uncovers Fifth Column, Theocracy,</span><span class="font4"> as well as to complete the translation of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah.</span><span class="font4"> We received in return the greatest abundance of new liteiature. In addition to the booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees, Angels, Conspiracy Against Democracy, Satisfied,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Judge Rutherford Uncovers Fifth Column,</span><span class="font4"> we were overjoyed to receive, during the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">Campaign, the books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font4"> as well as the new disc, 154-204, which is the best of all we have yet had in Portuguese. Then, on August 8, in time for our &quot;Children’s Day” activity, came the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy.</span><span class="font4"> What more could our hearts wish!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Activltes</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord has been pleased to give increase to the publication of the Kingdom. The output from the Branch office for 1940-41 far exceeded that of the 12 months preceding, as the following shows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Total number of company organizations in country 19 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Beports from the field show that there was a decided increase in placements of books, booklets, and individual magazines, as well as in number of hours, back-calls, and subscriptions. While the peak of publishers did not reach the high level of last year, the average of pioneers reporting monthly increased from 31.3 in 1940 to 50 in 1941, while the average of company publishers increased from 108 m 1940 to 109 m 1941, making a total average increase in publishers for the year 1941 over 1940 of 20. With this small increase in publishers, the increase in other respects is all the more marked, showing the Lord’s blessing upon the faithful efforts of those who rely fully on Him and have the courage resulting therefrom to continue to bear the Kingdom fruits, come what may.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The two conventions, one in Bio de Janeiro at the time of the Memorial, April 10-13, and the other in Sao Paulo, May 9-11, were greatly blessed of the Lord. In Bio, it seemed almost to the last day that we should not be able to secure the desired hall, or any, for that matter, because of the refusal of the police to grant the proper “alvara”, without which no owner of a building is willing to risk the renting of his premises. We were able to secure only a verbal promise of non-interference, and the convention proceeded, the most orderly gathering of the Lord’s people it has ever been my privilege to attend. Jehovah opened the windows of heaven and poured out refreshment on his little ones, despised for his name’s sake. With the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font4"> we had a fresh supply to offer the people, too. At the Memorial 92 were present, 24 of whom partook of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Sao Paulo, the company had been hounded by the police, so that in September they had given up their Kingdom Hall and had been meeting in private homes. It seemed, however, that a public witness was still to be given in that city; so a beautiful, appropriate hall was secured, as well as the necessary alvara from the police, and there assembled more than 100 of Jehovah’s people for encouragement and to receive at the Lord’s gracious hand the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font4"> in Portuguese. Our joy knew no bounds. There were 24 persons baptized at the two conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Branch Office Moved to Rio de Janeiro</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The big undertaking of the year was that of moving the Branch office from Sao Paulo to Bio de Janeiro. Nearly two years ago you suggested to the Branch servant that it might be well to transfer the office to Bio de Janeiro. Immediately the Lord’s leading in the matter was sought. The house obtained is well-built, and presents a pleasing appearance now that it is m order, and the place is suitable for our work, by no means luxurious, but comfortable and spotlessly clean, as should be the place of Jehovah’s service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to interrupt the work as little as possible during the transfer of location, a good supply of literature was entrusted to the Sao Paulo company which we have been drawing on for our pioneers in the State of Sao Paulo ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Hindrances</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service, so full of joys and abundant blessings, has had to weather storms of persecution and difficulties from without and from within. The authorities have continued to refuse to register the Society, on one pretext or another, with no just reason, and we have continued our legal fight to gain this recognition and are still fighting while we continue with the publication of the message of The Theocracy the best we can without this human recognition, knowing full well that it is Jehovah’s work and has His recognition and approval. In our efforts, the Lord has supplied us the help of some noble-minded men, especially a kind-hearted lawyer in Sao Paulo who, while not professing to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses, has offered to help us and has helped us materially without expecting to gam anything from the organization, recognizing the righteous work in which Jehovah’s people are engaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After sputtering and threatening for more than a year, the police seized 20,000 of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font4"> booklets on December 28, and on December 31 our press suspended operations, on order of the Department of Hygiene, until it could be placed in a position which the Department considered suitable. We had finished our printing through February, getting ready for our move, and this gave us an opportunity to have the press overhauled before installing it in its new location, at the tune of our moving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the State of Bio Grande do Sul the severe persecution of last year has continued through this year. The two pioneers who had been forcibly though illegally expelled from Brazil by the police of Porto Alegre are still kept across the border, as far as their persecutors are aware. For some months four pioneers witnessing in Pelotas and other cities in the southern part of the State were hounded by the police and finally, on January 7, 1941, all of them, three women and one man, were arrested, and their literature seized, and they were threatened with deportation. Also in a number of cities scattered throughout the State, the publishers have been arrested, their literature seized, and their correspondence with the Society intercepted, and told that the police in the whole State have received instructions to seize all pubheations of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society and stop its work. The zone servant presented a written complaint and protest from the Society to the chief of police of the State at Porto Alegre. As always happens when the Devil brings a lot of persecution against the Lord’s people, it has aroused those of good-will. As a result of the persecution, the brethren concentrated their efforts on back-calls and holding model studies. One pioneer reports that during the month of February, while the persecution was severe, at a meeting where 200 people of good-will were present 16 Jonadabs symbolized their consecration by water immersion. At another place 13 were immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“Children’s Day&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s people are one, and they are not separated by geographical bounds nor by the efforts of their great enemy to scatter and weaken them; so that, when Jehovah calls his people into action, that activity is not limited. August 10 was “Children’s Day” in Jehovah’s visible organization. The day was marked by the actual assembling, at St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.A, of the greatest number of consecrated children ever gathered together on the face of the earth; it was marked in Brazil by activity in the field of the largest number of children that ever witnessed for the King. And while that number is very small, comparatively speaking, the loving zeal of these little ones has made a mighty witness for The Theocracy, and has stirred up some of the older ones to realize that they can make better use of their Kingdom privileges while there is yet time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While Judge Rutherford spoke to 115,000 people in The Arena in St. Louis, with 15,000 children before him in specially reserved seats, ranging in age from 5 to 18, the children of the King in at least four cities in Brazil, to the number of 49, went out in the service, presenting the Kingdom message to the people, with a new weapon of our warfare, the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy,</span><span class="font4"> which they presented for the first time on that day. This, no doubt, marks the beginning of a new activity on the part of the children who now take their part in the service in obedience to the commandments of Jehovah, and who, if faithful, will survive Armageddon and, in due time, have part in fulfilling the divine mandate to “multiply and fill the earth”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The brethren in British Guiana have continued to receive the meat in due season throughout the year, even though strict censorship has banned the importation of the literature. More publishers are in the field, and more literature has been distributed despite restrictions. The hand of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is very manifest, and the report by the servant looking after the work in that country reveals this fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are pleased to report an all-round increase in service, in spite of several handicaps, chief among them being the ban imposed by the local Government in January on some of the Society’s publications. Not only was there considerable delay on the part of Government in issuing a definite ruling, but we have been unable to import fresh stocks until all the items required have been scrutinized by the censors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After representations had been made to the local authorities, we prepared a Memorial to the Secretary of State for the Colonies which has been transmitted to him at our request, and there the matter rests at the moment. In the meanwhile we are grateful to the Lord for the opportunity to carry on the witness with some, if not all, of the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are amazed that the work has not suffered more seriously from this cause, but the publishers have worked harder, and have actually placed 3,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font4"> in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Unfortunately, our magazines have also been banned, and this phase of the work has suffered most.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two conventions were held during the year—one in Georgetown, and the other at Grove, East Bank Demerara—the latter coinciding with the St. Louis convention. The brethren were much enthused by these meetings, and the opportunity for group witnessing on a large scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two publishers from Grove, East Bank Demerara, have recently returned from a visit to the mining districts of the interior, traveling many weary and difficult miles to take the message once again to outposts, and calling on folk who had not visited the city, and had seldom been in contact with civilization, for years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We should also mention pioneer service rendered in the county of Berbice by two publishers from Georgetown. A parish priest suggested to his “flock” that they stone one of these messengers of the Lord as he quietly went about his duties. And it was the same reverend (?) gentleman who, within a few days of the detention of our first shipment of challenged literature, informed his hearers (in a distant country district) that all our literature would be burned by Government that week. It was quite evident that “the wish was father to the thought’’, but one wonders how he obtained any information regarding the seizure, which was at that stage (and still is, for that matter) considered “Confidential” by Government!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To all our brethren persecuted m various parts of the earth we extend greeting, exhorting them to be of good cheer, realizing that their sufferings are “for righteousness’ sake”, and that Jehovah will never leave nor forsake those who love Him supremely.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It is not convenient to obtain an official report from the Canadian brethren, but, from letters and verbal reports received, our brethren in that land are obeying the Lord<sup>?</sup>s commandments, regardless of persecution. The news from this part of the field shows faithful soldiers of the Lord Jesus fighting hard against the organized drive of the Catholic Hierarchy operating from Quebec, under the direction of that foreign power at Vatican City, Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">General information and experiences that have come to hand during the past year are here set out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Minister of Justice (Catholic dictator), acting for the Hierarchy, and under the pretense of caring for the safety of the state and the efficient prosecution of the war, displayed “patriotism” by persecuting the faithful servants of Almighty God. Under the guise of “war measures”, he caused to be outlawed Jehovah’s witnesses, and made it an offense to— “advocate or defend the acts, principles, or policies of Jehovah’s witnesses; attend meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses; distribute literature of Jehovah’s witnesses, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, or the IB S.A.; distribute or have in his possession in quantity literature . . . containing any material . . . intended or likely to cause disaffection to His Majesty, or to interfere with the success of His Majesty’s forces.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This, interpreted, means to have in possession literature containing any material likely to open the eyes of honest people to the hypocrisy and abominations of the Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So far as law can make it, every possible avenue through which a faithful servant of Jehovah could publicly testify to the Kingdom of </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Alm</span><span class="font4">ighty God has been blocked. The Hierarchy concluded Jehovah’s witnesses in Canada were caught m a dragnet, and would now cease their activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reports received during the past year reveal this is not the case. The brethren had been taught of Jehovah, and had found their strength in Him. Faithful brethren continued to advise and counsel the Lord’s children in that land. Jehovah, through the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">mini</span><span class="font4">stration of His Holy City, comforted the witnesses and exhorted them to keep covenant with Him, remembering that faithfulness brings life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to information sent in, there have been 5,000 brethren regularly in the field service, approximately 30,000 bound books distributed, and the number of booklets distributed is enormous—somewhere near the figure of 2,500,000. Comparing this with last year’s figure, it has more than doubled the output.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah permitted the Devil to set against these faithful servants the Government of Canada with its Catholic dictator; the politicians who give their assent to what is being done; the press which has been instructed not to publish anything favorable concerning Jehovah’s witnesses; the Roman Catholic Members of Parliament who, in many districts, have acted as a Canadian gestapo; the provincial and local police who have been compelled to raid homes and arrest the brethren; the cardinal, and all the pnests of the Hierarchy; and the law, with the judges, crown attorneys, etc. Yet, in spite of all this opposition, they have gone forth valiantly, enduring hardness as good soldiers. They keep ever before their minds the honoring of His name, the proclamation of the Kingdom, and comforting those who mourn. They have sought to 'forsake not the assembling of themselves together’, and to 'keep themselves in the unity of the spirit and the bonds of peace’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To render service during this past year has meant the brethren have scorned the dangers, threats of imprisonment and the separation from families, and sought joyfully to accomplish Jehovah’s will, rejoicmg in the privilege not only to believe but to Buffer for Hie name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our adversaries say Jehovah’s witnesses follow a human leader. This is not true. Our only leader is Christ Jesus. He was appointed by Jehovah. 'I have given Him for a Leader and a Commander for the people. ’ (Isaiah 55: 4) It is counted a great honor to fight shoulder to shoulder with their beloved brother and counselor, Judge Rutherford, upon whom they look as an elder brother, fighting a good warfare and working out his own salvation with fear and trembling. Following his example, they are daily encouraged to press on in the same warfare until Jehovah’s “strange act” takes place. Surely so much work being done by these witnesses under such adverse conditions testifies to the fact that there is no human leadership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophecy of Joel revealed to the Lord’s people in 1939 is fulfilled: “A strong people set in battle array; . . . they . . . climb the wall like men of war; . . . they . . . march every one on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks . . . they . . . run to and fro in the city; they . . . climb up upon the houses; they . . . enter in at the windows like a thief.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Order-m-council, with its weapon “war measures” (Defence of Canada Regulations), prevents the Lord’s work in Canada from operating from a central building. This, however, does not prevent faithful servants obeying God and preaching the good news of The Theocracy. There are yet thousands to take their stand on the Lord’s side, and the proclamation must continue to be made. Word comes to us that large numbers of God’s people have come forward during the past year, and probably more than m any previous year have symbolized their consecration by water immersion. All brethren have been fed by the hand of the Lord as He promised: ‘ ‘ Thou prepares! a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.” Throughout the year not one meal served by the Lord for all His saints has been missed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The action of the Government against the Lord’s people in Canada m July, 1940, was very sudden. The swiftness of the blow stunned many servants for a short while. They quickly steadied themselves, and realized this Order-in-eouncil, intended by the Hierarchy to be a death blow to them, would not accomplish the purpose intended. Knowing that such could not happen unless the Lord permitted it, they looked to Him and sought His mercy and direction. Hollowing July, 1940, some of the faithful continued to preach the Kingdom publicly from house to house. Others were eagerly looking for some way in which they could demonstrate their love to the Lord by activity in service. Jehovah answered their prayers. Prom reports received as well as the newspaper clippings sent in, these brethren rose very early one morning in November (1940) and flooded the country from end to end with Jehovah’s message, showing that shortly The Theocracy would assert itself and destroy all opposition, and that would put to an end all totalitarian power. Like Jehovah’s faithful servants in times past, they got busy “when the dew was on the ground”, and when the people of the land awakened they found on their doorsteps the message from the Lord. One can see the enemies of the witnesses being terrified, and saying, “The hand of Jehovah’s witnesses hath done this.’’ Whereas many persons of good-will would lift their voices in gratitude to the Lord, accepting the message as manna from heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More than 7,000 witnesses participated. Less than 10 were arrested, and no one was charged with distributing subversive literature. Yet the message was similar to that delivered in this country for many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A letter received recently described how the brethren throughout the country are digging into the back-call work as never before. This form of service can be engaged in by the majority, and therefore it is anticipated there will be increased activity during the coming year. It is simple to go to a home and speak of God’s Kingdom, and assist the “sheep” in every possible way. We must help them in the same way as we were helped. Every servant of the Lord can assist another to be faithfid in this way, and so progress along the way which leads to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One letter reports that hundreds of faithful servants of the Lord go from house to house preaching Jehovah’s name and The Theocracy. They do not carry literature or phonographs with them, yet they are obedient to the Lord’s commandments. Shortly many thousands will be preaching the gospel by word of mouth, fulfilling the Scripture: “For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” (Bomans 10: 10) All the consecrated will realize that though this Order-in-council operates against an organization, it does not prevent a faithful follower of Christ Jesus from being obedient to the commandments of the Almighty. Jehovah’s work must be done, whether a nation will hear it or not. “And they [the children of Israel], whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.”—Ezekiel 2: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those reading this report will be interested to learn some of the experiences through which the brethren have passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When first launched, the Order-in-council was severely enforced. Magistrates and other officers of the law concluded Jehovah’s witnesses must have done something seriously wrong. Convictions were made everywhere. Many sentences of 12 months were meted out. These heavy sentences were strenuously fought, and, up to date, in no case has a sentence longer than 6 months stood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Boman Catholic member of Parliament, so long a romantic figure in Canadian history, has been used in a great way by the Hierarchy, to kill freedom of speech and worship in Canada. The Knights of Columbus m high places use the Order-m-council to work private vengeance on Jehovah’s witnesses. Many brethren had been forced out of employment. Threats of internment have been made. Gatherings of Jehovah’s witnesses in their homes are reported regularly to police by neighbors. In some localities the interference by the Roman Catholic members of Parhament or local police has become so regular that when a knock comes to the door it raises the query, “Is it the police?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The only reason given by the Canadian Government through its prime minister to date as to the reason for bringing forth this Order-in-eouneil is that “they follow God’s law according to their interpretation in preference to man’s law”. Like Daniel, there is found no cause against these faithful servants, except in the law of their God. The publicity given to the trials and persecution testifies to their faith, and supphes information to the “other sheep” as to their course of action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A great witness has been given in and through the courts by our brethren. Pot instance, a witness leaves a booklet at a door, and is arrested, tried and imprisoned. Fifty or more people listen to his defense in court. Fifty or more talk with him when in prison, and thousands read about it in the newspapers. In this way Jehovah’s name and the acts of His witnesses are carried to many, although ‘preached through contention’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One elderly sister, too UI to attend her trial when first called, was eventually tried and found guilty. The magistrate, hypocritically pretending to extend mercy, said: “ I find you guilty. I am going to suspend sentence on the understanding that you attend no more meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses, and distribute no more subversive literature.” Her reply was published in the newspapers across Canada: “I will not deny Jehovah, nor will I agree not to do His will. So you may as well impose the sentence.” She received a month in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In another city, goaded by the spreading of literature honoring Jehovah’s name and exposing wicked systems of religion doomed for destruction, the Catholic authorities organized two groups of 54 and 60 pohce to raid the homes of every known Jehovah’s witness there. Some literature was found in three homes. Brought to trial, the Lord’s power was manifested greatly on behalf of His people. Sufficient evidence could be found against none to make a conviction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All our brethren are now endeavoring to fight their own eases in the magistrates’ courts. With assistance they can present a better witness, and several of these brethren have been able to enter into their defense words to this effect:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I have no apologies to offer for these books. They teach the way to eternal life. I sincerely believe them to explain the purpose of Almighty God to establish a Kingdom of righteousness in the earth. To me, they have been the greatest blessing of my life. In my opinion it would be a sm against the Almighty to destroy these books, and the message of God they contain, in the same way as it would be a Bin to burn the Bible itself. Every person must choose whether he will risk the disapproval of men or the disapproval of the Almighty God. For myself I have taken my stand on the side of the Lord and His Kingdom, and I seek to honor the name of the Most High, which is Jehovah, and if I am to be penalized for that, then there is responsibility before God to be taken by those who impose the penalty. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In one case where a sister did make this declaration in court, the magistrate, impressed by her firm stand for the Lord, acquitted her Over one hundred people in court heard this witness, the local newspapers headlined the event, and the radio carried some of her word over that part of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One young brother was charged recently under the Regulations, because the police found m his home 3 cartons of literature and some instructions. He decided to fight his own case and was assisted with the preparation. The court listened the whole morning and part of the afternoon to his argument. Much scripture and law were quoted, and his defense concluded with the statement quoted above. The work of the Lord was upheld with dignity, and the Crown was challenged to produce before the court one statement from the literature which would be likely to cause disaffection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The magistrate took more than two weeks to give judgment, and now, on the 10th of October, it is learned that, after a lengthy opinion, he acquitted the brother, stating that in his opinion there was no statement in the pubheation containing disaffection against His Majesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In another case, a Crown attorney caused a father and mother who were witnesses to be locked up in jail for eleven days without bail, and their three children—one a very sickly child under twelve months of age—were put away in an institution. There was no case against the parents, and yet the magistrate wickedly sentenced them to seven months in jail for disaffection. The case was appealed, the term never served, and the magistrate was later fired from his office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A certain man was hired by the pohee to enter the company of witnesses at Edmonton, Alberta, to gam information as to their activity. This traitor (officially called a “voluntary witness”) went on the witness stand and gave strong evidence against some of the witnesses. Even the judge must have been disgusted with his conduct; for he said, “Why were you baptized, etc ?” He answered he had been paid by the pohee to do so. The press was careful not to report the fact that the Roman Cathohc M. P. had hired him to get information. As the result of his evidence many brethren were sent to prison. Following the trial, one newspaper, reporting on the case, also carried this information: “A brown paper parcel, containing a rope, was found Wednesday morning in the door of the court room, with the words, ‘ For Judas Iscariot. ’ This traitor’s name will be pubhshed all over the Province, that all may know of his diabolical work and be warned.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Opposition is manifested against the children of the brethren. Some small-town mayors and local councils, desiring to demonstrate their ‘ ‘ patriotic fervor ’ display their so-called ‘ ‘ patriotism” by persecuting little children. Their opportunity came when these children desired to worship and serve the Lord according to the dictates of their own consciences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our brethren state that the Canadian Government displays a lack of understanding of the persistent activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. They know these witnesses are not criminals, and do not seek the bodily injury of any. They are not subversive, nor are they ‘fifth columnists’, but that pressure from the religious element is too strong for officials to take steps to alter the matter. The view of many local authorities is, ‘We know_ you people are not subversive, or seeking to do any wrong, but the Government has declared you illegal and therefore you must stop your work. If you do not, then you are rebelling against the Government, and for that reason you must be punished. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The witnesses of Jehovah, in continuing their service toward the Almighty, are not rebels. They are obeying the commandments of the Almighty, who is the Higher Power, even though it brings the disapproval of an earthly government. These witnesses contend it is the Government of Canada that is rebellious, because of the Order-m-couneil produced to stop the work of Jehovah God from being completed. Finally it is not the witnesses who will suffer, but rather Catholic dictatorship, political authorities, or local bodies, by reason of their opposition to the work of the Lord God and His children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is estimated that more than 2,500 brethren from that land were present at the greatest assembly of Christian persons ever to meet on earth at any one time. Everyone gives evidence of the joy and strength received. AH hearts overflowed with gratitude as they realized how Jehovah had ‘led them by still waters’, providing a situation which was a holy place where the saints of the Lord could meet together in peace and in gladness, while He refreshed their spirits. It brought to mind the word of David: ‘‘Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!” (Psalm 133) It was a precious privilege to behold the joy of the Lord in every face, and to freely express oneself concerning Jehovah and His Kingdom. Then their greatest joy was to be present and see and hear their beloved president, Brother Rutherford, speaking words full of grace and truth. By his ministry the Lord’s children were strengthened and enabled to realize more clearly the work of the Lord in this day, to have a clearer perception of their duties and responsibility, to maintain their integrity, and to keep their eyes ever on The Theocracy. All were thankful for the discourse dealing with ‘‘Integrity”, showing how the experiences through which Job passed are fulfilled in the Lord’s people today, and that the issue is world domination. They also learned to their great joy that every effort must now he put into this grand work of comforting those that mourn. As they all saw thousands upon thousands of children expressing their love for the Lord, and showing their determination to take their place in the procession, playing the instruments provided, their hearts overflowed with gratitude to the Lord and His servant, Brother Rutherford, who arranged these rich provisions. Words failed usl Jehovah had opened the windows of heaven and poured upon us such blessings we could not contain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So long as there is breath m our bodies we will do all possible to exalt His name and labor in the interests of The Theocracy; &quot;Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>CENTRAL EUROPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The totalitarian monstrosity has brought into subjection to its violent rule practically every country of Europe. The Central European office, with its main headquarters in Switzerland, has to the best of its ability directed the work in all countries of Central Europe. Communications are practically impossible. However, reports trickle in from the war-ravaged countries of France, Poland, Germany, and the other nations to the effect that the faithful witnesses of Jehovah stand firm, maintaining their integrity and continuing to proclaim the message of His Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In those lands of great oppression Jehovah’s witnesses are the targets of the demonized totalitarian rulers, and the controlling element of the countries have come to the conclusion that the witnesses of the Lord are one group that they cannot whip into line; they will not betray their God and violate His principles of truth and righteousness, nor will they bow to Hitler or his totalitarian idol. Because of their firm, unwavering devotion to Jehovah and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus wicked persecution, intense pain, much physical suffering, and dreary isolation have been brought upon the servants of the Most High God; but the faithful and true witnesses of The Higher Powers cannot be broken by the whip of the religious, inquisitional methods of the Papal Hierarchy now carried out through the gestapo. Knowing from God’s Word that the Devil’s human agents might kill the body but not destroy the eternal existence, these faithful servants of Jehovah, who are upright, honest and harmless in their devotion to His kingdom, stand immovable and continue to comfort all that mourn in those distressed lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reports set out by the Branch servant in the Central European office concerning many of the countries are brief, but the information is sufficient to afford evidence that the testimony of the Kingdom is given in all the world, including territory of “the king of the north”, for a witness by Jehovah’s covenantkeeping servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The situation of the European countries overrun by the monster, and m which in former years an organized publishing work could be done in connection with the Central European office in Berne, has not changed since last year. No complete reports, if any, have been received from a single one of these countries. However, individual letters, which have reached us from time to time, show that Jehovah’s witnesses have raised their voices in spite of even increased persecution. This fact clearly shows that the Lord’s cause on earth is well established and that Jehovah’s name is blessed “from this time forth and for evermore”.—Ps. 113: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year’s figures for Central Europe are therefore incomplete ; i.e., reliable data are at our disposal for but one country, Switzerland. Erom the companies in Yugoslavia we have reports for 11 months; and for the pioneers in that country, for only 6 months. The report from Hungary may be viewed as complete, while data from Belgium and France are very defective. For this reason a comparison with last year’s results is useless. We may, however, submit a few remarks as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While during the former fiscal year (1939-40) reports were received from an average of 2,611 publishers, this number is now only 1,385, that is, 1,226, or 47 percent, less (about half). The number of hours is relatively normal, it being 48 percent less than last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the number of booklets placed there is a reduction of 33 percent, and total literature distributed shows a decrease of 38 percent as against the former fiscal year. Sound attendance was 36 percent less. On the other hand, 12 percent more periodicals were placed, 1,144 more subscriptions obtained, and about 36 percent more back-calls made, than during the former year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These comparisons are especially interesting when we consider that last year we had complete reports from six countries, while this year, as already mentioned, only those from Switzerland, Yugoslavia and Hungary are available.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In view of the extraordinary conditions nothing can be said about company organization, etc., within the province of the Central European work. However, a report just received from Germany, for instance, confirms that which we always surmised, viz., that in the countries terrorized by the monster the spiritual as well as organic connection among the faithful of the Lord still exists and could not be destroyed even by the most cunning schemes of the hordes of the adversary.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">We have not been able thus far to resume the connection with the Branch servant of this country. Some letters were received with the information that the friends enjoy the protection of the Lord and continue the witness work, and that they do not lack spiritual food.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>BULGARIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">We have no connection whatever with the few brethren in this country. Besides, this part of the Balkans is placed under the full dictatorial control of Germany.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A wave of violent terror is just now passing over this country, especially in the occupied territory, in that week by week dozens of alleged Communists are shot. Much suffering generally has come over this country since it has been vanquished by the monster. We are not especially informed as to the extent to which our brethren in France may have been affected by these unhappy conditions. We know, however, one thing, viz., that many brethren received prison sentences from one to two years because of their constant attitude. But the spirit of truth is also working in these men, and the conviction that witnessing for Jehovah and his name must be done even under adverse conditions ‘quickens their mortal bodies’. Thus we are informed that the witness work goes steadily on, both in the occupied and in the unoccupied territory. We have succeeded in resuming connection with the brethren in Pans, and the news received unanimously attests the fact that the eagerness to work is unbroken. A letter we received from a brother in the free Zone states that “the whole family which had been dispersed since the outbreak of the war has now been gathered together again”. The following are a few excerpts from letters which have reached us during the past months from various parts of France:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I have even found the Alsatian relatives, most of whom have found refuge in the same town. The whole family had at first been scattered all over the unoccupied territory. Now at every place where there are members of the family there is someone who cares for the necessary things for health and nourishment. It is a great joy for us to see that for two months now we have been in association with nearly all as in former times. All are well and all work according to the same conditions and instructions; i.e., they are making back-calls. As you know, I have very much to do. ‘Jael’ is separating herself from ‘Sisera’. We very clearly recognize the character of these two persons. They are at variance with one another, especially since the beginning of this year. It is our duty to show ‘Jael’ the way to go so that she is able to protect herself against this evil one who becomes ever more enraged. The family is growing everywhere and opportunities for immersion must be provided.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I have now been in prison for 21 months because of my faith, and now I .would like to ask you if </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> could not be sent to me. I have yet three months to spend m prison and shall be glad for an immediate answer. ... I had only read </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font4"> and saw immediately my duty towards God. I took my stand for him and Christ, and so the Devil succeeded in bringing me into prison; but I am even happy for that, for here I find time to study God’s Word, and I have many opportunities of giving the witness. This poor Devil is always the disappointed one! ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I would like to write you a few lines at the same time as my friend L., hoping that they may reach you. I have now spent 22 months in prison, and I am overjoyed that I have maintained my faith and my integrity. Couldn’t you send me some spiritual food? . . . Before this war I was not a witness for God, but then I got the message which filled me with new hope, and I learned that it requires much courage to be a witness for Jehovah. May I now remain firm! Often I tremble at the thought that I might not be able to do that which is right for my God. May he make me capable and useful. I thank the Lord for the time I have spent in prison. Even though I have suffered a little, this time has wrought such good that was not known to me before.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;My sentence is now concluded. I am glad, and yet I almost regret one thing, viz., that where I am now I have not so much opportunity of sowing as where I was before—in prison. That seems really paradoxical. When I review everything I must humbly acknowledge that I had privilege upon privilege, joy upon joy; the Lord gave to me and I passed it on, and so I feel today the peace of the Lord in such a wonderful way. I am now waiting for the necessary papers to return to my home. Shall I get them? Then I will continue to give all glory to the Lord and to fight for The Theocracy.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(From Northern France) &quot;For some time now we have not received any sign of life from our dear uncle Joseph. And^you in Switzerland, have you any news from him? How may he be? It is so painful to be without news from those who are so precious to us. ” (These brethren wrote us that until recently they heard regularly the message over WBBR. Now their radio set seems to have been taken away from them!)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(From Paris, beginning of June) &quot;... Otherwise we are all in good health and work is not lacking. Here all goes the same quiet way as before the exodus. During the course of the past year we have been able to plant over 100 new little trees in our Father’s garden. They are all thriving well, and we shall very much appreciate the fruit they will bear, especially in this time.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(From Strasbourg) &quot;In the various vineyards over 100 new vines have been planted. So the work for life is ever going on, and we can look into the future with good courage.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(From Paris) &quot;As we love sports, we always have good appetites. Kindly suggest to uncle Joseph that he send us a big fat cheese. In our own way we have manufactured what we call ‘ ‘ Port Salvation ’ ’. It tasted very fine. All of the family here are cheerful and wide-awake. During the last 18 months we have been 70 times in the swimming-baths.&quot; (Immersion)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The above are only a few of the many letters received from our friends in France. They contain sufficient evidence to show that in this country as well there is a faithful remnant devoted to the Lord.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This land, now called &quot;Greater Germany&quot; and which includes the former Catholic Austria, is the political and military stronghold of the religious-totalitarian &quot;abomination of desolation&quot;, which assumes to take the place of and to rule the world in the stead of The Theocracy and which therefore forbids the proclamation of the gospel of that kingdom. No detailed reports are to hand concerning the actual spread of the Lord’s provided food as set forth in the publications of the Society, but that the circulation of the forbidden message still goes on is certain, though at the risk of liberty and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Faithful servants of Jehovah in. Germany have now for years held fast to their integrity and to their unbending devotion to The Theocracy in the face of the setting up of dictatorship and the signing of the Concordat between Germany’s Catholic dictator and the religious head of all Roman Catholics at Vatican City, in 1933. Such steadfast ones have been an outstanding example of faithfulness that has been spoken of and published throughout the world, even as the Christians in the days of the apostles. (1 These. 1- 6-8) This has been possible only by the sustaining grace of Jehovah, who has filled his covenant people with an unbreakable love for him and his King Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The demonized ruling element, besides taking away the freedom to practice true Christian worship, has attempted to starve the faithful witnesses of Jehovah spiritually by depriving them of the literature setting out the Lord’s instruction and the fulfillment of Bible prophecies and by depriving them of the privilege to freely and without interference meet together for study and discussion of such “present truth”. But the Lord’s hand is not shortened, and even there in that land of intense darkness the Lord has answered the prayer of his suffering ones for “food convenient”. To quote from one such: “We express our joy and gratitude for all the precious things which Jehovah has given to his people through the columns of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> It is like a miracle that all this still reaches us; but in this dark country as well Jehovah holds the affairs of his people safely m his hand, and to know this makes us confident and happy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even if the totalitarian powers were to succeed in taking away the Bible itself as well as the books and publications setting forth the revealed Bible truths, Jehovah’s faithful ones have the truth and the knowledge of his purpose and his Theocracy in their hearts and minds, and which none of the demonized powers of this wicked world can take away. This lifesustaining knowledge they stored up in their hearts and minds, and this they did by taking advantage of all their opportunities to study God's message both privately and in company with their brethren and also by telling it out to others who have a hearing ear, thereby watering themselves with truth as well as others. Being now under great restraints and privations, such ones appreciate the benefit of that course of action far more deeply than many in lands yet favored with considerable freedom of speech, of assembly and of worship and who are careless or indifferent toward their privileges to study and meet together with those of “like precious faith”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For a number of years now our German brethren, by force of hard totalitarian oppression, have been made to know the meaning of the scripture: “Every man shall bear his own burden.” (Gal. 6:5) Their organized study and activities being broken up by the religious-dictatorial enemies, and their contact with headquarters being snapped off and prevented, they have been forced to be on their own and have had to look directly to the Lord and to rely on him and to be guided by the knowledge of his truth and promises and principles of righteousness which they had learned previously, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus being their teachers. They have not forgotten their covenant to do God’s will and to obey God rather than men. They know the commandments of the Lord and their covenant-obligations toward him, so that it is not necessary for them to consult with others on this earth, but the sure Word of God is their guide, and this they have followed and continue to follow, be it at the cost of great suffering. Therefore they go straight onward, doing what the Lord tells them to do, and each one meets his own personal responsibility toward the Lord and is grateful for the privilege of suffering for maintaining his blamelessness and innocence toward God by active obedience to his commandments. They trust not in their own strength, nor lean upon the arm of flesh of others. They have been taught of God what to do amid persecution, and they do it. His strength is made perfect in their weakness, and his grace is sufficient for them. (2 Cor. 12: 9) Thus they press on delivering the testimony as opportunity offers, whether inside of prison and concentration camp or outside thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Verily in their case there have been fulfilled in no small degree the words of the prophecy, to wit: “And they that understand among the people shall instruct many; yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days. . . . but many shall cleave to them with flatteries. And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end. ’ ’ (Dan. 11: 33-35) Tn Hitler Germany the faithful ones have been<sup>-</sup> greatly tried, not only because of the demon-obsessed “strong-arm squad’’ and the political and religious dupes and tools of the arbitrary dictator, but also because of the Judas class, which traitorous class broke covenant with the Lord and fell down on their integrity and thereafter try to drag down others with them into the course leading to everlasting destruction. Such unfaithful ones, including the “elective elder” class who are impressed with their own importance and selfwisdom and who desire to shine rather than suffer with Chnst, have tried to ‘cleave to the faithful ones with flatteries’, thereby to entrap them and to deliver them over to the demons and their human agents; and some have fallen to their wiles. By way of comparison: There are more than 6,000 devoted ones who to this very day linger behind prison walls and in concentration camps and who refuse to compromise under torture, yet these are in a condition far more blessed and far safer than that of those outside who are double-minded and in uncertainty because of fear of men and a failure to take the uncompromising course of absolute obedience to Jehovah. The faithful have the divine approval, and hence peace and joy even amidst their sufferings, hardships and restraints. They put up their guards against the fair-speeehed and beguiling flatteries, and resist such, and hold themselves in the narrow way of keeping covenant with their God, regardless of the consequences to which it may lead. No man on earth is their leader to bear the responsibility for them, and they refuse to heil the dictator or to follow ‘' elective elders'' or any other human creature. They follow ‘ ‘ the Higher Powers&quot;, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By God’s loving-kindness the substance of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">articles on &quot;His Organization&quot; has reached them, setting out the Lord's rule for his organized people as being neither religious-totalitarian nor democratic, but Theocratic. The brethren who tried to maintain contact with one another and to carry on active service have endeavored to work according to this divine rule. Of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> articles only a few of the originals manage to be passed around, but copies thereof are made and gotten to those desiring further instruction from the great Teachers, God and his Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Information reaching us is that in Nazi land </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">is read with greater joy, appreciation and understanding than in former times, and much benefit has been drawn from the articles. There </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> cannot be studied in the same way as it is yet possible in America. Here and there model studies may take place. Due to the way the Lord uses for distributing </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> it is not possible to give exact figures as to the number of readers. Occasionally there are meetings of faithful witnesses up to a dozen or more, but that is always dangerous and requires much circumspection by every one and such meetings must be held in an isolated or unobserved place. On such occasions various </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> articles are discussed as well as service matters. Such a gathering is always a joy and a blessing to those thus assembling in obedience to the Lord’s command. (Heb. 10: 25) One such writes: &quot;Many a general convention in peacetime may not have had the same blessed effect upon many as such an assembly in the deep forest or elsewhere.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Added to the cruel oppressions of totalitarian rule, and now that war has been renewed between &quot;the king of the north” and &quot;the king of the south&quot;, many cities of Germany have undergone bombardment from the attacking air fleets. Hence our brethren are experiencing like things as their brethren in London and elsewhere in the British Isles, which British brethren, when caught in public places while engaged in the Lord’s service, take all reasonable precautions and avail themselves of all means of self-protection and who sensibly heed the air-raid alarm, gather up their means of witnessing and calmly walk to the nearest air-raid shelter and there continue giving the witness among the people huddled together there for safety. To give the witness Jesus and his apostles went where the people were congregated and waiting to hear the Lord’s Word; and the brethren today likewise take advantage of the conditions produced by the air raids and go to the people who have fled from home and streets and congregated in such bomb-proof shelters. Such is ‘preaching the word, in season and out of season’; and this has been commented on appreciatively by many observing persons of good-will or of unbiased mind. According to the report, up to the summer of 1941 nobody in Germany belonging to Jehovah’s faithful people had as yet lost his life or been injured in air raids.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are yet some of the Lord’s “other sheep’’ in Germany, and these the Good Shepherd is gathering to himself in spite of the terrible conditions produced by the demon rule. To quote from the report: “Even m Germany it still often occurs that people of good-will express their full devotion to Jehovah by water immersion. Some of those who were immersed in recent years have sealed their faithfulness with their lifeblood. We may well say that in spite of the criticism, scorn and persecution Jehovah’s witnesses are the only class of people in Germany who enjoy real respect, although this is not openly admitted. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“A young man who is believed to be a Jonadab [one of the Lord’s ‘other sheep’] had been sentenced to death for refusal of war service. A few days later, the war court called upon the wife of the condemned one to visit her husband, and she was granted an opportunity of speaking with him for half an hour. She was to influence him and cause him to abandon his refusal. However, she did not do so, but both encouraged each other to keep faithful to Jehovah unto the end. At the close of the visit the judge appeared and inquired about the result, and when he saw the immovableness of the brother he said in the presence of the wife: ‘I shouldn’t have expected it otherwise.’ Shortly after, this witness was shot and, as was told later on by soldiers of the detachment of sharpshooters, the captains of two companies who were to command the fire refused to do so; only the third one carried out the order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In Germany in many firms, especially the big works and State enterprises as well as in offices of all kinds, workmen, employees and officials are required to do things which are diametrically opposed to God’s law. Anyone who refuses is dismissed and not seldom sent to a concentration camp. Such is naturally a further trial for the faithful. Some have yielded in these things and have said as their excuse that they could not act otherwise if they did not want to starve. However, the faithful do not permit themselves to be turned out of the right way even by such pressure. They set their confidence solely upon Jehovah, at the same time being constantly on the lookout for other jobs where they can work without compromise, and no one has perished thus far. For such, work is still to be had, even now, and that enough, only it may not be so pleasant. Today there are even jobs </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">en masse,</span><span class="font4"> since there is a great lack of workmen m agriculture, in the smaller trades and in households; yea, faithful witnesses of Jehovah are now frequently besieged with offers of work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“As to the ways and means by which Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany carry out their commission of giving the witness, we refer to the Annual Report in the 1940 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In Mecklenburg there is a concentration camp for women (in Ruerstenfeld-Ravensbrueck), m which there are very probably most of the female witnesses taken to camps. Some of them have been there now for over four years. The sisters there are allowed to write very little, only four lines, and even these are partly cut out most of the time. In that camp there seems to be a good spirit amongst the witnesses, for one never hears that anyone has tried to buy her freedom by signing the clause of retractation. Such steadfastness is to Jehovah’s honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Often people inquire about such camp prisoners, as to why they never come out, and such inquiry then provides an opportunity for their relatives, if they too serve Jehovah, to give a witness. The same is the case when one is shot because of his faithfulness to God. Nothing definite can be said at the moment as to the number of those shot or guillotined, but their number may be estimated to go into many hundreds.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to this observer the German citizenry are yielding more and more to the power of the demons, “so there are only a few who place themselves on Jehovah’s side.’’ Concerning those who have been friendlily disposed for some time but who had not promptly taken a positive stand for Jehovah and The Theocracy, “the light which came to us from Jehovah through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> regarding the ‘great multitude’ put these people of good-will on their legs. They read and understand </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> The articles ‘Fill the Earth’, ‘Lovers of Righteousness,’ ‘Salvation,’ ‘The Ransom,’ ‘Lazarus Comforted,’ and many others, were especially helpful m this respect. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lovers of Jehovah and his Theocracy are comforted and encouraged by the examples of faithful devotion under extreme test, wherever these occur, and all such watch with keen interest and fervent prayer the course of their fellow witnesses in Nazi Germany. When authentic reports filter through showing that Jehovah’s devoted ones hold fast their integrity in unswerving devotion to The Theocracy, even unto the death, the brethren in other lands experience much the same comfort and joy as did the apostle concerning the persecuted brethren of his day at Thessaloniea, and to whom he wrote after receiving a faithful report: ‘ ‘ Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you, in all our affliction and distress, by your faith: for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God; night and day praying exceedingly ... to the end he may stabhsh your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints ”■—1 Thess. 3: 7-13.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The figures at our disposal comprise twelve months, but, unfortunately, no general report has been received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Hungary the enemy is extremely active. According to a report one hundred more friends were recently delivered to prison, but those still enjoying their freedom have worked with undaunted courage, especially the brethren in Transylvania, which territory formerly belonged to Rumania but has now been lost to Hungary. One of the latest reports from Transylvania stated that the brethren there, regardless of the political trouble caused by this annexation, have courageously continued their activity. According to recent newspaper reports mail censorship has been introduced in Hungary; and that would explain why our last letters have not been acknowledged by the brethren there.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Most of the brethren in Italy are still in banishment. As shown by a letter received from the wife of the late office servant in Italy, treatment is not so bad, but the dictated sentences are of long duration, up to eleven years. The brethren are bearing these trials with remarkable valor and in complete confidence toward the Lord that &quot;the hour of their deliverance is nigh”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Recently we wrote to all addresses in Italy known to us, so as to see who could answer. Up to the time of writing several answers have been received and more should yet come. Two or three were from brothers, but the majority from sisters who confirmed that their husbands were still in prison undergoing sentences up to eleven years (from 1939 to 1950), as above mentioned. It therefore clearly appears that most of the Italian brethren are behind prison bars.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>THE NETHERLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">We very much regret that this year practically nothing can be reported concerning the state of the publishing work in the Netherlands. As a matter of fact, we have had less communication with this country, swallowed by the monster, than with any other. In the course of the summer we received a single card showing that the brethren &quot;spent Whitsun happily together”. Manifestly there were smaller gatherings. That they are not lacking spiritual food is shown by the fact that a pioneer, formerly working in Holland, and who is now in Switzerland, received from that country copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> and books and booklets in the Hollandish language!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There are no actual reports from this part of Europe. More or less regular connection could, however, be maintained by correspondence which showed that the brethren in Poland are by no means inactive and that they are not lacking spiritual nourishment. Thus the Lord cares everywhere in some way for the well-being of his own; and this reassures us, for it often pains us that our desire to help is so restricted. So the Lord adds what we can not do, and thus we see how the words of the apostle prove true when he says of the Lord: ‘ ‘ But he abideth faithful. ’ ’</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>RUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The promised report from the former Branch servant in Bucharest has not arrived up to the time of writing, and no news has been received from other quarters either, so that we know practically nothing as to the fate of the brethren in this country. Political events there rendered almost impossible any exchange of correspondence, even before the outbreak of the war, because martial law had been declared, and acts of terror were the order of the day. And now we see former Rumania rather dismembered and with that also the former limits of the territory of the witnesses of the Lord. Manifestly many persecutions came upon the faithful of the Lord in this country, as was already the case even in former years when Rumania still existed as a unified nation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Production Report of the Berne Office</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is, no doubt, due to the protection and provision of Jehovah that we are able today, in spite of the difficulties and efforts of the enemy to shut the mouths of God’s people in Switzerland, to compile a production report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;When, in July, 1940, the military authorities interfered and as a first immediate measure decreed the preliminary censorship upon </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> to which we refused to submit on the grounds that God's Word cannot be subjected to the approval of any human institution, it was to be expected that the enemies of The Theocracy would take advantage of the situation in order to dissolve the work, or the Central European headquarters m Switzerland, and to forbid the whole activity. That the Lord prevented the tools of the adversary from atta</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">inin</span><span class="font4">g their goal is shown very clearly by the following production repoit. The factory in Berne manufactured:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">559,480 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">930,702 booklets</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">249,948 miscellaneous printed matter (leaflets, invitations to lectures, etc.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">85 phonographs</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">2,250 records</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is to be noted that this literature was printed for Switzerland alone; for prevailing conditions, especially since June 1940, made exportation impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If we compare the production during this past fiscal year with the two former years, when </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> could still be forwarded to France, Holland, Belgium, Luxemburg, etc., we see that the edition for Switzerland has risen very much.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">After the coup of last year, when we had to dismiss some of the staff, the number of colaborers has had to be gradually increased again, so that it is now around 40. From 7 to 9 persons were occupied from month to month on both farms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to war conditions, military measures, rationing prescriptions and the continual increase of prices of commodities, greatest economy has had to be observed. It is a good thing that rationing of paper has not yet taken place; however, it is rather certain to come. Prices have steadily risen. Efforts are also being made to bring the printing trade under State control, an attempt which manifestly proceeds from Catholic circles. As regards printing ink the situation is about the same as with the paper. The supply of lubricating and cleaning materials, however, has become very precarious. Ersatz products may be obtained yet, but they are by far inferior to their originals and four to five times as expensive, and most of them may be obtained only upon official authorization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Till now we have had in our building Allmendstrasse 39 an oil-heating plant. However, prospects for the supply of heating oil for the coming winter are very bad, and for this reason we have had to recur to gas-heating. The necessary transformation work is under full swing; for instance, concentration of all offices into one room, partitioning of the bookbinding and printing departments—in this way heating may be reduced to three rooms. This new installation costs money, but we are grateful to the Lord that he has provided the funds therefor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The results of this past fiscal year are tangible proof that Jehovah has protected and richly blessed his work in this country. They also show that the Lord’s “volunteers” have gone on courageously and in faithful obedience to the instructions given by the antitypical “Deborah”. The Lord’s people in Switzerland have used with great appreciation and gratitude the means provided by the Most High to give a powerful witness to the honor of Jehovah and his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As stated m this report, for the time being we can print and distribute only booklets and periodicals. This year 49 percent more booklets were placed in the hands of the people than in last year (pioneers, 13 percent more; company publishers, 52 percent more). During the fiscal year under review six German, four French and two Italian booklets were published. 488,240 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> copies were distributed, to compare with 375,068 in the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the whole, 109,320, or 24 percent, more publications (exclusive of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation)</span><span class="font4"> were placed than last year. Considering the serious restrictions that have taken place, this is a gratifying progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The maximum number of publishers of all companies is 1,359; in the preceding year, 1,303. The highest number in any one month—August—-was 1,180. The average number of publishers of all companies is 1,013; 977 in 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past year we had 21 pioneers in the field, of whom, however, only 4 worked during the whole year. The number of pioneers seems likely to increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">New subscribers respectively regular readers of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation, </span><span class="font4">in German and French, were gained to the number of 4,446; i.e., 2,162, or about 95 percent, more than in the previous year. This result is due to intensive work with this periodical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Single copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> in German and French were distributed to the number of 108,175, or 44 percent more than last year. Below are details of the copies forwarded from the office:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Single copies for distribution by pioneers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34,839</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Single copies for distribution by companies &nbsp;&nbsp;318,284</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mailed to subscribers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;27,399</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Served to regular readers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;107,895</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Total &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;488,537</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls and Model Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here as well considerable progress was made. 28,243 back-calls were made, or 118 percent more than during the former year. This shows that the publishers see the importance of this service and that they accomplish it with much joy and appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In February the model-study work was launched with the help of the senes of records and of the booklets. Practical demonstration of such studies in service meetings conveyed good advice and instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year 555 phonographs have been in use. Some publishers have more than one in possession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Switzerland there are at present 58 organized companies in the German-, French- and Italian-speaking part of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past fiscal year we had 11 regional service conventions, with 4,850 attendants and 232 who symbolized their consecration by </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font4">ersion, as well as one Theocratic general convention with 1,640 attendants and 77 immersed. On the occasion of these assemblies the service from house to house accomplished the following result: By 1,708 publishers, 3,871 hours, 35,879 booklets, 4,433 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> copies, and 246 addresses of interested persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Public witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A lecture with lantern slides held in Berne on the subject “The Theocracy in Power and Glory”, with 1,700 attendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A lecture with lantern slides in Basle, in two parts, on the subject <sup>11</sup> World Peace Only Through The Theocracy”, with 3,700 attendants, followed by three supplementary lectures with 500 attendants each. There were, moreover, some smaller public witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Service to Companies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Begular public discourses are given in the companies. These were attended by 33,263 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bethel family as well zealously took part in the publishing service. The following are the results of the past fiscal year: 33 publishers (maximum), 5,441 hours, 272 Bibles, 9,547 booklets, 12,204 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> copies, 184 subscriptions, 23 phonographs used, 997 setups, 2,554 listeners, 2,431 back-calls, and 138 model studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Service meetings have also been held regularly. They are of special benefit to the brethren, helping them to carry out their commission in the proper way. The same may be said about the study meetings, which are a special blessing to the family. The brethren receive the precious food with great thankfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mail received, 4,724; mail dispatched, 4,880.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Experiences</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When we now look at the map of Europe, we find Switzerland as never before surrounded by “the sea and the waves roaring”. Will she once again, as m 1914-1918, be spared from the terrors of war? That is the question we ask ourselves time and again; and if so, will the Lord allow us to continue the witness work in this country till Armageddon? What an immense grace that would bet But whatever may be our lot, we have learned to look to the Lord in full confidence; for we have experienced one thing quite especially: the Lord does not allow anything to happen before the time; that is to say, he does not permit his enemies to touch his own and to harm them till his wisdom allows it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the enemy tried to frighten God’s people in this country some time ago, he was in no wise successful in his attempt to do so. Indeed the work of proclamation has continued wonderfully, and more intensively than ever before in so far as the work can be done at all under the restricted possibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Apart from the regular witnessing activity the Lord provided at &quot;Easter” a very special opportunity of showing that Jehovah’s witnesses, in spite of claims made by Catholic papers that they &quot;had had to begin their retreat”, are still here and are loudly raising their voices. Against all expectation this general convention in Berne, the capital city of the country, brought nearly 1,700 friends together. This shows how great was the need to assemble together again in the midst of the persisting insecure conditions, as the psalmist expresses it in the 100th Psalm, verse 4: &quot;Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name! ’ ’ The Lord cleared the way for this assembly m a visible and wonderful way, so that we could but expect that he would grant us special blessings, and so it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This Theocratic Assembly m Switzerland began with the Memorial. Nearly 1,000 persons had already arrived on the first day of the assembly, which began in the afternoon, and attended the celebration in the evening either as participants or as visitors. On the second day several hundred brethren and Jonadabs took part in divine service from house to house in Berne and in other places around the capital, reaching far out into the country. A new booklet had been published for this event, and 12,000 copies thereof found their way into the homes of the people, together with over 1,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> copies. On the evening of that same day there was the &quot;happy event”, viz., the public lecture on the subject &quot;The Theocracy in Power and Glory”. The friends throughout the country had not known what was to be expected under this heading &quot;Happy Event” as announced in the program, the less so as since the outbreak of difficulties in the Berne office we had no more appeared on the public scene in this way. The authorities whom, according to existing regulations, we had to inform about this manifestation, had no objection to make. So on that evening the gieatest auditorium of the city was packed out with 1,700 persons. The audience listened attentively to the exposfi and followed with interest the diversified pictures. Thus the second day of the general convention closed with richest blessings from the hand of the Lord. The third convention day was the climax, commencing with a lecture on the coming of the Lord to his temple, continuing with a very well presided question meeting, an hour for the pioneers, an hour for the children, a back-call demonstration, and closing with a chief discourse on Haggai 2:4: &quot;And be strong, all ye people of the land,. . . and work.&quot; At the close of this discourse the following Resolution was read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;1,700 witnesses of Jehovah, assembled in Theocratic general convention in Berne, from April 11th to 13th, in answer to constantly recurring slandeis in the Catholic press that Jehovah’s witnesses are enemies of the State and of the common good, submit the following declaration:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;1) We have pledged our unqualified allegiance and devotion to Almighty God, and to His </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom, for which Jesus commands all Christians to pray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;2) We respect the Swiss Federal Constitution, which was written in the spirit of reverence toward God, and acknowledge it as a basis for the living together of honest men, a basis which does not interfere with the right to worship God according to one’s own conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;3) We pledge allegiance and obedience to all the laws of our country that are consistent with God’s law, as set forth in the Bible. We do not do this under coercion, but because it is right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;No honest, sincere person can find objection to such solemn declaration; for it tends to cause others to have greater reverence for Almighty God, which is, of course, for the good of the country. In harmony with this it is written in the Scriptures: &quot;Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah.”—Psalm 33; 12, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;This declaration was unanimously adopted by said convention and it was decided to bring it to the knowledge of the Army Staff and of the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;April 13, 1941. &quot;Theocratic General Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">of Jehovah’s witnesses in Switzerland. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This wonderful convention of God’s people in Switzerland was followed on the fourth day, &quot;Easter Monday,” by excursions to both Kingdom farms. For a long time many friends had expressed their desire to see the two places, and so this was made possible at little cost in conjunction with the general convention in Berne. Many participated and great was the joy of all these visitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following the general convention we received a number of appreciative letters. Quotations of a few of them may testify to the joy and blessings shared by the conventloners:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ . . . We have returned from Berne richly blessed, and our hearts are full of gratitude to the Lord, who has so strengthened us for the great amount of work which lies ahead of us, and also for the trials and difficulties which Satan will not forget to put in our way. We would also like to thank the brethren who must certainly have had plenty of work to make everything run so smoothly, as was actually the case. The Lord will surely reward them with rich blessings. . . . M. F., Z.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ . . , The Easter days in Berne were unique. Words fail me to express what I have felt, and, no doubt, also all others. Thanks to the Lord for everything and to you as well at Bethel for your many efforts, which were visibly blessed. . . . E. J. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ . . . With my heart filled with gratitude towards Jehovah, I have returned to my field of activity. Language is inadequate to describe the marvelous impressions and joy received during our great Theocratic convention. . . . P. O., L. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ . . . With appreciation and full of deep gratitude for the many joyous things and so much meat in due season we left Berne. Encouraged to new and zealous activity, we have returned to our zone our hearts full of good resolutions. . . . E. H., A.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ . . . Already a week passed, but for a long time yet we shall draw from the unspeakable blessings which were dispensed on the occasion of the general convention. The Lord Jehovah especially blessed you this time in that he used you in giving us much encouragement; the public lecture, too, was very refreshing. . . . R. R., 8.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ . . . Still being entirely under the influence of what we lived and received at the Theocratic general convention, a goodly number of us assembled on Thursday for our service meeting. Over 200 brethren were present, for on Tuesday I had particularly emphasized that important things were to be discussed. ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Meanwhile the enemy, who manifests himself in Switzerland especially m Catholic Action and their press, continues his campaign of slander and lies. As an example, the notorious Catholic paper </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Morning</span><span class="font4"> published an article abounding with infamous lies about us, and in which among other things it was claimed that we had published a booklet entitled ‘‘Now Everything Will Change”. In this pamphlet we were said to have called upon the reader to refuse to pay State and military taxes and to do military service, etc., and to have written: ‘‘To the Devil if Christians do such things! ” As a matter of fact, such a booklet, duplicated, was in circulation and the things above mentioned were actually in it. However, it soon became manifest who was the author, namely, a former Catholic and anti-militarist. But </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Morning</span><span class="font4"> trumpeted to the world that Jw had written and published it. Naturally, said paper was forced to publish a retractation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An even more brilliant piece of Jesuitical denunciation was performed by a Catholic prelate in Basle, Robert Maeder, in a newspaper article as well as m a booklet entitled ‘ ‘ Dynamite under Switzerland”. He seized upon our booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocratic Ambassadors,</span><span class="font4"> which amongst other things contains an article by Brother Rutherford “Is God One or a Trinity?” as an excuse to write this article which truly is more provocative than anything we have ever read in this country. Therein prelate Maeder describes Jw as ‘ ‘ religious revolutionaries, religious anarchists, spiritual incendiaries ’ ’ and their writings as ‘ ‘ dynamite under Switzerland”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following are a few flowers picked at random from his article:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The old Swiss Confederation is trinitarian. Its God is nowhere a deistic god from the 18th century, but the God of Christianity, the Bather, Son and Holy Ghost. To the three human confederates here beneath must correspond the three divine confederates above. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We admit that the 'theocratic ambassador’ proclaims Christ as ‘the great King whom God has set upon his throne’. Bor him Christ is the One who brings to reality a coming total, radical and universal domination by God on earth. Bor him he is the first-born of creation and the hope of the human race. If one is not a Christian, one cannot speak more fluently and enthusiastically about Christ than is done by the Bible Student. But what is the use of all these glorifications of Christ after one has reduced him, the Son of God, to the condition of a mere man! In the end all this palaver is nothing else than praise out of the mouth of Antichrist.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘ ‘ In the name of honesty we demand that the Bible Students crowd appear upon the battle scene with open countenance, namely, as that which it is, masked Judaism, and therefore as antiehnstian. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the occasion of the great public witness in Basle, when we were privileged on two afternoons and evenings to speak on the subject “World Peace Only Through The Theocracy”, a wonderful opportunity was afforded us to answer the prelate and to remind him that he himself, nineteen years ago, literally wrote in the Catholic magazine </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sentinel:</span><span class="font4"> “Every Catholic has the right and duty to be a spiritual incendiary,” and that he now comes and accuses Jw of being that very thing. We further reminded </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font4"> of his spiritual essay published eleven years ago in the parochial magazine </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bells</span><span class="font4"> and in which he said: “When in the middle ages they took recourse to burnings at the stake and the gallows, they thereby wanted to preserve, and in many cases did preserve, the then existing world from rum. In their place we now have the unrestricted, yea criminal freedom of press and speech. If we could succeed in interning in State prisons—even with good board and lodging—all equivocal university professors advocating freedom of thought, all artists, authors, editors, cinema owners, fashion makers and seducers of all kinds, it would yet be possible to save humanity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We flung out to prelate Maeder that we accept his gauntlet and are ready to debate publicly, in any place in Switzerland, ■with him or with any other representative of ‘ ‘ Thinking Catholicity”, and that the persons attending such debate, who appreciate honesty and do not reject truth, would see that we actually are God’s witnesses and that by His grace we legitimately bear His name (Jeremiah 15:16-21); that moreover they would see that these accusations and slanders were to serve the fixed purpose of discrediting and making contemptible Jw, or, as Mr. Prelate called them, the ‘ ‘ Bible Students crowd ’ ’, in the eyes of honest Swiss citizens, and, which is now especially modern, to represent them as Jews. The audience in Basle followed the expose with the most lively interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the occasion of the supplementary lectures following this impressive public witness, ‘ ‘ Catholic Action, ’ ’ chiefly represented by young men, was ever present and tried to disturb, but they did not once succeed; on the contrary, leaflets which they had handy for distribution were confiscated by the police, because they did not bear the name of the printer as prescribed. In their despair, at least it seemed so, they even called upon the Federal Attorney’s office in Berne, for at the last lecture there appeared a representative of this high Swiss body and warned the speaker beforehand not to make any political utterances. However, that would not have been necessary, because Jw, as is well-known, do not participate in polities, but always confine themselves to statements based upon the Bible. At the dose of this lecture this official, on being asked, stated that everything was O.K. and that he had nothing to object to. Thus this manifestation in Basle, with its supplementary lectures, meant one victory upon another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And now the Lord provides a further unique opportunity of proclaiming The Theocracy as the only remedy for the solution of all world problems, in that at Zurich, the largest city of Switzerland, with its more than 300,000 inhabitants, the wonderful, entirely new House of Art, situated right at the lake, is at our disposal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the Lord wills, we shall describe the course of this witness in our next annual report! Should the Lord keep us till then in this position of favor, so that we might continue to proclaim The Theocracy in power and glory, then be it our continual prayer that we may be very zealous and that we may go forward boldly and unflinchingly. Yet whatever Jehovah may permit for our best—be it more trials—may we then, too, remain true and steadfast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For a year and a half now an examination has been going on against the Branch servant in Berne. This examination has now come to a close and, as the judge stated, the military courts will now have to decide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our prayer is that Jehovah may keep his protecting hand also over this part of the work. And even if by the wise permission of the Lord we should be called upon to share temporarily the lot of Job, we shall still firmly believe that the final conclusion can but be a glorious one!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Yugoslavia has also lost its existence since the monster trampled through this land. The office in Belgrade is closed. The Branch servant there very courageously defended the interests of the work until he found it wise to move to another place. There, too, he does his best and reports as often and as well as he can. Since the invasion some brethren have been arrested, while there is no news of others. In his last report he stated that it has become impossible for him to maintain relations with the brethren living beyond certain limits of his present abode, and that he is sorry he cannot send m a more detailed report for Head Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Shortly before the political difficulties broke out in Yugoslavia and before the country was defeated by the monster, the Branch servant at Belgrade was accused for distributing the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fifth Column.</span><span class="font4"> He was haled into court, and the ensuing trial was marked by a special feature, about which we briefly report as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the close of the debates the accused stated to the judge that he had to present a declaration and that he wished that such declaration become a part of the records. The judge answered: “Please dictate it to the secretary to become a part of the records.” The following is the statement of the accused:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I claim and emphasize once more that to me, as well as to Judge Rutherford, the author of the incriminated booklet, there is imposed the sacred duty of representing the interests of Almighty God, Jehovah, and His King Christ Jesus, because we steadfastly believe in Jehovah and Jesus Christ. Safeguarding these interests, it is our duty to smash the lying claims of the religious Catholic organization, even if that should cost our lives, as has been the case with many true Christians. The firm stand taken by Judge Rutherford and myself is that of true Christians who cannot stand by and allow the name of God Almighty, Jehovah, to be reproached, as has been done for centuries especially by that religious Roman Catholic organization. Our position and that of all our brethren all over the earth is a fair and frank one. To all peoples of the world we make known the truth as set forth in the Bible. This work is not the work of a man, but it is God’s ‘strange work’, for which Almighty God Jehovah uses in tins the ‘last time’ those men who have sworn faithfulness and obedience to </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font4">. We cannot act otherwise, and we do so in the conviction that thereby we serve Almighty God Jehovah, his King Christ Jesus, and the people. And now judge yourselves I ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thereupon the judge burst out: “Man! instead of defending yourself, you are accusing yourself even more! But I see that you are a decent, God-fearing man.” The brother answered: “Mr. Justice, I do not feel at all as an accused one, I even believe that I would be entitled to take the role of complainant!” The judge asked. “So you wish that all this become part of the records?” The brother replied: “Yes, I even insist on it, because this is the essential thing m my defense.” The judgment was as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In the name of His Majesty King Peter II of Yugoslavia, the court of the district of Manbor found the accused, Rudolf B. Kalle, editor from Belgrade, domiciled in Belgrade, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">guilty </span><span class="font4">in the accusation by the State Attorney, dated December 28, 1940, No. 1752-40-3, and said Rudolf R. Kalle, on the basis of § 4 of the law for the protection of public order in the State, is sentenced to ten days arrest, 500 Dinar fine and to the payment of all legal expenses, the sentence suspended for one year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In determining sentence consideration was given to the fact that the accused has not been previously sentenced and that he openly acknowledged the incriminated act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The court further acquired conviction that the accused acted from a pure motive, since according to his opinion his act was one of duty and service to God However, by said act, 5 4 of the law for the protection of public order in the State was violated, wherefor the sentence is justified.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Brief Report of Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This comprises but eleven months, whereby from April, 1941, reports had come in from only three companies. There was a monthly average of 45 publishers who, under very changeable conditions, obtained the following results: 8,397 hours, 887 books, 23,772 booklets, 510 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> copies, 318 Bibles, 396 phonograph setups, 2,894 listeners, 1,213 back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No report was received concerning the Memorial. The last booklet published was </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied,</span><span class="font4"> in Croatian and Slovenian; 20,000 copies were printed. The booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy,</span><span class="font4"> 32 pages, was duplicated in Cioatian.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During this “time of the end”, and particularly since 1931, the years have been filled with war and suffering for the multitudes of the Republic of China. Hence it has been a blessed privilege for a few servants of Jehovah God to proclaim the message of the Theocratic Government of righteousness and by this means “comfort all that mourn”. During the year past a good witness has been given, not alone in Shanghai, but in other parts of China. By the Lord’s grace and the faith in him some pioneers have been able to penetrate into the central parts of the country by traveling over the bomb-target Burma Road, taking with them good supplies of literature and bringing consolation to many in those war-torn areas. Many refugees who fled from Nazi Germany and have come to Shanghai have been given the opportunity of hearing the Kingdom truth. It has been more difficult, due to war conditions, to get shipments into our China Branch, but despite this the obedient witnesses keep faith with God and press on. An interesting report is herewith set out as received from the Branch servant:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With God there is no “respect of persons,” and as the gospel of the Kingdom is preached first “to the Jews” (or “Christendom”, so called) it is also preached “to the Gentiles” (or heathendom), not to convert them, but to give a witness (Matt. 24: 14), and we are privileged, according to God’s arrangement, to be used for that very purpose and to have a part in bringing the good tidings of the great Theocracy to the suffering, demon-controlled, heathen Chinese. Of course, to preach the gospel in this land may to many seem harder than to preach to those nations that call themselves ‘ ‘ Christian ’ ’; but the witness must be given, and that quickly, before the “end” comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Generally speaking, in China Jehovah’s witnesses are regarded as “missionaries” who are referred to as “yang kwei tsz”— meaning ‘the foreign devil’, still we are convinced that there are many sincere and honest-hearted people who would be overjoyed to accept the Kingdom message were it not for the pernicious influence of babbling religionists who don’t want the truth for themselves and who do their best to hinder others from getting the message. Nevertheless, much literature has been placed and we feel sure that some—perhaps many—of the people of good-will will yet find their way into the Kingdom, the one and only place of refuge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Owing to Japanese occupation of the entire eastern half of the nation the scope, or range, of our activities has been diminished to an enormous extent. All that is left for us is the city of Shanghai with a population—now—of two and one-half million. Being anxious to spread out we recently explored the possibilities of going farther afield, but found ourselves confronted with endless rules, regulations, laws and by-laws and outlaws; so that we just had to “stay put”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To travel in China is surely set about with many difficulties. It is very expensive under present conditions. In some cases only Japanese military transports are available. In fact, the entire travel service is virtually controlled by the Japanese. Besides, our status in Japan is well known. This is a circumstance hardly overlooked. But, however, the arm of the Lord is not shortened, and now workers are entering western China through another way, as you will see in the next few paragraphs. Thus, through the tender mercy of our God the light of truth is given to them that ‘ ‘ sit in darkness and in the shadow of death” due to the power of the “god of this world”, his demon hordes and human dupes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Shanghai company of Jehovah’s witnesses is composed of different nationalities. Our number, never large at any tune, has been still further diminished by the departure of some of our workers for other countries. Most of the workers devote themselves almost exclusively to the Chinese. Since they do not speak the language, follow-up work is impossible. Two German pioneers are getting Chinese lessons twice a week and much progress has been made. One pioneer (German Jew refugee) labors exclusively among the Japanese. He has been very successful in making placements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the fall of 1940 two German pioneers arrived from East Indies with instructions to proceed to Thailand. During their stay in Shanghai for two months waiting for ship they worked among the German population and placed a good number of German books and booklets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are about 17,000 German-Jews (refugees) in Shanghai. To serve them we printed 5,000 handbills. These contained a brief and vital message for the Jews and an invitation to attend a special meeting for the occasion where a lecture in German was to be given. The next week, and for a number of weeks following, more leaflets (date changed) were given out and more lectures given. The attendance at these meetings was very small. No permanent interest developed—hut the witness was given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most promising outlook here is really among miscellaneous European nationalities. One worker devotes all his time to these foreigners, and among the interested ones we find English, American, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Danish, and Czechoslovakian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For years this Branch has been looking for a suitable house for office quarters. Now the Lord has provided us with a nice home just in time. On February 15 we moved in and settled down comfortably and have our regular studies here. We thank God for his gracious provision in time of need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You will be interested to hear that recently two Australian pioneers have arrived in Chungking, the capital of free China. The following paragraphs are quoted from their letter of recent date:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Brother Oates and myself are living in the country about two miles from the city, very hilly and very hot, so you can imagine how hot the city is. We have air raids every day. The city has been badly bombed, but we have sufficient territory to last us for many more weeks. When the winter starts, the haze over the city then makes it difficult to bomb, so they don’t bother to come. The house in Chungking city where we stayed for two days on our arrival had been partly bombed— debris galore on all sides. We also lost some warm clothes, but certainly it could have been worse had it not been for God’s protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘ ‘ There is much work to be done in Chungking and surrounding towns such as Chengtu, Wanhsien, Suifu, and other places which can be reached by highway and river.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These two courageous young pioneers constrained by the love of Chnst press on under great difficulty and danger to bear the message of the Kingdom to parts of China hitherto never visited—giving all praise to His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Responding to the call for pioneer service, one Jonadab, a Rumanian, woke up to his privilege and entered into the pioneer work. This brother had been a company worker for a number of years after his consecration, and now he rejoices in the greater privilege of full-time service. He is richly blessed in his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Six hundred copies of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> (Chinese) were recently ordered from Java Depot. When on arrival in Shanghai we found that these books had been censored—some of the pictures, including that of the pope’s head (center of book) and the Roman Catholic religious inquisition on page 319, had been blotted out. This was evidently done by some religious fanatic in an attempt to cover the exposure and exit (a la Haman) of the Hierarchy. The damage done to the books was irreparable, but we took advantage of the circumstance by inserting a copy of original picture and a printed statement showing how it all happened, etc. This really made the books far more desirable than they otherwise would have been. ‘The wrath of men shall praise the Lord! ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year two shipments of books were discharged at Hong Kong, one of the most vicious strongholds of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The books were first seized by the Police Department and later censored by the authorities, but finally released because no fault could be found with them. We were grateful to receive our stock though a heavy expense for reshipment had to be paid. Surely Jehovah has directed the matter to the honor of His name and it is evident that it is His will that the work continue in Shanghai.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Chinese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> is doing its part in the good work. Much interest has been made manifest by the readers. More subscriptions are obtained. Orders are coming in constantly from overseas, such as, Thailand, Honolulu, India, Burma, Manila, Java, Singapore, and the States. Wrote Bangkok Depot: ‘&quot;Jhe magazine goes out very well and we could well use 400 of each issue if you could get them to us. . . . Please continue to send us the magazine, even back numbers if you have them. . . . The people like the magazine very well. ’ ’ The two pioneers in Chungking sent in their first order for 500 copies and 250 of each issue as they are published. Later we were notified by the Chinese Post Office that the magazines we sent to Singapore and Java have all been seized by the authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In December last an invitation was received from a Chinese independent church asking one of the Chinese brothers to give a speech on ‘ ‘ Religion and Christianity ’ ’ because they, through reading of the Chinese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> wanted to know the difference. The speech, based on Scriptures, was given in the presence of approximately 60 men and women, all Chinese, and to their satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign one worker, by God’s grace, secured 70 new subscriptions. He regularly distributes the major portion of 40 American </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> fortnightly and does much back-calling. When the new booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theociacy</span><span class="font4"> arrived from Brooklyn this brother was assigned the work of ca</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">llin</span><span class="font4">g on the missionaries, Protestant clergy, etc. Here is his report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“There is usually a big crop of missionaries and religious workers in China, but because of hostile conditions, high cost of living, difficulties in traveling, and the hot, sticky summer weather, this gentry has for the most part sought out a more congenial atmosphere elsewhere. One can imagine that those who are forced to remain find the situation anything but pleasant, particularly if one of those witnesses of Jehovah comes along scattering ‘coals of fire over the city’. Truly, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State</span><span class="font4"> find a mixed reception. It is extremely interesting to watch the facial expressions of those approached and to note their remarks. One missionary, in charge of a rest home, said to me: “The Devil?—I don’t believe in any devil. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Frequently one hears, ‘That’s Russellism.’ Some viciously tear the literature into shreds; a fitting gesture seeming to say, ‘Here goes the last lingering hope of life.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font4"> booklet has been printed in Chinese now, and so, whenever possible, these are left with Chinese office attendants, as they are all a part of the staff. None of these have ever refused to receive their copy. The Chinese say, “We are always ready to accept anything as long as we don’t have to pay for it. ’ ’ A percentage of missionaries receive their copy with a smile, promise to read it, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the scope of our activities is limited to Shanghai, the books are traveling far and wide into the remotest places of the country. This is evidenced in the letters received from Kalgan, a small town in North China, and Loiwing, a small district in Yunnan Province, southwestern China, expressing their appreciation and interest in reading our literature. Consequently a considerable number of books and booklets and of Chinese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> have been placed with those who do hunger and thirst after righteousness.—Matt. 5. 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One isolated Chinese brother in Shensi Province, northwestern free China, who had entered the pioneer service years ago is still active; but he can witness only orally, as it is impossible for us in Shanghai'to send literature to free China since the Sino-Japanese hostilities began four years ago. However, when he heard that workers had arrived in Chungking he rejoiced exceedingly, seeing the day is not very distant when he may join them and work again with books</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The annual report shows a marked increase in all items, surpassing that of the last year, especially the magazines. This is because of the Chinese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> now m circulation.

<p><span class="font4">In conclusion, we again give thanks to our heavenly Father, ‘who worketh all things according to the counsel of His own will,’ for the privilege of being His witnesses in this country and for the increased fruits of our labor. Nevertheless, when we have done all those things that are commanded us we are still unprofitable servants and we have merely, by His grace, done that which was our duty to do. Truly, He is “able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us. Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus, throughout all ages, world without end. Amen. ’ ’—Eph. 3: 20, 21.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A group of several islands in the Pacific are under the direction of the Branch office located at Honolulu, on the island of Oahu. Companies have been established in the various islands, and pioneers travel from place to place and are reaching those living in the most isolated locations of these islands. There is a considerable demand for the literature in many languages besides the English, including Japanese and various dialects of the Filipinos. The distribution of the literature was nearly double that made in the previous year, and the report furnished by the Branch servant is encouraging.</span></p>

There was also an increase of 3,528 individual magazines placed, and also 140 more new subscriptions obtained than in the preceding year. There are many new publishers, although the figures above do not so indicate, since they replace some who left here for the mainland. Especially has there been an increase in the number of pioneer publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The hours reported in the field are not as great in number as for the previous year, for several reasons.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers. During the first part of the year there were only 3 pioneer witnesses, but the number increased during the summer to 7. Then the last month of the year, September, the total increased to 11. Heretofore the pioneers were mostly from the mainland and they would return there from time to time. Now the new ones are all people who have learned of Jehovah’s purpose while in the Islands, and keenly feel their responsibility to carry the message to other inhabitants of the Islands, and by the Lord’s grace to remain in the work here. One of these entered pioneer service within two months from the time of beginning to read the literature of The Theocracy. Many thanks to Jehovah for calling out the “great multitude’’ at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the excessive cost of travel between the Islands? it is necessary for pioneers to remain for long periods of time on one island. Sometimes this means that they do not see other brethren or have fellowship very often. The cost of food is very high, and they find it necessary to do without many comforts. Despite these and other hardships, rainy weather and heat, they are pushing on gladly in service of the great Theocrat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneers on each island are: Kauai, 2; Hawaii, 2; Maui, 2; and Oahu (Honolulu), 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Meetings. In Honolulu meetings were held in the study of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion;</span><span class="font4"> also weekly service meetings. The year’s attendance for these was 2,884. There were other meetings in Spanish, Japanese and Filipino languages, also many model studies. One pubhsher alone had 25 model studies with a good attendance. Two publishers privileged to serve at the Kingdom Hall in Honolulu report their field activity as: 963 books, 6,470 booklets; total, 7,433 pieces of literature. Also 602 magazines placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the island of Kauai, 156 meetings were held by the pioneers, with a total attendance of 837. The pioneer conducting the studies had to drive a total of 55 miles for each one, and states m his report: “It is necessary to drive a long distance to the studies at Makaweli, but the joy received from studying with these folks who have been held in Babylon so long makes the distance nothing or less.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Immersions. During the year 15 persons were immeised, and are now rejoicing in their privilege of knowing and serving Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Street Witnessing. This feature of the witness is now being carried on regularly each Saturday on the principal business streets of Honolulu with good results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Flag Salute by children in schools. This question was brought to an issue on three of the islands. In some cases the children were expelled and then after a few days again permitted to attend school after the matter was properly explained to those in charge by the parents. Now the children are excused from the room while the flag exercises are conducted. This has af</span><span class="font4">forded opportunity for the children and their parents to take a stand for The Theocracy, and has given a good testimony to the school authorities involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In closing this report opportunity is taken to express deep gratitude to Jehovah, and to you Brother Rutherford as the head of the Lord’s visible organization, for the many provisions made during the past year that the witness might be given in these islands The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> book is the latest such provision, and for it we are very thankful, and we look forward to many privileges of service in carrying it to the people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Regardless of the fact that the royal Government in the British Isles continues to let the servants of Jehovah go ahead with their witness work, many of the countries included in the British Commonwealth of Nations have banned the Society’s literature and tried to cause the stopping of the witness to The Theocracy. This is true in India, where during the past year the Government ban was put upon all importations of the Society’s publications into India. Officials also seized the literature at the depot in Travancore. In Calcutta pioneers working there had their literature taken away from them. Appeal was made to the viceroy of India for intervention in this matter. A report of the activities on the part of the brethren as furnished by the Branch servant follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These figures cover the ten months from September, 1940, to and including June, 1941, and show a healthy increase over the corresponding period of the previous year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">All appeals to the Government to allow the Society’s literature to be imported into Ceylon failed. We have now sent a letter to the officials concerned and all members of the Ceylon Government regarding this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A convention was arranged during the Memorial season for the special benefit of the Indian brethren in Trayancore. Jehovah gave his very manifest blessing. A good hall was procured for three days; the peak attendance of brethren was 69, and for the first time we had a properly organized street campaign using the magazine bags printed in the Malayalam language. The brethren were highly delighted with the new phase of work, and I heard even the sisters, who in this part of the world are extremely shy of doing anything in the nature of a public work, took part. Service organizations are given special attention. Eleven were immersed. Three public meetings were arranged inside the hall as well as some outdoor transcription woik done. The attendances at the advertised meetings were 500, 600, and 700, on three consecutive evenings. The public meetings were held at Trivandrum, the capital of Travancore state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord has blessed this field with the printing press, and they are printing Malayalam </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font4"> and other publications that will advance The Theocracy. The brethren have just finished preparing the type, and are ready to print 10,000 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font4"> booklets. There is considerable delay in the transit of letters to America and replies, but the brethren look to the Lord to press on with the work, knowing that they have one thing to do, and that is to preach “this gospel of the kingdom”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work in the British West Indies continues, and the Jamaica Branch has been able to obtain import licenses from the Government during the past year and considerable literature was allowed to enter the country. A marked increase is manifest, not only in the literature distributed, but in the number of publishers associated with the Kingdom activities. The Branch servant’s report follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tins island stronghold of the far-flung British territories has, during the past year, received the greatest witness in its history, and the faithful servants of the Almighty God continue to press onward, despite a rising tide of opposition to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Kingdom. As in many parts of the territory of “the king of the south”, Jamaica is feeling the effect of the treacherous, liberty-destroying influence of the Jesuits. The governor of the island has been empowered with the privilege of making proclamations which prohibit the importation, carnage coastwise or exportation of such literature or goods as he may desire. In September 1940 certain of the Society’s publications were banned from further importation or distribution; but in September 1941 a proclamation was made prohibiting all pubheations and phonograph records of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That it is the Boman Catholic Hierarchy who are really responsible for this effort to hinder and stop the work of proclaiming the message of God’s Kingdom in this land is clearly shown in the fact that when the Branch servant attempted to obtain permission and a license to import certain Bibles published by a worldly printing concern, not the Society, this was denied, even though such Bibles be sent as a gift to the people of Jamaica. It is well known that the Devil’s Catholic Hierarchy has always done its utmost to keep the people from reading the Bible.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The witness work in this country moves ahead at a good pace. The Mexicans, while being under the domination of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy for centuries, are now being given the opportunity to hear the truth. Those of good-will are taking a stand and quickly joining in the Theocratic activities and pushing ahead with the “strange work” of Jehovah. A big increase in the number of hours devoted directly to field service is shown in the report furnished by the Branch servant and which follows. A tremendous increase in the distribution of literature is also noted. One of the outstanding events of the year was the Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in Mexico. Many new publications in Spanish were released during the same period, and at the close of the year several more are being released for the advancement of the work both in Mexico and in the other Spanish-speaking sections of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This has been a year of great blessings and increased activities in this country, and we imagine the same is the case m every country where the “abomination” has not interfered with the “daily sacrifice” of the Lord’s people to the extent that it has in the domains of “the king of the north”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sometimes we are prone to think that the work is about to close, but to our joy we find that it advances, and that new features are added to keep busy all publishers of Tub Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We were not altogether pessimistic at the beginning of the fiscal year, but, seeing that the “harlot” is getting a freer hand here in Mexico, and that she is becoming bolder and bolder, we thought that results would decrease. But how far we were from the facts! In many respects we went beyond last year’s lesults, particularly in booklets, as the actual number sent out from this office came to 790,210, as against 428,642 for the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Sidewalk Witnessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A great aid for these results was our sidewalk witnessing campaign with the self-covered booklets. Some friends came as high as 475 booklets m a single day, and one reached the 5,000 mark for a month. We sent groups of pioneers to most of the larger places, with splendid results. True, results have again decreased, but we do hope that with the booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn</span><span class="font4"> we shall again be able to awaken a great deal of interest and duplicate or surpass results.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazine Distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While not altogether satisfied with results in the magazine work, nevertheless we are doing our bit. Some workers are very good at it, while others do not seem to appreciate their privilege or are too backward for results. As a rule, we make our distribution from the 15th to the 22d of each month, and have found that the best results are obtainable Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning. (On Sundays only the ones that obtain the best results in the magazine work are allowed to work in this work; all others go from house to house.) One Sunday morning 13 publishers placed 259 magazines in less than two hours. During the recent convention over 2,000 magazines were placed in the city in less than two days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Office and Printing Plant</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Though confined to a rather small space, we are utilizing every available hook and nook to meet the increasing demands of enlarged work. By the Lord’s grace, and assisted by the Society, we were able to improve our office equipment. We installed Cardex Index system, obtained an addressograph and installed one fluorescent lamp in the office, etc. All these things are great helps for more efficient and accurate work, enabling us to enjoy more our long hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This office prepared copy for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, Kingdom News,</span><span class="font4"> and translated </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font4"> Nos. 2 and 3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied, Comfort,</span><span class="font4"> etc. Now we are getting ready </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The printing plant has been kept busy. Indeed it has been a great help. Besides, we are able to effect quite a saving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">New Unit for Mexico City</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the space at the Kingdom Hall connected with the Branch headquarters is insufficient to accommodate the friends, and as there are enough interested ones and workers in a section of this city to make it convenient for them to have a hall, we have now the &quot;Portales Unit” of this company, constructing a Kingdom Hall there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Theocratic Assembly</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the most blessed conventions ever held in Mexico, and the first Theocratic general assembly, was held in Mexico City on September 12-16. A nice theater was engaged, with 1,000 capacity, which was just enough for the friends attending it. Plenty of instructions for service were given, and some of the subjects used at St. Louis were here presented in Spanish. For the first time in Mexico we introduced the rooming arrangement for convention. Friends are rather poor here and up to now were all accommodated free at headquarters or at the friends’ homes. But this was now impossible; so we engaged rooms for those requesting this service in the corresponding blanks Economic conditions hindered quite a number from coming; also, many friends from the States were unable to assist for this reason (many spent their savings going to St. Louis) and for the added reason of passport requirements. But, all in all, it was a blessed and busy time to the honor of Jehovah and for the joy of those that were able to attend it and all others that love Him in Mexico.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>NORTHERN EUROPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Our brethren in the lands comprising the Northern European field for work are pushing ahead with the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. They are no longer working under a central office as in times past, but each of the countries, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Estonia, Sweden, Latvia, and Lithuania, forge ahead with the witness as they know the Lord would have them do. Communications are slow, but in due course they receive the general instructions sent out by the Society and they follow campaign by campaign to the best of their ability. All of these countries have been overrun by the totalitarian monstrosity, with the exception of Sweden. The people are thereby oppressed. However, Jehovah’s witnesses know that their one duty and privilege is to comfort those that mourn. During the past year and under the most harrowing and depressing times the Kingdom publishers were able to distribute two and one-half million books and booklets in the various countries of this Northern European territory. The Branch servant, who had for many years looked after the general interests of the work in all the countries under supervision of that office, is now in a concentration camp, as well as many other brethren. Information, however, continues to come from there, and they are pushing on in the Lord’s “strange work” that precedes Armageddon. The reports of the various countries within the Northern European district are set out below.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It was hardly expected that progress could be reported in the little land of Denmark, due to its being overrun by the Nazi hordes. For all this the Lord’s people working under the increased difficulties do not accept such as an excuse for slackness, and as one phase of the work may suffer another manner of work that has been brought to their attention increases with leaps and bounds. This clearly appears in the fact that the door-to-door work, of necessity, had a setback but the model-study and the back-call activities have moved ahead with added impetus. There has been an increase accordingly of 150 percent in the back-call work over that of the previous year, and the natural result of this is that the number of publishers has increased until we find that now in Denmark there are nearly 1,700 active servants of The Theocracy. Reports show that it is difficult for the brethren looking after the work to make the customary visits, but the brethren throughout the land know that this is the Lord’s work and move ahead, following the instructions they receive. The report from Denmark sent in by the servants looking well to the interests of the Kingdom is comforting and strengthening to the Lord’s people throughout the earth and shows a unity of action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the elose of the fiscal year, when, we review the many blessings which have been ours our hearts are overflowing with gratitude to Jehovah our God for the privilege we have of being his representatives in this dark day in the history of man, when the great unseen forces of evil would beat down the courage and destroy the faith of those who serve the Lord. We have surely proved the truth of the words: ‘Jehovah preserveth all those who love him.’ What a favored lot is ours, to be used to bring to honest souls a message of comfort and hope from the Word of Almighty God. Never has the need been greater, and it is our sincere desire to be faithful in the use of the opportunities which are afforded us. That we have had difficulties to overcome goes without saying, but so many have been our blessings, both spiritual and material, that such setbacks as we have experienced have only incited us to greater activity for The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That you might rejoice with us in the blessings which the Lord has given us in his service, I set out below a table showing the results for this year to compare with last year. Last year it was deemed advisable to make a rather extensive distribution of free literature, and for this purpose 350,000 booklets were used. This year there seemed to be no particular necessity for a special gratis distribution.</span></p>

Strangely enough, conditions which at one time seemed to be far from favorable for us proved to be a blessing in disguise and helped us to understand better than ever before the importance of model studies Like every new work, it takes time to get it really organized; but now we are really getting into stride, as the following figures show.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Owing to difficulties in connection with communications, it was not possible to get reports from the smaller countries under the Northern European office and Estonia was the only country that was able to furnish a report. Doubtless the other countries tried to make a report but censors have destroyed such. The Lord knows his own and will protect them and bless them in these perilous times. The short report by the servant, who under great difficulty was finally able to get out of the country after its invasion by the Germans and who continues to carry on a witness in another place, follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is the only one of the three local countries for which a report for any portion of last year is available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the report shows, a httle has been accomplished, but, of course, the war between Germany and Russia brought everything to a standstill. Now that the country is under die control of the Germans, we may expect that service conditions will be even more difficult than heretofore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Co</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font4">umsts are, of course, just as much religionists as are Jesuits, and when the Soviet Union took over the country opposition to the message of The Theocracy, hitherto instigated by the clergy, increased at the hands of the local Communists. As is often the case, local extremists were far more bitter and cruel in their treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses than were the invaders Third-degree methods were used m an endeavor to get the Lord’s people to betray their brethren, but this did not cause those who were still free and who remained faithful to cease in their efforts to carry the comforting message of Jehovah’s Kingdom to the people of good-will, then in such a special need of it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Notwithstanding years of war the brethren have continued to hold high the banner of the Lord in Finland. Although the government there has been forced into the unhappy position as a war ally of the Nazi totalitarian monstrosity, the brethren and servants of The Theocracy succeeded in doing some work. During the year past, the facts show, the greatest witness ever given in Finland was accomplished to the glory of Jehovah. A marked increase in publishers is manifest. The people of good-will want to learn the truth and to definitely take a stand for The Theocratic Government, and 461 newly interested ones have been immersed in symbol of their consecration to God. Some of the difficulties which have been overcome during the twelve months are set out below in the Branch servant’s report from Helsinki.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The year has also been a wonderful one for our printery. Formerly the number of big books printed each year was about two or three thousand. Some years we printed none at all. This year we have printed 99,000 bound books, 50,000 of which were printed for Sweden Besides that, we have printed 130,000 booklets, 113,350 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> 434,350 copies of our issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> 148,600 folders, 166,250 tracts, and 2,400 circular letters; a total of 1,093,950 pieces of literature. As we had no rotary press, we used outside printers for certain work as long as it was possible to get them to work for us. They printed 350,000 booklets, 600,000 tracts, and 113,000 folders; all together, 1,063,000 pieces of literature. Each of these 600,000 tracts contained practically as much written matter as a 32-page booklet. The grand total of all printing thus done for us during the year was approximately 2,000,000 pieces of literature. This works out at three copies for each family in the country. No wonder the Devil has been very angry and has made greater efforts than ever to stop the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You will remember that when we tried to hold a large public meeting this was stopped by the authorities, but we were able to get the most important newspapers in the country to publish the lecture m full, and we believe that at least a million people were thus able to read it. After this the chairman of the association “Publishers of The Theocracy” and I had to report at the office of the State police, where we were individually questioned for seveial hours. They tried to get us to admit that the aforementioned association was a continuation of the banned society, but were unable to do so. However, they started a case against the “Publishers of The Theocracy” in order to stop the activities of this association also, and after several months’ legal proceedings they succeeded in causing that association to be banned also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As soon as our friends heard that this latter case was to be started against us, and before any action had been actually taken, they drafted a petition, and in two weeks over 33,000 signatures were obtained. This petition was presented to the Government by a special committee, and copies were sent to each member of the House of Deputies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A third case was then started against one of our publishers. Martial law was still in effect in Finland at that time, although Finland was not then at war, and certain restrictions concerning public meetings were in force So-called “spiritual” meetings and meetings for educational purposes do not come under these restrictions. We have used loudspeakers for openair meetings which thousands have attended, and generally everything has gone well, as such meetings have come under the headings above mentioned. In a small town a meeting was arranged by the aforementioned publisher, and nineteen persons were present. Officials of the police were also present and made no objection. But then the local priest came and demanded that the meeting should be stopped on the grounds that it was political. The case was taken to court, but the judge had a proper understanding of the matter, and the case was decided in our favor. Our opponents then appealed to a higher court, which decided against us and fined the publisher for ‘ ‘ unlawful activity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our enemies have tried to fight against us m many other ways, but it has been a great inspiration for us to see how the Lord has kept his hand over us and protected us. When high officials prevented us from holding the big meeting in the stadium, they said that the time was not suitable for such a big open-air meeting. But it seemed to be the Lord’s will for us to make a fresh effort. The Lord blessed this, and we succeeded m getting the large Exhibition Hall for the meeting, which was attended by 4,500 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The lecture was a success in every way, and it was thought it would be well for the work generally if it were to be published all over Finland. A 300,000 edition was printed and spread in a few days. This caused much dismay amongst our enemies, and they started to write against us m their newspapers. Almost all of them were wondering from whence we obtained the money to carry on our work. One big periodical published an article entitled “Judge Rutherford’s Secret”, with pictures from the big convention at Detroit, in which it was stated that, apart from the source of its funds, all other things in connection with the Society had been revealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The newspaper </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The National Socialist</span><span class="font4"> published a long aiticle against us in which it was stated amongst other things that Charles Taze Russell was a Jew, and that a Jew, Balzereit, had directed the work in Germany. The article further stated that it had been proved that Jews in </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font4">enca. had given money for the work, and went on as follows regarding matters in Finland: “In our country the leader of these international Jewish activities and champion of Jehovah is the well-known Engineer Harteva. Even this short account shows that much money is needed for these activities, and when we add to that fact the above-mentioned men of Jewish origin, we can see for what purpose this work is carried on. ‘Salvation is of Jehovah’ [which was the title of the lecture] shows in itself that the purpose of this work is to advocate Jewish world power. When one has once listened carefully to Harteva it is clear for what he is fighting. You can visit the Watchtower in Vaisamoisenkatu and find out with whose money it is constructed. Are such palaces general among the publishers of Christian teachings? One would think that it should be a matter of concern for our Lutheran clergy, as here Jewish world power is publicly preached, and they should make it their business to inquire as to whose money is used to proclaim the power of Jehovah under the guise of Christianity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But the most interesting point of this is that in the same issue of the paper m question it was stated that the Lutheran &quot;churches” following the war with Russia lost 200 times more than our little house is worth, and that the Greek Catholic &quot;church” lost about 300 times more. These figures refer only to a very small and thinly populated part of Finland. It is also well known that many clergymen in Finland have houses which are at least as expensive as our house, which contains not only living rooms for the staff but also a whole pnntery, the offices and a meeting hall. In the same newspaper the following letter was published, purporting to be from a Freemason in America to a Swiss Freemason:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Dear Brother:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning your second question about the Earnest Bible Students which have their headquarters m Brooklyn, New York ■—of course, these people are of great benefit to us. We are giving them, in an indirect way, funds provided by some of our brethren who have made much money during wartime. It will not be heavy for their purses! They are Jews. In the beginning of the year it is possible that a well-known judge will come to Europe. He has made such trips many times already Mr. Rutherford will do advertising work with his lectures. Now I have a little request to make, honored brother. Will you see that the newspapers in Switzerland do not publish any articles which will be against these propaganda articles of Rutherford. For that reason I ask you to see that the newspapers in Switzerland in future do not in any unfavorable way refer to the activities of the Earnest Bible Students Association. For us this company is really of great benefit. They must be our pioneers. . . . Boston, U.S.A., 27/12/1922. Your brother . . . ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The paper then stated that it was of great importance for the real F</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">inni</span><span class="font4">sh people to know of such a document. &quot;By this we do not mean that Engineer Harteva’s work would not be a full-weight pioneer work m our country in order to confuse Protestantism and to take away the effervescence from deep Finnish Christianity. So there is no need for Mr. Rutherford to come to our country with his propaganda lectures, as no larger hall than the Exhibition Hall is available to which all of our people who are unawakened could be herded. That shows the danger which is threatening the soul of our people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The weekly journal </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Herattaja</span><span class="font4"> (The Awakener) published in their leader among other things the following about the lecture: “We thought that this movement had already been liquidated, and now to think that such a gang should fill the Exhibition Hall!” It was such a surprise for them that they stated further: “We put the thumb of confusion between the teeth of amazement.” In other words, they gnashed their teeth until it hurt, and so they had to stick their thumb in to make it a little softer! In the same article we were referred to as “ stinking vultures” which the war had caused to rise up to the prey, and it was stated concerning me that I had taken the lead over these vultures. As our lectures began and ended with the words “Salvation is of Jehovah”, they wrote: “The name of our Christian God is Father, Son and Holy Ghost. In that name a Christian proclamation is begun and ended. In that name the watchmen of Zion must go forward in a strong aggressive war against the activities of the vultures, both with the words of truth and mockery. The Scriptures give permission for such mockery, as the Lord m heaven is laughing at the claims and activities of all kinds of dreamers. The main thing is that now it is necessary to be awake on the walls. It shall not be allowed that the enemy comes into our nation through that part of the wall which the publishers of the Word have been given to watch.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A little later a public meeting was arranged in the second-largest city in. Finland, where a theater was hired and paid for. We have for some time experienced difficulties there, and this time it was no easy matter to get a suitable hall. Our enemies managed to get the contract canceled, but at the last minute our friends succeeded in obtaining another hall, several kilometers from the hall originally hired. The meeting was advertised to start at seven o’clock in the evening. We had been advised that some of our enemies intended to use eggs at the meeting, and for that reason our friends told those among the people who seemed to be earnest, and who had come to the theater, to go to a certain place where they would get certain information. At that place they were told to go to a third place, where a bus connection had been arranged to take them to the second hall, where the meeting had been advertised to commence at eight o’clock. These arrangements were a means of sifting the people, so that we had a very fine audience. The hall was filled by half-past seven, and so an earlier start was made. The police had received information that we would be starting at eight o’clock, and they arrived whilst the lecture was in progress. They went to the janitor and demanded that he should stop the meeting, but he said that he had no right to do this; so the lecture went on right to the end, after which I and some others were called before the police, who could, of course, now do nothing The chief of police m that place had said that he would see to it that no meetings would be held m that city. To see the Lord’s hand in the matter was a very great encouragement to the friends. I</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font4">ediately after the meeting several of the interested expressed their desire to symbolize their consecration</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following evening we had a meeting m Finland’s third-largest city. Our friends had succeeded m getting the biggest and best hall in the place. When we arrived a little before the advertised time of starting the strong-arm squad was outside informing the people that they could go away as no meeting would be held, and it seemed at first that this would really be the case. We went to one official after another, coming at last to the district governor. He refused to give permission for the meeting to be held, and one of our friends then informed him that the Minister of the Interior had nothing against such meetings. The governor telephoned to the Munster and even at that late hour happened to catch him. The Minister said that the meeting could be held, and the police were so informed The result was that the Lord had the doors opened just five minutes before the lecture was due to commence, and we had a packed house. There was seating accommodation for 800, but 1,250 managed to get crowded inside, whilst several hundred were turned away. And what a meeting it was! One could see how those present hung upon each word, and when we announced that a meeting would be held at the close for those who had made, or who desired to make, a consecration of themselves to Jehovah, 600 people remained. After the second meeting several symbolized their consecration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to inform the people of Finland of what was going on, a newssheet headed, “Is Religious Intolerance Practiced m This Country?” was printed. This was signed by the members of the committee who presented the petition before mentioned. In the newssheet it was clearly shown that the clergy were behind the persecution in Finland, and that they used their newspapers in supporting that persecution. Reference was also made to the charge that a wrong motive prompted your writings, and we quoted from the fine article entitled “Love” in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span><span class="font4"> booldet, so that the people themselves could see that a bad source or wrong motive could not be responsible for such a desire to honor the Most High. The newssheet also contained a challenge, set out in very large type, with the following contents: ‘ ‘ For the benefit of our people we challenge all the theologians and religious practitioners m Finland to show where the teachings of the Publishers of The Theocracy differ from the Bible If they can do that, we for our part will desist from those teachings; but if they cannot do so they must stop their persecution of us and of those who believe as we do, and also stop causing officials to make attacks against innocent people, so that those who are fully consecrated to</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God and are faithfully following in the footsteps of Jesus may use their small means and powers for the benefit of their country and their fellow men We are fighting only against false teachings, as the truth alone can bring lasting blessings. We claim that there is not a single place in the Bible where it is stated that the soul is </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font4">ortal, that there is a trinity of Gods and that Jesus was at the same time God and man, only to mention a few samples of the teachings which are wrongly claimed to be teachings of the Bible. We are willing to pay half the expenses for arranging a debate upon this matter. Let the clergy and preachers of Finland select their best man, and we will choose our man for that occasion ... If the clergy and other supporters of religion do not accept this challenge it will prove that they have been promulgating false teachings.” In a few days 300,000 copies of this paper were spread throughout Finland and copies were specially sent to every clergyman in the land. Needless to say, the challenge was not accepted, but a great cry was raised in the papers controlled by the clergy. The most interesting point in the articles published by these newspapers was a denial that the soul is immortal, giving the proof, from the Bible, that the soul dies. It was quite clear that the printers of Helsinki had come to an agreement not to print our newssheet, although one printer said he would like to do so but was afraid of the consequences. Only one firm agreed to do the job, but the price they asked was a million Finnish Marks, or $20,000, which was twenty tunes the price we ultimately paid to a firm in another town The young men at the printing works at the latter place said that the job was the only good thing they had done in their lives</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As our challenge was not accepted, a big public meeting was arranged at a large hall, built for the International Olympic Games which were to have been held last year but which were postponed on account of the war. The hall is owned by the city of Helsinki, and they took several days to consider whether they would rent it to us. Finally they agreed, and at the meeting arrangements were made for the various questions in the challenge to be asked, so that direct answers could be given from the platform. A few days after the meeting was held, the Publishers of The Theocracy association, which had arranged the meeting, and against which a court case had been in hearing for several months, was dissolved. So now our friends have no legal organization to arrange meetings, which has caused some trouble, of course, and all meetings are now arranged by private individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the food question has been a very severe one, we have been very grateful to have our little farm. It has been a great help to us and we have had the food we have needed to carry on with the Lord’s work. No doubt, the care bestowed upon the crops has had much to do with their successful growth, but it is a noticeable fact that certain vegetables grown on the farm are more than twice the size of those sold on the markets</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The war which broke out at the end of June gave the religionists of Finland the long-desired opportunity to cause practically all of the books and booklets written by you to be banned. We have also been deprived of the right to form any legal association to arrange our meetings, and a large number of our most capable brothers have been incarcerated. Yet, of course, we are doing with our might what our hands find to do, and we are glad and giateful that the severe persecution came when the work m Finland had reached its peak, just as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> had told us to expect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of our enemies are now greatly rejoicing; but we know that their joy will not be long-lived, as we have to expect &quot;the sign” which will mark the time for the complete destruction of all the Devil’s crowd. Then all those faithful and loyal to Jehovah will experience no hindrance m their joyous service and praise to the great TheOCEat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have been able to hold our convention m spite of the war and all the ensuing difficulties. There were 560 friends gathered together at Helsingfors, and, of these, 311 placed approximately 10,000 pieces of literature in the hands of the people. As most of the books and booklets are confiscated, or at least proscribed, the majority of the literature was in the form of magazines</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are at present about 150 of our most able brethren in prison, for terms varying from five months to three years Among them is my son. To give you some idea of the &quot;justice” of these sentences, one brother received five months and another eighteen months for the same &quot;offense”. The reason for the longer sentence was that the brother m question gave his evidence before others of the public, while the one who received the shorter sentence had only the judge and a few court officials to hear him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One brother had received civil work at a hospital. The doctor in charge demanded that the brother should salute him in military fashion. This was, of course, refused, and a court case ensued, resulting in the brother’s receiving a prison sentence of two years and one month. The doctor had no right to demand a military salute, of course, but the real reason for the prosecution was the fact that the brother had been giving a constant witness to all with whom he came m contact, and this had to be stopped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three brethren were sentenced to death and were actually blindfolded before the firing squad. Just as the order to fire was to be given a messenger ran up with a countermanding order. It was stated that it was not intended that the order to fire should be given, but that the whole thing was done to see if the brethren would give way and agree to do military service. If such was the case the action was entirely illegal. The matter is being looked into, but there is little hope these days of obtaining justice in even a slight degree; for behind the judicial powers stand the clergy, and it is their declared intention that Jehovah’s witnesses shall be dealt with in such a way that they will not be able to carry on with their work. They have now succeeded in causing our association to be banned and dissolved, in ta</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font4">g away our literature and in incarcerating the bulk of our most energetic brethren. Yet it has been a great witness to the authorities, and although they have for some time threatened to stop our magazines, by the Lord’s grace we are still able to get them out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The confiscation earned out by the authorities is illegal in every way. They have taken phonograph records, phonographs and magazines to which, according to their own law, they have no right. We protest as much as we are able and use every opportunity to give a witness before the authorities, as Jesus said that for that reason we would be taken before magistrates and the courts. All other public witnessing in Finland has now practically come to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yet we who are still free are working with magazines, Bibles, concoi dances and some of our literature which, despite all persecution, we still have in our possession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Alm</span><span class="font4">ost daily new friends are symbolizing their consecration; and so the work is still going on. We hope and pray that, by the Lord’s grace, we may be permitted to be faithful in this service unto the very end. We are looking forward with interest to see how the Lord will guide the work, knowing that soon the enemy with all his organization will be swept away.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This Protestant country is now under the complete domination of “the king of the north”, and great oppression has been brought upon the Norwegians in his effort to break the spirit of everyone. Jehovah’s servants, however, maintain their integrity and push ahead as opportunity affords to give the witness. Strong censorship is put on all Norwegian correspondence, but reports have trickled through from time to time during the year which show that upward of 380,000 pieces of literature that the brethren have had they were able to distribute throughout the country. Even this report is very incomplete, but it shows that the faithful servants of Almighty God will continue to work. Very little detailed information has been received, and on the surface, so far as the enemy is concerned, the demonized opposers have been able to stop the work; but we know the witnesses will not cease till the work is done and “the sign” appears. As long as Jehovah has His witnesses they will do whatever is possible to justify their acceptance of that name and to vindicate their right to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It appears from the reports that many of the uniformed invaders of the country have been getting to know about The Theocracy. In the raiding of various places they have come upon the phonograph recordings and have run them and thus heard the lectures. Many of these army men, who were forced under the totalitarian mailed fist to do the things they do, have obtained some of the literature, and in a few instances the reading thereof seems to have borne some fruit. The reports expressed the hope that the message of comfort and hope would be carried baek by some honest-hearted men to their home country should they live to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Little does the enemy take into account that persecution and opposition always have had the effect of stirring up the zeal of God’s faithful ones to greater expression. Persecution and opposition have broken down many organizations formed by man, but the unity of spirit which the Lord has established amongst those who serve the Most High God binds his servants more closely together in the bonds of faith and devotion. It is really remarkable to note that the literature reported placed, and which is not a complete report, is just short of the grand total of that reported for the previous year. How much time the brethren have actually spent in the service could not be determined, but it cannot be questioned that even more time has been devoted to the interests of the Kingdom in Norway than in any former year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is gratifying to learn, too, that the sound equipment has been put to excellent use. Baek-calls are numerous, and the people of good-will are comforted and rejoice to learn of the message of the Theocratic Rule of righteousness.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark111"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This is the only country in the Northern European district that continues to operate with a considerable degree of freedom. It is one of the few nations in Europe that as yet have not been forced into the camp of “the king of the north”. The work there has made excellent progress during the past year, finding several hundred more publishers in the field, and which resulted in an excellent distribution of literature. Excerpts from the Branch servant’s report are herewith set out:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is with a feeling of special gratitude to the Lord that the enclosed annual report for Sweden is submitted; for, with practically all of the rest of Europe directly or indirectly involved in war, resulting in most eases in a complete stoppage of the work, we in this country are still enjoying peace, although not the usual peacetime conditions, and are able to carry on almost unhindered with the service the Lord has graciously entrusted to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Publishers and Hours. The golden opportunities of spreading the Kingdom message thus afforded are being used to the best of our ability, and it is a joy to report that many more people have come to understand the meaning of The Theocracy and to see the privilege and importance of supporting it. At the Memorial this year there were 2,325 present, as against 1,718 last year, while the number of those taking part in the work has gone up from 1,740 to 1,901. This latter increase is really greater than appears from the figures, as several of the male publishers have been unable for longer or shorter periods to have an active part in the field work, owing to the activities of the enemy. Nevertheless the average number out each week has increased by 183 to 1,064. Those who have been able to take part in the work have also managed to put in more time, the increase being 58,143 hours, making a total for the year of 388,283 hours. This means an average of 17 hours per month for each publisher. Last year the average was just under 11 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers. The number of pioneers carrying the Theocratic message into the more isolated parts, and also helping the companies in the more crowded areas, has continued to grow in a very satisfactory manner. Two years ago there were not more than 70 pioneers. At the end of last year the number had increased to 132, and now there are 169 on the list, a 28-percent increase over last year. The highest number reporting in any one month was 135, as several have been hindered by the enemy’s activities above referred to. It is also of interest to note that the average number of pioneers out each month has increased by 45 over last year’s average. Just after October 1 a further fourteen will be starting out. These include young, middle-aged and even rather old ones, all desirous of using all their time </span><span class="font4">in furthering the interests of The Theocracy while the opportunity to do so remains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zone Servants and Companies. During the year 10 new companies have been organized for service, and several more are on the point of being thus organized</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the northern part of Sweden particularly the zone servant is frequently confronted with difficulties m getting from place to place. There are instances of journeys where it was necessary to go by foot for two days in order to reach someone interested. Often there are no roads, and rough country has to be covered, or lakes and rivers crossed the best possible. On one occasion the zone servant was out in such a severe snowstorm that, when trying to move from one hut to another only a few yards away, he was blown to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Distribution of Literature. Conditions in Europe generally and in Northern Europe in particular have seriously affected this phase of the work. Before the commencement of the fiscal year the Society’s plant at Berne was unable to supply us with any printed matter, and reprints of books and booklets have had to be made by local commercial firms at a very high cost. For a while, too, mail connections with </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font4">erica, were so poor that literature in English reached us very late and thus caused a long delay in the printing of new items.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For these reasons the figures for books and booklets spread during the year are not as high as those for the previous year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">For booklets the figures are 944,905, to compare with 980,512 for last year. This decrease is also due to the impossibility of getting our stocks replenished during the first part of the year. Bit by bit, however, we have been receiving fresh supplies, including a reprint of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> and the new booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied, Conspiracy</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy.</span><span class="font4"> The two latter are now being distributed together, and just at the time of writing, the last-named booklet is being given to all clergymen as well as to newspaper and magazine editors. The total number of books and booklets spread has reached 1,032,585, and, although 46,587 less than last year, this figure is not unsatisfactory under the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Magazines. The stressing of the magazine work by the Society came at an opportune time this year, when we were short of other literature, and it is reported with much gratitude that 28,372 new subscriptions have been taken, which means 7,036 more than those taken last year. There were also 98,307 more single copies placed than last year, the total having reached 267,068. Street-corner witnessing, which in the greater part of this country can be done only during the spring and summer, owing to weather conditions, was introduced this year, and the friends have been very enthusiastic about it. On one occasion a witness standing on a street corner was accosted by a man who said: “Is that by Rutherford? He is the only real man with a backbone I have ever heard. He can tell the truth.’’ It appeared that the man had been in the United States. Many instances have been related to this office of the joy expressed by interested people at seeing the courage and zeal of the brethren manifested as they share in tins work, and, of course, the work of dividing the people has been more accentuated by our appearance on the streets. A professor from one of the universities expressed his appreciation of this method of witnessing, as it was a very good way, he said, of getting into touch with people who, like himself, never care to listen to callers at the door. He was so impressed by what he was told that he returned to make further inquiries and to take some literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There have been several instances of people renewing their subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> on the streets, and on more than one occasion their subscriptions had expired in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> days! In one place the local Salvation Army captain stated at a meeting, after he had passed some Theocracy publishers on several street corners: “I dislike the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses, but I must say that they are admirably zealous and courageous in standing up for their beliefs. ’ ’ Several other religionists have made remarks to the effect that they envy a movement having workers with such zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign, starting with the introductory booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied,</span><span class="font4"> although carried on for only nine weeks, was responsible for the addition to our lists of 1,000 new direct subscribers for that journal. During the year the total distribution of copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> reached 177,000, while 979,500 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> also were distributed. Last year these totals were 125,200 and 734,500 respectively. The subscription lists at the end of the year show, for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> an increase of 1,514, the total being 6,247; and for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> an increase of 10,444, with a total of 58,154. Thus, when the output of magazines is added to the output of books and booklets, the total for the year shows an increase over the previous year of 51,720 items placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Back-calls and Model Studies. This phase of the work continues to go ahead, and we are anticipating still better results. Back-calls amounted to 97,712, which is 11,560 more than last year. Model studies to the number of 5,601 were arranged, with a total attendance of 20,545.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sound Work. There are 1,200 phonographs available for tins work, and the sound attendance reported is 292,925, which figure is 26,120 less than that for last year. One case is reported where a pioneer sister had opportunity to get into a military camp and play a lecture to a number of soldiers. Some of these got so interested that they fitted the phonograph onto the radio apparatus in the dining hut, and then several lectures went out to more than 600 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During parts of the year two sound-cars have been active in the service of two different companies, but such activity has been very limited by reason of difficulties m connection with motor fuel. Towards the end of the year a new type of sound equipment has been put to use This is fitted to a trailer attached to an ordinary “push” cycle. Two such equipments are now being used, and it is reported that they are very effective. With a favorable wind the lectures have been heard over a distance of five kilometers. Some people, glad to hear the message, have remarked that they thought that the sound was coming from heaven, while others cursed what they called a nuisance. As soon as certain parts, which these days aie difficult to obtain, are available, six more equipments will start out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Public Meetings. Meetings where the Branch servant addressed the public on the subject “Can Religion Save the Woild?” were held last spring in ten different towns, the largest halls available being overcrowded in several cases The total attendance at these meetings was 9,150, and they were widely advertised by means of information marches, folders, posters, newspaper advertisements, signs in the trolley cars, etc., which raised the ire of the enemy and called forth a number of attacks by clergymen and others, in the dailies under headlines such as: “Jehovah’s witnesses—Modern Superstition”; “Jehovah’s witnesses an Anti-Social Movement”; “Judge Rutherford, ‘Jehovah’s Great Field Marshal,’ ” and other attempts at misinformation and ridicule. As usual, these attacks only served to further advertise the Kingdom, and in some cases the lecture itself was directly advertised in that way. For example, at one very large hall a well-known stage and screen personality was to appear immediately after our meeting. A newspaper, in a poor attempt at humor, suggested that its readers should not go too early to the hall to see and hear the “star”, as they might get to hear Jehovah’s witnesses as well. Of course, this was a fine free advertisement. The hall was packed at our meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lately other opponents have seized upon our attitude of strict neutrality as a pretext for suggesting in letters to editors, etc, that our work should be suppressed as being detrimental to the state. So, although not on the war front in the same sense as their brethren in other lands, the supporters of The Theocracy in this country are getting their small share of the peiseeution now to be expected by all who are holding high the banner of the King of Eternity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Annual Convention. It pleased the Lord to have his people in this country gather for their annual convention this year as in previous years, and although traveling has become much more expensive and difficult, the convention was the biggest ever held here. Even on the first night there were about 100 more than attended the largest meeting at the previous year’s convention, when we reached what was then the peak attendance of 750. On the last day of this year’s convention the attendance reached 1,100. The unanimous opinion of all present was that this was the most blessed convention ever held in Sweden, and the unity of spirit and joyful activity evidenced were indeed an inspiration. The common union with our brethren gathered at the same time at St. Louis was strongly felt, especially as, by the Lord’s grace, you had made arrangements to have the new pubheations released at St. Louis sent to us by air mail so that the friends could be told about them and also be informed of some of the proceedings at the convention exactly at the time they took place. This was a source of great joy to the assembled friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of those present 755 took part in the field work. On the Saturday 420 brethren engaged in the street-corner witnessing in all parts of the town. This caused quite a stir, and mention was made of the work in the newspapers. One of the latter, a clerical weekly, referred to the witnesses ‘ ‘ offering a new earth which can be read about in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> for 25 ore”. On the Sunday the witnesses went from door to door, presenting the message in the shape of the two booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy,</span><span class="font4"> which were just then off the press. The total distribution amounted to 9,500 pieces of literature. A baptismal service was held and 119 symbolized their consecration to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zone Assemblies. Twenty of these were arranged during the year, and the total attendance was 2,528. At these assemblies 292 symbolized their determination to serve the great Theocrat. At several of these meetings the street-corner work was introduced for the first time and added greatly to the enthusiasm of those assembled. A practical demonstration of a model study was a part of the program at each of these gatherings, and this was also much appreciated by the friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Food Convenient. In these disturbed days we are especially grateful to the Lord for the fact that we have been able to receive </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> legularly and for the sustenance and nourishing food provided m its pages. Not least of all are we grateful for the timely admonition and warning in the recent article entitled “Noah’s Day”, Now we are eagerly looking forward to studying the promised series on the prophecy of Daniel chapter 11, which it has pleased the Lord to open up at this time, and we are confident that the fact of the revelation of this prophecy certainly points to the near approach of the final battle. We rejoice that soon Michael, the great Prince, will destroy the opponents of The Theocracy, and we are looking forward with keen expectation to the day when we shall be privileged to see Daniel </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font4">self come forth and ‘stand m his lot’ with the other princes to the glory of the great Jehovah, whom they served so faithfully. To thus serve unto the end is also our desire, and we pray that the Lord may grant all his faithful people the courage and strength they need to hold fast and ultimately to see the desire of their hearts.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work in this Commonwealth moved along steadily all through the fiscal year, and the witness was given in the large cities and back in the hills. It is very manifest from the report of these islands that the ultrareligionists have a strong hold upon the Filipinos, but the commission of the Lord’s people is to preach “this gospel of the Kingdom” and give the people the opportunity to hear, and then the responsibility is theirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch servant reports that the Roman Catholic priests, especially of the German nationality, are there in considerable number. It is alleged that the rector of a certain pontifical university of Manila was reported being deported secretly because of his “fifth column” activities, in which the Jesuitized Hierarchy is a past master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Branch servant reports that a representative from the Intelligence Bureau, carrying on his general investigation work, called at the Branch office twice to check on the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses and he found that we are doing a Christian, educational work. This representative of the United States Government was supplied with all literature available for his reference. He was very grateful for the privilege of listening to a considerable number of phonograph recordings of the lectures and expressed appreciation of the co-operation of the Society with his Bureau. He advised the Branch servant that “in case of any misunderstanding from the Commonwealth officials regarding your work, you may just refer the matter to the Bureau”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord, in his goodness, has arranged for the Society to have a new headquarters in the Philippines, and from this point good work has been accomplished. Incidentally, the “evil servant” class continue to do everything within their power to hinder the work of The Theocracy, but those who love God and his Kingdom pay no attention to this great opposition and move ahead with the one thing they are commissioned to do, namely, “comfort all that mourn,” in this time of world distress culminating in Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Society’s Home</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was reported to you last year that, owing to the great increase that the great Theocrat continues to give this Branch, we have deemed it pleasing to the Lord to have a commodious building of our own. By the Lord’s grace, our need has been provided, in the later part of last year. Bethel home is spacious, well-ventilated, away from the dust and noise of the vehicles of the main thoroughfare. Its location, too, is good. The large basement floor serves as a storeroom for the storage of the Kingdom goods. The office and quarters of the Bethel family are on the main floor. The spacious </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sola</span><span class="font4"> is utilized for study and other Theocratic meetings. For this timely provision and its accompanying conveniences and comforts we give thanks to the great Theocrat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord's “Strange Work”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Theocratic work during the year has been a splendid one. The Lord has richly blessed our efforts, particularly with reference to the gathering of the “Jael” class, as shown by the organization of eight more new companies. Others of the ‘ ‘ goodwill” are still in wait for their organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In almost every phase of the “strange work” there has been a gratifying increase. All special testimony periods were blessed. While the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign was splendid, the best yet was the “Theocratic Ambassadors” Testimony Period. In the last week of June the office was forced to stop the company publishers in putting out the campaign literature to give preference to the pioneers. The outcome of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">Campaign would have been still better had we not run short of dialect literature, especially in Hocano and Cebu-Visayan</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">and also self-covered booklets in Tagalog during the three months of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> special period.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In putting the printed spiiitual food in the hands of the famine-stricken in Satan’s pnson-houses, the faithful and courageous publishers have had more interesting and thrilling experiences during the year, a few of which are herein recounted :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Cagayan Valley group of pioneers, in crossing rivers to reach their territories, built bamboo rafts, where they put their Kingdom &quot;ammunitions” and their clothes, and pushed the rafts to reach the other banks of the rivers. In covering the mountains, the people of the wild mountain tribe would meet them menacingly with long bolos or long knives in their hands. But after the brethren had explained their mission they became friendly. There is another tribe of mountain people, short in stature, whose houses are so small and roofed with cogon grass low to the ground that the brethren could hardly enter into them. In some barrios the brethren had to sleep on grasses because the people of those barrios were warned not to admit strangers, due to present critical conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the pioneers covering Davao province reports: &quot;We have decided to cover the vast Japanese abaca plantations first and as quickly as we can, because we take note that Japanese women and children are beginning to leave for Japan because of the impending U.S.-Japanese conflict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Japanese plantations are adjacent to or within Bogobo lands. The Bogobos are a semicivilized pagan tribe generally handsome m figure and given to decorating themselves in attractive colors. Men and women wear long hair, and cheap rings on practically all fingers, and many trinkets above the ankles and above the knees. While the women alone wear bracelets, the male are more elaborate. At important occasions the men decorate their heads with a bead-studded cloth with plumelike horsehairs, twined with their long hair. They wear shell or porcelain earrings as large as saucers that often disfigure their ears. Their short and tight scanty clothes are heavily decorated with close-served beads in cunning designs. Men and women chew buyo nut, which make their teeth unsightly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The Bogobos are a friendly, hospitable people. They are easily taught and are eager to learn—until recently, when religious racketeers poisoned their minds against the truth of God’s Word. In their pagan belief a person has two souls, one in the right arm and one in the left. They worship images, like a decorated bamboo pole, as well as big trees, big boulders, etc. They believe in amtos (demon spirits) and offer or sacrifice to them buyo nuts, grains, eggs, fruits, drinks,—almost anything. They ask favors of the anitos when they are sick. They believe in one supreme god, Bathala (must be Satan). The Bogobos bury their dead sometimes in the sitting position, and, like the demon-worshiping Egyptians of old, bury with them some provisions like money, grams, cooking utensils, etc. A mosquito net is placed over the grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The so-called ‘missionary and Christian-Alliance’ (Congregationalist sect) lead among those who have taken it to themselves to proselyte the Bogobos. As with others, they have misled the Bogobos to believe that by believing (mentally) m Jesus they are actually saved. Those poor deluded ‘converted’ Bogobos sincerely believe they are already saved when actually they are every whit pagans just the same. They gamble as formerly, chew buyo nut and have their holos by their sides, even during their Baal “Protestant’’ worship. At the beginning they were delighted to hear the Kingdom message, especially the blessings that The Theocracy has in store for the people. They eagerly got literature and urged others to do the same. Then the ‘ ‘ Protestant ’ ’ prison-keepers learned that their prisoners were being liberated. They collected the books from their credulous flock and burned them, telling their dupes that those books would destroy their ‘faith’ and that ‘Jehovah’s witnesses are false prophets’. Now the poor “Protestant’’ Bogobos would not get the printed Kingdom message any more even if offered to them free. Thus those modern Pharisees not only have declined to enter the Kingdom, but do also desperately prevent others from entering, in order to be able to continue m their racket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“An intelligent Bogobo told one of us: ‘At the time of collection at the Bogobo congregation, a Bogobo principal of the flock (m clique with the pastor) would get a five-peso bill and secretly write his name thereon. When the pastor calls for donations, then the Bogobo accomplice of the pastor loudly or conspicuously presents his five-peso bill. Other well-to-do Bogobos are embarrassed to give less, and others, because of pride, give more. Even the poor ones are induced to give more than what they actually desired to donate. After the meeting the Bogobo accomplice gets back his five-peso bill which he marked with his name ’ The American Seventh-Day Adventist missioner here, who warns his flock and others against the Watchtower literature and who has been reported to peddle that Judge Rutherford was once a Seventh-Day Adventist but fell away from God’s (Seventh-Day Adventist) organization, does not only extract money from the people m general in what his religion calls ‘harvest’, but attempts to demand from</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Chinese and others other than hrs flock the tithes—ten percent for 'God’s’ [his god’s (2 Cor. 4: 4)] service. One time he approached a sweepstake winner and demanded that ten percent of the man’s prize must go to ‘god’. Who says that religion is not a mean, shameless, God-dishonoiing racket?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A brother in the Baguio City company slept one night in the city jail The people of the various mines go to Baguio City every Sunday for marketing and recreation. The publishers in the City of Pines take advantage of the weekly influx of people by exhibiting the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom publications and otherwise giving testimony at the plaza market. The brother was arrested by a police officer on the charge of ‘‘Public Scandal”. He slept in the night of July 7 and was summoned to the court for tual in the morning of July 8. A zone servant assisted him, as outlined in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Advice for Kingdom Publishers.</span><span class="font4"> After the brother had pleaded not guilty and the judge and the fiscal had read the Motion to Dismiss, the judge said, ‘‘What is your opinion, Fiscal?” The fiscal said, ‘‘I’ll just ask some questions to this patrolman,” and he cross-examined the police officer that put the publisher under arrest. The judge finally decided that there was no real public scandal committed and therefore there was no violation of the city ordinance number 506. The brother was counseled by this office, however, to carefully follow the instructions in the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Advice for Kingdom Publishers</span><span class="font4"> in matters perta</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">inin</span><span class="font4">g to giving testimony, especially in public places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is the common observation of the publishers here that as a rule the English and American white men in the Philippines, especially the executives of some firms, are haughty, arrogant, m fact too wise to this ‘American propaganda’. (Gal. 6: 3) Like other prisoners in Satan’s organization, they often rely on the lying report of their religious leaders, that the Watchtower literature is subversive, etc. Most of them dismiss the Kingdom message by a mere wave of the hand or a shake of the head, sometimes accompanied by the remark, ‘‘I have heard about that” or ‘‘Absolutely not interested”. But there are exceptions to the rule. There are also reasonable persons, not to say of good-will, among the white men here, who understand and appreciate the beneficent mission of the Watchtower Society and of Jehovah’s witnesses. Those readily obtain literature and often press the publishers to accept contributions more than the regular amount received for the books, to whom the publishers give more literature in turn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While serving the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font4"> on the Protestant pastors in his territory, a pioneer met the city pastor of the United Evangelical Church. The pastor brought out some of our books which he obtained before and said he had read them all, but does not agree m many of the points discussed; he was not obtaining any more books, but he willingly contributed for the latest four booklets, including </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy,</span><span class="font4"> which he promised to read carefully. Thinking he was a sincere man and had only been deceived, the brother offered to call back on him with the phonograph and records the next evening, which he accepted. The brother asked the pastor, ‘ ‘ On what point, for instance, do you disagree with the books you obtained from us?” Pastor: ‘ ‘ For example, the ransom. ’ ’ He did not believe in the creation as recorded in Genesis; nor in the fall; consequently not in the ransom either; but he believed (that is what he claimed) in Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Brother Rutherford's Letter of January 8</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your letter of January 8 was mimeographed as soon as received. Copies were provided the publishers, and it greatly encouraged the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazine Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Magazine bags have been made locally by the brethren. They are patterned after the Brooklyn model, only 5e is changed to 10 centavos. Children join in the distribution of magazines in the street. Zone servants took up this matter with the companies and the brethren realized the importance and far-reaching significance of this phase of the Theocratic service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the eve of April 11, the anointed and their companions here assembled to commemorate the sacrifice of the Lord to the vindication of God’s name. It was by far the largest and happiest gathering we have ever had on the same occasion here. The great joy in the hearts of the brethren was reflected in the flush in their faces. They went back to their territories with renewed vigor to wield the “sword of the Spirit” to the undoing of the enemy. Of the 621 that celebrated the Memorial, 16 partook of the emblems of bread and wine, thus showing definitely that the “great multitude” are here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are four in the Bethel family with our two young children, the elder of whom is begi</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">nnin</span><span class="font4">g and always eager to go with us house to house Early in the year we had to call in a pioneer to stay with us in the Bethel home, as it had become impossible for the two of us to cope with the volume of the work. Even with the addition of the brother, who is of great help in the office, especially in filling out and shipping requisitions, still we cannot fully cope with the ever-increasing amount of woik. Soon we will add two more active and zealous workers in the Bethel personnel. This is not by any means a complaint, but only to show that the Lord’s work here is richly blessed. “Bring ye the whole tithe into the store-house, that there may be food in my house, and pi ove me now herewith, saith Jehovah of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.&quot; (Malachi 3: 10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R V.~)</span><span class="font4"> The Bethel family has to woik very early, and late in the evening. In spite of all this, by the grace and power of the Lord, they find time to share in the field work. Their field report is as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Study and Service Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here in Manila, and in different groups of the Lord’s people, regular </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies, book studies and model studies are held. These studies, together with the service meetings, are well and enthusiastically attended. Some brethren have to travel as far as 20 kilometers [12 miles] to attend such meetings. Stormy weather or the flooded streets do not deter them from being present. They are realizing more the importance of such gathering in seeking meekness and righteousness and they are being blessed accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Timely Provisions Received During the Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Jehovah will provide&quot; (Gen. 22: 14, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.,</span><span class="font4"> margin). True to the Word of the great Theocrat, His people have never been in want: in His own due time and own good way He has bountifully supplied their needs. During the year ten new different dialect booklets and three different dialect records were received by this Branch. The booklets are, to wit: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">'Face the Facts, Safety,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font4"> in Tagalog; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Protection, Choosing </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font4"> in Ilocano; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Choosvng</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Fa-cts</span><span class="font4"> in Cebu-Visayan; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Choosing</span><span class="font4"> in Pangasinan, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font4"> in Bicol. The dialect records are m Tagalog, Cebu-Visayan and Hocano. We also received Spanish </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font4"> and the senes &quot;Religion&quot; and ‘ ‘ The End ’ ’. The new English publications received dunng the year are, to wit: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy, Satisfied, Conspiiacy Against Democracy, Judge Rutherford Uncovers Fifth Column, God and the State,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font4"> No 3. We are very grateful for all this abundant supply of Theocratic &quot;ammunitions&quot;. These, especially the English publications, not only have strengthened the faithful soldiers of Christ and their faithful companions themselves by setting squarely before them the development of the great issue for early final determination and their relation thereto, but have also greatly helped them to set before others the same issue and thereby advertise the Theocrat and The Theocracy. Japanese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> and Tagalog </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> were received late in the year. This will further help us comfort all that mourn during the ensuing year, to which we look with greater and stronger hope.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In the face of certain restrictions put on the work in this British colony during the year we find from the year’s report an increase in the work and results. There are now 199 publishers proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom, and these were privileged to place in the hands of the people, to wit, 358 books and 7,627 booklets, making a grand total of 7,985 pieces of literature. This is 1,300 more pieces than last year. The publishers devoted much time to the Kingdom interests, and particularly increased their back-call activity, which shows a fair advance over the work effected in this field the preceding year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Barbados island also operates under the Branch office established at Trinidad, and the report from there is very gratifying also. During the year 54 publishers were in the field. These brethren put out 9,519 pieces of literature, also pressing forward with the phonograph and recorded speech and improving on their back-call efforts over all previous times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Grenada, in the British West Indies, reports 11 publishers as having placed 641 publications. The general report shows a steady increase, by the Lord’s grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At St. Vincent island a distribution of 435 pieces of literature was made by two publishers during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All together, every means is taken to see that the people in the British West Indies are given the blessed opportunity of hearing the truth in these urgent times immediately preceding the “battle of that great day of God Almighty”. The report from the Branch servant concerning the conditions as they appear is briefly set out herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I am glad to report that during another year the brethren in these parts have been rejoicing in Jehovah’s service. The difficulties grow, but with Armageddon so near they are being advised to redouble their efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In line with St Louis, a convention was held at the island of Barbados August 10. The brethren here in Trinidad also met in a well-attended and enthusiastic convention the same day. At it, a local booklet entitled “The Strait of Jehovah’s witnesses in Trinidad’’ was released. It contains—Report of a public meeting protesting against the government ban on our literature—Correspondence with the government growing out of it—with an introduction. It has been well received and has been refreshing to the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As you were advised at the time, the persecution m this island reached the point that two of the brethren were imprisoned for being found m possession of some of the literature. This brought about the public meeting above referred to. It was largely attended and passed resolution which has been forwarded to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, London Some eartons of supplies held up for 18 months have been since delivered to us. On the whole, we are doing what can be done.

In the island of St Vincent, only </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font4"> In the island of Barbados, nothing at all; the brethren there are working with the remnant of stock remaining. Work is also being done at Grenada, Montserrat, Tobago. Nothing is allowed to go in to Dominica.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren at Barbados were warned by an official to take back all literature from the publishers and to nail up all the stock until after the war. We set on and put out, in three weeks from April 10, more than is usually distributed in that island during six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sample copies even of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children, Comfort All That Mown,</span><span class="font4"> or of the article on Darnel 11, have not been allowed to reach us. Doubtless we will see them later.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">From the foregoing it clearly appears that Jehovah’s purpose moves steadily forward to its full accomplishment (Ex. 9:16), and that therefore His work goes on under conditions and in a manner that make it indeed a “strange work” to all the enemies of The Theocracy. Hence these are filled with dismay, and in every land they strive desperately to stop completely the proclamation and spread of the Kingdom message and the ingathering of the Lord’s “other sheep” into the one fold. As in the case of Sisera’s mother at the window impatiently and anxiously expecting a victorious return of her warrior son from the battle of Megiddo, so likewise the religious leaders expected complete victory over Jehovah’s witnesses and the division of the spoils before 1940 and a complete cleanup of everything in their favor in 1940. On the contrary, in 1941 the witness of and concern-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ing Jehovah's Theocratic Government was carried on to a greater or less extent in practically every country of the earth where the Most High God has stationed his witnesses, and the Kingdom publications distributed were published in 88 languages. Now after the passing of that fiscal year His “strange work” is still going on although the spreading conflict between “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” is cutting off more and more lands and is making it increasingly difficult to operate. However, in all the lands, including those under governmental restrictions, the spirit of Jehovah’s devoted ones is to go forward, carrying on in the way of witnessing that the Lord still holds open in order to feed his “other sheep”, and looking forward to even increasing their accomplishments in the field over those of the year past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hence it is with joy in the Lord and with unspeakable gratitude to him to whom all credit and glory are due that we may announce this, to wit: According to the reports partial or complete from all the countries as listed in this </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font5"> there was a placement of 36,030,595 books and booklets containing the Theocratic message, and which is the largest distribution of that message yet accomplished in any single year since the days of the apostles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In view of the world conditions that rapidly grow worse the above result would normally be contrary to what might be expected; but all things are possible to Almighty God, who is working in his faithful servants “both to will and to do of his good pleasure”. Therefore this marvelous placement of Kingdom literature bespeaks that by his help Jehovah’s covenantkeeping people are surmounting the obstacles and demon opposition and are ‘putting on more steam’, because now the time is short and it is desired to turn in to the King a faithful report, showing increase of the Lord’s Kingdom interests, or “goods”. This stacks up still higher the pile of stones of testimony which have been piled in the midst of the antitypical Jordan river as Jehovah’s people, under the leadership of the Greater Joshua, Christ Jesus, pass through the midst of the people that are rushing down the broad way that ends in the Dead Sea of destruction at Armageddon. Up until October 1, 1940, the distribution of books and booklets amongst these people had totaled 337,749,320 copies. Now, by adding to this the above figure for the year just completed, the grand total of such bound literature placed in the past 22 years increases to 373,779,915 copies. “Praise ye Jehovah!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">None of those who will maintain their integrity will now hesitate or show indifference toward the Kingdom. They will follow the example of “the Sun of righteousness” and will in this hour of gross darkness upon the world let their light shine concerning The Theocratic Government and will let that light be so used as to make manifest the hidden things of darkness and to enlighten, those who desire to be comforted from the “God of all comfort”. Nothing now shall stop them. They will come forth as willing volunteers for The Theocracy and will boldly let their light shine as does the sun, giving their all in complete, loving devotion to the Most High and his King: “And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever.” (Dan. 12:3) All who love him shall sing his praises now, regardless of violent opposition leveled against them. “Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.”—Ps. 148: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whether it will be possible to complete another service year and to publish the customary annual report thereon is a matter that rests with the Lord and which the faithful do not stop work to consider. The one who has had the great privilege of preparing these annual reports, seeing his inability to go on, hands over this blessed work to another, and may that beloved one who takes it over, by God’s grace, see the abundant blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Necessarily a report cannot be made fully by one person, but since my very severe illness during the past few months Fred Franz has been looking after the details of the report for me. We have both worked on it some. He has done the greater portion, and again we both rejoice very greatly to have some part in filling np that which is left behind. Blessed is our privilege, and we give thanks to Jehovah our God, and the president officially affixes his signature to this report, and at his request Brother Franz affixes his signature also as an associate worker.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Agreeable to the Charter and By-Laws, and notice published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> the annual meeting of the Pennsylvania corporation, one of the publishers for Jehovah’s witnesses, was held at the usual time and place, as will appear from the minutes of that meeting, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Minutes of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Annual Meeting</span><span class="font5"> of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, </span><span class="font5">Pennsylvania Corporation, held at Pittsburgh N.S., Pa.,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">September 29, 1941 </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, </span><span class="font5">Annual Meeting at Pittsburgh, October 1,1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dear Brethren:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Again it becomes necessary to hold a meeting of this Corporation for the purpose of transacting business required by the terms of the charter. I am unable to be personally present, but others there will take care of what is to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Please have in </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font5">d that </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s</span><span class="font5"> people are engaged </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font5"> the most blessed service in which men have ever on this earth had the opportunity to engage. We have seen the witness work, the “strange work” of </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font5"> progressing throughout the earth, and now we see it rapidly drawing to a close. In many of the countries the powers of Satan’s organization have made it exceedingly difficult for </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s</span><span class="font5"> witnesses to be active, and without a doubt </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah </span><span class="font5">has permitted this for His own good purposes. Now the work is confined to the United States and a few outstanding countries. This condition should not at all be discouraging to any who loves </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah</span><span class="font5"> and his great government, but, on the contrary, is further corroborative evidence that the day draws very near when the battle of that great day of God Almighty will be fought, and the earth will be rid of Satan’s wicked organization and those who survive will go forward with great joy to perform the duties conferred upon them by The </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Be of good courage, therefore. Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might, and push on with greater zeal than ever heretofore exhibited, because the time is short m which to do this work. Those who love </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah</span><span class="font5"> now are entirely devoted to the great </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocracy,</span><span class="font5"> the government and kingdom of </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah God</span><span class="font5"> by Christ Jesus. It is not only our privilege, but great joy, to be representatives of that righteous government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Be assured of my continued love for each and every one of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Your brother and servant by His grace, [Signed] J. F. </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rutherford, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">President</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(Copy of Telegram)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">October 1, 1941 Judge J. F. Rutherford, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Grateful for your encouraging letter. We are with you in Theocratic service to </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s</span><span class="font5"> praise. We are thrilled with the forward march of </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Theocracy,</span><span class="font5"> and thank God for our privileges of service and that we are one with the loyal supporters of the Theocratic Government of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Almighty God</span><span class="font5"> throughout the earth. Be assured of our deep love to you our fellow servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s witnesses’ Annual Meeting </span><span class="font5">[of </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.] </span><span class="font5">Pittsburgh, Pa.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>NEW OFFICERS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">The invisible Theocratic Head of the Society, to wit, Christ Jesus, stated the divine rule, “Render therefore unto Caasar the things which are Caesar’s, and unto God the things that are God’s.” (Matthew 22:21) The two corporations, </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society,</span><span class="font5"> of Pennsylvania, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Incorporated, </span><span class="font5">of New York, were organized as heretofore stated, in conformance with the proper laws of “Caesar”. Promptly, and in compliance with the charters and by-laws of the above two legal corporations, the directors thereof were notified of the passing of Brother J. F. Rutherford as president, January 8, 1942, and were instructed to convene in joint session on January 13 to act with reference to the vacancy thereby created, in the interim to prayerfully study and consider whom the great </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocrat, Jehovah,</span><span class="font5"> indicated to be the one qualified and pleasing to Him to succeed to the presidency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At 12: 45 p.m. of the day appointed the complete membership of the boards of directors of both corporations met jointly in the reception room of the administrative building, at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, N. Y. First earnest prayer being offered that the divine will be done, they proceeded with the election. After a thorough discussion of the issues involved, and of the Theocratic proprieties, and of all factors bearing on the decision to be reached, the joint boards unanimously elected Nathan H. Knorr as president of both corporations. This leaving a vacancy in the office of vice-president, and Brother Knorr waiving his privilege according to the by-laws of personally appointing the vicepresident, the directors thereupon in full unanimity elected Hayden C. Covington as vice-president of the two corporations.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark121"></a><span class="font8">Yeartext for 1942</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Blameless in the day of our Lord&quot;—1 Cor. 1:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">'“THE words of the above text were written specifically for the benefit of the faithful remnant of the members of the body of Christ, “the feet of him,” who should be living at the time designated. For long the faithful Christians waited “for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ”. (Vs. 7) The great “day of Jehovah” began in A.D. 1914, when he set his Beloved One, Christ Jesus, upon his throne and sent him forth to rule in the midst of his enemies, including both “the king of the north” and “the king of the south”. “Both these kings,” under demon influence, became angry and engaged in the first world war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The way having been prepared before the Lord, then Jehovah’s “Messenger of the Covenant”, the Lord Jesus, straightway came to his temple, in 1918, and with that event the “day of our Lord Jesus Christ” began. There also the judgment began at the house of God. (1 Pet. 4:17) The approved remnant the Lord anointed, and commissioned them and sent them forth to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah and to his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font6">By the proclamation of the Kingdom message all nations are gathered before Jehovah’s Judge on his throne, and the Lord Jesus judges them and separates them as sheep from the goats. He 230 puts the “sheep” on his right hand and makes them the earthly companions of the faithful remnant, and graciously invites them to participate with the remnant in declaring Jehovah’s name throughout the earth and the establishment of his Righteous Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the faithful performance of this commission and obligation the remnant and their companions now are “hated of all nations for [his] name’s sake”. Now as this year 1942 opens “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” are again engaged in a desperate conflict for wobld domination. The world domination belongs to Jehovah’s anointed King, Christ Jesus. The end of Satan’s uninterrupted rule came in 1914, and now the final end of demon rule is at hand. The time for the final showdown is very near. Now the demons are making their last vicious assault upon their real target, to wit, the faithful remnant and their devoted companions, to break up their unity and to make them fail to keep their covenant obligations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The faithful servants of Jehovah must maintain their integrity unto the final end, as shown in the prophetic drama concerning Job. “Integrity” means “innocence, being without fault, blamelessness”, and this they will continue to maintain, even unto the death if necessary, by the Lord’s grace. If they thus put their trust wholly in Jehovah, and hold fast their unswerving devotion to The Theocbacy and continue to faithfully represent it on earth, the Lord will fulfill the apostle’s prayer to confirm such unto the end, that they may be thus blameless in this present day of our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Therefore the daily texts and comments which follow have been arranged in order that each day the active servants of The Theocracy may feed upon a portion from the Lord’s table to aid them and strengthen them to keep their affections fixed on The Theocracy and to hold firmly their integrity and so be found blameless unto the end, for the vindication of Jehovah’s name by his grace through Christ Jesus.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">They that understand among the people shall instruct many.—Dan. 11:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s faithful witnesses have become instructors of many by visiting them at their homes and by holding study meetings and aiding them in studying God’s Word. Such has been and is a tremendous witness work, carried on in divers ways, to wit, by use of books, booklets, magazines, radio, phonographs, and by traveling from place to place and from house to house, speaking to those willing to hear. They have met with many who have had a hearing ear, and these the witnesses have instructed in the way of the Scriptures. Their journey and work as Jehovah’s servants are along the rough and rugged way, viewed from the human viewpoint, but always the way of joy of heart to those who willingly engage in the field witness work. It is not expected it would be easy on the human organism ; it has not been. It has been too hard for some. Therefore says the prophecy: “Yet they shall fall.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In all this did not Job sin with his lips.—Job 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the Theocratic Government that is of paramount importance. Therefore the prophetic drama of Job includes the Head and body members of that government ; also the faithful men of old who will be the earthly representatives of that government and rule amongst men, filling the places of visible governors; and also those who receive the divine commission from Jehovah and who act under that government to carry out that divine mandate to fill the earth. The severe test to which Job was subjected foretold the test to which the members of The Theocracy are put; and a like test is put upon every one who holds an official position under that righteous government. Each and every one under the test must hold fast his integrity in order to receive the approval of the Lord Jesus Christ the King and of Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/41</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">But thou, Lord, art most high for evermore. For, lo, thine enemies, 0 Lord, . . . shall perish.—Ps. 92:8,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah will vindicate his name by destroying all those who work against his government under Christ Jesus. It is Satan, that wicked one, operating his religious-totalitarian conspiracy against The Theocracy that is now desperately fighting against Jehovah’s kingdom. There is no compromise and no possibility of peace between God and the wicked. Today the Vatican officials, together with the dictators, are moving with all their power to destroy everything in the earth that will not submit to the devilish rule. All this is in defiance of Almighty God and a reproach upon his name. Jehovah’s name must be vindicated. It shall be vindicated ! The only possible way to bring about the vindication of Jehovah’s name is the complete destruction of the wicked, every part of Satan’s organization. At the battle of that great day of God Almighty all the wicked shall be destroyed. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/41</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 4</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">My son, forget not my law; hut let thine heart keep my commandments.—Prov. 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The true followers of Christ Jesus are begotten or accepted by Jehovah and acknowledged by him as his children or sons, and these must be obedient to Jehovah God their Father if they would receive life everlasting. These become new creatures in Christ Jesus, who is the Head of the new creation or spiritual Israelites : “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” (2 Cor. 5:17) Having received the spirit of God, these are led by his spirit and are his sons. (Rom. 8:14-16) As children they must be obedient to his commandments; they could not live otherwise. Such are and must be witnesses to Jehovah and bear testimony to his name and to his kingdom, and hence they are called by the Lord Jehovah “My witnesses”.—Isa. 43:10-12. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/41</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord hath sworn in truth unto David, he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.—Ps. 132:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s Word makes it impossible for the faithful servant to doubt the establishment and complete domination of The Theocracy. Not only has Jehovah given his unchangeable word, but he has confirmed his word by his oath that he will build up his capital organization Zion with his beloved One, Christ Jesus, as the Head thereof, upon the throne of the organization, and that his good and righteous government shall rule the world in righteousness and that rule shall never end. King David stood as the representative of Christ Jesus, and the words above are the response of Jehovah to David’s prayer; which words He binds with his oath, thus making doubly sure that He will bring forth his government, The Theocracy, to complete victory and glory. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/41</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 6</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Then Joel, Heber’s wife, took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples.—Judg. 4:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not sufficient for one to say, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> am a Christian; I love the Lord’’; but in judging himself one must ask </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">hims</span><span class="font5">elf: &quot;Am I proving my faith and devotion by joyfully and enthusiastically obeying the commandments of Jehovah and his King ? Am I giving my entire and undivided devotion to The Theocracy? If I am not wholly and entirely for The Theocracy I am against The Theocracy.” One cannot be negligent or indifferent to God’s commandments concerning The Theocratic Government and expect to receive God’s approval. Jael was put to the test, and she without hesitation put herself entirely on the side of Jehovah and his typical covenant people, who there remained faithful to God. Jael pictured a faithful, obedient class who shall receive the everlasting blessings of Jehovah and his King. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/41</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God spared not . . . the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world.—2 Pet. 2:4,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah set Noah before men as an example for those to follow who have faith in God and in his kingdom and who would be faithful. When God puts his approval upon a man, others who come afterwards do well to give consideration as to why God marks that man with approval. God never changes, and when he approves one man we may be sure that his approval will be placed upon other men who likewise do well before him. God is no respecter of persons. What is required of one to merit God’s approval he likewise requires of all others who receive his approval. The Scriptures disclose the reason why God approved Noah. He was just, was blameless in his conduct, maintained his integrity, was a man of faith, and was faithful under the test, being obedient to God.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy.—Deut. 7:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah, the Almighty God, has announced his purpose concerning man and has caused that announced purpose to be recorded in the Bible, which is His Word. Jehovah’s expressed purpose concerning man constitutes or is God’s covenant concerning mam A “covenant” is a binding promise, or a declaration of purpose, to do or not to do a certain thing. When God makes a covenant he binds himself to keep it faithfully. Nothing any creature can do would hinder God in carrying out his announced purpose. Every expressed purpose of Jehovah concerning man is a covenant which Almighty God performs in his own due time. If God takes a man into covenant with him, that is called a two-sided or bilateral covenant. The obligation rests upon both parties to the covenant to carry that covenant into complete operation according to its terms. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/41</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">January 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live.—Deut. 30:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such, is the statement of the divine rule, from which Jehovah never deviates, and everyone who believes God can rely upon that rule. Jehovah does not arbitrarily compel any man to take a specific course. God made man a free creature with the privilege of choosing to obey the great Creator or to take an opposite course. That rule applied to Adam, the first man. It is the fixed rule of Jehovah, and he never changes. Jehovah’s purpose is to give men a full and fair opportunity to gain life by choosing the same or to choose the very opposite of life, which is extinction. Knowledge is required to make the choice, and God affords every opportunity for man to gain such knowledge. Jehovah furnishes the opportunity to man to know which is the right way. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Arise, shine; for thy light is come, ana the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.—Isa. 60:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah gives this command to his covenant people when his time arrives for them to go into action. The commandments of the Most High cannot be ignored or side-stepped. To receive his approval every creature who has made a solemn covenant to do His will must act, not with sullenness or stubbornness, but with a burning zeal and genuine joy. Such a one has a heart full of gratitude which leads to unselfish devotion and zeal for the Lord. With Jehovah there is a fixed time for everything. When that time arrives it is the duty and privilege of his covenant people to quickly respond to his commandments. In the hour of gross darkness upon Satan’s organization and all people under it the great Vindicator of Jehovah appears and makes himself manifest to his faithful servants, and his glory and power are seen to be on those who faithfully follow his lead.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah inspired his prophet to tell of a vision of Armageddon which he had, and which prophetic utterance is about due for fulfillment. The prophecy discloses what will be the result of Jehovah’s “strange act” upon the earth. There can be no doubt that Jehovah will do exactly as his words announce by the prophet, because “Jehovah hath spoken this word”. His word cannot return to him void, but shall accomplish his announced purpose. (Isa. 55:11; 46:11) But who on earth now believes what He has announced ? Only those who have taken their stand firmly on the side of The Theocracy and who joyfully support that kingdom. To them Jehovah has given full assurance, for their comfort and hope.

If the people now on earth who are of good-will toward God would find the way to life everlasting they must be led by the true guide, which is God’s Word. The will of Almighty God expressed to his creatures is his Word and constitutes the true guide, which directs mankind into the way of life everlasting. Jehovah sent Jesus to the earth to proclaim His expressed will, and this he did for the purpose of guiding men in the right way. The message which Jesus declared was and is not his own, but is that which proceeds from the mouth of Almighty God. Jesus said: “The Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say.”—John 12:49. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.—Prov. 15:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has made plain his purpose to permit men to choose the way of life or choose the way of death. God placed before Adam the way of life and the way of death. God informed man that he must obey if he would live, but if he should choose to disobey he must die. Had Adam always looked to God and obeyed his law he would not have died. Adam chose the opposite course, with the result that he died and all others of humankind came under condemnation by inheritance. In due time all the race must die. All do die and remain dead except those who choose the way of life and conform to the rules God has laid down, pointing out the course they must take. To escape death, described as <sup>&lt;c</sup>hell”, which is the grave, they must look above. That means they must look to Jehovah for guidance in the way of life if they would become wise in God’s way. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures are provided by the Lord for his covenant people that they may be fully equipped for every good work. One who neglects to study the Scriptures and to be guided by the advice and admonition there given cannot have the Lord’s approval. We must study his Word and do his works, that we may receive his approval. Study classes and service meetings are regularly held amongst God’s people for the purpose of enabling them to keep in mind the proper things and their mind fixed upon the righteous things of the Lord. Every one of God’s covenant people should attend such meetings when it is reasonably possible and take an active part in them. One who is negligent and not attending such study classes is failing to seek righteousness and meekness, which the Lord requires of all he approves. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s words are not altered and are heard with compelling force now by every one who has given his devotion to The Theocratic Government. Today the obligation is laid upon every parent who is in a covenant to do Jehovah’s will to bring his children into the congregation, that they may learn the Lord’s words and see their privilege of serving The Theocratic Government. The parents that serve Jehovah and love their children will be diligent to- instruct them in the way of righteousness, that they may serve the Lord and live. Parents who neglect this divine obligation disclose thereby that they have not a proper appreciation of their relationship to God nor of their obligation to the children they brought into the world.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s covenant cannot be altered or hindered. His covenant here named is his unbreakable word that his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, his Beloved One, shall be established and rule the world in righteousness. The Theocratic Government is of greatest importance, because by it Jehovah’s name shall be vindicated; the completion and operation of that Theocracy is about to be revealed to all creation, and now the demons have mustered all their force and power to resist The Theocracy that they might continue to rule the world in wickedness. The controversy is that all the demons are against The Theocracy, and this controversy will be settled finally at Armageddon. Individual salvation, while important to creatures, is of small importance when compared with The Theocratic Government. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Men who have pledged themselves to serve Jehovah God have divided themselves into two classes: some have departed from that covenant, while others have been faithful. The failure of some, in turning away from their covenant, has in no wise altered His announced purpose. Having purposed it, he will do it. There cannot be the slightest doubt about the result in the mind of one who loves Jehovah, and for the comfort and assurance of his faithful servants Jehovah supports his word by his unbreakable oath. From Abel to the last of God’s holy prophets there were faithful men on the earth who not only believed in The Theocracy but staked their all on it and gladly suffered martyrdom rather than to yield to the enemy’s power, and thus they maintained integrity to God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/41</span></p>

The destiny for such is life everlasting in peace, joy and glory forever in the presence of the Most High. That “blessed nation” is the nation of which Christ Jesus is the Head, and including all who are made members of God’s capital organization under Christ. Now God’s time has come when he, by Christ Jesus, is gathering to himself his “other sheep”. These should be enlightened concerning what is required of all who undertake to be servants of God and Christ. What God has caused to be written in his Word of and concerning others that have gone before serves to furnish a guide to those who are now seeking the way of faithful service and everlasting life.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Man is given the choice of believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, if he would live and not perish. It follows, therefore, if he does not believe he will perish. Man was already subject to death by reason of inheriting the result of Adam’s violation of God’s law, and now Jehovah was giving man an opportunity to choose to extricate himself from death by taking the side of the Lord Jesus Christ. If a man does not choose to take that step, then what? “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” (Vs. 36) This is in harmony with the statement of the divine rule announced by Moses, in which Jehovah set before the Israelites life or death and permitted them to choose their way.—Deut. 30:19.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Arise, Barak.—Judg. 5:11,12, Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Four times the word “awake” is uttered. It was a call from Jehovah to his servants then to awake and stir themselves unto active service and praise of His name. It was a fourfold call to awake, hence a full and complete call. The prophecy here foretells the call of Jehovah to his organization on earth (“Deborah”) at the coming of Christ Jesus (“Barak”) to awake and arise to activity and to advertise his name and his kingdom. This he does just preceding the time when he exercises his supreme power against Satan and his entire organization. Those of Jehovah’s organization must obey his commandment to immediately and actively participate in declaring the name of Jehovah in singing his praises, and declaring his judgment already written against those who are opposed to him and to his kingdom.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I delight to do thy will, 0 my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.—Ps. 40:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because of his full and complete obedience unto his Father under the most trying conditions Jesus was given life immortal, the highest place in the universe next to Jehovah, and the administration of Jehovah’s will. (Phil. 2: 8-11) Because of his complete obedience Christ Jesus is made the Author of eternal salvation to all that obey him. (Heb. 5: 8, 9) It is of the greatest importance to know these facts, if one would live. All humankind were born in sin because of the sin committed by Adam, and therefore all of his children inherited death. God has provided redemption and salvation of men from death by and through the sacrifice of the man Jesus unto death. God therefore provides the gift of life to all men who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as the Savior and who then covenant to be obedient to the laws of God and hence obedient to Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah beholds the righteous in distress, hears their cry for help, and delivers them. He deals exactly in an opposite manner with the wicked, and the memory of them shall perish from the earth. As all are born in sin by reason of the disobedience of the first man, a man becomes righteous only by faith in Jehovah and in Christ Jesus’ shed blood as his redemptive price, and by full consecration and obedience to God and Christ. Before man can be made righteous he must show his faith in God and in Christ Jesus by willingly making a covenant to do the will of the Most High, and then he must maintain his righteousness which he has received through Christ Jesus by faithfully performing the terms of that covenant. He must be entirely for Jehovah and his kingdom and not compromise with the enemy. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Perfect” is defined by the best Biblical authorities as “blameless, sound, sincere, undefiled and upright, one of integrity and a bearer of the truth”. Noah was a man of faith, and he was faithfully obedient to God. He ascertained God’s commandment and rendered himself in obedience thereto. It follows, therefore, that every other who may expect and hope to receive God’s approval must be just, sincere, pure in thought and action, a bearer of the truth, and one who maintains his integrity toward God. He must have faith in God and be faithfully obedient to God’s will or commandment. Noah was a “preacher of righteousness” at a time when the earth was filled with violence. Undoubtedly he maintained his integrity toward God under great adversity and shunned not to declare the truth under all circumstances, which truth he received from God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">His secret is with the righteous.—Prov, 3:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The purpose of Jehovah is a secret to sinful men, Since each announced purpose of Jehovah is a secret, his covenant is a secret to all against The Theocracy. What, then, is required of man before he can be taken into covenant with Jehovah? He must fear God. He must have knowledge that the Almighty God is Jehovah, the Creator, the Fountain of fife, and the only Giver of life everlasting. He then recognizes Jehovah as the all-powerful One who is just and righteous and entirely unselfish. Believing that all blessings flow from Almighty God, the creature man fears to take any course that would cause him to miss the blessings God gives. He believes that disobedience to God would cause him to lose God’s favor, and fears lest he might not receive God’s favor. He desires to be taught of God, that he may go in the right way. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/41</span></p>

It was that close-girdling sin, religion, concerning which the apostle wrote to those who had made a covenant to be faithful servants and witnesses of Jehovah: 'Let us lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily besets us? God’s people today have all the wealth of his revealed Word and the record of faithful men who have gone before and who proved their integrity toward God, together now with an abundance of physical facts which have come to pass in fulfillment of God’s prophecies, to uphold and strengthen them and to fully fortify them against all opposition and violence heaped upon them by the enemies of The Theocracy.

Such fearful and negligent ones will not receive any protection and blessing from the Lord. The faithful and obedient ones, who do not fear men but who fear God and joyfully obey his commandments, will receive protection and blessings from the Lord Jehovah and his King. The faithful “remnant” and their true “companions”, the Lord’s “other sheep”, now read the prophecies and their explanations which God has provided, and, so doing, they rejoice that the evidence is clear that the day of deliverance from oppression is near at hand and the day of vindication of Jehovah’s name will be the result.

<p><span class="font5">The person who desires God’s approval must be guided aright. The Bible, which contains God’s Word, is true and is the correct guide: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” (Ps. 119:105) The Bible guides sincere persons to desire and pray for the most important things that may result to their welfare. God has put such prayers into the mouth of his sincere servants, and one of these prayers is this: “Shew me thy ways, 0 Lord; teach me thy paths. Lead me in thy truth, and teach me.” (Ps. 25:4, 5) The sure and unfailing promises of God to such sincere seekers for truth are certain, and God will fulfill those promises. He who would be wise in things that are right seeks pure knowledge, such as is contained in the Bible: “Wise men lay up knowledge.” —Prov. 10:14.

<p><span class="font5">A man may be ignorantly against The Theocracy and the King thereof, but when he is enlightened he must quickly turn about and take the right course, and, doing so, he will be forgiven. When a man learns of Jehovah and his gracious goodness manifested through Christ Jesus and then treats that great truth with indifference or with willfulness, his wrong course is not forgivable. He thus sins against light or against the holy spirit, which is light. The blood of Christ Jesus is the price that purchased mankind, and is not a common thing. Therefore when a man sees and understands that his hope of life is by faith and obedience unto Jehovah God and Christ and he then spurns or disregards that favor, the wrath of God remains upon him and his end is with all others of the wicked class.

They knew Noah was building the great boat, which was a testimony of his faith in God, but the people who saw it regarded it as of no importance. Noah’s work and testimony were so important in the carrying out of Jehovah’s purposes that God used him to foretell what must come to pass at the time of setting up the Kingdom. The ark which Noah built at Jehovah’s command pictured the organization built by the Most High through Christ Jesus and which is God’s capital organization with Christ Jesus as the Head thereof. Carrying the eight persons over the flood pictured the survivors of Armageddon that God will carry over to the new world. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Who will hear, give heed, understand, and choose the way of life ? Jehovah’s answer is: “The wise shall understand.” God’s Word shows that there are two classes now on the earth: (1) those who will be wise and shall find the way to righteousness and life; and (2) the other class, which continues in wickedness, darkness and religion, and remains under condemnation and suffers eternal death. The present is “the time of the end”, that is, the end of Satan’s uninterrupted rule. Such is the due time for those who are wise to understand Jehovah’s purpose and take the course that leads to life everlasting. Now is the due time when those who shall form the “great multitude” must hear and choose wisely, and will understand.

That government is the great Theocracy, by which Christ Jesus exercises a paternal care over the interests of the people that shall live on the earth. He is the King and the Father of them that obey him, and they, as his children, will address Christ Jesus as “Father”. Jehovah God is the King of Eternity, and the fountain of life. None can get life contrary to his will. Jehovah has delegated to his beloved Son, the King, full authority to administer life to those who shall receive life everlasting. In these latter days the Most High has made this fact clear to those who have fled to the Lord and found refuge. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/11</span></p>

Job held fast his integrity, and therefore was blameless before God. Was he blameless because he was perfect in organism and had the right to life ? No; he was the offspring of Adam and hence under condemnation. His integrity, or blamelessness, consisted in the fact that he refused to be moved from his steadfast devotion to God and his coming Kingdom by the Messiah. Job would suffer all things rather than be unfaithful to The Theocracy. Job's integrity foretells that those whom he pictured must be immovably devoted to the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, and that regardless of what the enemy is permitted to inflict upon them. They must remain faithful, true and wholly devoted thereto. In no other way could they be blameless before God. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/11</span></p>

His law is the same toward all who seek to live. Children seek knowledge and must be taught, and it is the desire of all sane persons, both adults and children, to receive life everlasting. Obligation is laid by the Lord upon consecrated parents to see to it that their children are instructed in God’s law. They cannot disregard this obligation and expect his favor. It is also the duty of the parents to have their children in subjection and carefully guide them in the way of righteousness. All parents who have agreed to do God’s will are bound by the commandments of Almighty God to teach their children the Word of God and to instruct them in the way of righteousness.—Deut. 4:9; 6:6, 7. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In vision John saw the Holy City, which is The Theocracy, coming down from God out of heaven to rule in righteousness. It is that Theocracy by Christ Jesus that will carry out God’s purpose to wipe out wickedness and bring joy and everlasting peace to those that live. It is in that Theocracy, Zion, where God shall dwell. Every human creature that lives everlastingly must be wholly and completely devoted to Almighty God and to his beloved Son, Christ Jesus. This is the covenant that Jehovah God remembers for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations, which covenant he made with Abraham and swore to the antitypical Isaae, Christ Jesus, that in his Seed, The Christ, blessings shall come to those who obey.—Ps. 105: 7-9.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Let none that wait on thee be ashamed.—Ps. 25:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">David had waited patiently for Jehovah to manifest himself and to deliver David from his enemies. In his own due time Jehovah did deliver David. To wait patiently means to fully trust in God and confidently move forward in performance of assigned duty, well knowing that one is on the right way and backed up by the King of Eternity. Such ones never try to run ahead of Jehovah, but follow explicitly the instructions given. One who is patient is anxious in his mind, watching with great care that he may not miss an opportunity to honor Almighty God. Patience, therefore, means a trial of faith and a refusal to be turned aside from steadfast devotion to God, regardless of what persecution the enemy may bring. When Jehovah’s due time arrives for him to avenge his servants he will do so, his primary purpose being to vindicate his holy name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">God led the Israelites out of Egypt by the hand of Moses. In this he was giving them an experimental education that they might freely choose either the way of life or the way of death. God made prophetic pictures with those choosing, by which he emphasized the divine rule that men are free to choose the way of life or the way of death. In due time he sent his beloved Son to earth to declare the truth and to make known to man the only means of receiving life everlasting. No man, however, was then compelled to accept Jehovah’s appointed way, but the same was offered to him freely. When a man makes an intelligent choice to enter into a covenant with Jehovah God, thereby agreeing to do His will, he then enters upon the way of life. He must meet the requirements of God’s law to receive the blessings of life eternal. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord rebuke thee, 0 Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the<sup>1</sup> fire?—Zech. 3:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the temple judgment Satan was there to look after his religionists, whom he had subtly trapped by means of deceit and the practice of formalism and other religious ceremonies. The faithful ones standing there with the Lord are as brands plucked from the fire’. What fire? The destructive fire of demonism or religion. Some who had covenanted to do God’s will had withstood that destructive influence and power even though they were mixed up with and identified as religionists. Their “garments” are symbols of identification, and the soils on their garments pictured the religion or demon influence. At the temple judgment the rejected ones were unwilling to divest themselves of their religious garments, but the faithful and approved ones were anxious to do God’s will and follow the great Judge.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Judg. 5:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jael was blessed because of her faith and obedience. Therefore she pictured a class on earth following the beginning of the temple judgment, who hear the message of The Theocracy, believe in God and Christ, and covenant to do God’s will, and who then prove their faith by being obedient to His commandments. Jael is mentioned in strict contrast to the indifferent and negligent and unfaithful. Jael pictured the Lord’s “other sheep”. She was a weaker vessel compared with the men of Meroz; yet she showed her faith and devotion, where the unfaithful men failed. God pronounced his curse upon Meroz, which curse proclaims that the persons against The Theocracy, and who fail, either by negligence or willful disobedience, to render service to The Theocracy, are wicked.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Stand against the wiles of the devil.—Eph. 6:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan’s purpose is to carry out his original challenge to Jehovah and bring about the destruction of all who have made a covenant to do God’s will. As to Jehovah and his purpose, He permits the Devil and his associate demons to beset His covenant people in order to give Satan full opportunity to carry out his wicked challenge and at the same time to afford an opportunity for those who have made a covenant with God to obey him and maintain their integrity toward him. It is the time of crucial testing. The same rules of the Lord apply to those who are Jonadabs and who have hope to be of the “great multitude” as apply to others who have made a covenant to do the Lord’s will. Let this be kept in mind: that the demons now direct their wicked action chiefly against God’s covenant people, both of the “remnant” and of the Jonadabs, because the demons have control over all the others of this wicked world. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.—Ps. 9:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has made known his fixed rule, which rule applies to all persons or nations that at one time pretended or claimed to serve him and then turned away from and against the Most High. This is a warning from Almighty God given to all those who have assumed the obligation of serving him. He compels no one to serve him, but when they undertake it they must bear the responsibility of fulfilling their covenant. One may enter into an actual covenant with God to do his will, while others may be in an implied covenant to do God’s will by reason of their information and outward claim of being God’s servants. God’s rules do not change. God is no respecter of persons. He makes known his rules, and the creature who agrees or undertakes to obey them must perform or take the consequences.

<p><span class="font5">By his prophet Daniel the Almighty says: “The end shall be at the time appointed.” (11:27) Those words are a guarantee from Jehovah that the end of the rule of the world by the demons shall come, and that at the time he has appointed. Nothing can change that time. Daniel is certain to have a “better resurrection” and to be one of the “princes in all the earth”. He finished his course as a faithful servant and prophet of God, and died like other men and went to rest in the grave, there to remain until God’s due time to awaken him out of death. Time of his resurrection may be any day now, when he, as one of earth’s governors, shall appear and assume his divinely appointed office.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">De hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear.—Ps. 40:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By faith now God’s remnant see the day of deliverance is near, and they are all filled with the song of praise to the Most High. And what results from their singing the victory song and continuing faithfully in the service in these dark days now upon the world? They see people of good-will who are being awakened, hurriedly taking their place on the side of The Theocracy and wending their way to refuge and life. As the Psalm of David says: “Many shall see it [The Theocracy, and the deliverance and blessings that righteous government brings], and fear [Jehovah], and shall trust in the Lord,” Jehovah, the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">g of Eternity, and in the King Christ Jesus. It is timely and appropriate that they join in the song. Therefore such are putting their trust in the Lord and are finding refuge under his organization, and they too join in the song.

<p><span class="font5">Persons &quot;who have for years been serving Jehovah and Christ Jesus are still subjected to severe trials. Some wonder why. The answer is that all who receive Jehovah’s approval must prove their steadfastness for The Theocracy. One can prove this only by being put to the test and remaining immovable under it and continuing steadfast for Jehovah and his King. Even now, when the King of The Theocracy is upon his throne, his servants on earth find themselves beset by many trials; but to the faithful such trials are not at all surprising. Those wholly devoted to The Theocracy and who see the great fight being made by the enemy against The Theocracy can appreciate why the individuals in God’s organization are put to the test. As with Job, so now one who will receive the reward of Jehovah’s approval must be put to the test and prove entirely blameless before God.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Teach them, diligently unto thy children.—Deut. 6: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The obligation upon parents begins to be specially binding only after they have made a covenant to do God’s will and have been taken into a covenant with him. Parents who are in a covenant to do the will of God must then inform themselves of his will or commandment toward themselves and toward their children, and then they must obey those commandments and teach them to their children and admonish their children to obey. The state or nation, through its rules of education, has no right whatsoever to limit, interfere with, or hinder parents’ instruction of their children in the Word of God. Non-Christians may salute the flag without reference to the Bible rules. Those who are real conscientious Christians are in a class entirely different from others in the world. Jehovah’s witnesses are Christians and in a covenant to be entirely obedient to God’s law. They must teach their children to obey His law.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 13:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here God’s Word recorded in Holy Writ declares that love is the fulfillment of the law; no other motive could meet the requirements of Jehovah. The moving cause for awaking and becoming zealously active is love, that is, unselfish devotion to doing the will of Almighty God. God’s servants, seeing their privilege, are grateful in their hearts, and they express their gratitude by unselfish devotion. It is written: “Awake, awake, Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song.” (Judg. 5:12) Antitypically this command to awake and organize is to the organization of the Lord on earth, which organization was pictured by Deborah. These must awake and sing or utter the song of praise to Jehovah’s name. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Sisera would have no thought that a great flood of water would come rushing down that dry bed of the river Kishon at that dry season of the year. He, being a religionist, had no faith in Jehovah God and would be utterly in the dark as to Jehovah’s purpose. While it is also true that Barak must have had no expectation of a great flood of water from heaven fighting in his behalf, yet he had faith in Jehovah God and believed that God would fight the battle for his own people in his own good way and, having that faith, Barak went boldly forward. Deborah had full faith that God would deliver the enemy into the hands of Barak, and Deborah pictured God’s organization. Jehovah did exactly as he had said to Barak.

For the physical organism they would need their daily bread; but that was not all. In order to have life that is lasting, something of far greater power than material bread is needed. The Word of God furnishes that bread of life, and it is necessary for them to give heed to his Word in order to find the way to life. God’s rules are the same with regard to all intelligent creatures. There is but one way for any human creature to receive life everlasting. God does not change, neither do his rules change. Being the same at all times, they apply now to every one who seeks to be guided in the way to life. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Such man believes he must choose to be for Jehovah or against him, and he fears to choose contrary to God’s will. The man who fears God, and who with diligence seeks to know and do God’s will, is led in the right way. Such person begins to have faith; and without faith it is impossible to please God and receive his blessing. Would man know the purpose of Jehovah? How may he find out that purpose? The Lord answers: “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.” (25:14) The man fearing God, diligently seeking the truth, God reveals to that man his purpose. God’s primary purpose is the vindication of his own great name; not for his own benefit, but in order that his creatures who desire righteousness may choose the way of righteousness and live, to the honor of the great Creator. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/41</span></p>

God limited the number of those who shall be associated with Christ Jesus in his Government. Each one of these chosen ones must take the wise course and continually and faithfully walk therein even unto death. It appears that the greater number of those who have taken the wise course, and have been taken out by Jehovah for his name, have finished their earthly course and that only the remnant now remain on earth; and to such remaining ones God has assigned the duty and privilege of bearing testimony to his name and to his kingdom. This they must do until his due time to exercise his supreme power against the adversary and the adversary’s entire organization.

<p><span class="font5">The authority conferred upon him by Jehovah means that the territory of the dominion of Christ the King-Father belongs to him, and not to his subjects. The people will occupy the earth and glorify it in trust. That is a sacred and blessed trust, which the children of The King shall have the privilege and joy of executing. Thus the Lord confers on his children a great and wonderful privilege and honor. This great King is “The Seed of Abraham” according to God’s promise first given to Abraham, and He shall own the earth, and his children shall beautify it and use it to Jehovah’s glory forever. His first work upon taking possession is to announce Jehovah’s name and have his servants proclaim it throughout the earth, and then proceed to destroy the wicked ruler, to the end that the people may have a righteous government under which to live.

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus is now enthroned; hence The Theocracy has come, and all the kings of earth are arrayed against it, and this will become more pronounced in the very near future. Will Jehovah’s kingdom be able to withstand the opposition of Satan’s organization? Concerning The Theocracy, his kingdom, Jehovah says: “Which shall never be destroyed.” It is the “everlasting kingdom”, is invincible and shall stand forever. “And the kingdom shall not be left to other people”; no one in Satan’s crowd will have anything to do with it. The Theocracy shall be forever ruled from heaven by Christ Jesus; and those on earth who are representatives of that government will execute judgments. There will be no politics, commerce or religion in The Theocracy. It means the end of demon rule for ever. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">During the earthly ministry of Jesus he began to gather to himself those Israelites who voluntarily came to him and chose to be on his side. Later he opened the way to those Gentiles who took a similar step. Thus Jehovah authoritatively speaks through Christ Jesus, but at no time compels anyone to follow in his footsteps. On the contrary, Jesus says: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me.” To those who seek to know the right way Jesus gives this advice: “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.” (Matt. 11: 28, 29; 16:24) Here he emphasizes that man is a free moral agent, free to exercise his will in choosing the way he should go.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s promise and oath was to his beloved One. That was not an unconditional promise so far as the creatures are concerned. The condition is that the children of the Greater David, Christ Jesus, whom the Lord Jehovah gave to him, must “keep my covenant and my testimony”. So doing, such faithful ones shall be with Christ Jesus in the Kingdom. Every one that has faithfully kept his covenant and testimony with God has suffered violence and persecution at the hands of the enemies of The Theocracy. Thus opportunity has been offered to each and every one that made the covenant to prove his integrity under adverse conditions and to thus prove Satan’s challenge to Almighty God a malicious lie.—Job 2: 3-6. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those who do evil in God’s sight and against God’s people who are faithfully proclaiming God’s name are wicked, and hence are against the great Theocrat and his King; and the judgment against these is pronounced by the Lord Jesus at Matthew 25:41-45. God turns away his face from such: “The face of Jehovah is against such as do wickedness, to cut off from the earth their memory.” (Ps. 34:16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> The criterion by which a man should examine himself is not his physical and mental shortcomings or imperfections, but according to his sincere, honest heart devotion. God judges that way, and that is the right way. Concerning this it is written: “Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.” (2 Cor. 13:5) “For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.”—1 Cor. 11: 31.

(1 John 5:19) Against whom, then, is the assault now being made particularly ? The subtle and seductive shafts of the demons are now specifically directed against God’s covenant people. The demons in their wicked activities endeavor to cause God’s covenant people to violate their covenant and to join the world in destruction. Subtly the demons endeavor to cause the covenant people of God to become careless and to let down the proper bars between the sexes, so that moral and sexual delinquency is the result. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/41</span></p>

No. Those persons of the most powerful religious organization on earth, which men are bent on ruling the earth contrary to God’s will, are called Christians, and those hypocritical men are the ones that manifest the greatest hatred against Jehovah’s faithful servants. Christ’s faithful followers are hated today by all nations under Satan’s control, and that hatred is because such are witnesses for and advocates of the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. It is a part of the same conflict begun long ago, the Devil against righteousness. Now the King of righteousness has begun to exercise his power as King and the climax foretold by the prophetic drama of Job, whose name means “hated”, has come.

There was Gideon, a farmer, who was threshing his wheat when Jehovah’s angel appeared and told him that God had selected him to be a deliverer of the Israelites from the Devil religionists, the Midianites, who were oppressing the Israelites. With his little band reduced to only 300 men Gideon put to flight and destroyed the enemy host. Thus God rewarded him with service because of his faith and made a picture of blessings to come.

There is no distinction between male and female (Gal. 3:28), but all who are chosen of God and taken into a covenant with him and sent forth are ordained ministers to preach this gospel of the great Theocracy. No earthly power has any authority to set aside this high ordination and commission. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, an organization acting in behalf of and with Jehovah’s witnesses in order to do things orderly and carry on the work in an organized, orderly manner, sends out such witnesses, and thus an earthly ordination is provided, but that is always subject to the ordination of the Almighty God.

<p><span class="font5">Up to this point Barak had not struck a blow against the enemy. Before his army of ten thousand got into actual fighting with the enemy the Lord God began to fight against the Canaanites by exercising His superhuman power. Thus he gave unmistakable proof that the battle was God’s, and not man’s, and thus he pictured that the battle of Armageddon will be God’s, and not man’s. Sisera and his host and iron chariots were unable to withstand the onslaught of the superhuman powers. No human power, and no other power, for that matter, can successfully fight against Jehovah and his hosts.

<p><span class="font5">To love God means that one must be wholly and unselfishly devoted to Almighty God, seeking always to know and to do His will. &quot;Neighbour” is one’s fellow creature who is also a believer on Jehovah and Christ and who has agreed to do God’s will. God’s commandment requires that one Tove his neighbor, even as he loves himself’, that is to say, put his brother Christian on an exact equality with himself. The only way a person can prove his love for God is by fully and sincerely obeying the commandments of God. (John 14:15) The Christian proves his love for God by joyfully obeying God’s commandments. (1 John 5:3) Where the commandments of men are in conflict with God’s co</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mman</span><span class="font5">dment there is but one thing to do, and that is, to obey God first.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Then sang Deborah, and Barak the son of Abinoam, on that day, saying, Praise ye the Lord.—Judg. 5:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Deborah pictured God’s “woman”, that is, his organization, now fully united in devotion to the Most High, the great Theoerat. Through that organization he now brings to his people the revelation of his holy purpose, which is testified to in the prophetic song. Barak, whose name means </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">lightning,</span><span class="font5"> pictures Christ Jesus, the Head of the capital organization of God. The “remnant of her seed” (Rev. 12:17), that is, the last members of the body of Christ now on earth, are made a part of Jehovah’s organization, and they now participate in the song from the viewpoint of its certain fulfillment in the near future. We are now in that “day of Jehovah”, and it is appropriate that all of God’s faithful people now join in the song of appreciation and joy, looking confidently to the hour of earthly deliverance. “Praise ye the Lord.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</span><span class="font5">—Rev. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">18:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This warning is sounded by the Lord for the benefit of all persons of good-will toward The Theocracy. Such as heed will speedily flee away from religious organizations and find safety under the Lord Jesus Christ. Those who believe God and his Word should now see and understand that God is no respecter of persons or nations and that all who have learned of Jehovah and his kingdom and then forgotten God and turned away to the “beggarly elements” of the world shall go down at Armageddon, and also all who fail and refuse to hear and obey God and his King. But before executing his judgment the Lord sends forth his witnesses to declare his name and kingdom throughout the earth, for a witness, in order that the nations may have no excuse for their action and end. They fix their own destiny. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">As </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name remain.—Isa. 66:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The seed . . . according to the promise” is The Christ, Head and body, which constitutes the “new heavens”, the official Theocratic Government, the capital organization. The “new earth” is God’s faithful princes on earth carrying out the orders and judgments of the King, Christ Jesus. The world of righteousness consists of the invisible, which is The Christ, and the visible, which is the representatives of The Christ on earth. It is this “world” of righteousness, The Theocracy, that God so loved that he appointed, anointed and “gave” his beloved Son to be the King and Ruler of it. (John 3:16) It is this new world, the Holy City, that comes down from heaven and rules the things in the earth.—Rev. 21:1-5. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Likewise today the devils or demon organization, both invisible and visible, are watching the presentday “strange work” of the Lord, in which Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions are having a part. All who are of the world are under the influence of religion or demonism and therefore watching the progress of the battle and expecting that shortly that battle will result in the complete annihilation of those who are the representatives of The Theocracy on earth. Truly, as the apostle states (1 Cor. 4:9), every faithful servant of God on earth is now a “spectacle unto the world”, both men and angels. Yet Jehovah’s “strange work” is still going on in some parts of the earth. The religionists therefore cry out, “Why the delay?” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Such have not the zeal for the Kingdom that is pleasing to Jehovah. Such look upon those who have less of the material wealth of this earth and no luxuries as the ones who should bear the hard part of the field work. The faithful, zealous ones are willing to sit anywhere and on anything, even on boards or on wheel chairs or on slabs of stone or on prison benches in the cells while delivering the message of The Theocracy. The ones specifically admonished to “speak”, or “meditate”, are inclined to “sit in judgment” on those who do not have the outward appearance of being so much favored as themselves. The willing ones who formed the ten thousand volunteers who followed Barak and trod the rocky, roadless slope of Mount Tabor gladly took things as they were, having in mind but one thing, and that to do the will of Almighty God and to follow their leader.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake, Deborah; . . . arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.—Judg. 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The name “Abinoam” means “father of sweetness and grace”. This name applies to Jehovah, the Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Jehovah is love, and he is sweetness and grace. Every attribute of perfection is in Him. He is the manifestation of sweetness, grace and goodness to all who joyfully obey him. Christ Jesus, his beloved Son and Executive Officer, at the fixed time receives the signal, the command from the Most High, to begin “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”; which battle was pictured by Barak leading his army against the forces of Sisera, Jabin’s captain. Before Armageddon begins the Lord’s organization on earth, pictured by Deborah, must first awake and act under the commandment of Christ Jesus and vigorously, zealously and unhesitatingly proclaim the name of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">In keeping with this commandment the combined army of the enemy prepares for Armageddon and Jehovah’s mighty ones come down from heaven, and the fighting forces are made ready for the “battle of that great day of God Almighty”. From the physical facts now well known it is clearly seen that the time for the great and final conflict at Armageddon is very near. The hour and the day no man on earth knows, but, to be sure, the Lord knows, because he has fixed the time definitely, and that battle will begin at the time appointed. Now the covenant people of Jehovah have but one thing to do, and that is, to continuously proclaim Jehovah’s name and kingdom, regardless of what fighting the enemy may do. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5"> 4/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Let none now think it is sufficient and in fulfillment of their covenant to spend part of the hours distributing literature or manufacturing it, and then to employ the remainder of their time in foolish things, such as social parties or &quot;jazzing about”. Some time is required for study and meditation and careful planning the work that is to be done. The time is brief, and there is much to do. Let everyone now on earth who is in a covenant to do God’s will have in mind at all times this: We have taken our position on the side of The Theocracy and openly declared ourselves for Jehovah and his King. Demons, led by Satan their chief, together with all of the organization of that wicked one, are arrayed against us and seek our destruction. We desire to win. We must win. There is only one way to win. That is, by the grace and strength of the Lord. We must give heed to and obey his commands, else we fail. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For not at any time was prophecy brought by the will of man, but men from God spoke, being moved by holy spirit.—2 Pet. 1:21, Emphatic Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The almighty Jehovah inspired holy men of old to act as his amanuenses and write down the truths given by him for man’s benefit. The people must choose to follow tradition of men and walk in the darkness concerning the way to life, or to gain knowledge from God’s Word, which points out the only way that leads to life everlasting. The purpose of Watchtower publications is to help the people to make a choice in harmony with God’s Word. It is the truth of God’s Word that is sharper than a two-edged sword, and which exposes the fallacy of guides that are offered by men. Human theories concerning the way to life are directly in conflict with the Word of Almighty God. Those who desire to live should ignore human theories and give heed to God’s Word.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity.—Rom. 1:20, Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The visible things of creation impart information to man. This information which man gets from observation he knows is true, because he sees it with his own eyes; and therefore he has knowledge of the existence of the same. “Knowledge” means to receive and perceive the truth. From the information and knowledge which the man has he knows there must be a power greater than himself, and a power greater than the things he sees about him. That greater power is the Creator, the Almighty God, “whose name alone is Jehovah,” who is invisible to the creature, and “whom no man hath seen nor can see”. The man who desires to know the truth recognizes that there must be an invisible power far greater than man. The same man desires to live.

<p><span class="font5">That great Ruler shall guide the people in the right way; and as to this it is written: “And his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor.” All persons who follow his counsel are certain to walk in the right way. One of the names given him is “The mighty God”, meaning that all power in heaven and earth is committed into his hands. (Matt. 28:18) He is called “The everlasting Father” because unto him is given the power to minister life everlasting to obedient ones of humankind. That means that those to whom he gives life and who obey shall never die, and those who are his faithful and obedient subjects shall live forever and carry out his purpose. One of his titles also is “The Prince of Peace”, meaning that he is the great paternalistic Ruler and his rule of peace shall never end. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/11</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Here Jesus emphatically declared he is the King of Jehovah’s government; that Jehovah’s government stands for the truth which Jesus declared; and that all persons who are of the truth choose to put themselves under The Theocratic Government, that is, the kingdom of God under Christ Jesus, and which kingdom will be a complete vindication of Jehovah’s name. The faithful apostles were the first who voluntarily became the disciples of Christ Jesus. Since their day others have chosen to follow in Jesus’ footsteps. No one has been compelled to take that step. Those who have chosen to follow in his footsteps and who continue therein faithful to their covenant, have chosen life, and not the way of death, which life is received as a gracious gift from Jehovah by and through Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">We ought to obey God rather than men.—Acts 5:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In taking that course the covenant people of God in obedience to his commandments are following the same course as that taken by the apostles of Christ Jesus. Those faithful men were in a covenant to do God’s will, and, receiving his commandments, they obeyed by going about preaching the gospel. Their action was contrary to the law of the land, as declared by religious Jews. Those faithful men were punished by imprisonment, and yet as soon as they were released they straightway went again to publicly preaching the gospel of the Kingdom. Again they were haled into court, charged with violating the law, and their reply was: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“We</span><span class="font5"> ought to obey God rather than men.” They chose to follow the rule which Jesus had announced: “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” The Bible records many instances showing His approval of the course taken by the apostles.

<p><span class="font5">A man who enters into a covenant to do God’s will and hence to follow in Jesus’ footsteps, and who then through negligence, indifference, fear, willfulness or other cause does not keep and perform his covenant, thereby puts himself in the class of the wicked. He becomes responsible for his own destiny. It is not all in making the covenant; but faithfully keeping and performing the covenant is that which is of the greatest importance. It is written: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” That fear of God and the full devotion to him must be kept and maintained henceforth; otherwise one fails to have that wisdom which comes down from above. The wicked include all against The Theocracy and who therefore, directly or indirectly, oppose the kingdom by Christ Jesus.— Luke 11: 23.

<p><span class="font5">The prophet Urijah was deterred from performing his covenant obligations because of the threats made against him by men. Fearing man, he fled. God did not protect him, and he was seized and killed. In striking contrast to him is the prophet Jeremiah, a faithful witness of Jehovah. Jeremiah refused to compromise with the government of the nation of Israel and held fast to his covenant with Almighty God. Though repeatedly threatened with death, he steadfastly went on obeying God. He stood firm and steadfast for God and faithfully served him. God provided protection of Jeremiah against the venom of the rulers, “that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.” (26:24) Jeremiah was a type picturing Jehovah's witnesses now on earth who declare Jehovah’s name and his Theocracy.

<p><span class="font5">Samson received favorable report from the Lord because of his faithful devotion to Almighty God. After faithful service to God Samson was taken prisoner and brought before the Philistines, who put out his eyes and brought him into a public place to exhibit and taunt him and to reproach his God. Samson there played a part picturing the faithful servants of the great Theocracy, who are blind to everything except Jehovah God and his kingdom. Blind Samson, held a prisoner, was given great strength by Jehovah to pull down the two pillars supporting the temple of the demons, in which were assembled thousands of religionists who reproached and defamed God’s holy name. Samson was faithful even to the last, and in his death slew a host of God’s enemies. His faith secured for him God’s approval. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.—Ps. 41:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that his enemies did not triumph over him was to David a sure token from Jehovah that he had received the favor of the Most High. Now those who proclaim The Theocratic Government and hope for complete entrance into it with confidence likewise say: T know Jehovah favors me, because he has prevented the enemies from overwhelming me.’ As David said, so now those who likewise hope for deliverance say: “As for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.” (Vs. 12) All who shall stand in favor before the Lord must hold fast their integrity, and never be found deficient therein. It is God’s chosen people whom he has called for his purpose; who must now remain steadfast and immovable for The Theocracy, that shall receive his everlasting blessings. Salvation of each one of such depends on loyalty and faithfulness to The Theocracy. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those who take the wise course increase in understanding and rejoice in the Lord. (Vs. 10) Many were spiritually asleep prior to 1931 and were in the “dust” of Babylon until the Lord awakened them. When awakened, they began to realize the importance of the hour. Becoming alive to its importance, they went to work, joyfully going forth to have a part in God’s “strange work”. The number of pioneers rapidly increased; and in many companies those who were spiritually asleep, yet who had love for God, awakened and seized the opportunity of going from house to house to bring people the testimony. Such have become faithful witnesses of the Lord and have carried his message to those who have been hungering and thirsting for righteousness.

<p><span class="font5">In 1938 the Lord revealed that his organization is The Theocracy, ruled from the Head downward, and not from the bottom upward. Everyone who receives God’s approval must come to appreciation of this fact. Of paramount importance is the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Some fail to see that all-important truth. They consider themselves and their individual ease and salvation of great importance. Such fall, and for them there is no recovery. Rebellion against the rule of The Theocracy is disastrous. Bebels insist on their own selfish course. They forsake the course of wisdom and understanding and follow a selfish course, evidently because they have yielded to flatteries. Any man who indulges in flattery shows a lack of faith and of appreciation of God’s Word and his dealing with men. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/41</span></p>

Concerning those whom he found to be faithful servants he speaks in the above words. The great Judge adds: ‘“Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.” That was an unconditional approval and taking them into the Kingdom; but these from that time forward were required to walk in the way of the Lord and to shun religion, that is, “other gods.” (Verses 6,7) Henceforth everyone who receives the Lord’s final approval and who receives an abundant entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our God must shun religion and be a true and faithful witness to the name of Jehovah God and his Theocracy.

The blindness and indifference to God’s message today are similar to what prevailed in Noah’s day. Are such things all that are similar or alike of the two periods of time ? No, there are others. In Noah’s day there were bullies browbeating and overrunning the people of the world. Also there prevailed in Noah’s time a state of lawlessness or moral wickedness resulting in debauchery of all human creatures aside from Noah and his family. In all the nations of earth today there prevails a state of affairs of violence similar to that of Noah’s day. All of this is the result of the influence of the demons under the leadership of Satan.

(1 Pet. 2:21) It is written that, beginning with Jesus’ coming into the world, he said unto Jehovah God his Father: “Lo, I come; in the volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, 0 my God: yea, thy law is within my heart. I have preached righteousness in the great congregation.” (Ps. 40: 7-9; Heb. 10:7) Each and every one taken out of the world for Jehovah’s name and taken into the covenant with him must likewise agree to do and delight to do the will of God. He makes such solemn agreement to do God’s will and thus he obligates himself to perform his covenant. That binds him unalterably to be obedient to God’s commandments as set forth in his Word.

A </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">canon</span><span class="font5"> is a measuring rod. As to the Bible, it means the rule of truth. Without any doubt the spirit of Almighty God directed faithful men to arrange the canon of the Scriptures according to his will. That much could not be said of any other book in existence. All the evidence, when considered together, proves beyond all doubt that the Author of the Holy Scriptures set out in the Bible is Almighty God, whose name is Jehovah, and which name means his purpose toward his creatures. The Scriptures disclose that God invites man to reason with him (Isa. 1:18) ; and the fact that the Creator endowed man with faculties of reason shows it is proper that man reach a conclusion by process of reasoning in harmony with facts and authority beyond dispute.

They had neglected to look above for instruction, and failed to follow the Lord’s instructions. Those were perilous days for the Jews, and all of the blind did fall into the ditch, as the Lord Jesus foretold. The present is the time of even greater peril. Pastors and clergymen, desiring men’s approval rather than God’s, turn to fables. They too are blind guides of the people, yet they regard themselves as wise, and their dupes that follow them likewise regard them as wise.

<p><span class="font5">The Lord announces his purpose to provide a “great multitude” with the opportunity of life everlasting on earth. All who compose the “great multitude” must agree to do the will of God, and therefore, exercising faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus as their Redeemer, must consecrate themselves to do God’s will and must serve him. They must obey His commandments. They are commanded to “seek righteousness” and “seek meekness”; which means they must endeavor to learn what is God’s will concerning them and then do that which is righteous by obeying his will. The law of Jehovah God given to typical Israel applies with equal force to all men who gain life everlasting. To all such as have agreed to do his will he says: “See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil.” “Therefore choose life.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/11</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“The stars” had reference to the host of heaven, invisible to human eyes, but who really did the fighting in that battle of Megiddo. The stars fighting pictured Christ Jesus and his heavenly army. Of himself he says: <sup>f</sup>I, Jesus, am the bright and morning star.’ (Rev. 22:16) He is the Star that shall rule the world with irresistible power. (Num. 24:17) Suddenly he and his glorious army will fall upon the enemy and wipe them out, even as was done with Sisera’s forces at Megiddo. All the influence and power of Gog and his host of Magog shall then be destroyed. Now Gog, the Devil’s invisible representative who is in command of the enemy’s forces both invisible and visible, is pushing all of his power to the destruction of The Theocracy. It is therefore certain that the hour is due when the prophecy of Jehovah shall be accomplished concerning that wicked host. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.—John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Now</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah is making clear to his people through Christ the meaning of his great love for the world of righteousness. The salvation of creatures from death and the giving to them of everlasting life is secondary to God’s great purpose to establish The Theocracy, the new world, the new heaven and the new earth. God sent forth his beloved Son Jesus to carry out his purpose, and, in order for any of the human race to be changed from human to spirit and to be associated with Christ Jesus in his kingdom and thereafter be a part of The Christ, they must be redeemed. Only those who devote themselves to The Theocracy can ever have life everlasting. Their devotion must be to Almighty God and to Christ Jesus, his King; otherwise they perish. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">On that occasion the religionists tried to silence the children thus crying out. In words of rebuke to them Jesus said: “Have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?” Today the children of the King joyfully hail Christ Jesus, proclaiming The Theocratic Government; and the religionists now try to silence these children, but they cannot. God can make the very stones to cry out, and he will see to it that his children shall now herald the message before the people who desire to hear. Religionists have lost their opportunity, and now the children, by the Lord’s favor, take up the glad song and herald it far and wide, and, as the Lord declares, this is done to put the enemy to silence. The children are now in the Lord’s favor and joyfully serve him; they shall see the enemies of The Theocracy go down in defeat.

<p><span class="font5">Barak, no doubt, took many captives, but not for the purpose of sparing them alive. All the forces of Sisera being against God and for the Devil, none of them were spared alive. (Judg. 4:16) Likewise when Christ Jesus, the Greater Barak, renders the forces of Satan panic-stricken and in complete rout he will take many of them captive and execute them. All the enemies of God are destined to die, because They are vessels of wrath for destruction’; “as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed.” (Rom. 9: 22; 2 Pet. 2:12) At Armageddon the Greater Barak will spare alive none of the devils. (Rev. 19:19-21) This destruction is immediately followed by a feast of rejoicing by those who have remained firm, true and steadfast in support of The Theocracy and its King. Their song will fill the universe with praise to Jehovah’s name and his government. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“The church of the living God” is the “church of the firstborn”, composed of Christ Jesus and the members of “his body” in glory. (1 Tim. 3:15; Heb. 12: 22, 23) The church is the “holy nation” of Jehovah, devoted wholly and entirely to the service of Almighty God. It is the chosen inheritance of Jehovah which shall be forever to his praise. (1 Pet. 2: 9,10) That holy nation has but one God, who is Jehovah, and concerning which it is written: “Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.” (Ps. 33:12, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.) </span><span class="font5">Those who enter into a covenant to become a part of that nation must follow righteousness.

<p><span class="font5">To correspond with the decree issued by the king of Persia, Christ Jesus, the Greater Cyrus, began his reign in 1914, and thereafter in 1918 came to the temple of Jehovah and gathered unto himself his faithful servants and followers to the temple. He has builded the temple of Jehovah and has released God’s faithful servants (pictured by Daniel), to wit, Jehovah’s witnesses, “the remnant,” releasing them from modernday Babylon, Satan’s organization. He sets them free to go forth and have part in the temple work. Therefore now is the due time for God to reveal to his faithful people the meaning of Daniel’s prophecy. That being true, the time for Daniel’s resurrection and return to his place, or “lot”, on earth as one of the princes is very near. We on earth may look forward with confidence to seeing Daniel among us almost any time. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In these days of wickedness and wicked deeds committed by the Hierarchy and allies against harmless people because these proclaim the name and kingdom of Jehovah God, all these things are evidences that this is the time when the wicked have grown up like grass and the workers of iniquity blossom and flourish. In view of the prophecies bearing squarely upon the point, and God’s promise to avenge his elect, let his faithful servants now wait upon the Lord and fully trust him. As soon as he has promised he will destroy the wicked for ever. (Ps. 92:7) The lovers of righteousness can afford to wait for the Lord to act. They cannot afford to take any other course. The faithful servants of Jehovah will wait upon him because they know he will act in his own due time and will completely wipe out the enemy.

<p><span class="font5">The hammer and tent nail picture God’s Word of truth, which instrument is used effectively against religion. “Is not my word like as a fire ? saith the Lord; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces ?” (Jer. 23:29) Lovers of righteousness equipped with the “hamme?’ of God’s Word, which people of goodwill are able to understand, meet the chief minds of religious champions and successfully beat down and kill their religion. They successfully stand up against the doctrines and traditions of religion. They go forth with the hammer-like message of truth, declaring the truth abroad, and that activity is destructive of demonism and the power of demons or demon religion over others. They must act like Jael, in resisting religion and in taking their stand on the side of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1/41</span></p>

Instead, they give heed to a vicious company of religious leaders; and so now there are among the political rulers those who indict and try Jehovah’s witnesses upon the false charges of sedition and conspiracy to provoke to riot, such false charges being based solely on the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses proclaim the message of the kingdom of the Most High as God has commanded them to do. The action on the part of these rulers is in defiance of Almighty God. Will such cruel, fanatical and demoniacal persecution of his witnesses stop the “strange work” of Jehovah God? Certainly not. That work of Almighty God will continue until the due time to have it end, and that end will immediately be followed by His “strange act”.

<p><span class="font5">This pictures the heart devotion of Christ Jesus and those of his organization singing the praises of The Theocracy. It is that warm appreciation and genuine love of Christ and the capital organization under him that causes them to express their burning zeal and heart devotion to The Theocracy. “Governors,” or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[Young's]</span><span class="font5"> “lawgivers”, of Jehovah’s organization are those who announce or proclaim His law and statutes. Those in the organization of the Lord upon whom rests the obligation to outline the work that is being done and who stir up action to accomplish that work which Jehovah has commanded to be done are prefigured by the word “lawgivers”. It must be true beyond all doubt that such are guided and directed by the Lord and that they carry on the work assigned without knowing at the time that it is in fulfillment of a certain prophecy.

It is the time when the people on earth are being separated into two classes, one class being those of the righteous by reason of their faith and obedience to the Lord, and the other the unrighteous or wicked ones. This separation precedes the great and final conflict at Armageddon, which takes place when the separating work is completed. The day of enlightenment and separation began from and after Christ’s appearing at the temple in 1918. Thereafter the Lord no longer passes by unnoticed the conduct of men towards The Theocracy, which conduct or course of action is intelligently taken. In the judgment and division of the nations now taking place each one must in due time be for The Theocracy or against The Theocracy.

God declared his purpose to put enmity between the seed of His woman (His organization) and the seed of Satan, and stated that the Seed of God’s organization would in due time completely crush Satan and his seed and vindicate Jehovah’s name. That declaration was an unalterable covenant of Jehovah, which Christ Jesus is now carrying into full operation. From Eden till now enmity between God’s organization and Satan’s seed (the Devil’s organization) is made manifest. That enmity will end only by the complete triumph of the Seed of Abraham and the vindication of Jehovah’s name. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/il</span></p>

The great and long-hoped-for Theocracy has come! Lift up your heads with joy. Go now and tell the glad tidings of The Theocratic Government to all who will hear. Those who do hear and obey will join in the everlasting praise of Jehovah now being sounded in the heavens: &quot;Kings of the earth [Christ and his bride], and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth [the visible representatives on earth of The Theocracy]: both young men and virgins ; old men [survivors of Armageddon] and children [born of the great multitude to fill the earth]: let them praise the name of JEHOVAH.”—Verses 11-13. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Aside from Noah there were no others on the earth perfect in generation as he was, but all others aside from him and his family were defiled. Noah stood out in contrast to all others. God was pleased with him. He is therefore a proper example. Noah was a type of Christ Jesus and was used by Jehovah to make a prophetic drama foretelling Jesus and some of his work. Because the members of his family held steadfastly with Noah to the course of righteousness they were used to foretell the Lord’s &quot;other sheep”, who will form the &quot;great multitude”. Noah busied himself with preaching the name of Jehovah God, and no doubt the members of his family worked with him, and hence they were, in fact, companions to him.

Human creatures that voluntarily agree to do His will and whom he receives by and through Christ Jesus, and to whom he gives the promise of being members of &quot;the body of Christ” and reigning with him can attain to life everlasting in heaven only by giving heed to and obeying God’s Word. All persons who enter into a covenant with Jehovah with the hope of life, either in heaven or on earth, are governed by the same rules. Concerning all such the Lord Jesus prayed to Jehovah in these words, which apply primarily to the spiritual class, but also to all of his covenant people, to wit: &quot;Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.”—John 17:17.

<p><span class="font5">The north refers to the position of Almighty God Jehovah. It is from his throne that The Theocratic Government has come forth to carry out his purpose. (Pss. 75:6,7; 48:2) Isaiah 41:25 identifies Christ Jesus as the One referred to by the word &quot;east”, or &quot;the sunrising”. Jehovah gave his word that he would raise up a righteous government that would destroy all unrighteousness, that is, Satan’s entire organization and power. Whatever the “tidings” or &quot;reports” are they greatly disturb the totalitarian earthly organization. It is the Almighty God Jehovah and Christ Jesus as King that send forth the message which troubles the enemy. Those tidings constitute a warning from Jehovah that Armageddon is about to be fought.

(Gen. 4:4) God counted Abel a righteous man because of his faith. Abel was murdered at the instance of the Devil. Concerning Abel’s righteousness and God’s purpose to punish those who have practiced religion and used it to bring about the murder of many others, Jesus Christ said to the religionists at his time: “Upon you [shall] come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias.” (Matt. 23: 34, 35) Abel was a good and faithful man; and it is written that they that have done good shall be resurrected.

The apostle Paul had his heart set entirely on the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus and summed up the matter in the record at the eleventh chapter of Hebrews. Faithful men there named came out from the organized government controlled by the Devil and because of their immovable devotion to The Theocracy they had no desire to return to Satan’s organization. Their desire and hope was in the government which the God of heaven was preparing. To that hope they held fast. Because of their blamelessness God was not ashamed to acknowledge them as his servants. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/41</span></p>

Jehovah God is now doing his “strange work”, exposing the fallacy and hypocrisy of religion and setting before the world his message of truth, which plainly announces the way of life. This message is not limited to a few, but all who will hear are given the opportunity. The demons know the crucial hour is here; hence all the wicked of the spirit and human creatures desperately fight against God’s witnesses. They hate Jehovah and his Theocratic Government, and hate those who announce it. But the remnant, together with their companions who have fled to the Lord for protection, must proclaim the message regardless of all opposition. This, by God’s grace, they will do. As others of good-will hear and choose the wise way they too will join in proclaiming God’s kingdom under Christ as the only hope.

They were distracted and sidetracked, and hence missed the opportunity of taking a part actively in the battle, which activity foretells of God’s “strange work”. No doubt there was much noise about many good resolves and good intentions, but no real actions. Good intentions and resolves count for nothing unless there is some real activity in proof of their genuineness. Those Reubenites did nothing to set in motion anything for the furtherance of the field work. That foretells the condition that exists among some at the present time. They cannot say with the faithful ones: “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.” (Ps. 13:5) One must prove his devotion to God by acting in harmony with confessions made by the mouth.

He armed them in the holy cause of righteousness and afforded the ability to stand against the machinations of religious influence. This “strange work” amidst organized and fully equipped opponents’ must continue and shall continue until Jehovah begins to carry to complete success his “strange act” and to use his equipment to annihilate the enemy.

Almighty God makes it impossible for his side of the covenant to fail. Can a man who has been taken into a covenant with God treat his obligations under that covenant lightly and violate them or break them with impunity? God’s Word answers: “Covenant-breakers . . . are worthy of death.” (Rom. 1:31, 32) Jehovah made this matter plain to the Israelites. What God announced to the Israelites is his unchangeable law and applies to all people who willfully break covenant with God. God is faithful in all things he has promised. He requires faithfulness of all who undertake to perform an agreement or covenant with him. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those whom Sisera’s mother pictured expect to destroy the work and organization of Jehovah’s witnesses and put the members thereof to a menial service where they cannot bear testimony that exposes demonism. Mark the open and wicked discrimination against God’s faithful ministers at the present time, and, while marking it, let those who are unjustly and wrongfully treated remember how God in the past foretold the manner of showing his favor to those who love him and remain faithful to him. The wicked may prosper for a time, but that time is short. Like old Haman, they look forward to the hour when the scaffold, which they have builded, will be put to use and the modern-day Mordecai will hang on it.

It would be impossible to make it more emphatic concerning the obligation to teach the children, from their youth up, than what God has put in his Word. The foundation of the child’s education must be laid in God’s Word, because that is the only way that leads to life everlasting. By nature a child’s mind seeks information or knowledge.

They indulged in all manner of debauchery, the result of which was to turn all men’s thoughts from Almighty God. (Gen. 6:5) The sly, subtle foe Satan tricked the spirit “sons of God” into marrying the offspring of Adam, and creatures were brought forth on earth who were entirely given over to wickedness. The only exception to the wicked state of affairs was Noah and his family. Because of their faith and obedience they found favor in the Lord’s eyes and were saved by him. Thus they pictured a class who find grace in His eyes now and who are saved from the deluge of fire at Armageddon. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The day of judgment has come and Christ Jesus, the great Judge, accompanied by his host of angels, now judges the nations. The religious leaders, the “man of sin”, the “evil servant”, the ungodly, and the sinners, utter cruel speech against the faithful servants of Jehovah who declare his name and his Theocratic Government, and bring much trouble upon such faithful servants of the Most High. Therefore it is written of them, and which applies at the present time: “seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you who are troubled, rest with us; when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels.” —2 Thess. 1: 6,7.

<p><span class="font5">&quot;Daily [or, continual] sacrifice” has reference to the continuous or unceasing activities of Jehovah’s servants in giving praise to his name and proclaiming his Theocratic Government. It is the continuous praise of Jehovah by his servants’ bearing testimony to his name and government, and doing so publicly by publishing the message of the kingdom of God. This is done by distribution of Bible literature, which informs the people of God’s gracious provision for them, and by going from house to house and delivering to the people these truths and reproducing recorded speech, and by other means proclaiming the gospel in obedience to the Lord’s command. That public witness work is designated as God’s “strange work”, at Isaiah 28:21. It greatly angers the demons, and all that are under demon control.

<p><span class="font5">The organization of righteousness is in all prophetic pictures represented by a woman, even as Deborah played the part picturing Jehovah’s organization, of which Christ Jesus is the Head. The part played by Jael pictured those persons who join themselves to Jehovah’s organization by voluntarily putting themselves under the organization of Christ, and who find refuge, protection and life in this way. For a long while these people of good-will have shielded these religious leaders (modern Sisera) , while at the same time they have observed such religious leaders wickedly persecuting God’s faithful servants. The time comes, however, when all persons must make their choice, either for or against the wicked. God’s judgment by Christ Jesus, the great Judge, now in progress, requires every one to make such a choice. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The prophetic song sung by Barak and Deborah gives an account of the battle of Megiddo, &quot;which foretells the coming battle of Armageddon. “Armageddon” means “mountain of Megiddo”, that is to say, “the mount of the assembly of troops.” The troops are those who are under the command of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Greater Barak, and whom the Lord assembles in the mountain. The ten thousand assembled with Barak in the mountain pictured all those who are faithfully and uncompromisingly supporting the Lord Jesus Christ, that is to say, who are following joyfully in his steps wheresoever he leads. The odds appeared to be overwhelming against Barak. Jehovah was with Barak and his little army, and Jehovah is irresistible. So shall it be at Armageddon.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset.—Heb. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Witnesses” and “martyrs” translate the same Greek root. Every faithful servant of God, in this life and in death, is a witness to his name and kingdom. They are martyrs to the cause of righteousness. From Abel to John the Baptist there was a “cloud of witnesses” to the name of Jehovah and to his kingdom. In this Christ Jesus took the lead and continues to lead. A “weight” consists of anything that hinders or retards Jehovah’s servants in giving the witness; while the besetting or close-girdling sin is religion and its baneful influence upon those who hold to any part of religion. This shows that God’s people in this hour of crisis must remove every possible weight and must shun religion as a deadly thing. The faithful cast such things aside and go forward with a song of praise upon their lips. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those princes were not one whit behind the faithful Israelites in general. They were in full harmony with Deborah and, antitypically, in full harmony with God’s organization. For Isaachar war was really on the “home front”. This suggests that today one may serve on the home front if he cannot be a pioneer. Not all can engage in the pioneer work, but all of God’s servants may perform their duty wherever they are. The Issachar class of God’s covenant people today joyfully serve wherever they are put. They are wholly devoted to The Theocracy, hence in full accord and unity with the visible part of God’s organization, taking commands from the invisible Greater Barak and performing their duties without hesitation. They are not pacifists; they do not compromise. They are entirely for Jehovah’s organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W ijl/il</span></p>

It will be the blessed privilege of the faithful children, under the direct lead of the faithful “princes” or governors in the earth, to carry into action the divine mandate toward filling the earth with a righteous people. Let parents who are in a covenant for the Kingdom now see to it that they are obedient to God’s commandment to be diligent to teach their children concerning The Theocracy. In this do not fail! The greatest favor the parents can now bestow upon their children is to keep constantly before them the Kingdom and what it means to humankind. If sueh parents have brought up their children “in the nurture and admonition of the Lord” they will not depart from that training. Blessed shall be those who thus obey!

These constitute the remnant of the ‘Tiody of Christ” and must continue to be faithfully obedient to God and his King and bear testimony to the name of the Most High and to his kingdom. The “other sheep”, who will form the “great multitude”, are an earthly class that shall live forever on earth and carry out the divine mandate to fill the earth with a righteous people. For these “other sheep” to ultimately become members of the “great multitude” they must be wholly devoted to The Theocracy and must remain within the bounds of the “city of refuge”, God’s organization under Christ, and there faithfully perform their assigned duties until Armageddon ends. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/41</span></p>

They have not stopped pushing forward in Jehovah’s service. The pioneers and general publishers have had many difficulties, but on they have gone. They know they are backed up by almighty power, Jehovah and his King. Therefore, when hindered by the enemy and caused to stumble, they rise up again and go forward. “For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again.” (Prov. 24:16) Some of the faithful have refused to compromise with the demon organization, and have been put to death, symbolized by “the sword”; some of them being literally beheaded. “Sword” also symbolizes violent opposition and persecution waged by demonized mobs. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Since 1922, when the flood of truth pursued them, the religious leaders have eagerly hunted a place of rest where they might be protected and their religious susceptibilities would not be shocked As Jehovah’s witnesses become more active, and necessarily more efficient, in their work and in advancing and proclaiming the Kingdom message, the clergy become more fatigued and fearful, therefore desperate. When those of the Hierarchy priests are found out, as they are now discovered, they, as the Scriptures declare (Jer. 51:30), become as women and refuse to fight in the open, and hide behind the skirts of others. This suggests that the Hierarchy and Jesuit priests will find themselves in a position similar to that pictured by Captain Sisera. That day must be near, because Hierarchy agents are flourishing.

Those who willingly and joyfully participate in the Lord’s “strange work”, bearing the reproaches that fall upon them for his name’s sake, do serve and refresh themselves greatly from the waters of revealed truths that come from Jehovah’s wells of salvation. (Isa. 12:3) They bear the brunt of the battle, the abuse and ill-treatment of the enemy, but that only increases their zeal, because to them such is evidence that they are servants of Jehovah according to his will.

<p><span class="font5">Without faith it is impossible to please God. Religious teachers have no faith in God and his Word. Such teachers advance their own learning and human wisdom in stead of God’s Word. “Evil” is that which brings injury to the one who suffers it. False doctrine, based upon the traditions of men, leads men away from life, and is therefore evil. Those who are wise will shun evil and give their attention and devotion to God and his Word. Today the Lord is gathering to himself his “other sheep”, that is, those who love righteousness and who hate evil. To such the above instruction comes from God’s Word. (1 Pet. 3:10,11) That rule applies both to God’s remnant and to the “other sheep” of the Lord. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/41</span></p>

All visible creation testifies to the indisputable fact that there is a Supreme One who is the Creator, the Almighty God. The circumstantial evidence of Jesus’ miraculous birth, and the direct testimony delivered by him during the more than three years of his ministry, establishes the authenticity of the Holy Scriptures, the Bible, as the Word of Almighty God.

What led to the seduction and debauchery of the people thereof by the demons ? Pride, idleness, fullness of bread, and sexual abomination. (Ezek. 16:49, 50) Noah and his family were saved from the assaults of the demons by reason of their faithful obedience to Almighty God’s commandments. Lot and the faithful members of his family likewise were saved from destruction because of their faith and obedience to His commandments. God’s rules do not change. There is one, and only one place of safety for God’s covenant people. Only those who love Jehovah and his kingdom can remain in that place of safety.

(Matt. 21:31) In Jericho Rahab learned of Jehovah’s power and his blessing upon those who have faith in him and serve him. Upon learning these truths she readily made a covenant with God’s servants to shield and protect them. She thereby played a part in a prophetic drama foretelling that in the present time of wickedness those who show favor to God’s servants shall be blessed by the Lord. Rahab’s faith in God was rewarded and she was saved from the fate that befell those of Jericho who had no faith in God. God will not forget Rahab’s faith.

They are not anticipating any heavenly power to act in behalf of God’s faithful people. In old time the great flood of waters that rushed down and filled the dry bed of the river Kishon was so unusual and unexpected that captain Sisera and his army would regard it as a very &quot;strange act”. Even so when God’s great Field Marshal, Christ Jesus, and his host of heaven fall upon the enemy host, the leaders of that host and all under it will recognize the power against them as the &quot;strange act” of God. They will know that God’s hand is upon them.

These Jesus designates as his “other sheep”, and when these are gathered unto the Lord and given life all shall be of one fold under Christ the great Shepherd. God’s announced purpose is to grant life everlasting to those only who believe on him and on the Lord Jesus Christ and render themselves in obedience. This rule applies to both the spiritual Israelites and those of the &quot;great multitude”, that is, to all who shall live. &quot;He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.”—John 3: 36. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/41</span></p>

The man in a covenant to do Jehovah’s will and who hopes to receive his approval must have and exercise unfeigned faith and full confidence in God and Christ, fully determining to remain steadfast for the great Theocratic Government, regardless of what trials may come to him. “Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, 0 Lord, and teachest him out of thy law; that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.” (Ps. 94:12,13) This shows that trials upon God’s people must continue until the wicked go down into the pit.

All of the covenant people, whom Jehovah has taken out for his name and sent forth as his witnesses, the Almighty God by his spirit has ordained or commissioned to proclaim his name and his kingdom. God has made them preachers or ministers of the gospel. Such are duly ordained ministers appointed and commissioned by the highest authority, regardless of what men may do, say or think.

Job knew he had not willingly been disloyal, and therefore he could not understand why he, as God’s servant, should suffer. His suffering was a prophetic picture made for the benefit of others. The test put upon Job was directly related to world domination, the issue being world domination. Job being an example used to make the prophetic picture, the test upon Job necessarily points to the requirements God makes of all who shall have to do with the rule of the world in righteousness. Jehovah had declared his purpose to set up his capital government of righteousness to rule the peoples of the world. Job would know of this promise because it had been made to his kinsman Abraham. In opposition to Jehovah Satan had declared that he would rule the world or ruin it. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">To know God and Christ is the way to life. Knowledge of God and Christ is absolutely essential to all who would be wise; and that knowledge is to be found in God’s Word alone. Receiving such knowledge the wise will be diligent to give heed thereto and walk in the way God leads: “He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.” (Prov. 10:17; 12:28) It is a grievous mistake for one to conclude that he may walk in the way of righteousness without first receiving some knowledge of God and of Christ.

The chief lie in which both kings engage is this: By their course of action both deny that Jehovah God is the Supreme One, the Owner of the earth, and that he has appointed and anointed his beloved Son as the earth’s Ruler. Contrary to God’s purpose, both kings attempt to set up a rule of their own to control the earth. They speak lies, of which their father the Devil is past master and author.

The people of goodwill have come to know the true description and purpose of religion and that it is a deadly foe to The Theocracy under Christ; they abandon religion and put it to death and take their stand unequivocally on the side of Jehovah and Christ. This Jael class God’s Executioner finds marked in their foreheads, and he spares these at Armageddon. The opponents of The Theocracy, who have refused the mark of intelligence when offered, the Executioner slays.

The one class desires the easy way, and they have much reason to meditate upon their present-day opportunities and responsibilities and to deny themselves ease and personal comfort when such is necessary to engage in service of The Theocracy. They should be willing to follow the lead of the Greater Barak and his 10,000 willing fighters who in this day of the fulfillment of the prophecy desire to bear witness to the name of Jehovah God under any and all circumstances. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/41</span></p>

Jael did not keep her vigorous act against Sisera a secret. She went right out and related to Barak, God’s servant, what she had done. Likewise the Jael class today boldly go out in the Lord’s name and publish, among their brethren and all who will hear, the great truth that religion is a dead thing and that its leaders and teachers are dead factors in their lives and all religion and religious institutions are doomed to destruction.

Issachar’s tribe moved about and resided wherever it seemed best. They were accustomed to tents: “Rejoice, . . . Issachar, in thy tents.” (Dent. 33:18) Thus those faithful men well picture the pioneers who gladly reside wherever their work takes them and are content with whatever conditions the Lord provides for them.

<p><span class="font5">Unclean thoughts and meditations must be shunned. (Mark 7:15-22) Idleness and slothfulness lead to disaster. The mind and the hands must be occupied in things that are profitable and works that are righteous in order to avoid the pitfalls set by Satan and his emissaries. Idleness contributed to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The demons see to it that the idle brain is filled with improper thoughts and leads to improper action. What must God’s covenant people do ? The remnant must obey His commandments. The “other sheep” of the Lord must do likewise. The “other sheep” find protection within the “city of refuge”, that is to say, under the Lord’s organization, and they must stay within bounds and obey the rules and commandments of the Lord’s organization which he gives. The first great commandment is to love God.—Matt. 22: 37-39. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.—Prov. 14:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the nations of “Christendom&quot; have received this warning by and through the Word of God. Not only have the nations had the Word of God, by which they could have been properly guided, but they have had the history of the experiences of others that have gone before and have been destroyed because they had forgotten God and his Word. Jehovah God brought the flood upon the world, which destroyed all save eight persons, Noah and his family. This He did because that people pushed aside and wholly ignored God’s Word. This forms a warning to “Christendom”, but “Christendom” has forgotten to give heed to that warning. “Christendom” has forgotten that God vindicated his name by the flood and that he will likewise vindicate his name by destroying all who turn away from him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Even as the Son of man came not io be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.—Matt. 20:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil cannot thwart the purpose of God, who made the earth for man to live upon. God made provision, therefore, for a ‘second Adam’, who shall minister life to all obedient ones and make the earth a righteous and glorious place to live. (1 Cor. 15:45, 47) By right of purchase, and by power and authority which Christ Jesus received from Jehovah, he becomes the second Adam, owns the earth, and will regenerate and minister life to all of the purchased ones who render themselves in full obedience to his law. The “many” who are ransomed are those who have full faith in God and are obedient and who serve joyfully The Theocratic Government. Christ Jesus, the King of The Theocracy, actually gives life everlasting to all his subjects, and thus he is truly their “Everlasting Father”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Render obedience to Almighty God first and obey the rules of the state when such are not in conflict with God’s commandments. The person who is in a covenant with God to do His will knows that the most severe punishment the state can inflict upon him is death, from which death God will resurrect his faithful servants who have been put to death by man by reason of their faithfulness to God. He knows that willful violation of God’s commandment means death everlasting, from which there is no resurrection. He prefers to have everlasting life. He follows the advice of Christ Jesus above. The covenant people of Jehovah unhesitatingly obey God first and at all times, and implicitly trust him as to the final result.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.—Heb. 11:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The next man after Abel who had faith in God was Enoch. When it is said that a man walks with God, that means that his course of action is in harmony with God’s appointed way or rules. Long ago it was written: “And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.” (Gen. 5:24) God did not permit the Devil to kill Enoch, and because of Enoch’s faith God took him away. Enoch prophesied that the Lord Jesus Christ, at his coming and his kingdom, will punish those who have fought against God. (Jude 14,15) It was Enoch’s faith that pleased God, and therefore God has a place for Enoch. It is written in connection with him and other faithful creatures: “Without faith it is impossible to please him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them.”—Heb. 11:6.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations: which covenant he made with Abraham.—Ps. 105:8,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By the Scriptures is made certain that Jehovah’s everlasting covenant is his expressed purpose to set up The Theocracy by Christ Jesus, who will rule the world in righteousness. Jehovah’s covenant with Abraham was a unilateral, unconditional declaration that he would bring forth his Seed, Christ Jesus, the King, and the associate members of his kingdom, and that Christ should be King of The Theocracy and rule the world. It is that covenant which Jehovah promised to make clear to those who love and serve him, and concerning which he says: “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.” (25:14) Against that everlasting covenant, The Theocracy, Satan has fought from the beginning of his rebellion.

<p><span class="font5">The holy spirit, which is the invisible power of Almighty God, moved upon faithful men of old to write what is set forth in the prophecies and which is there written according to God’s will. This is a guarantee that the prophecies are true. The testimony of Jesus, the Greater David, confirms the authenticity of the prophecies. Both the acts and words of Jesus refer specifically to the prophets; which proves that the prophecies written in times of old, as set out in the Bible, are true. Christ Jesus is that great Prophet, who speaks with full authority conferred upon him by his Father Jehovah. Repeatedly the testimony given by Jesus shows that his Father sent Jesus to the earth and that Jesus’ testimony is in exact accord with his Father’s will.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Shew forth the praises of him.—1 Pet. 2:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people God takes out of the- nations for his name are his covenant people. They are taken into the covenant with God. Being taken out from the nations, God makes them separate and distinct from all other peoples. They are a people for a purpose, that is, for God’s purpose, that they must bear testimony to his name, represent him, and show forth his praises. He has called them out of darkness into the light, and they must make known his light and name. He selects them for the primary purpose of bearing testimony to his name, and thereafter the life of each one thus taken into the covenant depends upon his faithful performance of all obligations of his covenant by being obedient to the commandments of Almighty God. There is no excuse for him to alter his part of the covenant nor to fail to perform fully every part thereof. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This is like the report of the man clothed with linen, with the writer’s inkhorn by his side, who went into the temple and reported to the Lord: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> have done as thou hast commanded me.” (Ezek. 9:11) Barak did not resent Jael’s action or claim the glory for himself. He was pleased with what she had done. In fulfillment of this drama the Lord Jesus shows his pleasure and approval of those who take their stand on his side and who put religion to death so far as their hearts are concerned. He begins the battle of Armageddon, and there religion meets its final end. He looks to see if they are worthy to survive Armageddon. If they have fled from religion and killed it, so far as they are concerned, and taken their stand on the side of Jehovah and his Theocracy, they may receive complete protection.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.—Judg. 5:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many of God’s people used the byways or secret ways to serve God and his kingdom, rather than to face the danger of coming out in the open and boldly proclaiming Jehovah’s name and his kingdom, as the Lord had commanded. That condition of fear continued for some time after the World War had ended. The persecution of Jehovah’s servants grows in severity in the present day, and even now some take to the byways, but these are few compared to those who boldly declare themselves for Jehovah and his kingdom. To be sure, it is always wise to use discretion and sagacity and not to unnecessarily provoke anyone to wrath, but, when necessary, the servant of God should not hesitate to declare himself for Jehovah and Christ his King. There can be no compromise. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When Sisera began to move his army against Barak the results seemed certain in his favor. Now it appears to the Hierarchy and allies that it will be an easy matter for them, when the due time arrives, to completely destroy God’s people. But in answer to their threats and brags it is written: “When they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.” Never before had the river Kishon acted as here against Sisera, and no one had ever witnessed such an unseasonable flood of waters rushing down its dry bed. It was indeed a “strange act”, and likewise at Armageddon the forces there will be indeed a “strange act” to all, particularly to those who have no faith in God. Never within the memory of man has there been anything like it. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thy testimonies are my meditation.—Ps. 119:99.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What the Lord requires of those who receive his approval is the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house and the zeal that consumes them in his service, and which the Lord Jesus has always had. (Ps. 69:9) The Lord requires unstinted devotion to The Theocracy. The faithful ones are such and have entered into the joy of the Lord and have a keen appreciation of having a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Beginning with the temple judgment by Christ Jesus the physical facts disclose that from that time onward there have been those who profess to love God but do little or nothing in the service, while there are those who profess to love God and do prove their love by willingly serving under all conditions and circumstances. This latter class sing the victory song by faith now with ever-increasing joy. This should cause the others to meditate and to get busy.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Give ear, ye princes!—Judg. 5: 2, 3, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The song of victory is begun even before Armageddon clears out all parts of the Devil’s organization. The “strange work” of Jehovah is observed by all servants of Satan, and that greatly angers them. They behold Jehovah’s people volunteering and willingly going forward in his “strange work” and doing so with great joy and this they do in the face of all manner of persecution heaped upon them. The kings and rulers of the earth see this, and at the instance of religious leaders, particularly those of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, they redouble their efforts to destroy the faithful servants of the Almighty God. Thus notice and warning is given by the Most High, who commands that earthly rulers shall give heed for their own good. Jehovah does not take advantage of their ignorance, but sees to it that they have opportunity to hear. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jael’s life was spared from Jehovah’s executioner, Barak, who found Sisera in her tent. Her life was spared although she was the wife of Heber, who maintained friendly relations with Jabin the enemy. She was given favorable mention in God’s Word, and made the picture concerning the Lord’s “other sheep”, that shall form the “great multitude” and that shall survive Armageddon and fill the earth according to the divine mandate. It appears that prior to the Megiddo battle she had no children but doubtless was blessed with children thereafter, and her family line was thereby preserved. The “great multitude”, whom Jael pictured, are greatly favored of Jehovah by being permitted to bear children after Armageddon and to thereby “fill the earth” with a righteous race. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Devil is the great waster, and with his host of wicked ones is attempting to waste all things of righteousness. Any person today who has made a covenant to do God’s will and who then becomes indifferent and slothful concerning the work and service for The Theocracy or any other proper work to which he is assigned is thereby opening the way for the demons to completely control him. At the present time there are those amongst the consecrated who have children and who have failed to put them to work and who fail to even encourage them to work. They proceed upon the theory that the children must be left to their own desires for idleness and play. In this the parents are doing great injury to the children and their own selves. For the child’s protection and betterment every child should be taught God’s Word and the need to obey His commandments. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/41</span></p>

That which is today called “Christendom” is the antitype of the unfaithful Israelites. Both have turned to religion; both have forsaken the fountain of living waters, and drink at the fountains of so-called “wise men” who teach tradition, and which waters not only are brackish but contain the poison that leads to death. (Jer. 2:13; 17:13) The wise man takes the Bible for his guide because it is the only thing that illuminates his pathway. Knowledge of God and Christ is essential to all who would be wise.

<p><span class="font5">True to his name “Lightning”, with lightning speed Barak pursued the fleeing, discouraged army of Sisera. With his smaller army of only ten thousand men Barak did a good cleaning up of the job. At this point of the prophetic drama he played the part picturing Christ Jesus and his invisible army of heaven made up of the angelic host that follow after the victorious Christ Jesus. This picture shows that the invisible host actually in the battle of Armageddon literally complete the wrecking of the religious-dictatorial crowd that is determined to rule the world in defiance of God and that stands in the place of God’s Theocratic Government. In that complete cleanup, which the Lord will accomplish, all enemies of Jehovah God and of his Theocratic Government shall perish.

<p><span class="font5">All persons who fully agree to do God’s will and who are selected by Jehovah and taken out of the nations to be a witness to~his name are thus taken into the covenant with Jehovah God. That is a covenant by sacrifice. Those who make a covenant by sacrifice with Jehovah choose to follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, and they thereby agree to sacrifice every right and privilege that would conflict with Jehovah’s purpose. Since the selection of Jesus’ faithful apostles and their anointing at Pentecost till now many persons have agreed to do God’s will and have made a covenant by sacrifice. The covenant obligations of all those taken into the covenant require faithfulness in proclaiming the name and kingdom of Jehovah.

Then all who receive God’s approval must, as Job did, hold fast their integrity and stand blameless before the King. The suffering of Job foretells a climax of suffering of God’s faithful witnesses at the present time and amidst all of such sufferings the approved ones must hold fast their integrity. They must all speak the same thing, that is, this gospel of the Kingdom.

Modern religious practitioners seem to have forgotten that ancient battle of Megiddo. To them the Bible account is merely fiction or history in which they have no real interest. They are too wise in their own learning to give heed to what the Lord has said. Jehovah will not permit his enemies, that have so willfully and ruthlessly and without cause or excuse persecuted his faithful servants, to go down to death in peace or by a peaceful means. Those enemies shall perish at the hand of his Executioner under great violence, and they shall know that the Lord God, by his Executive Officer, Christ Jesus, executes them.

In matters pertaining to worldly affairs it seems instruction by a competent teacher in the schools is proper, but, as to God’s Word, it is the first and bounden duty of consecrated parents to teach their children. Consecrated parents must bring up their children 'fin the nurture ... of the Lord”; which means as God has commanded. They must bring them up in the “admonition of the Lord”; which means that advice, counsel and instruction must be given them in righteousness, as this instruction is set forth in God’s Word.

His “other sheep” shall live forever on the earth and will experience regeneration. A multitude of such are now living on the earth, and these hearing the message of life respond gladly and, proving their integrity, they shall live and never die. That blessed multitude was pictured by the sons of Noah that were carried safely over the flood. Their father Noah pictured the great Life-giver.

From these sources flames of malicious persecution have flared forth against Jehovah’s witnesses. Against such scorching flames the faithful have stood firm, refusing to yield to any part of the demonized organization. These witnesses have been taken into captivity, physically, in totalitarian-ruled countries, where they have been physically dragged and thrown into prison; many throughout the United States. All such wickedness, leveled against them, is in fulfillment of prophecy.

As to the punishment of religious practitioners, the individuals, the Lord will attend to that. Human creatures have nothing to do with that. It is no part of man’s work who has devoted himself to the Lord to punish others because of their belief or practicing of religion. Their duty is to tell the truth.

Acceptable service must be a willing service. Such is the proper and therefore exemplary course to be taken by the faithful. In line with this the apostle instructed Timothy, and hence all servants of the organization whom he pictured: “Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation.” (1 Tim. 4:12) The faithful ones must be “doers of the word, and not hearers only”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/41</span></p>

Christ’s faithful followers are violently ‘hated for his name’s sake’, even as Jesus foretold. (Matt. 24:9) Religion, politics, commerce, and their agencies unite in their efforts to heap violence upon all who boldly declare the name and kingdom of Jehovah. Freedom of worship of Almighty God has disappeared from the earth, and only Jehovah and his King give protection to those who love righteousness. It is certain that all of Jehovah’s witnesses and companions today would be slain by the violent ones were it not for the protection the Lord provides for them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/41</span></p>

The demonized religionists have started the fight and are keeping it up, and will continue to do so until Jehovah opens up the heavenly forces against the enemy and performs his “strange act”. The service to Jehovah by his witnesses proclaiming his name and kingdom must continue until the time for Jehovah to begin his “strange act”, and then there will be a real fight, which will be the last one. It will be much more than the enemy are expecting, and hence the enemy will know before it is done that it is the great Theocracy fighting by and through Christ Jesus, the King thereof, and that it is all under the co</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font5">and of Jehovah, the Almighty God.

<p><span class="font5">Jesus testified as to the authenticity of the law and all the holy prophets, and stated that upon these the two great commandments of God are based. (Matt. 11:13; 22 : 36-40) Having testified to the authenticity of the law and the prophets, which are set forth in the Holy Scriptures, and having stated that he received these truths from the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Alm</span><span class="font5">ighty God, his Father, Jesus summed up the matter in these authoritative words: “Thy word is truth.” (John 17:17) For more than three years the twelve apostles of Jesus were personally taught by him. God gave him those apostles, and all except one of them remained faithful. (John 17:6-10) At Pentecost, Peter the apostle, inspired and moved by God’s holy spirit, then and there testified that the Lord God had raised Jesus out of death, and at the same time cited the prophecy foretelling that great and marvelous act of God.—Acts 2:31-36.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God takes out from the nations a people for himself; which means that those thus taken out are to be used and must be used for his purpose. His purpose is that his name shall be proclaimed throughout the nations before Armageddon and such proclamation must be made by those whom God has selected. They must tell the people that Jehovah is the only true and almighty God and that Christ Jesus is the King of The Theocratic Government, and that such government is the only hope for peace and life of the people. Among Jehovah’s faithful people there are no strange gods, either of men or of angels. The faithful are devoted wholly to Jehovah, the only true and almighty God.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s manner of dealing with his creatures is for their good. He is entirely unselfish. He needs nothing from his creatures, because all things in heaven and earth are his. Jehovah places the truth before his creatures and permits them to voluntarily accept the same and willingly serve him or to reject his Word and suffer the consequences. He neither begs nor compels anyone to serve him. One cannot approach God unless he first has faith, that is, believes Jehovah is the Almighty God and that the creature receives His blessings only when he seeks those blessings. (Heb. 11:6) He rewards only those who diligently seek to know and do his will. He is no respecter of persons. He is making no effort to induce anyone to get into his organization and serve him. All who desire to know and serve God must do so voluntarily, and not by compulsion or undue influence. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There is but one way to heal the people of the nations which are now desirous of being healed, and that is the way which Jehovah God has provided. Christ Jesus, with his own precious lifeblood, has bought the human race. Those who believe in God and Christ and devote themselves to the Lord and obey his rules shall have the benefit of the means God has provided to give them life through Christ Jesus. There is no other means of salvation. Demonism, religion, and human philosophy are altogether in vain. Jehovah God is the “fountain of life”, and he administers life by and through Jesus Christ, and administers that life and attending blessings to those who faithfully obey and serve him.

It appears that in the last desperate stand the religionists, or demonized rulers, will attempt to prevent any and all in the “seas” from coming forth and fleeing to the “glorious holy mountain”, The Theocratic Government. It may be that at this point the Lord will open the eyes of multitudes, who will escape and find refuge under The Theocracy.

<p><span class="font5">There is one God Eternal, The Almighty, whose name is Jehovah. He is &quot;from everlasting to everlasting”. From him proceeds everything that is good. All his ways are perfect. God’s commandments are perfect, and if a man could at all times deport himself exactly in harmony with God’s law he would never make a mistake. (Ps. 19: 7-9) Jehovah God is the fountain of life and the Giver of life everlasting to them that obey him. Necessarily it follows that, if man makes some creature or thing a god to which he renders obeisance and obedience, he could never find or possess life everlasting. By reason of the goodness and loving-kindness of Almighty God this unchangeable commandment is given to all who have hope of life everlasting: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.”—Ex. 20: 3.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Understanding</span><span class="font5"> means that the creature has an appreciation of his own relationship to the Creator. When one starts in the right way, which is the way of wisdom, if he really desires to be wise he will continue to grow in knowledge, wisdom and understanding. The fear of God is the beginning of knowledge and wisdom, and the wise man always fears God. He will not content himself by starting to serve God, and then become indifferent. Some persons erroneously conclude that, they having taken the step of consecration and agreement to serve God, nothing further is needful. The wise man continuously searches the Bible and carefully and prayerfully meditates upon and studies it that he may keep in the way that leads to life everlasting. This instruction is given to all who will walk in wisdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those prophets had faith in God and in his coming government, The Theocracy, and prophesied of its coming. Because of their faithfulness they received God’s approval. Every one of those faithful men endured great affliction, which was heaped upon them by religionists and other dupes of the Devil, and all these faithful men are mentioned as valiant fighters. The Devil, in his effort to make effective his wicked challenge to Almighty God, fought against these faithful men, endeavoring to turn them away from God. In that fight the Devil employed religion, or demonism, as his chief instrument and applied physical force where he could not succeed by fraud and deception. Under the test those men remained true and showed faith and devotion to God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.—John 3:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Certainly this means not the salvation of individuals as a primary purpose, but means that God, for his name’s sake, would establish his Theocratic Government, the new heavens, and through it establish a new earth of righteousness, wherein dwelleth righteousness and where righteousness shall prevail and persist forever. Today God makes this matter so plain that The Theocracy stands out far and above everything else and is therefore of paramount importance, for the reason that it is The Theocracy that vindicates Jehovah’s name. This is “the everlasting covenant”, his unbreakable word that he would have a Seed that would honor his name, vindicate it, and provide a means of salvation to all those who willingly put themselves under The Theocracy and devote themselves to God and Christ. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This warrants the conclusion that at the blow upon Sisera’s head first delivered he raised himself up and offered what resistance he could under the conditions and then fell down dead. Whereupon Jael, with the tent pin, fastened his head to the ground. In like manner the Jonadabs abandon and shun religion and use the hammer of the Scriptures upon the religious rulers; which causes such religionists to writhe in agony and to rise up and attempt to resist and to howl in agony and to take all possible action against the Theocratic message, and then in the end they fall down and die. According to the Revised Version margin the text reads: “He fell down overpowered.&quot; The Kingdom message completely overpowers the religionists, and they are not able to answer today. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Exactly as Jesus foretold, his faithful followers, the witnesses of Jehovah, are now hated of all nations for his name’s sake. God’s covenant people are subjected to the enmity of both “the king of the north&quot; and “the king of the south”, and both of these kings are against The Theocracy; and those who are loyal and faithful to The Theocracy are pilgrims and strangers in the enemy’s country. The supporters of The Theocracy, therefore, must be entirely neutral as to all controversies between kings that rule under the demons’ influence. At the same time it is clearly Jehovah’s will that his covenant people now on earth and pictured by Daniel should diligently seek to gain an understanding of Daniel’s prophecy, which understanding brings to them great comfort. This prophecy clearly points to the early collapse of demon-rule. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/41</span></p>

They regarded the- covenant of the nation with Jehovah as an obligation to be kept. They were first to volunteer. (4: 6,10) Now the faithful covenant people of God go right out in the field where they can be seen and marked as a remnant of the people who are entirely for Jehovah and his Theocracy. They thereby make themselves the target for the enemy and expose themselves to the assaults of mobs led by religious priests and supported by other fanatics under demon influence.

<p><span class="font5">At all times Jehovah has magnified his word, keeping or performing it faithfully and completely. (Ps. 138:2) In the prophetic picture David represented Christ, the Beloved of Jehovah God and who is the Seed of promise. Jehovah’s covenant to bless men under certain conditions is an unbreakable promise and is certain. As God has made the sun to shine, just so certainly will he carry out and fully perform all the terms of that covenant to make Christ Jesus the Head of The Theocratic Government, from which all blessings shall flow to obedient human creatures. In his loving-kindness toward men Jehovah has doubly assured men of His purpose to fully perform his covenant. Not only does he give his word, but he binds his word with his oath.—Heb. 6:17, 18.

It was fear of Almighty God in her mind, fearing lest she should take her stand against the Almighty, the Righteous One, and the only One who gives life to those who do righteousness.

If you hope to live, and you now love the “Everlasting Father”, the King, you will willingly and joyfully give heed to his words and obey him. As prospective children of the King it is now your privilege and bounden duty to hasten to carry out the Lord’s commandment by carrying Jehovah’s message of hope to the people who will hear.

This is at least a suggestion that under The Theocracy men and women will seek the face of the Lord, the King, and beseech him to make the selection of the wife for the husband. Since Armageddon is near at hand it would seem wise for those who hope to be of the “great multitude” and therefore to fulfill the divine mandate to wait upon the Lord, seek his direction, and ask him to guide them and make selection of a companion. As the “great multitude” will carry out the divine mandate in righteousness they will need and greatly desire the direction of their “Wonderful Counsellor”, the King of glory.

It has seemed strange to the enemy, because the faithful ones have denounced religion as God’s enemy and continued to do so. The faithful have increased in their zeal and devotion, and it has been a time of joyful song in which they have sung and continue to sing the praises of Almighty God; and today that song of joy and victory is ever increasing in volume because the faithful servants of the Most High know that soon Jehovah shall vindicate his name and that he will bring about their complete deliverance.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is the Author of the song of victory. It is a song of praise. Songs of which he is the composer are always of praise, telling of deliverance of his devoted servants and glory to his own name. They are prophetic of the time when Jehovah manifests himself for the honor of his name. His faithful servants have always been oppressed by the enemy Satan and his agents; and when Jehovah’s servants wait upon the Most High and put their trust fully in him, then he in due time delivers them. The song of praise tells of such coming victory in a great conflict led by Christ Jesus, to the honor of his Father. The song expresses the joy of Jehovah’s organization at the early vindication of his name. The faithful servants of Christ Jesus have now entered into his joy and are now singing the praises of the Most High and of his kingdom.

The faithful remnant on earth and their companions, who survive Armageddon, shall see the Lord’s work and will tread upon what at one time was the strength of the enemy. Jehovah’s faithful servants now refuse to dishonor Almighty God by bowing down to or saluting officials, emblems, or images, and for this they are persecuted. Jehovah’s people will remain true and steadfast in their devotion to him, and ere long the things that are now the enemy’s strength shall be trodden down.

<p><span class="font5">A Christian is one who follows in the footsteps of Jesus Christ and joyfully obeys the commandments of Almighty God. All Christians must follow in Jesus’ footsteps. (1 Pet. 2:21) There is a wide difference between persons who have not made a covenant with the Lord and those who have covenanted to do his will. Those who enter into an agreement or covenant to be obedient to God, and who are accepted by him as followers of Christ Jesus, are entirely separate and distinct from others in the world. Only those who have strictly obeyed the Lord’s commandments have been saved from Satan’s influence and power. For this reason Christ’s faithful followers are instructed to ‘keep themselves unspotted from the world’. Therefore rules that nations make concerning their people in general cannot always apply to the one who is in a covenant to do God’s will.

<p><span class="font5">Religionists expect all the glory for themselves and to gratify themselves. Jehovah has clothed his servants now on the earth with the glory of the Kingdom service. He has given them a favor never before enjoyed by human creatures. The religionists, and the clergy particularly, would now strip them, if possible, of that glory and put it on themselves, that they might appear before the people as the legitimate representatives of the Lord. When Armageddon begins and the Lord Jesus Christ sends his forces against the Devil’s organization, the religious leaders will be the first to go down.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah gives full assurance to men that his Word shall not return unto him void, but shall be fully and completely performed and fulfilled. Such assurance is given that those who put their trust in him may have a sure anchorage for their hope. Those in a covenant with God to do his will must have food for the mind. God has furnished such food in abundance, and every word uttered by the Lord is truth and food for the mind. “Princes [worldly rulers] have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word. I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.” (Ps. 119:161, 162) “Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.”—Jer. 15:16.

<p><span class="font5">The name “Job” means “hated”; hence to be persecuted by the enemy. Those pictured by Job are hated by all adversaries or enemies of the Kingdom, which enemies are hostile or at enmity with and against the purposes for which the Job class is used. When God pronounced judgment against the Devil He said: “I will put enmity [hatred] between thee and the woman [picturing God’s universal organization], and between thy seed and her seed.” The seed of Jehovah’s organization is The Christ. Concerning that Seed it is written: “And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies [haters].” (Gen. 3:15; 22:17) Satan’s deadly enmity was shown toward the man Jesus. Satan repeatedly tried to bring about Jesus’ destruction. That was due to the fact that Jesus was at all times faithful and loyal to his Father. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">As long as the Devil is in existence and his organization operates every person who is diligent to maintain his integrity toward God and his kingdom will be the object of persecution by the blind guides of men and by all others of Satan’s instruments. The evildoers are headed for destruction. The lot of the evil or wicked is most undesirable and is shunned by all persons who desire righteousness. The end of the wicked is near. Their time is short. The day of Armageddon is near, and at that time all who remain on Satan’s side shall suffer destruction. The lot of those who have fled to the Theocratic organization is the blessed one. Finding refuge there and then remaining steadfastly on the Lord’s side, such persons pursuing the wise course are diligent to continuously do God’s will. Thus continuing faithful the Lord’s “other sheep” shall be brought through Armageddon and find everlasting life on the earth.

<p><span class="font5">This announces the rule that everyone should work. One who has covenanted to serve God and his kingdom must do works of righteousness. With him the Kingdom interests are all-important at all times. He will not content himself by devoting seven to ten hours per day to doing work in the office or factory of the Lord’s organization, or by going from house to house telling the people of the Kingdom. He will not divide his time and energy between such service work and other things out of harmony with the Kingdom. He will devote himself wholly and entirely to matters pertaining to the Kingdom; as it is written: “And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.”—Col. 3: 23.

<p><span class="font5">The power of Almighty God was used against them and doubtless he permitted some of them to escape for a time to carry out the completeness of the picture. The waters, rushing down from the high land of Megiddo, would force Sisera’s hosts to flee to the higher lands on the opposite side, leading them right into the trap which the Lord had set for them with the army of 10,000 Israelite soldiers with swords. Not one of the bodyguard or military staff of Captain Sisera was permitted to escape and flee with him. Sisera had to hit out for the hills on foot, alone. The religious leaders will find themselves in the same predicament. Some of his army got out of the flood and fled as far as Endor and perished there. This is a symbol of those who flee to demons or demon representatives and who shall come to an untimely end. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/11</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Those who go out to battle against the enemies of God’s covenant people are the ones who should receive the abundant blessings of the Lord and who therefore refresh themselves at the watering places. Such faithful and zealous ones are in a position to appreciate the manifold blessings of the Lord and to tell about them. They do tell of the Lord’s work of vindicating his name against all unrighteousness. They are privileged to tell others how religion has misrepresented Jehovah and brought great reproach upon his name. They have many thrilling and blessed experiences in going about among the people and telling of the righteousness of Jehovah and the blessings that The Theocratic Government will bring. They refresh themselves from the waters of revealed truths. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/11</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The fact that in all the nations Jehovah’s witnesses are now hated and persecuted is strong evidence that the witness work is about completed and that Armageddon is very near. Because many have forgotten God and become enemies of God and of his servants the words of the prophet (Ps. 119:139) now apply to them: “My zeal hath consumed me; because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.” The remnant of God’s “holy nation” still on earth have not forgotten God. The Lord’s “other sheep” now fleeing to the antitypieal “city of refuge” do not forget God and his “wonderful works to the children of men”. Such “other sheep” continue faithful and in due time will form the “great multitude” and constitute the “nations” that shall carry out the divine mandate.

That means that the rule of the earth, both invisible and also visible, shall be in righteousness. The righteous Ruler, Christ Jesus, shall ever be invisible to human eyes, but will have his representatives acting in righteousness who will be visible to human eyes. Almighty God Jehovah is the King of Eternity and is invisible. Christ Jesus is “the express image” of Jehovah and likewise invisible to human eyes. He is Jehovah’s duly anointed </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font5">g of The Theocratic Government.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel... have likewise foretold of these days.—Acts 3:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Samuel was a child of parents who were devoted to and served God. His mother consecrated Samuel to Jehovah before Samuel’s birth, and when the babe was weaned she handed him over to God’s service. That was a specific instance in which the child was taught from his youth up to have faith in and to serve God, and from that he never departed. He was yet a child when God called him to be a prophet and thereafter God used him as a prophet. Samuel was faithful unto the end and repeatedly warned the Israelites against demonism or religion. He judged Israel with a righteous judgment, always showing his devotion to God. Samuel prophesied the coming of The Theocratic Government and of the King thereof and the setting up of that kingdom in power and glory. He received God’s approved. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Seeing that certain tribes of the typical people of Jehovah God missed their greatest opportunity by remaining inactive during an emergency in the days of Barak and Deborah, and that their action was of sufficient importance to have it recorded in the prophecy, every consecrated person today should ask himself, Why did Jehovah call attention to the derelictions of some? and why did he emphasize the course of action taken by others who joined in the Song of Victory? God caused those things to be recorded to show the consecrated today their privilege of having a part in vindicating his name and to emphasize the fact that all protection and salvation proceed from God and none comes from any other source. The loving-kindness of the Lord is manifest at all times to those who are diligent to do his will. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Gen. 9:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To all his covenant people God commands: “Thou shalt not kill.” (Ex. 20:13) “Vengeance is mine; I will repay.” (Rom. 12:19) God’s law fixes the death penalty for anyone who willfully violates that commandment. His law provides for the execution of the violators of his law. Human life can be properly taken only by God’s specific provision. He has appointed his Executioner. The slaughtering of human creatures in war or otherwise is a violation of God’s covenant concerning the sanctity of life That is an everlasting covenant, not subject to change. No one can break God’s covenant and escape the penalty prescribed for so doing. With stronger force does this rule apply to everyone who is taken into a covenant with the Lord God to be a witness to his name.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.—Judg. 4:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The issue back there was between demons, of whom the Devil is chief, and Jehovah; that is, between religion or demon-worship and the obedience to and worship of Jehovah God. Today religion, with its advocates, has become dead and a dead factor to the people of good-will toward God. That was the condition of Sisera when the tent nail went through his temple. Persons who love righteousness and hate wickedness are dead against religion now because it is the product of Satan and leads to death, whereas the worship of Almighty God and Christ Jesus leads to life. People of good-will must choose between the Devil and Jehovah; therefore they must abandon religion and turn fully to Christianity, if they would live. They must slay religion by taking a bold, uncompromising stand against it and by declaring to others that religion is a deadly enemy.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.—Acts 5:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those faithful apostles of the Lord, because they persisted in keeping their covenant with God and obeying God’s commandments rather than men, were arrested, ill-used, thrown into prison, and beaten. When released from prison they went straightway forward in preaching the gospel in obedience to God’s commandment. They did not fear what men might do; they feared God and obeyed him. Suppose they had taken a compromising course by obeying commandments of men, in order to avoid bodily punishment, and yet preached the gospel on the sly, when rulers might not find it out. That compromising course would have constituted a failure to keep covenant with God, breaking their covenant because of fear of men. The fear of man leads into Satan’s snare, which means everlasting destruction. That same rule applies to all today. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jael gave him milk, not as an act of giving aid to the enemy of Jehovah’s people, but to put him to sleep and thereby to disarm him that she might carry out her purpose in favor of The Theocracy. Milk, when warm, or buttermilk, has a tendency to put to sleep one who is tired. Likewise the Jonadabs hand to the enemy the “milk of God’s Word” as set forth in the Scriptures and the Scriptural explanation. This confounds the enemy and disarms them and puts them to sleep mentally. When one is taken to task by a religionist and hands the simple word of God in reply to him, the religionist is so confused that he cannot answer; hence he is mentally asleep. Jael pictured this by serving Sisera with milk. She brought it forth “in a lordly dish”.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah draws a striking contrast between the enemies of The Theocracy, that yield to flattery and do wickedly against The Theocracy, and those who faithfully support The Theocratic Government. The faithful servants of Jehovah engage, by his grace, in God’s “strange work”. These do know their God and rejoice in serving him. Such are Jehovah’s witnesses to whom He has been pleased in recent years to reveal himself and his purposes, and he has made them “strong in the Lord and in the power of his might”. He has made them strong in faith and in works and to stand up against the totalitarian forces of the demons, and to refuse to have anything in common with covenant-breaking religionists. God has made them strong to stick to and proclaim the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus his King. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/11</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In 1914 Christ Jesus was enthroned King and sent forth to rule, and immediately there began a “war in heaven”, resulting in the ousting of the Devil and his angels and the casting of them down to the earth. God’s faithful people thereafter willingly offered themselves unto the Lord in his service. Christ Jesus took the lead, and whithersoever he leads the faithful servants on earth follow. In the prophetic drama the ‘leaders” were Barak and Deborah, picturing Christ Jesus and God’s organization. In the drama’s fulfillment Christ Jesus, the King, and his heavenly army take the lead and all those on earth who are Jehovah’s witnesses voluntarily offer themselves, entering the service of the King and joyfully performing that service.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Prov. 4:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If one follows the admonition to “study” (2 Tim. 2:15), he gains understanding. He must walk in the way of wisdom in order to gam understanding. In no other way can man have a proper appreciation of his own relationship to the almighty Creator. Therefore, with all his getting he is admonished to get understanding. The wise man knows that God’s will is perfect and if he would continue to walk in wisdom and to increase in understanding he must learn God’s will concerning himself and then he must strive to do it. The wise man therefore turns to Jesus, the perfect One, who is also above, and looks up to him that he may learn by studying the course which Jesus takes. He hears Jesus’ words: “I delight to do thy will, 0 my God.” He immediately sees the need of his own agreement to do God’s will. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/41</span></p>

This ‘Ting” has had his day in which he had permission to “have indignation against the holy covenant” (vs. 30); and at Armageddon it is his turn to experience the indignation from the side of the Holy Covenant, to wit, the Lord. It is Jehovah’s “strange act” at that battle that is determined; and nothing can interfere with or prevent it. Jehovah will make a final end of all that are opposed to the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. Daniel may be back on the earth at any time now and he, together with Jehovah’s faithful covenant people, will know what course to take at that time of the beginning of tribulation. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The two “kings” succeeded in taking away this “daily sacrifice” in 1918, during the World War, and under the pretext that the same hindered the war. After the war “the king of the north” continued to hinder and take away the “daily sacrifice” or service of Jehovah by his faithful witnesses. Now both kings, under demon influence and power, continue to suppress the message of The Theocratic Government and both look forward to the time near when they shall be able to say: “Peace and safety”; particularly for the religious element thereof. Everywhere the totalitarianreligious crowd are against God’s true worship because that worship is to worship God in spirit and in truth and emphasizes the great truth that the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus is the only hope of humankind.

The word of God should never be passed over lightly, but should be soberly considered. Here is an admonition forcibly addressed to all who have made a covenant with the Lord, and particularly those who are not performing their duties and privileges. The Scriptures and the physical facts which apply to them should always be considered together. One in a covenant with Jehovah should face the facts and take them to heart as to their significance and then after calm meditation act properly, seeking the wisdom that comes from above.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah compels no one to take the course, but he leaves the way open to all who voluntarily and freely come out and make known that they are on the side of Jehovah and his government of righteousness. But how about those who hear the message and remain silent, indifferent and negligent, concluding that they had better keep quiet in order to make the way of the present time easier for themselves? Can one who now hears the name of Jehovah and understands that his final reckoning is near remain quiet, indifferent or negligent concerning the same and expect to receive Jehovah’s protection?

He is perfect in wisdom and knows the end from the beginning: &quot;Known unto God are all his works, from the beginning of the world.” (Acts 15: 18) It was the great Jehovah who caused these prophecies to be written according to his will. The true prophet of God is one who speaks as he is directed by Jehovah’s power to speak. He does not utter man’s message, but utters God’s message. Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s great Prophet, who speaks with authority from his Father. True prophecy is recorded authoritative words declaring things that must come to pass in future days. At the time the men who uttered or recorded the prophecies did not understand the meaning thereof.

<p><span class="font5">Indulging in any ceremony or practice whatsoever contrary to the commandment of God is religious. Religion originated with the demons of which Satan is the chief. It has at all times been used to ensnare and has ensnared multitudes of people and kept them blind to God’s will or commandment. Religion has been the moving influence for the persecution and violent treatment of others, and particularly of Christians. Christians are those who do God’s will as commanded in His Word. They are called “Christians” because Christ Jesus is always obedient to God’s will and he is the Head and Leader of all who are diligent to obey God’s commandments. Christians are therefore commanded to avoid anything and all things contrary to his commandments. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/4=1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">To safeguard his covenant people from demon-worship Jehovah commanded them to have nothing to do with other gods, lest they be ensnared by such. God emphasized this law or commandment to his covenant people by saying to them: “Neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.” (Deut. 7:16) His commandment further emphasized his instruction that his covenant people must have nothing to do with graven images or even have a desire for them. (Deut. 7: 25) God being the Fountain of life and the only source of life, and life being granted upon condition of obedience, it was his Word of great loving-kindness that provided for the protection of his covenant people by commanding them to refrain completely from giving any worship to any creature or thing. Israel violated God’s covenant, and that nation was destroyed. Willful disobedience to his commands means death to the creature.

Such prophetic dramas were recorded and are now made understandable by those who love God and his kingdom that their faith might now be made strong, that they might receive comfort and increase their hope, and that they might remain immovable, on the side of God, and prove that Satan's challenge to Jehovah was false and extremely wicked. In this way the faithful have the opportunity of participating in the vindication of Jehovah's name.

They have ignored the antitypieal Deborah, the organization of the Lord, and have disregarded the call of the Greater Barak. They have failed to see that the service of the King and the Kingdom is the greatest privilege and opportunity any could have. Yet at the same time they have claimed to be consecrated to God.

Their suffering shall not continue long, and those who suffer because of their faithfulness for Jehovah now with joy hear the words of Jesus: ‘He that endureth to the end shall be saved.’ (Matt. 24:13) The flesh of all God’s servants is weak and inclined to fret because of the great amount of injustice done and heaped upon them by religionists. They see this injustice daily growing and wickedness on the increase. The Lord knew that such would be the conditions now, and for the comfort of his faithful covenant people he caused his prophet to record: “Fret not thyself because of evil doers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.”—Vs. 1. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/41</span></p>

Just how and when the final warning will be given no man can now tell.

<p><span class="font5">The Lord compels no one to serve him, but offers his blessings to those who desire to do right and are anxious to see the righteous government in full control of the world. Such-prospective children are diligent to learn what is his will concerning them and they hasten to do his will. Because they took the side of The Theocracy and have proclaimed the name of the great King, they are bitterly opposed by the demons and demonized men. The King’s prospective children must, under that crucial test, remain firm and steadfast for the King and his kingdom. If they do so until the test is completed at Armageddon, then they become the children of “The Everlasting Father” and enter into the abundant blessings which Jehovah has prepared for them from the foundation of the world.

<p><span class="font5">Be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear.—1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s faithful covenant people answer: “If we suffer death because of our faithfulness to Almighty God and the terms of our covenant, we have the sure promise from God that he will resurrect us to eternal life. If we violate our covenant with Jehovah we suffer eternal death, from which there is no resurrection. For us there is but one choice, and that is to faithfully perform our covenant obligations to Jehovah and his King. If we suffer punishment at your hands because we stand firmly and perform the terms of our covenant, God will punish you and you will find no way of escape from that punishment. We will do harm to no one, but Almighty God, whom we serve, will see to it that if we are wronged we shall be avenged, because he has so promised. He always keeps his promise.” —Luke 18:7, 8. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Resist the devil, and he will flee.—Jas. 4:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those watching the developments of present-day affairs see evidence of a retrograde movement to moral delinquency. Undue familiarity, at first intended to be innocent and appearing as such, often opens the gate to greater dangers. Seductive methods are at work, and debauchery is certain to result unless those wrongful methods are strongly resisted. The demons set snares. Into such snares the careless are led and, once in them, find it difficult to extricate themselves. Carelessness and loose conduct tighten the snare about them. This is one of the great dangers to God’s covenant people. The Lord sounds the warning: ‘As it was in Noah’s day, so shall it be also in the day of the Son of man.’ God’s covenant people must take warning and give heed to the Lord’s warning if they would safeguard themselves from the assaults of the demons. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thy kingdom come.—Luke 11:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There can be no peace and joy among the peoples as long as the wicked bear rule. There is no hope for anyone who holds to and supports that wicked rule. At Armageddon, which is near, Christ Jesus will destroy the wicked, clear them off the earth, and make the way for righteousness and righteous rule to ever thereafter follow. That is the hope of humankind. In righteousness Christ the invisible King will rule in full harmony with God’s will. On earth the faithful men of old, resurrected and made perfect, will execute the orders of The Christ and do so always in righteousness. Only those who love righteousness and hate iniquity will survive, and then all such will rejoice and give praise to the Most High. Today the wise will heed God’s Word and flee to The Theocratic Government, and will there find safety during Armageddon, and after Armageddon enter into complete joy under the righteous rule of The Theocracy. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Now is our salvation nearer.—Rom. 13:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The combined and official enemy, led by Satan and his chief officer Gog, know that the great climax is at hand, even though millions of hangers-on do not realize that fact. It is certain that the Devil knows that his time is short (Rev. 12:12), and, knowing this, he musters all his forces in his efforts to destroy those who support The Theocracy. In most of the countries of the earth what appears to be a successful movement to suppress the Kingdom message has been accomplished. Such, however, instead of causing dismay among the faithful, only adds strength to their faith and zeal, because they know the day of Jehovah’s victory through Christ, and the deliverance of his faithful servants, is at hand. They have no doubt as to the result. They are fully determined to maintain their integrity toward Jehovah, and they trust him to provide all needed strength.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.—Judg. 4:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Divine Record gives all the glory, honor and praise to Jehovah for that deadly war where Barak and Deborah served. Likewise at the battle of Armageddon no follower of Christ Jesus on the earth will use physical force against any earthly government or organization and no Christian will have claim to or receive any honor and glory for the destruction of wicked rule. Christ Jesus, the Executioner of Jehovah’s purpose, together with his invisible army, will do the slaying. Therefore the Scriptures declare that God fights against all his enemies and that all his enemies “shall lick the dust”, that is, shall suffer destruction. When will he put an end to wickedness ? Psalm 92:7, 8 answers that at the time ‘when the wicked spring up like grass and the lawless flourish’. That is now, because never was there so much wickedness. That means that Armageddon is very near. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 9:19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The nations have forgotten that God long ago declared his purpose to rule the world by Christ Jesus and that God gave warning to all rulers to receive and support Christ the King, or otherwise suffer the consequences. Instead of supporting the King, the nations fight against him and against Jehovah and persecute those servants of God who tell the people of his righteous government, The Theocracy. In every nation the servants of Jehovah and His King are persecuted, and the Lord Jesus Christ counts such treatment as done unto himself. It is certain, therefore, that all nations shall soon know that Jehovah is the Mighty God and that puny man cannot successfully fight against him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Redemption is not for every man whether that man believes or not. Redemption is only for those who believe on the Lord and who obey his commandments. While it is true that Christ Jesus tasted death for every man (Heb. 2:9), that means for every man who will obey the Lord. God is no respecter of persons, and his rules apply to all; therefore the ransom sacrifice is for all men that believe and obey the laws of God. God does not compel anyone to believe, nor does he bestow life on anyone contrary to that person’s desire. “God is love”; which means he is entirely unselfish. He is self-contained and needs no</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">thin</span><span class="font5">g from any creature, but is entirely unselfish, and in his loving-kindness he has provided a way to escape eternal death and receive life everlasting. That way is by always looking up. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hear, 0 ye kings; give ear, 0 ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto Jehovah.—Judg. 5:3, Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That means that Christ Jesus, the Greater Barak, and his organization, invisible and visible, will continue to sing the song of praise and victory to Jehovah, regardless of whether the “kings” and the “princes”, the judges and the sheriffs, and other officers of “Christendom” like it or not. The name and kingdom of Jehovah must be and is proclaimed throughout the earth, and that work must continue until Armageddon. As God plainly declared this must be done, therefore he said to the Devil and all who support him: ‘For this cause have I permitted thee to remain, that I might show thee my power, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.’ (Ex. 9:16) The proclamation of his name must continue, therefore, until his time to exhibit his supreme power against Satan and his organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed above women isJael, wife of Heber the Kenite, above women in the tent she is blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Judg. 5:24, Young.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jael’s marriage to Heber served to identify her as a non-Israelite and as a relative of the prophet Moses, one of the princes who shall rule in the earth. Hence she is a fitting symbol of the “great multitude”, now the active “companions” of the spiritual Israelites, and which multitude shall be for ever with the “princes”. Thus was Jael classified among the “blessed” who shall, together with the “princes”, live forever on the earth. She was a worthy example to her tribal relatives, the Jonadabs, the sons of Rechab, who dwelt in tents. (Jer. 35 6-19) The blessing of Jael makes her correspond with the Lord’s “other sheep”, to whom Christ Jesus says: “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom [The Theocracy] prepared for you from the foundation of the world.”—Matt. 25: 34.

<p><span class="font5">Today Jehovah’s covenant people are taking a course like that marked out by other faithful men that have gone before, and these modern faithful followers of Christ Jesus may confidently expect to receive the approval of Almighty God for so doing. If they suffer punishment because of their constant faithfulness and obedience to God’s commandments, they know that others who have gone before them have likewise suffered for faithfulness and have received Jehovah’s approval. The suffering will not be for long, because this is the day of Jehovah and soon he shall completely wipe out all his enemies and deliver his faithful servants and grant unto them life everlasting and all attending blessings. Have faith in God and continue to obey his co</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font5">andments, and live. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them.—Luke 18:7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is certain to avenge his faithful covenant people, because he has given his word that he will do so. Jesus emphasized this great truth, and then added these words: “When the Son of man cometh, shall he find [such] faith on the earth ?” This clearly indicates that a small number, comparatively, will have such faith. The “remnant” of Jehovah’s anointed people on earth do have such faith. The Lord’s “other sheep”, who are now being rapidly gathered unto the Lord, share with the remnant in that faith. These shall be avenged and, together, all these now by faith are singing the victory song and singing: “Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.” (Rev. 7:9,10) They prove their faith by the course of action taken. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">That woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, ... I will cast her . . . into great tribulation.—Rev. 2:20-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Seduction” is the act of leading aside or astray from the path of rectitude, virtue and duty, and into paths of evil, to corrupt men. “Debauch” means to degrade and corrupt, and is usually the result of seduction. In Noah’s day and up to the time of the flood Satan and his associate demons seduced angels and human creatures. The result was that both were debauched and the offspring of that action were morally delinquent to the extreme: “for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.” (Gen. 6:12) There was a clear line of demarcation or distinction between “all flesh . . . upon the earth” and the eight persons of Noah’s family, these being the exception. That was in Noah’s day, and, says Jesus, “so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord.—Deut. 4:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Word of God is complete and needs nothing to be added to or taken away from it. God is the fountain of life, and his Word points out the way to life. The wise person is one who follows the guide which God has provided for him. That person may be unlearned in things of this world, but if he seeks righteousness and meekness at the mouth of God he becomes wiser than the learned religionists who attempt to teach the people their theories: “Thou, through thy commandments, hast made me wiser than mine enemies [than my religious teachers] : for they are ever with me. I have more understanding than all my teachers; for thy testimonies are my meditation. I understand more than the ancients; because I keep thy precepts.”— Ps. 119:98-100.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Dan. 11:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This foretells the setting up by Satan and his agents of a mimic or substitute for Jehovah’s Theocratic Government. The purpose is to desolate Jehovah’s servants and to bring about the desolation or destruction of all the people at Armageddon, thus desolating all the earth. That “abomination” represents an offering, presumably to God and Christ, and is claimed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to be so offered; but in fact it is actually offered to the demons, the chief of which is “the god of this world”, Satan. To partake of that offering means to partake of the “table of devils”. The “daily sacrifice” is a living sacrifice on the part of God’s anointed servants in that these serve him by proclaiming “this gospel of the kingdom” and give praise to him with their lips.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The end shall be at the time appointed.—Dan. 11:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The time of the end” must mean a time when that which opposes Almighty God and continues to do so without interruption or hindrance from God comes to an end; and that is when the divine hindrance of the wicked rule begins. There are two positive lines of Scriptural proof showing “the time of the end” began in A.D. 1914. Just how long thereafter the final end comes is not revealed to creatures up to the present time. No one has authority to attempt to say just what day or hour the final end arrives. From the beginning of “the time of the end” forward the name of Jehovah and his kingdom must be proclaimed as a witness to the nations of earth, and when that is done then shall the final end come. By the circumstances and physical facts now observed the fulfillment of the prophecy strongly indicates that the final end is very near. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/41</span></p>

The admonition is addressed to those who profess to be in a covenant with God to do his will but who insist that it is their privilege to take it easy and let someone else do the witness work in the field. These excuse themselves and do not ordinarily tramp from door to door to publish the Kingdom. They are too delicate and refined to set foot on the ground.

<p><span class="font5">Paying tribute to an anti-theocratic foreign power was out of order with that faithful tribe. It is so with God’s covenant people today. Issaehar’s tribe foreshadowed the faithful ones of this time who recognize only Jehovah God and Christ Jesus as the Higher Powers. The tribe of Issachar was right with Barak in overthrowing the power and breaking the grip of the Canaanites upon God’s people. This they did because it was God’s will and command that they do so. Likewise the faithful followers of Christ today attribute praise, honor, glory and salvation to Jehovah and shun religion or demonism. Issachar, therefore, foreshadowed that company of Christian people who give their undivided and unstinted devotion to Jehovah and his King.

Why give advantage to the enemy by having fellowship with the works of wickedness and the works of iniquity? To associate with the workers of iniquity or wickedness is to open the door to the demons, inviting them to come in and assault you, and is therefore equivalent to laying down the weapons of defense which the Lord has provided for his people. The conflict today is a real one between the demons and God’s covenant people. There could be no compromise and nothing in common between them. Those who receive God’s protection and final approval must seek righteousness and do what is right at all times, and not merely a part of the time. Both mind and hands must be employed in works of righteousness all the time in order to successfully withstand the enemy assaults. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/41</span></p>

God has given his word that the earth shall be populated with righteous people. The sons of Noah made a picture related to that divine mandate as carried out. The children of the King shall fulfill that divine mandate in reality and completeness to the Lord’s glory.

<p><span class="font5">Because Paul kept the obligation of his covenant faithfully he suffered many stripes and imprisonment; but still he continued preaching Christ and his Kingdom, while he lingered behind prison walls. At one time he had much of this world’s goods and honor, all of which he gladly sacrificed, not counting even his human life as dear to him, in order that he might fulfill the terms of his covenant. Paul held fast his integrity, and when he came to the end of his earthly journey he said to his fellow covenant-keepers: “All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.” “I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day.”—2 Tim. 3:12; 4: 7, 8. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/41</span></p>

(Job 1:5; 42:8,9) As Job was rendered childless and made exceedingly poor, so the man Jesus was made materially poor and childless and was subjected to all manner of persecution. Through it all Jesus held fast his integrity. Though reproached and persecuted by Satan and his agents, and also made to appear as afflicted by Jehovah, even as Job suffered and was made to appear, Jesus remained true and steadfast and loyal in his devotion to Jehovah.—Matt. 8: 20; 2 Cor. 8:9; Isa. 53: 2-4.

If you have taken your stand on the side of God and his kingdom, see to it that you are continuously loyal and faithful to The Theocracy, walk in the way of the Lord, and continue to pray unto God through Christ Jesus. “Seek meekness,” by being willing to learn and diligent to ascertain God’s will.

All these chose life, joyfully obeyed the Lord, and receive life everlasting. Their eternity is spent in the spirit with Christ Jesus. But Jehovah provided long ago that under the King of The Theocracy there should be others who would receive life as human creatures and continue to live for ever on the earth, and who shall fill the earth with a righteous race. They must choose the way they will go, even as the faithful spirit class must choose. The first essential is to fear Jehovah God; and the promise is that He will teach such “the way that he shall choose”, and, choosing right and doing right, “his soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.”—Ps. 25:12,13.

Some of these by their words claimed to have faith in God and Christ, but their actions completely deny their words. Claiming to have faith is not at all sufficient, because faith without works, that is, without activity in support of Jehovah’s announced purpose, is dead. One must prove his faith by obediently carrying out God’s commandments. Failing or refusing to do so puts such a one in the class of the wicked. A person who claims to be serving God, and yet who does what he can to hinder the progress of the proclamation of the Theocratic message, is an enemy of God, and hence wicked.

<p><span class="font5">The chief reason for God’s covenant people to now be on earth is to bear witness to Jehovah’s name and his kingdom. Both parents and children that have covenanted to do God’s will will see to it that they faithfully bear testimony to his name and kingdom. To that end let such bear testimony before the boards of education or school boards that have taken occasion to expel the children and deny them the privilege of a common-school education because of their faithfulness to God. The tendency necessarily will be to fix in the mind of the people that their hope must rest in God and that they must be obedient to him and his kingdom, if they would live. Render unto the state the things which belong to it, and render unto Jehovah the things that are God’s. Place the name and kingdom of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus his King above all things. Remain firm and steadfast in your devotion to The Theocracy and wait upon God. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/41</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. —Prov. 9:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sincere man perceives the truth that the great Creator is One in whom resides all power over life. Therefore he fears to take any course contrary to the will of the Almighty God, who gives life. He having such proper fear, that marks the beginning of knowledge of the truth with that man. Where does he go to obtain more knowledge of the truth concerning Jehovah? Jesus answers: “Thy word [expressed in the Bible] is [the] truth.” The man who sincerely desires to be wise desires to take and does take the proper course. Fearing God and fearing to go in the wrong way if he follows his own inclinations, that man seeks to learn what is God’s will concerning him, and he goes to God’s Word, which is the Bible, to find out. It is his genuine fear of Almighty God that starts him in the way of wisdom. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Some . . . shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.—Dan. 11:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why has the Lord permitted the fallen ones to try to pull others down with them and to turn them away from the Theocratic organization and Government? At the temple judgment the Lord permits such things to come to pass to make manifest who is immovable and who is steadfast for The Theocracy. The fiery trials that come upon Jehovah’s people have the effect of purging and cleansing the visible part of his Theocratic organization and those who are associated with it. Such cleansing or purging work continues until the Lord’s “strange work” is completed and his “strange act” is made manifest at Armageddon. When his faithful servants see the unfaithful cleared out they are drawn even nearer to the Lord and the Lord causes them to shine brightly in his organization and in his service.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Now when they shall fall, they shall be holden with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.—Dan. 11:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The demons try their flattering schemes upon Jehovah’s witnesses. “The king of the north” and its agents and representatives thereby hope to corrupt them by inducing them to compromise with the Devil, as Satan attempted to do to corrupt Christ Jesus at the mount of temptation. Some officials of “the king of the north”, particularly the diplomatic ones, try to induce Jehovah’s servants by flattery and flattering words to compromise by having part in creature worship and paying homage to creatures. The faithful refuse to yield. There are flatterers among the “elective elder” class. Those who have taken the wise course are being subjected to the severe test, and all who will come off victorious must continue to hold fast their integrity. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Judg. 5:7, Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The persecution that resulted from the World War caused almost all, if not all, of the consecrated then to fear man, because it was believed that the “Higher Powers” were the worldly rulers over nations. Many of God’s servants desired to lead off in active service of the Kingdom, but were arrested, imprisoned and thus prevented from doing so, while others were forcibly restrained. Still others who had been leaders went into inactivity, that is, remained silent. Deborah’s prophetic song shows what results from fear of men. One who has made a covenant to do God’s will and who then because of fear of men fails or refuses to faithfully carry out that covenant is certain to be ensnared by the enemy. Those who are in a covenant to do the will of God, however, should weigh well the results that come from fear of men. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Now in the fulfillment of the prophecy Jehovah performed his righteous acts in behalf of his “woman”, his organization, pictured by Deborah and under Christ Jesus, the Greater Barak. Jehovah’s faithful witnesses learn that now the great prophecy is in course of fulfillment; and that gives them joy. When these precious truths are made known to them they joyfully carry the message abroad and tell it to all who have the hearing ear. Such faithful, zealous field workers, as servants of the great Theocracy, are strengthened by Jehovah and they put forth greater efforts in his service. Each trying experience aids the faithful to meet other difficult tasks, which likewise brings them increasing joy. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Who is willing to proclaim the truth now in this hour of the world’s great distress? Only those with full faith and confidence in Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus. Amidst the most murderous assault ever committed upon a freedom-loving people the faithful Christians raise high the banner of The Theocracy and boldly and fearlessly point to that government as the only hope of humankind. These faithful Christians have no fight with earthly governments, but their fight is for righteousness to aid the people to see the only hope of salvation. The faith and confidence of those faithful servants of the Most High will be rewarded by Jehovah God, and The Theocracy is their refuge and strength. “Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When a person enters into a covenant with Jehovah he is bound to perform the terms of that covenant. He cannot with impunity fail or neglect to perform. As opportunity to perform is given that performance must be forthcoming. When there is difficulty between the nations of earth God’s people have no part in it and remain neutral; but when God commands his covenant people to do certain things they must perform their duty toward his covenant people. He has commanded all such to preach “this gospel of the kingdom”, and there is no excuse to fail or refuse to do so. The curse pronounced against Meroz, without doubt, refers to the iniquities and indifference of some of the consecrated at the present time.

<p><span class="font5">The rules laid down in the Scriptures for the benefit of the spiritual class of God’s covenant people likewise apply to the Lord’s “other sheep”. God changes not, nor do his rules change. (Mal. 3:6) God is no respecter of persons. (Acts 10: 34) All who live must come under the same rules. What shall the people of God shim? Everything.that tends to corrupt the mind and body must be shunned and avoided. Uncleanness, fornication, lasciviousness, and suchlike. (2 Cor. 12:21) The “works of the flesh”, specially enumerated by the apostle at Galatians 5:17-21, must be shunned. The way that is traveled by the peoples of the world who are not in a covenant with God must be shunned by those who are in a covenant with him. The ways of darkness and death must be shunned. The warfare today is with the demons. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Covenant by sacrifice” means the giving up of everything pertaining to the earth, the sacrifice of the individual human will to the complete doing of the will of Almighty God. The man thus doing knows he is going right and walking in the way that leads to everlasting life. To those who will be of the Kingdom the covenant by sacrifice means the giving up of the right to live as human creatures on earth. To such the assurance is given that if he continues faithful in keeping his covenant he shall in due time receive from the Lord everlasting life in the spirit, at the resurrection. From the standpoint of the world the faithful covenant-keepers go into death in ignominy and dishonor. But God raises up such to life, honor and glory. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God has risen up and sends forth his witnesses to carry his message of truth from house to house to all those who hunger for the truth, that they may have opportunity to hear and to find the way to life. The prophecy of Isaiah 28:21 is now being fulfilled. Jehovah is doing his “strange work”, and he gives his humble and faithful people a part in that work. This work of testifying to the name and to The Theocratic Government of Jehovah must be completed, and then quickly will follow his “strange act”, which means the destruction of Satan’s organization. The people must choose between the leadership of men, such as religionists and evolutionists, and the perfect guide, Jehovah, and his Word. “Choose you this day whom ye will serve.”—Josh. 24:15.

<p><span class="font5">In due time righteous men shall live forever on earth, and have an organization that shall govern in righteousness. That organization will not be a democracy, but a government representative of the great Theocracy, acting under direct supervision of the King of the great Theocratic Government. That representative government will be visible to human eyes, and the people will receive the laws and instructions through those visible representatives. A “prince” is a sovereign ruler appointed by and acting under the direct command of the supreme or higher powers. “The Higher Powers” are Jehovah and Christ Jesus his King. The chief ruler amongst men appointed by the Lord is a “prince”. The faithful men of old complied with the divine rules and received God’s approval. Their record proves that when resurrected they are qualified to represent The Theocracy on the earth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/41</span></p>

They will follow the example of the “Sun of righteousness” and will in this hour of gross darkness upon the world let their light shine concerning the Theocratic government and will let that light be so used as to make manifest the hidden things of darkness. (Eph. 5:13) Nothing now shall stop them. They will come forth as willing volunteers for The Theocracy, and will boldly let their light shine as does the sun, giving their all in complete, loving devotion to the Most High and his King. All who love him shall sing his praises now, regardless of violent opposition leveled against them. “Praise ye him, sun and moon.” —Ps. 148:3.

<p><span class="font5">The fact that the Divine Record emphasizes the movement of this little army “on foot” well fits the present-day condition, that there is a great deal of foot work in the house-to-house service. These servants of the Lord must walk. The Lord contrasts this with the ones who take it easy, when he says: “Ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way [well-beaten, smooth roads].” (Verse 10) Such are the ones that take the easy way, and these have something to meditate about. The captain of Jabin’s army rode into the valley in great state. Shortly thereafter that overconfident military leader had to hop down from his chariot and take it on foot. The Lord made the enemy do some walking. That foretells they will be on the run at Armageddon, on foot or any other way they can go.

The mimic theocracy set up by “the king of the north” is the idol, or “abomination”, set up at the instance of the demons. That totalitarian rule is put forward in the place of the kingdom of Almighty God, the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. That desolating abomination now stands where it ought not to stand. (Mark 13:14) It is the announced purpose of that abominable thing to rule the world in the stead of The Theocratic Government, while at the same time that mimic thing claims to operate in the name of Christ.

Thus the earth, under the rulership of The Theocratic Government, shall be filled with people in perfection that shall forever honor and praise the name of Jehovah and the name of his King. They will be the people of the Lord, and he will be their God and Life-giver. Then the babes shall not sicken and die. Each one shall be given a full opportunity to prove his complete devotion to the King and Jehovah, and if any die it will be only because of their own willful disobedience, and for such there will be no tears of sorrow shed.

Say among the [nations], that the Lord reigneth.” (Ps. 96: 9,10) The “great multitude” is taken from the various nations, kindreds, people and tongues and shall form the new “nations” of the earth. God’s spiritual class, now with Christ Jesus, and having in mind at all times the name of Jehovah, sing: “Who shall not fear thee, 0 Lord, and glorify thy name ? for thou only art holy; for all nations shall come and worship before thee.” (Rev. 15:4) Those of goodwill hear the song and hasten to join the singers in serving the Lord. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/il</span></p>

These faithful servants count not their earthly lives dear unto them, having in mind one thing, that is, faithfulness to Almighty God that they might prove and maintain their integrity toward him and his King and receive everlasting blessings at his hand, and life that shall continue forever. They will find some way to continue their testimony, whether they be in prison or out of prison, whether in this earthly existence and body or elsewhere.

<p><span class="font5">If your fellow traveler falls into error, let the Lord judge him, because every servant stands or falls to his own master. (Rom. 14:4) If the Lord shows mercy to the erring one we should be merciful toward that one and delight therein. Do what you can consistently to help your neighbor even as you would desire to be helped. To “walk humbly with thy God” means to walk with fear and trembling, fearing we might displease the Lord and come short of the proper performance of some assigned duty. Avoid everything that the Lord tells you to avoid. Do everything the Lord commands you to do. The proper course He has pointed out in the Scriptures. Let them be the lamp that guides you and, walking in that light, make straight paths for your feet. Learn his commandments, and obey them; which means to walk obediently with him.

The demons now have such control over the minds of religionists that such religionists stop at nothing to put Jehovah’s witnesses out. Soon the religionists wifi apparently have complete control of the nations, and then, as it is written in the Scriptures, they will say “Peace and safety!” That will be “the sign” which Jehovah will give, proving that his time has come to take drastic action against all blasphemers and religious opponents of his Theocracy. It is written of Sisera, who pictured the religious leaders: “So he died.” Fulfillment of that part of the prophetic drama is certain to be carried out on opposers of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government.

<p><span class="font5">What is the continued attitude of all faithful servants of The Theocracy ? The answer is in these words, and “Bless ye the Lord” is their song of joy. To “bless the Lord” means to praise him and serve him with joy. Those who have the interests of The Theocracy at heart do bless or praise Jehovah for providing them with the opportunity to serve him and to prove their integrity toward him and for stirring up their zeal and courage to vigorously attack demonism. All of Jehovah’s witnesses do bless or praise Jehovah for providing his faithful, fearless and progressive Society organization on earth, by and through which the Lord carries forward his witness work to the honor of Jehovah’s name.

Every Christian is bound by his covenant to be obedient to God’s law, as written in the Scriptures. If he voluntarily breaks the terms of his covenant he is subject to death. All Christians conscientiously believe that God’s Word as recorded in the Bible is the truth; and if they willingly violate their conscientious belief, such act constitutes the breaking of their covenant. To cause a Christian to violate his conscience is denounced by the Scriptures as '“sin against Christ”. (1 Cor. 8:12) These general rules stated in the Bible apply to all persons who believe on God and on Christ and who start to walk in the way of righteousness that leads to life everlasting.

<p><span class="font5">Having declared himself on the side of The Theocracy, one must now maintain his integrity toward the great Theocrat and His King. This one does by obeying God’s command, as written: “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.” (Matt. 19:17) That means to do what God has commanded must be done by all who shall receive his approval. It is his will and hence his commandment that every person who takes his stand on the side of God and Christ shall, by his course of action and conduct, and by his words, bear testimony to Jehovah’s name and his Theocratic Government. All who are of God’s capital organization must be witnesses to his name. All who come under God’s organization must likewise bear testimony to his name.

This, by God’s grace, we can do by refusing to compromise with any part of the demonized organization of the enemy. We must and will be entirely, wholly, unreservedly and completely devoted to the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. We can have no part in and nothing in common with Satan’s organization. We are wholly and steadfastly for The Theocracy, and here, by God’s grace, we will remain. We know it shall vindicate Jehovah’s name and bring deliverance to all who love righteousness and who serve Jehovah under his righteous government. Let nothing move you from absolute and complete devotion to The Theocracy. Be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the Lord’s work.

At Armageddon Christ Jesus goes forth in his strength, leading the heavenly host. They “that love him”, that is, that love Jehovah, the great Theocrat, and his kingdom by Christ Jesus, and who maintain their integrity faithfully unto death, these shall “shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father”.

They are conscientious and sincerely believe that for them to indulge in the formalism or ceremony of saluting any flag is a violation of God’s specific commandment as set forth at Exodus 20:3-5 and emphasized in many other scriptures. The reason that such flag saluting is a violation of that commandment is that the salute attributes salvation to the state, which the flag represents, thus making the state a mighty one, or a “god”, whereas “salvation belongeth unto Jehovah”, the Almighty God, and to none other.

Likewise Satan’s organization, including the many religious dupes that have fallen under the influence of the demons, expect to make a cleanup of God’s people and collect the spoils and get rid of those on the side of Jehovah. They also are doomed to disappointment. Jehovah made Sisera’s host a spoil to His covenant people, whom King Jabin and his officers had oppressed for twenty years. In like manner God will make Satan’s entire organization a spoil at Armageddon.

The life of those faithful men shall be forever human on the earth. They have a '^better resurrection”, however, than that of those of the human race in general who are favored in the general resurrection. Those faithful men of old had their trial of faith before the purchase price or ransom was made available, but they had full faith in God’s promise and they shall receive the benefit of the ransom sacrifice because of their faith.

<p><span class="font5">One must have his mind free from improper, unclean thoughts and filled with thoughts concerning The Theocracy and what he may do to advance its interests. Doing thus he could have no time to indulge in loose, lewd, or improper thoughts or conduct, and will be keeping up the barrier against the demons. If one who has made a covenant to obey God and fled to the Lord for refuge becomes careless in his thoughts and actions and permits his mind to dwell on lewd, lascivious, selfish or improper things, he thereby lets down the bars or guards that have been erected against the demons, and therefore the demons invade his mind. Attending and participating in social parties and thus wasting time and energy that might be properly employed in the Lord’s service is a very dangerous course of action, because the barriers to the intrusion of demons are thus let down.

<p><span class="font5">The scheme of the two kings for world dominion cannot prosper, and therefore, in the prophet’s language referring to demon schemes, “it shall not prosper.” “For yet the end shall be at the time appointed”; which means, at the time appointed by Jehovah and which must come exactly in his due time. “The time of the end,” therefore, had beginning in 1914, and nothing could change Jehovah’s purpose, and the final end of demons’ rule shall come exactly at the time which Jehovah has appointed. Satan’s uninterrupted rule came to an end in 1914, when Christ Jesus, the rightful King, was sent forth to rule. From 1914 onward until the final end there must be done chiefly the witness work to the name of Jehovah, which is God’s “strange work”.

<p><span class="font5">Wise </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">men lay up knowledge.—Prov. 10:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The person who is wise and pursues a wise and prudent course desires to live forever and enjoy all the blessings God has provided for those who love him. There is but one way to life. That way is to receive a knowledge of God and Christ Jesus and then obey the Lord’s commandments and continue to follow in the right way: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17: 3) The person that would please God and live must know that Jehovah is the Almighty God and that Christ Jesus is his great Executive Officer, and he must fear to displease God. Such a person begins to acquire the right kind of knowledge. One is foolish to rely upon his own understanding and to ignore God’s Word. “Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear the Lord, and depart from evil.” To follow traditions of men contrary to His Word is to pursue a course of evil.

<p><span class="font5">Knowing the end from the beginning, Jehovah in due time began to make known his purpose to create and set up a paternal government by Christ Jesus, and that in due time a child should be born of God's universal organization that should become the King and rule the world in righteousness. That man-child was born in a manger at Bethlehem, and at that time the angel of Jehovah delivered to men whom God had chosen as witnesses this message: “Unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.” At the same time Jehovah caused his angels to deliver this message: ‘Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to all men of good-will.’ (Luke 2:10-14, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> That means that those of goodwill toward the great Theocracy shall have peace and all attending blessings, and now Jehovah’s due time has come when all who are of good-will toward him may receive such blessings. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Ps. 34:15, Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord judges men not by their words alone, but his judgment is by reason of the heart devotion. (1 Sam. 16:7) The Lord knows the secret intent of every person. The eyes of the Lord seek out those who devote themselves to him unselfishly, and he shows his strength in behalf of such. (2 Chron. 16:9) Those who become righteous by reason of faith in Christ Jesus and Jehovah, and in full obedience to the Lord, must because of their faithfulness to God suffer much at the hands of the enemy, and this suffering experienced enables them to prove their integrity toward God. In their distress they cry unto God, and he hears their cry because of their sincere heart devotion to him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Asher acted that part prophetic of the present-day condition in which some who claim consecration find themselves. They are not disposed to separate themselves from the sea of humanity which has alienated them from God. On the contrary, they have continued a close association with commercial and selfish business interests for selfish gain. When they learned of the Kingdom they were getting on in business profitably, and so reasoned: “Why should we put aside this profitable business and take a part in spiritual matters in the interest of the Kingdom?” Let someone else do that. Why should they jeopardize their business and their standing in the community by going right against religion and doing service and advertising The Theocracy? In this they missed the greatest opportunity that ever came to them. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The sword is a symbol of the destructive weapon of the Lord, which he will use against the enemy at Armageddon. True to the prophetic picture, Christ Jesus, the Greater Barak, with lightning speed, together with his heavenly army, will pursue the enemy at Armageddon. Beginning with religion, and particularly the Papacy, which is now urging on the dictators to acts of supreme wickedness, the Lord Jesus Christ will literally and completely destroy the enemy. The totalitarian, religious monstrosity shall not rule the earth, because Jehovah has decreed that such wickedness shall come to a complete end. The Lord made this part of the prophetic drama of Barak to give further assurance to God’s people that he will fight their battles to a complete victory.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The fear of the Lord is clean.—Ps. 19:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures tell of men who broke covenant with God because of fear of man, and that such covenantbreakers suffered the penalty of death. One of such was the prophet Urijah. Jeremiah did not fear man nor what man might do to him. In this he pleased God, and God manifested his power in Jeremiah’s behalf. One who is in a covenant with God and who fears what man might do to harm him, and for that reason yields to the point of violating his covenant, is unclean and cannot receive God’s approval. As is shown in the case of Urijah, so with all covenant-breakers. Such unclean ones must suffer death at the hands of Jehovah. God’s covenant people who continue faithful to the end in fulfilling their obligations are those who do not fear men. Those who have godly fear put their full trust in the Most High. All those in a covenant and for The Theocracy continue to fear God. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It took faith to believe that God would fight their battles for them and give the Israelites the victory over their enemies. Likewise following the World War, when the call came through Christ Jesus, the Greater Barak, who is the Head of the organization pictured by Deborah, to go into action, those who willingly offered themselves and voluntarily entered the service did so because of their faith and love for God and Christ. They were courageous because they recognized they were backed up by the Almighty God, who had exercised his power in their behalf. Those charged with the responsibility of the oversight and direction of the work must promptly take the lead in the active program and with zeal carry forward the work against the well-equipped enemy.

<p><span class="font5">‘Darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the people.’ (Isa. 60:2) Who will understand? Only the wise after the wisdom of the Lord will understand. Who are they that are purified, made white and tried, as stated by the Lord’s prophet ? Such are those who are in Christ Jesus, who constitute “the remnant” of Jehovah’s spiritual people now on the earth, and who are wholly devoted to God. Who are “the wise”? In addition to “the remnant” all persons of good-will toward God now are granted the opportunity of understanding Jehovah’s purpose. The Lord is now gathering unto himself his “other sheep”, all of which shall understand; otherwise they could not be of his “other sheep”.

<p><span class="font5">This shows that long before that time Satan had challenged Jehovah’s supremacy and raised the great issue. Satan’s accusing charge was made before the angels of heaven, and hence was known before all the host of heaven. The primary issue raised by Satan’s defiant challenge was and is that of universal domination. God had created the earth and created man for the earth. A perfect man upon the earth would worship and serve Almighty God. When God laid even the earth’s foundation Satan had heard the announcement made to the sons of God and learned that much of Jehovah’s purpose. Then Satan, moved by covetousness, determined he would have men’s worship for himself in the place of Jehovah and that therefore he would be the ruler of the universe. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/41</span></p>

God’s covenant people are on his side and entirely devoted to his purpose, and therefore must be and are at all times neutral in all things of controversy between the nations of this evil world. If the nations see fit to engage in war, that is for the nations themselves to determine and it is their responsibility. With such affairs God’s covenant people have nothing to do. In obedience to his commandment these must remain neutral, separate and apart. They must hold themselves aloof from all such worldly controversies and devote themselves to the service of the great Theocracy.

<p><span class="font5">In A.D. 1918 the time had come for the Lord to build up Zion, his capital organization, as pictured by the woman Deborah; and therefore it is written: “When the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.” (Ps. 102:16) Christ Jesus began the building up of Zion by gathering unto himself those of his own and gathering them into one organized body, that is, all who had proved their integrity and been faithful. First he gathered those Christians who had died in faith and faithful by awakening them out of death to life in the spirit; and then he gathered “the remnant”, that is, the faithful on the earth still in the flesh. These were “caught up ... to meet the Lord in the air” (1 Thess. 4:15-17) ; and all were gathered into unity into the organized “body of Christ”.

<p><span class="font5">The “sanctuary” is Jehovah’s organization, now represented on earth by his spiritual “remnant”, the last remaining members of the capital organization yet on the earth bearing witness to the great Theocracy. (1 Cor. 3:16,17) The sanctuary of Jehovah is the only “sanctuary of strength”; that sanctuary, or temple company, is “strong in the Lord and in the power of ais might” and filled with the joy of the Lord. “The joy of the Lord is your strength.” (Neh. 8:10) The remnant is a part of and represents that sanctuary. They represent, therefore, the great Theocracy by Christ Jesus the King, and that Theocracy is the great stronghold to which those who love Jehovah and his King have fled for safety. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jael’s words were proof to Barak that she was fully on the side of the Israelites; and thus was pictured that those persons of good-will, the Lord’s “other sheep”, have taken their stand on the side with Christ Jesus and are dead against religion and all forms of demon-worship. “Jael came out to meet” Barak. That showed her faith in Jehovah’s servant, picturing the faith of the Lord’s “other sheep” when they go out to meet the Lord and take their stand on his side. These people of good-will go out with gladness and meet the Lord and manifest their faith in him and show they are in favor of The Theocracy.

The children should be taught to keep themselves clean in body and in mind and to indulge only in that which is pure and righteous. Jonadabs must now see to it that both they and their children keep themselves busily engaged in the work of righteousness and keep their place of abode and themselves in a cleanly manner and be diligent at all times to ascertain God’s will.

A well-known pastor of a religious organization recently, by radio, made a statement to this effect: “Christianity is progressive. The world is progressing in Christianity and in due time will reach perfection.” Had he relied upon God’s Word he would not have made that statement. Christ Jesus is the great Christian, and hence Christianity is perfect, and not progressive. Christ is the “express image” of Almighty God, and all his works are perfect and “done in righteousness”. All true followers of Christ Jesus are guided by God’s Word. It being perfect at all times, it is not progressive from a lower to a higher degree.

Through all the cruel persecution suffered by Jehovah’s witnesses at the hands of demon-controlled ruling elements these faithful servants of the Lord have managed to stumble along. Weary in body, yet rejoicing in spirit, they have gone forward singing the praises of The Theocracy and its King. Thus they continue to have part in the “strange work” of Jehovah.

The fear of God is the beginning of knowledge, and also of wisdom, with him; and being guided by God’s Word, he begins to have an appreciation of his own relationship to the Almighty God. He sees that Jehovah, the Almighty God, is all powerful and all-wise, that justice is the foundation of his throne, and that “God is love”; meaning, that he is wholly unselfish. The man sees he is wholly dependent upon the great, eternal God; and rendering himself in obedience to God, he is assured of God’s blessing. Now he is getting some understanding, that is, beginning to have a proper appreciation of his own relationship to the great Creator.

Now is the time when all the covenant people of God must present a solid front against the enemy and each and every one do his part in declaring the name and kingdom of the Most High. When the actual battle of Armageddon begins there will be no need for volunteers or for faithful work in declaring Jehovah’s name. That work will be completed and the powers of heaven will do the real fighting.

<p><span class="font5">The way of life is by faith in God and Christ Jesus. Faith must be based upon knowledge, which knowledge proceeds from a truthful source. Opinions and doctrines of imperfect men concerning the way of life have no truthful source. True knowledge comes only from God’s Word. Faith comes by hearing and by relying upon God’s Word. (Rom. 10:17) He that advocates or preaches any doctrine contrary to God’s Word is without faith. Teaching and following traditions of men make the Word of God of none effect toward men; hence the wise man shuns religion as a deadly thing. (Matt. 15: 6-9) When he is asked to hear the babblings of religious teachers he immediately recognizes that such are vain and he quickly turns away from them and shuns them.

Psalm 119:133 expresses the sincere desire of such person: “Order my steps in thy word; and let not iniquity have dominion over me.” The person who ignores God’s Word cannot receive life everlasting. “Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed; but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded. The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.” (Prov. 13:13,14) If that person desires to avoid that which defiles and leads to destruction he is diligent to seek information from God’s Word. “Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way ?

Certainly not; because as the servants of the Most High they are backed up by his everlasting and irresistible power. The faithful under Christ Jesus are not now on the defensive, but on the offensive against demon influence and the power manifested particularly in religion. These faithful ones zealously obey the commandments of the Lord Jesus Christ, their Leader and Head, and they press the battle right to the gates of the entrenched organizations that are against The Theocracy. The faithful followers of Christ Jesus know beyond all possibility of doubt that Christ Jesus, the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, shall gain the victory and that they who remain faithful and true to their Leader to the end shall share with him in that victory.

They do not hesitate to take any place in the service to which they may be assigned. They count on the Lord to take care of them. They forget themselves. They are determined that nothing shall separate them from the love of Jehovah and his government under Christ. The apostle Paul was one who led off in this course of faithful devotion to the Kingdom, and hence under inspiration he wrote: “I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”—Rom. 8:38,39.

If children have shown diligence and efficiency in schools of this world, with stronger reasoning they must now be diligent to grow efficient in the school under The Theocratic Government.

Duly constituted authorities may make and enforce laws that are consistent with the supreme law. Should not all citizens be loyal to the country in which they reside? Yes; in harmony and consistent with God’s law they should obey the laws of the land. Necessarily that means obedience to God’s law or commandments is first and then obedience to the laws of the state that are not contradictory to God’s law. Jesus emphatically stated the supremacy of God’s law, and all his followers must abide thereby. God commands his servants not to give reverence, devotion or worship to any image or thing. No human authority can rightfully compel doing what God’s law forbids. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/41</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Covenant breakers, . . . knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death.—Rom. 1:31,32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God commanded the nation of Israel to keep themselves separate from all the nations that indulged in demonism or religious service of the demon gods, declaring unto them that serving such gods “will be a snare unto thee”. (Deut. 7:16) Israel was duty-bound to faithfully keep and perform the terms of that covenant. They failed to do so; they broke their covenant. God punished those covenant-breakers with destruction. He pronounced the final judgment upon that nation breaking covenant, and the nation was left desolate. Thus Jehovah’s fixed rule is made known that covenant-breakers are worthy of death and suffer death, and one who willingly breaks his covenant or avoids its obligations puts himself in the way of complete destruction.

<p><span class="font5">The wise man does not desire to follow his selfish inclinations. He has chosen the Lord and his Word as his guide. He looks to God’s Word and from it receives instruction and understanding. The wise man seeks the company and companionship of others who are also wise after God’s way. He will be diligent to attend studies where he may learn more about God’s way. He will study to show himself approved unto God. By so doing he will be pleasing to the Lord and will receive the blessings of life everlasting. He will walk circumspectly, which means to look about him and to see to it that he avoids all entanglements that beset the pathway of men. He will look up to the Lord for his guide, shield and protection. He will have his mind and heart set upon the Lord and be praying at all times that he may be guided in the way of righteousness.

<p><span class="font5">Particularly since 1937 the Jonadabs, pictured by Jael, have made bold to strike for liberty and against the Hierarchy, the head of the great religious system that has so long deceived and oppressed God’s faithful people. This they have done and do by arming themselves with and using God’s Word, thereby killing religious traditions and imaginations brought forth by the religious leaders who oppose and persecute Jehovah’s covenant people who advertise The Theocracy. These Jonadabs, by their knowledge and the use of the truth of God’s Word, are engaging with their companions in “casting down imaginations”. (2 Cor. 10:4, 5) They proclaim the message of the great Theocracy, thereby pointing out that God’s kingdom, and not religion, is the only hope of humankind. By thus doing they are putting to death religion. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Now in these last days all the demons, with their chief in the lead, have mustered all their forces to fight against The Theocracy. The demon forces include all nations and creatures on the earth that are against the kingdom of God by Christ Jesus. The forces are lined up for the great battle. Upon the earth there is a “remnant” of the anointed of Jehovah, all of whom are entirely devoted to The Theocracy and who now must and shall hold fast their integrity or blamelessness before God. All the demons invisible and visible are against these faithful servants of God. Jehovah and his King are for the remnant, and therefore they rejoice.

<p><span class="font5">That the test put upon Job involved chiefly his loyalty to the King of The Theocracy is shown by his words above. Job had faith in God and in his coming Theocratic Government by the Messiah, and for that reason Satan hated Job and attempted to cause him to repudiate Jehovah and to die. This being a prophetic picture for the benefit of God’s remnant, the crucial test must be applied after the Lord comes to the temple. That test is not to determine whether or not God’s devoted covenant people are perfect in word or deed or “character development”, but is to determine whether or not they are completely and immovably devoted to the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, who has come to rule in righteousness. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">After the Lord does rise up, he will give such an emphatic warning that the combined rulers that form the “desolating abomination” will be compelled to hear and give heed, and it will cause them to tremble in their boots. When that “Peace and safety” proclamation is announced by them the totalitarian, demonized rulers will conclude everything on earth is well in hand and that Jehovah’s witnesses and companions are safely tucked away. But when the emphatic message is heard by them from The north and the east’, that is, from Jehovah and Christ Jesus, they will conclude they must completely rid the earth of Jehovah’s witnesses. The faithful will stand still and see Almighty God’s power by Christ Jesus exercised for their salvation. The true servants of The Theocracy will hold fast their integrity. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The faithful remnant became Jehovah’s organized people and his witnesses on earth, appointed, ordained and commissioned to proclaim his name and to preach the Kingdom gospel. In times of old Jehovah fought the battle of his people and gave them the victory over the mighty. Likewise today, when the “strange work” is being completed and the “strange act” is about to begin, Jehovah is with Christ Jesus and his organization and is leading them on, and if the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses abide on the side of Christ Jesus and with Jehovah’s organization then Jehovah is sure to be with them, fight for them, and give them the victory over the mighty forces of the Devil.

<p><span class="font5">They did not expect the promised government in their day, but were firmly convinced that in his due time God would carry out fully his word of promise. Therefore they went into death full of faith. They knew that the promise would not be fulfilled completely while Satan continued to be the invisible overlord or god of this wicked world. They were seeking what country? The Scriptures answer: “The kingdom of heaven,” “the holy city,” which Jesus bought with his own lifeblood. They willingly took that course, and could have turned back had they so desired. God has prepared a place for them in connection with his Theocratic Government. A “city”, or ruling organization, is specifically prepaied for them. It is not a part of “the Holy City”, but a part of God’s organization just the same, and which shall operate under the supervision of the Holy City. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The woman Jael fitly pictured the organization of persons who choose to serve Jehovah God and his King, which is formed into an organization of the “great multitude”. Such will compose the earthly part of the Lord’s organization who serve him before his throne. They are not of the capital organization, however, but under it. Christ Jesus is the Lord and hence the Head over all of God’s organization. Such people of good-will flee to the Lord and put themselves under his capital organization until the end of Armageddon. Thereafter the “great multitude”, together with the faithful prophets resurrected (Heb. 11: 35), become the earthly part of the Lord’s organization. Such will be an organized body that will carry out on earth the will and commandments of the Lord. Jael fitly pictured such. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">To “walk circumspectly” means to keep one’s eyes open and looking about and seeing to it that one makes straight paths for his feet to avoid the snares of the enemy. Excess in everything should be avoided. “All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.” (Ps. 25:10) To keep covenant with the Lord means to diligently obey His commandments; and once learning them, one must obey them. Both the remnant and the Jonadabs must now “gird up the loins of your mind, be sober”. (1 Pet. 1:13) Be watchful and faithful in the performance of duty, and at the same time avoid the ‘^beggarly elements” of this wicked world, and bend all efforts and all energy to the service of The Theocratic Government and its King.

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus bought those faithful “fathers”, and bought their rights to life with his own lifeblood. They must therefore receive life from God by Christ Jesus. It is God’s will that Christ Jesus shall raise them out of death and give them life. Their resurrection shall take place when the Kingdom comes and begins to function. When raised from the dead and given life they will be the “children” of Christ Jesus because receiving life by and through him. Therefore it is certain that those faithful men will be raised from the dead as perfect human creatures and will occupy the high position of “princes”, or visible overlords or sovereign rulers, in all the earth. As visible representatives of The Theocracy they will govern the peoples of the earth, and all the people will look to receive instruction from them.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—1 John 2:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These words of the apostle now apply to the Lord’s faithful servants. The crucial test, which must persist until Armageddon, is proof that now is the last time. The antichrists, many of which now appear, are all those against the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus the King, and, says the apostle, ‘thereby we know that this is the last time.’ His words clearly mean that the end of Satanic rule has come: “And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.” (Vs. 17) It is therefore clearly to be seen that the crucial test is here, and thus Jesus says to those who follow him: “He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.”—Matt. 24:13. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehu executed the practitioners of demon religion in his day. He caused them to don the vestments of their religion and to thus identify themselves as being demonized or worshipers of demons. Likewise today the Lord is causing the people to take their stand on one side or the other. All will thus fix their own destiny by placing themselves on the side of death or on the side of life. Religionists and allied workers of iniquity will identify themselves as enemies or “goats”, symbolizing that which will be destroyed. When King Jehu had caused the religionists to identify themselves, then what followed? “Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword.”(Vs. 25) That corresponds exactly with what Christ Jesus will do to the “goats”.

Jehovah has sworn it: “He will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.” (Ps. 132:11) Jehovah gave to Jesus &quot;twelve apostles. Eleven proved faithful, suffered great persecution, maintained their integrity, and are now forever with the Lord Jesus Christ. When he was with them Jesus gave them the assurance that they would sit with him in his kingdom; and now their resurrection has taken place. Jehovah has given unto Christ Jesus a sufficient number of others to make up the 144,000 members of “his body”, and the obligation and requirements placed upon these are that they must keep their covenant and remain faithful.

Probably he was like modern-day dictators who are stargazers, and had counted on the stars to guide him as to the time of making the assault. But they gave him no safe advice. Stargazers and astrologers are demon-controlled. When Jehovah’s “strange act” begins, all such stargazers will learn that they cannot depend upon advice received from demons. All such stargazers will become weary with such demon advice and counsel.

Deborah pictured Jehovah’s organization, which shall forever be in the favor of Jehovah God, and doubtless Deborah will be amongst those who are the “princes” in the earth, because the Scriptures include all the prophets faithful to God. The faithful men of old who sealed their testimony with their lifeblood shall be of the favored ones of the Most High.

Men are imperfect, and their theories are likewise imperfect. Men and their theories die, but the Word of God endures for ever. Peter walked with the Lord and learned of him, and, inspired by God’s spirit, he wrote: “For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: but the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.” (1 Pet. 1: 24, 25) Another inspired apostle testifies: “The world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.” (1 John 2:17) The person who desires to live seeks knowledge at the Word of God.

<p><span class="font5">In these words God announced his rule concerning those who break their covenant. That means that all who because of fear of man fail or refuse to perform their covenant obligation suffer destruction at the hands of Jehovah’s Executioner. The faithful apostle repeated those words to all in a covenant with God for the Kingdom. His words apply to those who are assembled at the temple. They are addressed to God’s covenant people, applying at a time when all the world is in great distress and turmoil and when God is permitting to be shaken out of his kingdom everything that can be shaken. These words thus recorded for the benefit of God’s covenant people are: ‘Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear: for our God is a consuming fire.”—Heb. 12: 28, 29.

<p><span class="font5">The “great multitude” will bring forth children in righteousness to the honor of the King. As children of the King they shall rejoice to bring forth children and to teach them the way of righteousness that they may live forever in righteousness. Concerning this it is written: ‘Tjo, children are an heritage of the Lord; and the fruit of the womb is his reward. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.” (Ps. 127: 3, 5) Today those who love Jehovah and his King are not ashamed to proclaim the Theocracy by Christ Jesus, but serenely and joyfully speak to their opponents, telling them of the gracious things God has in store for those who joyfully serve him.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Keep my commandments, and live.—Prov. 7:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah requires of his children full obedience as a condition precedent to receiving everlasting life. By his Word he has emphasized that rule from the time of Adam when in Eden until this very day. Adam failed to obey the commandments of Jehovah God, and the result to him was death. The rules of God never change and are the same toward all. Life with the right to it can be had and maintained only by his grace. Life everlasting can be had by those only who are obedient unto God. The word “father” means the one from whom life emanates. God is the Father, therefore, of those who gain life everlasting. He is the fountain of life. He gives or administers life everlasting by and through Jesus Christ, his Executive Officer. “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ.” There is no other possible way of obtaining life.

Three of God’s typical covenant people who were in Babylon remembered Jehovah had commanded: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.... Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them.” They had respect for God’s commandments. They refused to obey Babylon’s command and were told by the highest authority of that nation that they would be put to death by burning. They replied to the lawenforcement body: 'We have no need to obey you in this matter; and if it be that you cast us into the fire, our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the fiery furnace, and he will deliver us.’ They were cast into the fiery furnace, which was so hot that it destroyed the men who cast them in.

<p><span class="font5">Continuing faithful unto death, such faithful ones of the “remnant” enter into everlasting glory with the Lord. On the earth are the Lord’s “other sheep”, who are the companions of the remnant. These have fled for refuge to Christ Jesus, found refuge under his organization, and, there remaining faithfully devoted to The Theocracy and to the King thereof, they have the promise of protection during the time of the “great tribulation”. By reason of their faithful devotion and obedience they receive such protection from the great Shepherd, Christ Jesus. Continuing thus faithful until the end of Armageddon and ever thereafter, they shall fully enter into righteousness and life; but if any of the remnant or of the “other sheep” become unfaithful to Jehovah and his King, such put themselves in the class of the wicked and their end is destruction.

All such as have now taken the step to put themselves on the Lord’s side must see to it that they do not forget God. What must one do to avoid that calamity? Shun religion, because it is demonism. Avoid the vain babblings of so-called worldly “wise men” and study to show yourself approved unto God. (2 Tim. 2:15, 16; 1 Tim. 6: 20, 21) Do not lean to your own selfish reasoning, nor to that of any man: “In all thy ways acknowledge [the Lord], and he shall direct thy paths.” (Prov. 3: 5, 6) That means, in everything you have, acknowledge the Lord; in everything you receive at his hand, acknowledge and thank him for the same. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/1/il</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is the fountain of life, which life he gives to those who obey him. His provision is that life shall be administered to the obedient of mankind through Christ Jesus, who purchased the human race with his own precious blood. Therefore man can come to God only by believing on the Lord Jesus as his Redeemer and Savior. To Relieve” means to take a course in harmony with that mental conception; hence the wise man consecrates himself to God and Christ Jesus, and does so by solemnly agreeing to do God’s will, and so thereafter he can say, “I delight to do thy will, 0 my God.” Not only does the wise man desire the will of God to be done in him at all times, but his prayer to God is, “Make me do thy will.” This he can do because he knows that the way of Jehovah God is right and if God makes him do His will he will go in the right way. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/il</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">While they have been east out of heaven and down to the earth, Jehovah permits the wicked demon horde to remain for a short time that the integrity of his faithful may be put to the test and they may prove their immovable devotion to Him. While this test is on they continue to declare the name of the great Theocrat and his Government to those people on earth who will hear; and such proclamation must continue until Armageddon begins. Jehovah has definitely fixed the time for its beginning, at which time he will show to all his supreme power. While no man yet knows the day nor the hour that Armageddon will begin, “the signs of the times” show that Armageddon is very near.

<p><span class="font5">A person who is not in a covenant with God is in a position far different from that of the person who is in a covenant to do God’s will. With Jehovah a covenant is a sacred thing, not to be broken or altered with impunity. It is the express will of God that his covenant people are and must ever be separate and distinct from the world, that is, from the things of and from the powers that attempt to rule this evil world. To such the Lord says: We are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.’ (John 15:18, 19) Jesus is the Faithful and True Witness of Jehovah. All his followers, taken out from the nations for Jehovah’s name, must likewise be faithful and true witnesses to God’s name and kingdom, and therefore must keep themselves unspotted or separate from the world.—Jas. 1:27.

<p><span class="font5">For the anointed Jehovah has provided a lamp which marks out clearly the pathway which his faithful servants now follow. These are not in darkness, because they are “children of the light”, and they are marching triumphantly on by faith, singing the victory song. The enemies are now on the run. Soon their complete destruction will be accomplished. The faithful remnant, together with their companions, the “other sheep”, are singing the praises of Jehovah and of Christ Jesus, and all together sing: “Salvation to our God ... and unto the Lamb.” (Rev. 7: 9-12) None of the-faithful will now slack the hand, but will continue to proclaim the truth of Jehovah and his King, regardless of what the enemy may say or do. Now all of the faithful together say: “Rejoice in the Lord al way .’’—Phil. 4:4. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">They had much cause to search their hearts and ascertain the motive for their lack of activity. It is even so today with those who say in their hearts or in words: “Let others do the work.” Today Jehovah has provided opportunity for all the consecrated to prove their integrity by giving their all in support of The Theocracy. The faithful cannot and will not compromise in order to avoid persecution. They know only one thing, and that is to do the will of God, obeying his commandments. Those whom Jehovah will approve must joyfully take their part in the service as opportunity is offered, regardless of what may be the conditions. Doing so joyfully and fully trusting in the Lord for results, they are certain to come off victorious. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Mie. 6:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“To</span><span class="font5"> do justly” means to do that which is right, just and righteous. The Lord’s command is to “seek righteousness”; and seeking it, one must do what is right and righteous. One must be entirely for Jehovah and his kingdom, with no deviation from that course God says: “Be ye holy; for I am holy.” (1 Pet. 1:16) That rule applies to all who have declared for The Theocracy. It means to hate everything that Jehovah hates. (Prov. 8:13) We must love what God loves. (Ps. 11:7) God bestows his favor on those who love righteousness and hate iniquity, lawlessness, impurity and all uneleanness. (Ps. 45:7) Therefore the person who is in the way of life must put aside everything that is displeasing to God and diligently pursue a course of purity and righteousness.

<p><span class="font5">The King purchases all who become his children subjects. These children include the “princes” and those of the “great multitude”. Thus the visible representatives and the children of their Father, the King, will exercise dominion over the earth, over the fish, and the fowls, and all the beasts of the forest and of the field. The Lord gives his guarantee that none of the beasts or other animal creation shall hurt or do violence to his children. They shall be used by the Lord to make the earth a place of glory and beauty. Tended and kept by his princes and his children subjects, the earth shall become the King’s garden, a paradise of which Eden was a type. Everything therein will proclaim the praises of the Most High and of the King. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Thus Jehovah will square the account for the wicked deeds the religionists have committed against those who love him. Such deeds they could not do without the permission of Jehovah. He permits such only for a season. During that season persons of good-will, those who love righteousness and hate wickedness, seeing their way clear to escape from religion, are led by the Lord to see and choose the way of life. It is therefore a great privilege to suffer for righteousness’ sake. That suffering will be for only a short season. God will soon fight for his faithful people. His drama of vengeance is now about to be fulfilled in completeness. All of God’s true people will now remain calm and firmly stand for The Theocracy. Deliverance is near!

Together with their companions the Jonadabs they are continually persecuted, but these shall soon be delivered and the faithful remnant shall be in the Kingdom glory for ever with the glorious King. Then the Jonadabs who now suffer for righteousness’ sake will suffer no more, but will be for ever in the favor of the Lord and receive his blessings. The King of glory will feed them and lead them by the refreshing waters and give them life everlasting, and they and their children shall dwell forever on the earth in peace.

<p><span class="font5">When will those faithful men come into possession of what is prepared for them ? Some better thing must first be provided for others, of whom Paul was one, before those faithful men of old could come into their reward or that which was prepared for them. That ‘&quot;‘better thing” is “the holy city”, the kingdom of God, The Theocratic Government, and it is prepared for those who compose the capital organization, to wit, Christ Jesus and the members of his body, all of whom must prove faithful unto death. That would mean that all of the Holy City must be selected and the Kingdom must come before those holy men of old could receive what is prepared for them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s “other sheep” sympathize with the “remnant” and show their goodness of heart by rendering assistance to the remnant. These “other sheep” are very few in number when compared with the host of wicked persecutors, called “goats”. They are likened to those who became companions of David when he was outlawed and hunted by Saul. So David wrote: “The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.” (Ps. 118: 7) Some help is also rendered by reasonable, sensible judges of courts who have rendered honest and sincere decisions upholding Jehovah’s witnesses’ rights in proclaiming the Kingdom message ; which decisions have had something to do with keeping the “back-door” open for the remainder of the modern-Ehud class. The Lord never overlooks kindness ministered to those who love him. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The state of affairs that existed in Noah’s day included more than marrying, giving in marriage, eating and drinking. Manifestly Jesus specifically mentioned these to further compare what did exist in Noah’s day with what exists at the present time. The state of affairs in Noah’s day was this: Satan, chief of demons, was desperately working to make good his wicked challenge that no man would be faithful to God when put to the test. Satan’s endeavor was to turn all men against Jehovah. Associated with him were then a company of demons, called “Nephilim”, bullies or tyrants, all bent on defeating God and turning all creation against God. (Gen. 6:4, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">AS.V.)</span><span class="font5"> The acts and conduct of those demons and those connected with them foretold a like condition or state of affairs on earth at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Today the worldly powers endeavor to force God’s covenant people to repudiate their covenant and to break the terms thereof by conforming themselves to the things of this world, which things are contrary to His commandment. God’s faithful covenant people remain steadfast to Jehovah, faithful to the terms of their covenant and The Theocracy. They will not fear man nor what man can do. They do fear Almighty God, and obey him and serve him. The power of wicked men ends with death. The power of Almighty God is eternal. If one dies unfaithful to God, that is the everlasting end of him. If he dies because he is faithful to Jehovah and to the obligations of his covenant Jehovah will resurrect that faithful one to life eternal. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Judg. 5:1, 2, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The song opens not with felicitation to creatures, but with praise to the Most High. For centuries Christ Jesus has sung this song, well knowing the day of complete victory he will gain, when all the survivors of the great battle of that day shall praise the name of the Most High. Now the time has come when all members of “the body of Christ”, both in heaven and on earth, join in the song and all those of good-will toward God are invited to participate in the song. The angels in heaven sing because they all see that the day of the vindication of Jehovah’s name and the complete victory of Christ Jesus, the Greater Barak, is at hand. So today Jehovah’s witnesses must “bless” or speak words of praise to Jehovah’s name and to his kingdom, and do so among all people who desire to see the triumph of righteousness in the earth.

<p><span class="font5">A striking and apt example of a faithful eovenantkeeper is the apostle Paul, once a religionist and later a true Christian, following the lead of Christ Jesus. When becoming a Christian he soon learned he would suffer persecution because of his full devotion to God and Christ. But that did not deter him at all or move him from his course of faithfulness. The man who is in a covenant with Jehovah, and who has partaken of the knowledge of the good things to be given by the Lord, does not permit himself even to debate in mind as to whether or not he should obey man and thereby break his covenant. He is determined to keep his covenant obligations faithfully to the end, regardless of what may be done against him by any human power. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/41</span></p>

Jehovah’s faithful people now on the earth with joy sing because they know that the day of deliverance is near; and following Armageddon that song will resound throughout the whole universe and everything that breathes will continue to sing the praises of the Most High. Everyone who loves Jehovah should be strengthened by His revelation of the prophecies and should now by faith rejoice, knowing full well that his joy will be complete in the near future and the praises of God and his King shall fill the whole earth.

<p><span class="font5">Psalm 83 discloses the formation of a conspiracy by religionists against God’s typical people, which foreshadows a conspiracy by religionists and allied elements against God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus. The purpose of such is to destroy the servants of Jehovah and to prevent The Theocratic Government from operating. Therefore the wicked workers of iniquity are determined to rule the earth contrary to the will of Almighty God. Then follows the prayer of God’s oppressed people addressed in the words above to the Most High, asking the Lord to fight their battles for them and to utterly destroy the enemy. Jehovah is certain to hear and answer that prayer, and to do exactly the things stated therein, because he has made known that such is his will and purpose.

<p><span class="font5">Those upon whom the curse was pronounced were seeking their own salvation, ease and comfort, and avoiding service. They said in their hearts: “Let others do the work.’ By that course they doubtless escape some persecution and hardship, but negligence in performing duty will bring upon them God’s curse. Jehovah’s rules, or law, change not. If a person enters into a covenant to do God’s will he must, in order to receive God’s approval, perform that covenant obligation to the best of his ability. Not God himself, but his commissioned servants, Deborah and Barak, did need help against the mighty host of oppressors who were defaming God’s name. Help rendered to Barak and Deborah was as rendered unto Jehovah, and in rendering such help they were bound to render it, not as unto man, but as unto God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/41</span></p>

The faithful servants of God trust him and go forward in the strength of the Lord and in the power of his might. Their weapons are not guns and swords and tanks and airplanes, but their weapons consist of “the sword of the spirit”, the message of Almighty God and his King, which they deliver in the name of Jehovah, and which is “mighty... to the pulling down of strong holds” of the enemy. (Eph. 6:17; 2 Cor. 10:4) The faithful believe and appreciate the promise that Jehovah has given to them, to wit: “No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.”—Isa. 54:17.

The apostles of Jesus Christ, Peter, John and others, were sent forth to preach and to represent The Theocracy, and, being in a covenant with Jehovah God, and therefore governed strictly by His will, answered the foregoing question, and their answer is the one given by all of God’s covenant people to like questions. That answer is: <sup>&lt;f</sup>We ought to obey God rather than men.” (5:29) One’s obligations under his covenant with God require him to faithfully follow this divinely announced rule.

All persons who are wholly devoted to Jehovah and Christ worship God in spirit and in truth, and for that reason the Devil hates them. Knowing that the day of final reckoning is here, he brings every possible woe upon those who expose his chief weapon, religion, and religious practitioners. Why does Jehovah God permit him to so persecute his true servants now? To afford an opportunity to Christians to prove their faithfulness and integrity toward God and Christ; and to bring about a separation of the nations, that is, the “goats”, or wicked ones, from the Lord’s “other sheep”, who love righteousness and desire to see God’s will done on the earth.

For his faithfulness God delivered Daniel unharmed. At the eleventh chapter of Hebrews God caused to be recorded a list of faithful men who throughout the ages withstood the unreasonable rules or laws of nations which attempted to break down their devotion to the Almighty God. Those men steadfastly served God in the face of all opposition, and for such faithfulness they suffered cruel punishment at the hands of men. Of them the Lord’s Word says: 'The world was not worthy of them.’ They all received God’s approval for their faithful obedience, and they have the assurance that they shall live forever.—Heb. 11:1-40. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/41</span></p>

Since 1918 there have been a number of professed consecrated persons who seem to think it best for them to hole up at home and avoid the conflict with the enemy, and have therefore let the intervening masses of humankind, pictured by Jordan, now rapidly descending into the “Dead sea”, hold them back from active service. They have permitted the turbulent people of the present time to hinder them from crossing over the antitypical Jordan and engaging actively in the Lord’s service. They have, for selfish reasons, failed to be obedient to his commandments, and are therefore in the same condition as if they had willingly violated God’s law.

Because of its paramount importance Jesus instructed his followers that they should always pray for the coming of that kingdom. It is God’s kingdom, and necessarily all prophecy concerning it must proceed from the Almighty God. Christ Jesus is the duly appointed and anointed King of the kingdom of God. All the prophets of God foretell the coming of that kingdom and the King, and point forward to that day as one of greatest importance. Over a period of practically four thousand years men of old who were devoted to God and who prophesied according to God’s will foretold the coming of Christ Jesus the Messiah. Not only did they foretell his coming, but they recorded the minute details. Such wisdom could proceed only from the Almighty God.

Such are put in the same class with the wicked, the “evil servant” and the hypocrites, and the destiny of such the Lord declares in these words: “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.” “The Lord preserveth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.” (Pss. 9:17; 145:20) Those of good-will toward God and who desire life must now flee • “For the day of Jehovah is near upon all the nations [that are against The Theocracy].”—Obad. 15, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am.

We willingly conform ourselves to every law of the land that does not cause us to violate our covenant with Jehovah, as He has commanded. Almighty God has made us his witnesses and his ministers to preach this gospel of his kingdom by informing the peoples of the world of his name and his provision for peace and life for mankind.

That extreme hatred is expressed in violence heaped upon those who love Him. God’s faithful servants now teach their children His Word and 'Tiring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord”, and for this they are hated and persecuted. The children, because of devotion to Jehovah, are expelled from schools and denied the right of free education. The present ruling powers now oppress and violently abuse God’s covenant people.

As to what is proper thinking, the admonition of Philippians 4:8 applies to both remnant and Jonadabs: “Whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/il</span></p>

There is no other basis for hope of life. They being born in sin and shapen in iniquity, the only means of escaping eternal death is by faith in God and in Christ and then by full obedience to God’s law.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.—Acts 5:41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the faithful ones rejoice to be counted worthy to suffer for the Kingdom of Righteousness. They hold fast their integrity. In Canada the religious Hierarchy has exercised its influence and persecuting power over the political powers to have declared the witnesses of Almighty God an &quot;illegal organization”. That declaration, however, cannot prevent His faithful servants from continuing God’s work of testifying to the name and majesty of Almighty God and his government by Christ Jesus. Those faithful men and women count not their lives dear to them, well knowing that if they suffer violence and death at the hand of the enemy because of their faithfulness to The Theocracy God will avenge them and grant them everlasting life in his Kingdom. Therefore they go right on serving God, with joyful heart. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/41'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 18</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation; for at the time appointed the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">end </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">shall be.—Dan. 8:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That positive and unchangeable declaration of Jehovah is that demon rule shall for ever cease exactly on time, which he has appointed. His promise is that he will make his faithful servants to know what shall be concerning that time. During the period of &quot;the time of the end”, that is, from and after 1914, Jehovah by Christ Jesus has been revealing to his faithful servants the meaning of various prophecies recorded in the Bible. It therefore appears that Jehovah’s due time is now here to make his people know more about the final end. The Lord’s faithful servants now diligently seek an understanding of prophecy, well knowing that the Devil’s scheme shall not prosper, but shall end disastrously at the time God has appointed.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Beheaded for the witness of Jesus.—Rev. 20:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such faithful ones have no human leader, but have given up their own head and look only to Christ Jesus as their Head and Leader that they might bear witness to Jehovah’s name and his Theocratic Government. They refuse to compromise with any part of Satan’s organization. Regardless of all earthly persecution and opposition, they remain true, steadfast and blameless before the Lord. Such blamelessness consists of their complete devotion to the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. Their integrity is put to the test, and those who receive the. Lord’s approval will hold fast their integrity under that test. They are being disciplined by the Lord, and they are determined to not yield to demon influence, but that they will remain faithful to Jehovah God and his Government of Righteousness, come what may. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">At the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north___shall enter</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">also into the glorious land.—Dan. 11:40, 41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The abomination that maketh desolate” enters where he has no right, into the “goodly land”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Margin)</span><span class="font5"> This refers to the antitypical Land of Promise, the condition into which Jehovah by Christ Jesus has brought his covenant people. (Ezek. 20: 6) In every land invaded by “the king of the north” Jehovah’s faithful servants have been trampled on and their publications concerning The Theocratic Government have been suppressed and destroyed, and Jehovah’s witnesses have been imprisoned or otherwise restrained of their liberties. That “abominable thing” has tried to occupy the place Jehovah God has assigned to his anointed, and it assumes the right to enter and to rule over the entire world contrary to Almighty God’s expressed will. It thus causes the desolating abomination to stand “in the holy place”, where it ought not. IV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: for he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God—Heb. 11:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Abraham was swift to obey God. That means he was willing and ready, upon short notice, to move, and also shows he had no fixed abiding place on the earth but was looking for a better place. He dwelt in tents and with his sons and grandsons. Abraham and Sarah's only son Isaac grew to manhood’s estate, and then God put a great test upon Abraham. God commanded Abraham to offer his son upon a fiery altar of sacrifice. Under that test Abraham exhibited strong faith in God. Abraham had faith in God’s government of righteousness, The Theocracy, which is symbolized by a city. God has fixed a place for Abraham. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/41</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The river of Kishon swept them away, . . . Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.—Judg. 5:21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sisera had regarded the horses as great strength in his army, which would bring him victory. He was disappointed. How about the war organizations of modern times ? These are supported -by the great religious institutions of the world, and on their mechanized equipment they rely for certain victory. Religionists and other ruling elements think their equipment is irresistible. They scorn The Theocracy and boast of their ability to destroy everything that is faithful to Almighty God. They will be greatly dismayed when the Lord begins to fight against them. Their horses and mechanized equipment will be of no value. Paralyzed with fear, they will be unable to offer effective resistance. The enemy will be thrown into panic and will find no way of escape. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/41</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling: for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.—Phil. 2:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work in which the Christian engages is not for the benefit of or profit to the Lord, but the Lord affords his covenant people the opportunity to work that they might prove their unqualified devotion to Jehovah and his kingdom. It will therefore not do to say, “I will perform my assigned task and then I will spend the rest of the time jazzing about attending social gatherings and indulging in that which gratifies the imperfect human desires?’ A man who is in a covenant to serve Jehovah is the Lord’s bond servant and must see to it that he gives his all to the service of the Lord and Master. God has given his covenant people the opportunity to prove their integrity toward him and to receive life everlasting. “Be blameless and harmless.”—Vs. 15. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rlessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked.—Rev. 16:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The king of the north” has tried to rip off the “beautiful garments”, the spiritual adornment, of God’s faithful servants by which their identification is made to appear. (Isa. 52:1) He has tried to compel Jehovah’s witnesses and companions to let loose their hold on Jehovah and his Theocratic Government. By His grace, however, Jehovah’s servants have been able to stand and that monstrosity has not succeeded. God’s faithful servants are determined to hold fast their integrity, come what may. They trust in Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, whom they serve. Though denied the right to possess Bibles and Bible helps to aid them in studying God’s Word, and though denied the right to meet for study, His faithful servants have these great truths in their minds, which cannot be taken away from them by the Devil or any of his representatives. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/41</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 25</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For God so loved the world that his Only Begotten Son he gave, that whosoever believeth on him might not perish, but have life age-abiding.—John 3:16, Rotherham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The world of righteousness is that which God loves. From the beginning it was his purpose to have a new world wherein dwelleth righteousness The apostle Peter, under inspiration, wrote: <sup>&lt;f</sup>We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Pet. 3:13) The promise here referred to is the promise God made to Abraham that in his Seed all the families of the earth that live shall bless themselves; that is to say, all nations and peoples that ever live must receive their blessing by first accepting Christ and devoting themselves to the Theocratic Government by Christ. They take the step of receiving the blessing by believing and obeying. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.—Ps. 145:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Selection of the members of The Theocratic Government to be associated with Christ Jesus the King has been carried forward during the past 1900 years and is now practically completed. The Lord Jesus received the Kingdom and began his rule in 1914. In 1918 he began the judgment of those consecrated to do God’s will, selecting those faithful and approved ones whom he has sent forth as his servants to be witnesses to the great Theocrat, and his name and government. The remnant of these are yet on earth. These must join and do gladly join with Christ Jesus to extend the invitation to all persons of good-will now on earth to come and take freely of the truth of life; and those obeying shall live. (Rev. 22:17) Thus the heavenly generation bring the life message to the earthly generation. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.—Rev. 2:10, Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For God’s covenant people, both the remnant and their companions, the Lord’s “other sheep”, the time of climax is here. Whether permitted to remain free to preach this gospel of the Kingdom as God has commanded, or restrained of all human liberty; whether walking through the land and doing that which God has commanded, or behind prison walls because of faithfulness to covenant obligations, the Christian in the covenant with God will regard but one thing worth while, and that is that under all conditions, and in whatever state, he will hold fast his integrity. There is but one thing for him to do. He will consider nothing else. That one thing is faithfully keeping covenant obligations prescribed by the covenant he has made with Almighty God, and to do so faithfully unto the end.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, and ye apostles, and ye prophets; for God hath judged your judgment on her.—Rev. 18:20, Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Kingdom must be completed and set up, with Christ Jesus in full authority and glory as King, before those faithful men of old could be granted life everlasting on earth. The ransom sacrifice, by which the purchase price was provided for mankind, must be paid over first before any man could be released from the bondage of death, inherited through Adam. All those faithful prophets died and went out of existence into the grave, or “hell”, but all are held in the memory of Almighty God, who will resurrect them from the dead in his own due time and according to his promise. Those men had faith in the resurrection, and therefore they endured the great fight of affliction even unto death in order ‘that they might obtain the better resurrection’.—Heb. 11:35.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Praise ye the Lord for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.—Judg. 5:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In that song they praise and bless Jehovah “for the avenging of Israel” and, now, for the avenging of spiritual Israel. The faithful people of God now on the earth by faith see that for a certainty soon He will fully vindicate his name; and, having this full assurance, they raise the song of praise before the battle is fought and won. When the battle of that great day of God Almighty is fought and won every surviving creature will join in that song of praise to his holy name. Jehovah’s witnesses must now declare “the day of vengeance of our God”, which vengeance will vindicate his name and will avenge all the oppressed of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, upon whom oppression and persecutions have been heaped by the modern-day Sisera, the religious leaders and others of Satan’s organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ardently awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ: who will also confirm you unto the end unac-cusable in the day of our Lord.—1 Cor. 1:7, 8, Both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s servants are now facing a crucial test. They must hold fast their integrity, if they are to receive protection and life and forever enjoy the blessings of The Theocratic Government. The above message the Lord caused his faithful apostle long ago to write to those servants of God who should be on earth at the time of the end. God’s people are there informed that they must now be at complete unity and all of one mind, that is, all completely for The Theocracy. Stand fast for The Theocracy! It will be folly to now turn to the beggarly totalitarian ruling elements. Give ear always to what the Lord says: “I will hear what God the Lord will speak; for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints; but let them not turn again to folly.”—Ps. 85:8. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/15/41</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">December 31</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And I saw ... them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image,... having the harps of God. And they sing the song.—Rev. 15: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s remnant and those “other sheep” of the Lord who are their companions should now be strong of faith and very courageous and should continuously proclaim the name and praise of Jehovah and his King and never permit anything to turn them aside from that complete devotion to The Theocracy. They must be faithful in keeping covenant with God and must prove their integrity to the Most High and to his King. The same degree of faith is required of all who receive the approval of the Almighty and his King. In fulfillment of prophecy the Victory Song has begun. It must continue to swell with increasing volume and until all who survive Armageddon shall know The Theocracy is now exercising its authority and power and that everlasting peace and blessings have come to stay forever. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/11</span></p><img src="yb1942_E_files/yb1942_E-4.png" alt="" style="width:49pt;height:71pt;">

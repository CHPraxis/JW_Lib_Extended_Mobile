<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God's law and was sentenced to death ; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH'S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah's organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege It is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah's kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that surtive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 8</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;And this man shall be the peace, ichen the Assyrian shall come into our land; and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.”—Mic. 5:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">JEHOVAH is never on the defensive nor ever in I danger of defeat by any foe, singly or combined. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font7"> He makes peace for those who take their stand on his side and keep his commandments, and creates evil or calamity and destruction for those who oppose and fight against his righteous Government. (Isa. 45:7) His beloved One, who on earth was called “The Son of man”, is “The Prince of Peace”. At his human birth in Bethlehem the prophetic song of the angels foretold that when his Kingdom should be established God’s peace would be extended through this Prince to men of good-will on earth. Amid the tumult of the world that marks its end He only is the One by whom to gain peace of heart and mind and to for ever enjoy the peaceful earth after the great conflict for universal domination is fought and won to the vindication of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>2</sup> It is God’s will that peace shall exist within the organization or “land” of his covenant people on earth, the spiritual Israelites. It is His decree that unity in serving Jehovah God shall be observed and safeguarded among such in the “land” of spiritual Israel. No one has a right to interfere with their united service. The original “Assyrian” was a demonworshiping, totalitarian world-power. It invaded the land of ancient Israel, thereby furnishing a prophetic picture, that the modern-day Assyrian with religious-totalitarian organization would invade the midst of God’s covenant people and seek to break up their organized and united worship of the only true and living God, “whose name alone is Jehovah.” —Isaiah 36 and 37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3</sup> The modern invasion is under way, as shown by the notorious persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, which persecution has scandalized all “Christendom”. The people in so-called “democratic” lands fail to realize that such persecution upon God’s servants by the religionists represents the invasion by the totalitarian “Assyrian” of the rights, privileges and liberties that all freedom-loving peoples want to retain for themselves. The power of the “Assyrian” will increase as the nations of the world all go totalitarian</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">under the great stress. In the most vital field of all, the worship of God upon which everlasting life depends, there only do Jehovah’s people clad in the armor of God resist the aggressions of the totalitarian-minded ones into the things which must be rendered unto God and which are His. They know that “the wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God” (Ps. 9:17) and that to spread and increase the knowledge of God is for the benefit of the nations. They know that the demons are back of the totalitarian regimentation that makes the people ignore God’s ways; and therefore they battle, not with flesh and blood, but with the power and rule of the demons which would cause the destruction of the nations by opposition to Almighty God. The witnesses of Jehovah maintain their unity of action. Under the leadership of the Good Shepherd, the Principal One of God’s capital organization, they rise up in a united front against the aggressor and hurl back the invader. They resist all forms of demonism, and no more does religion gain a foothold amongst them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>4</sup> Religion has failed, as proved by the facts today, after six thousand years of religion’s practice. Christianity has not failed, and never will. Though now the only true Christians are hated and persecuted of all nations, Christianity is not on the defensive. It is on the offensive against all religion, which is demonism and which has proved the ruin of humankind. The assaults by the modern “Assyrian” upon the Christian witnesses of Jehovah are but the enemy counterattacks, all of which fail to break the integrity of God’s covenant-keeping people. Concerning the offensive action and carrying of the war into the enemy territory Jehovah by his prophet foretold: “And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.” (Mic. 5:6) It was the first totalitarian dictator Nimrod that organized religion and built Nineveh, the chief city of Assyria. Hence </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">131</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">the land of Assyria is called “the land of Nimrod” and pictures the nations now going totalitarian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>5</sup> As the religious-totalitarian rule moves on to swallow up the whole world Jehovah bids his faithful witnesses not to fear, but to be bold and courageous in his service: “Therefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, 0 my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt [in Moses’ day]. For yet a very little while, and the indignation [of God against the totalitarians] shall cease, and mine anger, in their destruction.” (Isa. 10:24,25) Though the enemies conspire and confederate together against those who stand up for and proclaim Jehovah’s Theocratic Government, God’s covenant people may make no agreement or confederacy with the “Assyrian&quot; foe of The Theocracy. By his prophet Jehovah specifically warns them against a compromise with the &quot;Assyrian” in the hope of getting help and protection from him at the price of breaking integrity with God. (Isa. 8: 9-13) Jehovah alone is their fear and dread. Rather than compromise, they arise to the attack against religion which is linked with and does business with the totalitarian rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>0</sup> The faithful servants of Jehovah are provided with the “sword of the spirit, which is the word of God&quot;. They wield that sword by proclaiming the truths of God’s Word to those with an ear to hear. Thereby they waste the pastures of religion which the clergy part of “The Assyrian” have enjoyed with regard to such persons as now turn their ear to the Bible truths. They take no part in the literal wasting of the demon rule and organization which is symbolized by “the land of Assyria&quot;, “the land of Nimrod.” Jehovah’s executioner, who is the Head of the &quot;seven shepherds” and “eight principal men&quot;, does such wasting. He is the “Chief Shepherd” and is the “man child” who is to “shepherd all the nations with a sceptre of iron”. (Rev. 12:5, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham) </span><span class="font7">Quite correctly the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font7"> rendering of Micah 5:6 reads: “Then shall they shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof.” A shepherd is ordinarily a man of peace, but he is also a fierce fighter for his devoted sheep against all marauders, whether beasts or men. Christ the Good Shepherd laid down his life for the sheep, both his “little flock” and also his “other sheep”. (John 10: 11,16) Now enthroned as King of the world and sent forth by Jehovah God to rule in the midst of his enemies, the great Shepherd-King takes the sword against the modern “Assyria&quot;. That sword is the destructive forces of the battle of Armageddon, ‘the war of the great day of God the Almighty.’—Rev. 16:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">' The “land of Assyria” which is wasted by that “sword” represents Satan’s entire organization, visible and invisible. Gog of the land of Magog is Satan’s chief demon prince therein, and all the nations gone totalitarian are the visible part thereof. In Micah’s day Babylon had not yet seized the world dominance but was still subject to Assyria, and hence “Assyria” also stands for Babylon and what Babylon symbolizes. Nimrod founded Babel, or Babylon, and thereafter Nineveh in Assyria, and hence the “land of Nimrod” means the same as “Assyria”. Further, it calls attention to its god, who is Satan. Nimrod, the rebel hunter after Jehovah’s “sheep”, typified Satan the Devil, whom Nimrod worshiped and served. After Nimrod’s death he was deified by his fellow gangsters, and thus they worshiped Satan under the form of Nimrod.—Gen. 10:9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>8</sup> The present-day totalitarian “Assyrian” invades “our land” and sets up his religious-dictatorial “abomination of desolation” in the holy place, where it ought not to stand, attempting to crowd out Jehovah’s Theocratic Government and take its place. God’s faithful remnant and their earthly companions brandish the “sword of the spirit” and expose that desolating abomination as a demonic counterfeit of God’s holy Kingdom. They carry the battle to the gates of the religious-totalitarian combine, “in the entrances thereof,” or, “in the gates of its (cities).” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font7"> The word “entrances” here may also mean something “opened”, that is, “drawn” swords, as at Psalm 55:21; and hence the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font7"> marginal rendering reads: “Shepherd . . . the land of Nimrod with drawn swords.” The swords will not be sheathed until the battle is won and religion is completely killed off. “In the entrances thereof” also means that Christ Jesus will not only destroy the totalitarian rule on earth but also carry the battle into the wicked spirit organization, “the land of Magog.” and there destroy all the demons and Gog their prince and Satan their chief.—Ezek. 39:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">’ The presumptuous assault of the invader proves to be his undoing, just as when his prototype, King Sennacherib and his Assyrian hosts, invaded the Holy Land and assaulted Jerusalem. “Then the angel of the Lord went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they [God’s covenant people] arose early in the morning, behold, they [the 185,000 Assyrians] were all dead corpses.” (Isa. 37:36) As long as Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions are bearing testimony to The Theocratic Government as rightful ruler of the world, the earthly powers who are for a totalitarian rule do not feel they can realize “Peace and safety” for themselves and their beastly rule. To silence Jehovah’s servants they ‘come within their land and tread within their borders’ and apparently restrain them, to all surface appearances. Then the great Shepherd-King Christ Jesus and the great Theocrat Jehovah God in their displeasure send emphatic tidings of final warning to the totalitarian world rule. Daniel 11: 44 describes it thus: “But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>10</sup> Out for the utter destruction of all who stand faithful for The Theocracy, the great “Assyrian” Satan and all his organization make their last desperate assault upon the remnant and the Good Shepherd’s “other sheep”. They shall be pushed out. The drawn swords of Jehovah’s executional forces under the Good Shepherd shall flash and fall and hack the “Assyrian” organization and waste its land, including the invisible demon realm. “Thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.” The sure hope for the deliverance of humankind from totalitarian rule under demons is Jehovah’s mighty Shepherd, the Savior of his “sheep”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>11</sup> Since the great “Assyrian” shall fail in his destructive program and since the “remnant” of Jehovah’s kingdom heirs are the principal target of the “Assyrian”, it appears reasonable, and the prophecy indicates strongly, that Jehovah by his Good Shepherd will preserve the remnant of his ‘Tittle flock” through the battle of Armageddon and they shall see the terrific destruction of the “Assyrian” forces down to the last creature thereof. This preservation is not that the remnant of spirit-begotten children of God may live on earth in the flesh during the whole thousand-year reign of Christ Jesus that shall follow. Their stay on earth after Armageddon is merely for a brief time, serving as a vindication of Jehovah’s promise and his almighty power to preserve the faithful in their direst extremity. Along with this remnant Jehovah lovingly and mercifully preserves his “other sheep”, who never forsake God's side and therefore never the side of the faithful remnant. Satan and his hordes may be permitted to kill some during the battle, like David’s loving friend Jonathan, as a proof of their integrity toward God even to the death. Yet Satan shall fail in his all-out wicked endeavor to rid the earth of every righteous servant of Jehovah God. That which they intended upon the righteous, God will return on their own heads.— Ps. 7 :15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>12</sup> What shall be the work of the remnant after that battle<sup>1</sup>? The prophecy beautifully pictures it: “And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people, as dew from the Lord, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.” (Mic. 5:7) The name of Jacob, who was also called “Israel”, denotes that the “remnant of Jacob” are the last on earth of the spiritual Israelites, the joint-heirs with Christ Jesus of the promise made long ago to the grandfather of Jacob, Abraham. There shall be a great multitude of Armageddon survivors besides the remnant. a&lt; pictured by Noah's family which survived the destruction of the “old world”, “the world of the ungodly.” These shall be out of the former ‘nations, kindreds, people, and tongues’.—Rev. 7 : 9-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>13</sup> Armageddon, symbolically represented as the destruction of Satan’s world by fire, will be a scorching time. (2 Pet. 3:7-12) Thereafter the remnant will be retained on earth by the Lord to bring timely refreshment to the “great multitude” of the “other sheep” as symbolized by dew in the morning of that “new world”, “wherein dwelleth righteousness.&quot; With the remnant shall be associated in the woik the “faithful men of old”, who shall have a &quot;better resurrection” to life as perfect men. They shall be made “princes in all the earth”, the permanent visible representatives of the heavenly Theocracy. (Ps. 45:16; Heb. 11:35,39,40) The Scriptures strongly suggest that they shall be awakened to life and service on earth in the crisis at the beginning of Armageddon, and they shall take their place by the side of the spiritual remnant who are but the temporary representatives on earth of The Theocracy’ in power.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>14</sup> “All flesh is grass.” (Isa. 40:6) Now just before Armageddon the wicked spring as the grass (Ps. 92: 7); but after their destruction in that battle, and doubtless in the presence of the remnant as well as the “princes”, Jehovah by Christ Jesus will issue to the “great multitude” the divine mandate to “fill the earth”. (Gen. 9:1,7) They shall marry and reproduce righteous offspring, and then the righteous shall spring as the grass to ever beautify the earth. The remnant during the remainder of their sojourn on earth shall be in the midst of these righteous ones, “as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor Yvaiteth for the sons of men.” Heavenly refreshment such as dew and showers does not depend upon human creatures. Dew and showers neither wait for the command of men nor can they be detained by men, but must be accepted as God provides. His “doctrine shall drop as the rain, [his] speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass”. (Deut. 32:2) ‘Out of Zion [God’s capital organization in heaven] shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem [New Jerusalem, which is above].’ (Mic. 4:2) Doubtless the remnant, together with the “princes”, will be used to further tender to the Lord’s “other sheep” his then “meat in due season”, including the proelamation of the divine mandate to that “great multitude&quot;. This will be very exhilarating, like dew and showers from the Lord God upon the parched grass. Already he has turned to the remnant a “pure language’’ or “pure lip’’, with which even now before the fire of Armageddon they are commanded by the Lord to refresh the people of good-will who become the Lord’s “other sheep”. (Zeph. 3: 8, 9) The remnant do not wait or tarry for any of the sons of men in order to get a license or permit or other approval from judges or police chiefs or other public officials to carry the Lord’s refreshment to those thirsting for righteousness and truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>15</sup> “And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.” (Mic. 5:8) It is now in this day of judgment, and down until the destruction of the wicked opposers at Armageddon, that the remnant must be bold as the lion, “which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any.” (Prov. 30:30) Being approved as God's devoted and faithful servants, they are ‘covered with the robe of righteousness’ as Jehovah’s official witnesses. “The righteous are bold as a lion.” (Prov. 28:1) &quot;In nothing terrified by your adversaries : which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.” (Phil. 1: 28) Their loving earthly companions have like devotion to The Theocracy and are likewise bold. They are like the shepherd David’s companions, “whose faces were like the faces of lions.”—1 Chron. 12:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>16</sup> Both the remnant and their companions follow “the Lion of the tribe of Juda” and work havoc with religion. To the nations now going totalitarian and forgetting God they declare the Lord's warning: “Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.” (Ps. 50:22) Compared with the royal “Lion of the tribe of Juda” the religious-totalitarian crowd are but a dock of sheep for prey. At Armageddon Jehovah will let him loose upon the prey and he will go through them and tear to pieces all those branded with ‘the mark of the beast and his image’, and all the demon herders will not be able to deliver pope, dictators or their regimented subjects.—Isa. 31:4; Rev. 14: 9,10; 13: 16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>17</sup> Further concerning that victory by the Lord's power the prophecy adds: “Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.” (Mic. 5: 9) This is addressed particularly to the invisible Captain, Leader and Commander of the remnant, Christ Jesus, in whose hand is all power in heaven and in earth. Now the aggressive &quot;king of the north” continues to “stretch forth his hand also upon the countries [by means of propaganda, religious ‘fifth column’, sea raiders, suitmarines, airplanes, Catholic Action, etc.) ; and the land of Egypt [meaning the anti-Nazi ‘king of the south’s’ realm] shall not escape.” (Dan. 11:42) That totalitarian-religious aggressor power tries to poke its meddlesome bloody hand within God’s visible organization. It tries to interfere with and break up the organized united action of the remnant and their companions, but even by its concentration camps and dungeons and torture chambers it fails to crack their integrity and prevent their giving further witness by word and example to Jehovah's supremacy. The power of the Lord prevails in them; his strength is made perfect in their weakness. (2 Cor. 12-9) They know that but a short time now and the Lord's almighty hand of power shall prevail over the adversaries and haters of The Theocracy and shall slap them down and cut them off and the Lord's hand shall remain uplifted in victory. “Let thy hand be uplifted against thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham; Am. Rev. Ver.) </span><span class="font7">“Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.”— Ps. 21:8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DEMONISM OUSTED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>18</sup> The deluded people whose necks are still caught in the snare of religion think Jehovah’s witnesses are extreme in discarding everything pertaining to religion and practicing nothing hut pure Christianity. Jehovah is not fanatically extreme. So note what He does, and then judge as to his faithful and obedient witnesses who keep his commandments. “And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots.” (Mic. 5: 10) We are now in “that day”, which day began with the Lord's coming to the temple for judgment and purging the covenant people of God. It is also called “the day of our Lord Jesus Christ”. In that day the Lord's remnant on earth must “be blameless” by carrying on the “pure worship and undefiled before God and the Father” and without any compromise with religion. (1 Cor. 1:8; Jas. 1:27, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Syriac Version) </span><span class="font7">That day leads up to Armageddon. In the face of that battle for the vindication of God’s name what does Jehovah require of his remnant and his “other sheep”! Carnal weapons, as symbolized by horses and chariots? No! “Christendom” now feverishly multiplies such, but the Lord cuts such things off from his covenant people. He has revealed to them that Armageddon is not a fight between “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” nor other divided human interests. It is the final and deciding battle between God’s organization under his King Christ Jesus and Satan’s organization under his demon prince Gog and including all the nations which become totalitarian and demonized. Hence to his servants Jehovah says: “The battle is not yours, but God's. Ye shall not need to fight in this battle; set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you.” (2 Chron. 20:15,17) Therefore the remnant do not go down to Egypt, Satan’s world, for help by its fighting equipment. —Isa. 31:1,3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>1B</sup> In the typical setting long ago the twelve tribes of Israel fought against one another under the rival leaderships of Ephraim and Jerusalem. This continued until the Lord purged that people and brought forth a remnant. Now the Lord God has brought forth his spiritual remnant and commands that there be no internal strife or fighting among them, but that all shall be at unity in Christ and fight only against the common foe, the demons and religion. Thus He fulfills his promise: “And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off.” (Zech. 9:10) Now God’s unified people pray for the peace and prosperity of his visible organization, saying: “For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good.” (Ps. 122:6-9) Any causing disturbance and division among God’s people trying to serve him without distraction show they are not of his house or organization. The Lord duly cuts such off.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>20</sup> Jehovah is not an extremist when he further says: “And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds.” (Mie. 5:11) “Cities” picture organizations. Those that Jehovah cuts off from his Holy Land are not the service organizations of his faithful and wise remnant class. These operate according to his Theocratic rule and in the interest of his Kingdom. When Christ Jesus, having now received the Kingdom, came to the temple in 1918 and began judgment at the house of God he found two classes among those consecrated to God and begotten of His spirit. One class he approved, to wit, those who faithfully sought to keep unity with Him their Head and to look after the interests of their brethren in Christ and to serve them with the Lord’s provided “meat in due season”. Such he brought into the temple and anointed them and made them his “faithful and wise servant”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>21</sup> The other company were self-seeking, selfhonoring, oppressive to their brethren, troublemakers, seducers seeking to draw disciples after themselves, and obstructors to the Lord’s Kingdomproclamation work. Such were in line for the kingdom of God, but the Lord by his angels gathered these undesirables out of his kingdom. He cut them asunder from the Lord’s house and cast them into the outer darkness to there gnash their teeth with the other religious hypocrites. (Matt. 13:41; 24: 4.&gt;-51) Such cast-out ones established organizations or “cities” of their own to do the Lord's work for him according to their own self-chosen ways, but the Lord cut these off from the “land” of his faithful remnant and threw down all the strongholds of religion that had remained, and thereby purged his remnant. Concerning his action against the “cities” of the “evil servant” class Jehovah says:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>22</sup> “If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the Lord thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying, Certain men, the children of Belial, are &lt;rone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known; . . . thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edse of the sword, destroying it utterly . . . and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again. And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee.” (Deut. 13:12-17) Such action must take place prior to Armageddon and preparatory to a cleansed earth. Jehovah establishing that clean condition among those who are to survive Armageddon, then surely that holy condition of devotion to God and his Kingdom will continue on earth after Armageddon. Those privileged to pass through Armageddon into the new condition on earth must now walk with Jehovah God as did Noah before the Flood.—Gen. 6 ■ S. 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>23</sup> Knowing that religion is of the Devil and is demonism and leads away from the great Giver of life and into destruction, Jehovah purges the remnant of all such. As he has said: “And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers [users of hidden arts (I?o/7i.)]; thy graven images also will I cut off. and thy standing images [pillars] out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands: and I will pluck up thy groves [(J»i. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font7"> thine Asherim] out of the midst of thee; so will I destroy thy cities [thy enemies </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(margin: </span><span class="font7">and Leeser)].”—Mic. 5:12-14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>24</sup> “Christendom” is polluted through and through with the above forms of demonism or religion. But concerning his remnant of the temple class Jehovah foretold that at the end of the 2,300 days his sanctuary should be cleansed or justified. That time is now here. (Dan. 8:13,14) The Lord Jesus forewarned of the false prophets that would appear at the end of Satan’s world and using witchcrafts by whispering their own unscriptural opinions and predictions. The “soothsayers” are the religious hypocrites pretending to serve God but practicing Satan’s arts under cover for self-gain and glory. The “false prophet” mentioned at Revelation 19:20 is that powerful organization that makes an impressive stage-play before the Devil’s abominable totalitarian “beast”. That “prophet” promises a free-people’s world after the conflict, but such prophet is overreached by the demons and proves to be false and joins in setting up a religious-totalitarian “new world order”. Such “false prophet” with his attractive “new order” promises has no influence upon the remnant and their companions; they are wholly for The Theocracy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>23</sup> The graven images and standing images and other works of creatures' hands are cleared from God’s sanctuary. Such are things which were once respected more highly than the pure and selfsufficient Word of God; for example, the supposed symbolisms of the great pyramid of Gizeh; also set forms for going through a manner of worship; “character development” idolatry; undue honors conferred upon men and particularly “elective elders”, made such by the hands of voters raised in an affirmative vote; mapping out God’s work in advance for him by chronologies or time tables, based on the pyramid or other measurements. Now the Devil’s organization has brought forth the “image of the beast” to meet the world emergency and to make it appear that men can bind up this world into a peaceful and enduring arrangement, so making unnecessary and undesirable the kingdom of God. The effort is made to coerce all the people to idolize such “image of the beast”. (Rev. 13:14,15) Jehovah’s devoted remnant and their companions refuse to hail, salute or worship any creature image; they have no gods besides Jehovah.—Ex. 20:3-5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>20</sup> “Groves,” or “Asherim”, of demonism represented the female part of the religious worship and hence pictured Satan’s woman, his unclean demoncontrolled organization which recognizes him as lord and husband. This organization brings forth the clergy, to whom Jesus said: “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth.” (John 8:44) Worship was carried on under the shadow of the “groves” or “Asherim”. The clergy today are the friends of this world of Satan. To win converts and have the world’s approval, they mix the things of Satan’s organization with the things of God, whereas there is no agreement between such things. (2 Cor. 6:14-16) The clergy carry on their worship under the shadow, approval, permit, license, and protection of the representatives of the organization belonging to the “god of this world”. The remnant have come out from such and touch not the unclean thing. They worship and serve God at his temple and by his authority and according to his commandment and under his protection and approval. All the “cities”, or organizations of false gods, Jehovah has destroyed from among the remnant. Such “cities”, or “watchers”, encamp against them to ensnare them and thus are a close-girdling and easily-besetting sin: “the sin which doth so easily beset us,” to wit, religion. (Heb. 12:1) Now the remnant worship God in spirit and in truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>27</sup> All this clearing out of religion from among the remnant and the Lord’s “other sheep” greatly enrages the great “Assyrian” and all the demons and the religionists. Their religious hypocrisy is shown up by contrast, and their religious susceptibilities are shocked. So they are stirred up by the demons to assault the God-fearing remnant and their companions and to wage a war of lies and persecution against them. The religionists, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy who ride on top, steer the scarletcolored totalitarian “beast” against them to devour those who renounce religion and worship Jehovah God and keep his commandments. (Rev. 17:1-14) This stirs up the anger and fury of Jehovah against the presumptuous enemy. Having cleansed his “sanctuary” class from religion and established the pure worship among his remnant, He will not tolerate the efforts of the totalitarian-religious crowd to reimpose demonism upon his covenant-people who keep their integrity by faithfully resisting all such attempts by the “abomination of desolation”. Hence, as a climax, Jehovah says he will destroy those who refused to be cleansed and who held on to religion: “And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen [the nations], such as they have not heard”; “upon the nations which hearkened not.”—Mic. 5:15; </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>28</sup> Such nations have heard the sound with their ears, but have not heeded that message sounded forth. For more than sixty years and by the greatest publicity campaign in Christian history Jehovah’s witnesses have warned the nations of God’s vengeance coming at Armageddon. So there is no excuse for not having heard. The nations have simply preferred to forget Jehovah God and have objected to hearkening with belief and obedience. Concerning this Jehovah by his prophet foretold: “Behold ye among the heathen [the nations], and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work [at Armageddon] in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you [beforehand].” (Hab. 1:5; Acts 13:40,41) Armageddon will be so furious it will leave all the nations as though they had not been. (Obad. 16) It will be righteous vengeance upon them, because such vengeance means the vindication of Jehovah’s name, which name the nations have reproached by choosing demon-worship and demonrule and persecuting those who bore Jehovah’s name and proclaimed his Theocracy by Christ Jesus.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REQUIREMENTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>20</sup> The demons are gathering all nations of the world to Armageddon, and the life of each individual of the peoples is involved. Satan the Devil is the ‘'god of this world” and still has the “power of death”. (Heb. 2:14) He would make the peoples believe that life in peace and happiness is dependent upon his organization and proceeds through and is sustained and protected by his organization. Now that demon organization rapidly nears its final end. In the desperation to either rule or ruin Satan sets up requirements whereby creatures may live under his organization and which requirements they must meet or else be killed. His decree is that none shall survive save those worshiping his beastly organization and having its mark in the forehead or the hand; and he forces regimentation upon the people contrary to the rules of Jehovah.—Rev. 13: 15-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>30</sup> In reality, Jehovah God is the Fountain of life, and to him salvation belongs. (Pss. 36:9; 3:8) He declares that all who conform to and abide under Satan’s organization shall be destroyed with it at Armageddon by Jehovah’s Executioner. Jehovah through his Word reveals that the only place of safety and preservation unto life throughout the great deluge of Armageddon is the Ark of his organization. All seekers after everlasting life must take refuge in it. His command to his faithful remnant is that they must now aid the refugees of good-will to that only place of security and life, and must make knowm to them Jehovah’s life requirements which they must fulfill while abiding within his place of refuge. Thus there is now a great controversy on concerning effective requirements for life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>31</sup> By his mouthpiece and witnesses Jehovah addresses “Christendom”: “Hear ye now what the Lord saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.” (Mic. 6:1) ‘'Christendom” resents these attentions and says, 'Why come to me and continually make me hear the message? I have the Bible, and why don’t you witnesses go to the heathen?' Why? Well, in the type Jehovah spoke to his professed covenant-people Israel, and now he commands “Christendom” to hear, because the heathen have no covenant obligations toward Almighty God whereas “Christendom” claims to be in a covenant to do his will. Hence her claim makes her subject to God’s requirements. “Judgment must begin at the house of God,” is God’s rule. “Christendom” claims to be such house, and must therefore get attention before heathendom. “Christendom” is out to justify her yielding to religion or demonism. Jehovah bids her “contend”, or, “maintain thy controversy” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.),</span><span class="font7"> with him as to whether the Kingdom requirements are excessive or unreasonable, and why destruction should not come upon “Christendom” as well as heathendom at Armageddon. Jehovah further bids her contend in a most public way, “before the mountains, and . . . hills.” The controversy is of vital interest and concern to the lowest and to the highest personages of Satan's visible organization, to pope, dictators, kings, judges, governors, and others whose very highness makes their responsibility greater because of the power and influence they exercise over the peoples and the laws laid upon the people. Instead of taking av ay freedom of speech, press and assembly in connection with the worship of Jehovah God, “Christendom&quot; should play fair and consider the everlasting welfare of her peoples and let them hear both sides of the controversy. Then let the people determine which side is right, and freely act accordingly, thereby fixing each one his own destiny.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>32</sup> “Hear ye, 0 mountains, the Lord’s controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the Lord hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.” (Mic. 6:2) Such mountains represent particularly the lofty national governments of “Christendom”, including “the king of the north&quot; and “the king of the south” who now exchange blows over world domination. Jehovah has made such “mountains” to hear the message of His life requirements. Jehovah’s witnesses have by special couriers paid personal visits on the various ruling ones and presented them the printed Resolutions adopted at international assemblies. Like information ha&gt; been mailed to such worldly authorities. It has al-&lt;&gt; been radiocast over great networks of stations. There have been public hearings before federal commissions, Supreme Court and other courts high and low; and also petitions for free worship and open debate, and signed by millions of fair-minded lovers of righteousness. Even the so-called ‘ heathen nations” have been served with notice of Jehovah’s controversy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>33</sup> The bone of contention over which the two “kings” declare they will fight to the last ditch, shot and man is not the main issue. The really serious question is, not which one shall get on top with world domination, but, Shall Jehovah's Theocratic Government exercise universal domination? Of what avail is it if one “king” of “Christendom&quot; temporarily gets on top, if shortly thereafter all “Christendom”, together with heathendom, shall be wiped out at Armageddon for not meeting God's requirements? Hence “Christendom’s” view that Jehovah’s witnesses are wasting time and are a nuisance and serving no vital, essential purpose is upside down. Their proclamation of Jehovah’s Word is the most vital and pressing service from which all peoples can benefit lastingly. The creature's relationship to the Supreme Power and to the Government of ‘‘The Higher Powers” is of greater importance than that to any earthly human organization and it involves the creature’s eternal life and happiness.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>31</sup> In Jehovah’s controversy with unfaithful Jerusalem he sent his prophets early and late. So now he sends his anointed witnesses. Not only the lofty ones must hear, but also those who claim to be the foundations of Satan’s visible organization, “ye lasting rocks, the foundations of the earth.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font7"> The pope at Vatican City claims to be the rock foundation of spiritual Israel, “the church.” He and all other religious systems of “Christendom” claim to be lasting, enduring when all other things fail, and to be the bottom upon which the civilization of the earthly organization rests. Therefore they insist that provision be made for religion in the world order to be set up after this world war. The pope depends on the Axis powers as his military arm, “the sword of his church,” and all such comrades declare that strong, hierarchic and authoritarian governments are the only solid base for a permanent stable human society, a “new order based on moral principles”. Such religionists, including the Vatican’s pontiff himself, have been notified of Jehovah’s controversy and have been warned that they “shall die’’ 1</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>35</sup> This controversy with God’s professed ‘people of Israel’, or &quot;Christendom”, may not be dismissed lightly as if having no bearing on the world outcome or on one’s individual hope of life. It is of far-reaching importance to you to know whether “Christendom” has kept faith with God or has broken the covenant she claims with him and is worthy of death and hence doomed. All persons of good-will and who want life must be interested in this controversy, to determine whether to side with “Christendom&quot; or to forsake her. You must know how to avoid the death-dealing snares into which the demons have lured her. Thereby you can steer clear of her shortcomings and covenant-breaking, and so escape sharing her terrible fate at Armageddon. To know what is required of God unto life and how to maintain your integrity toward him, you must listen to His side of the controversy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>36</sup> Jehovah reasons with “Christendom” on the basis on which she claims to operate, to wit, as “his people”: “0 my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.” (Mic. 6:3) Jehovah raises the same question by a later prophet. (Jer. 2: 5-8. 31) “Christendom” claims God’s promises in the Bible, but does not render obedience to his law of worship upon which the fulfillment of those promises is based. (Ex. 20:6) Is God, therefore, responsible for her failure to realize those promises? Concerning the religionists and their political allies who disregard God’s law and brazenly make prayers for his blessing on their plans and methods, Proverbs 28: 9 says : “He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.” (Prov. 15:8) Failing to keep her side of the covenant, “Christendom” cannot receive the blessings promised. Why, then, should she be offended and her religious susceptibilities shocked at having her failure pointed out by Jehovah’s witnesses ? ‘Wily should she get wearied by their persistence in warning her at God’s command and then try to stop such witnesses by mobs, Catholic Action, government bans, and refined persecution carried on under the cloak of legality and “special emergency” laws and measures?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>3T</sup> It is not unreasonable of Jehovah to keep on sending his witnesses to her. He knows the importance of the matter deserves it. Further, “Christendom” should consider that it shows forth God’s great forbearance and mercy when he serves warning notice before executing his judgment upon her as punishment for not living up to her covenant claims and thereby reproaching God's name. (Jer. 7:25; 2 Chron. 36:15,16) “Testify against me,” says Jehovah ; but the religionists cannot answer on Scriptural grounds of argument. They are confounded by His little ones who quote Scripture showing God's righteousness and blamelessness. What do the so-called “Christian religionists” have against Jehovah ? He is not responsible for the past and present course of the Jews. In fact, such “Christian religionists” with their greater opportunities and responsibilities have done worse to Jehovah God than the natural Jews themselves. In spitefulness, therefore, the religionists testify falsely against Jehovah’s witnesses to discredit them and their message. Persons of goodwill are not wearied by these, but welcome their visits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">•<sup>8</sup> Doomed “Christendom” should consider what Jehovah in his faithfulness has done by which she might have been forever blessed. “For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 0 my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him [remembered] from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the Lord.” (Mic. 6:4,5) Jehovah provided the typical passover in Egypt for the deliverance of the Jews, and in due time provided the real thing, “Christ our passover,” “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world,” and by which comes deliverance from antitypical Egypt, Satan’s world organization. (1 Cor. 5:7; John 1:29) “Christendom” claims to have come out of “Egypt”, but belies her claim by making friendship with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">world, God's enemy. (Jas. 4:4) Jehovah God has again sent his Prophet, the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, to lead the way out of the world and into the blessings promised to the obedient who hear that Prophet. (Acts 3:22,23; 7:37) With his coming to the temple for judgment Jehovah has sent forth with him Christ's remnant of brethren as fellow witnesses, pictured by Moses’ brother and sister, Aaron and Miriam. (Gal. 3:28; Joel 2:28,29) They declare Jehovah’s name in the antitvpical Egvpt.—Ex. 9:16; 15:20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>39</sup> Jehovah God never backs up an enemy curse upon those who faithfully serve Him. Balak, the ancient king of Moab, opposed Jehovah’s people and sought to have them cursed and doomed. The prophet Balaam hired himself out to do it. He therefore pictures the ‘‘man of sin” class, including the “evil servant” company and also the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other clergy of “Christendom”. These hire out to the worldly powers who are out for world domination and therefore oppose The Theocracy and who pay the religionists to curse Jehovah's witnesses for preaching that Theocratic Government. (Numbers 22,23,24; 2 Pet. 2:15,16; Rev. 2:14) Jehovah turned Balaam’s attempted curse into a blessing. Today the curses and misrepresentation of his covenant people by the religionists He makes to work for a witness to the Kingdom and for the good of his faithful witnesses who love him. (Deut. 23: 4, 5; Neh. 13:2; Josh. 24: 9,10) No curses written in God’s Word can with effect be applied against his faithful servants. Religious curses pronounced upon them by pope and like clergy are neither Biblical nor of God, but are demoniacal and are of no avail.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>40</sup> To get them “from Shittim unto Gilgal” Jehovah divided the waters of Jordan and led his people across dry-shod. Then from Gilgal as a base he directed the march around Jericho, ending in the utter destruction of that demonized religious stronghold. From that destruction only Rahab and her believing household were saved, picturing how God delivers from &quot;Christendom’s” downfall the “sheep” class of good-will who do good unto his faithful and true witnesses, the remnant brethren of Christ. “Christendom” could have availed herself of covenant privileges with God and experienced like things antitypically, “from Shittim unto Gilgal,” so to speak. Only the “remnant” and their companions like Rahab have been thus led and used and preserved of the Lord. Why not &quot;Christendom”? Because she willfully broke her implied covenant with God. By remembering such facts Jehovah is seen to be not at fault. Faced with such facts “Christendom” must &quot;know the righteousness of the Lord”. He keeps covenant.—Neh. 1:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>41</sup> Now, with Armageddon immediately before us, it is a matter of life or destruction. Those who would be of the Lord’s &quot;other sheep” that shall compose the “great multitude” of Armageddon survivors and live joyfully on earth forever must find the answer to a very personal question, and very important. 'Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old ? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?”—Mic. 6: 6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>42</sup> How shall now one approach God with acceptance and get in the way of life? The leading religious organization insists it is by the Roman Catholic clergy and their canonized saints. Their latest argument is that mankind must come by way of a &quot;new order founded on moral principles” as approved by the pope. The “Protestant” clergy hang on to the papal apron-strings and for self-protection keep “good neighbor” policy with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and claim the approach to God is by joining their conflicting religious systems; that to be saved and go to heaven one must be a member thereof. All agree that one must make liberal financial sacrifices to support the clergy and their expensive organizations. They conduct &quot;drives&quot; for money as if to enrich God. Billions of dollars are paid them for masses and prayers for the dead. They disregard God’s law and appointed way and please themselves and then salve their consciences by such so-called “sacrifices”. With such religionists the “evil servant&quot; class line up in opposition to The Theocracy and its witnesses and claim approach to God is by the self-idolatry of &quot;character development” so called.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>43</sup> Sacrifices without obedience are bribe tactics and are abominable to God. (Prov. 21: 27; Isa. 1: 11-17) “To obey is better than sacrifice.” (1 Sam. 15.22) A mere material-sacrifice arrangement would favor the rich as against the empty-handed poor. All such “sacrifices” are things outside of the individual himself and can become mere formality, able to be done without one's heart in it and with mental i enervations, as when haters of dictatorship &quot;heil llitlei 1” and salute Hitler’s flag under compulsion. The i eli-gionists make an outward and formal acknowledgment of “transgression” and of &quot;sin of my soul&quot;. In the world conflict of 1914-1918 they persecuted conscientious Christians, but their appearance of repentance thereafter did not lead them to accept God’s kingdom proclaimed by his persecuted witnesses. Instead, they hardened their hearts against Jehovah's King and turned to and hailed the League of Nations, the World Court, the Paris Peace Pact of 1928 outlawing war, and other anti-Theocratic schemes. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy had its own scheme for world dominance, to wit, the rebirth of the “Holy Roman Empire” with the help of arbitrary dictators. Again today, as in the Dark Ages, the Hierarchy is exposed as willing to sacrifice millions of her “Catholic population” to gain her selfish ends and also to thereby cause the death of millions of firstborn ones and other children of human mothers, and which children are fighting against the totalitarian dictators that serve the Hierarchy's aims. Honest Catholics who appreciate the benefits of democracy and separation of religion and state should awake to this clergy hypocrisy and listen to God’s requirement for life and blessings. With such religious sacrifice of human flesh and blood in violation of God’s everlasting covenant will he be pleased? —Gen. 9:6,11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">““He hath shewed thee </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">[(Leeser; Rotherham) </span><span class="font7">He hath told thee], 0 man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?” (Mic. 6: 8) Jehovah has told man His requirements; “whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning.” (Rom. 15:4) Xow God has sent his Prophet, the Greater Micah, Christ Jesus, to the temple. Him God uses to make clear the inspired Scriptures and to point out therefrom Jehovah’s requirements. Thus since the Lord’s coming to the temple in 1918 the Scriptures have been especially opened up as never hitherto. To the Christians there have been made clear their true commission from the Lord and their covenant obligations and also the requirements concerning the Lord’s “other sheep” who flee to him for refuge. Then Jehovah anointed his approved remnant and sent them forth in performance of that revealed commission to go up and down “Christendom” and other nations to pass the life-giving information out to all, whether claiming to be Christian or not. As in Micah's day, the man actually in a covenant to do God’s will, and the man professedly so, should be and are most directly concerned about what the Lord requires. However, the Lord's rule is the same toward the earthly ones of good-will who become the Lord’s “other sheep”, even though they are not like “Christendom” in claiming to be spiritual Israelites.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>45</sup> The question that the young man asked Jesus is now fitting: ‘What good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?” (Matt. 19:16-19) Because of inherited sin and imperfection none on earth can now do perfectly; but note God’s Word as to “what is good” to do: “I will praise thy name, 0 Lord, for it is good.” (Ps. 54:6) “It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, 0 Most High.” (Ps. 92:1) “Praise ye the </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord: for it is good to sing praises unto our God: for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.” (Ps. 147 :1) “He that received seed [of Kingdom truth] into the good ground, is he that heareth the word, and under-standeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.” (Matt. 13:23) ‘Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.” (Matt. 25:21; Luke 19:17) “Prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” (Rom. 12:2) The sum of the foregoing is that persons of good-will, the Lord’s “other sheep”, must first receive his truth and devote themselves to the Lord. They must then bear witness to his name and Kingdom, carrying forth the Kingdom fruits to other hungry ones of good-will, and continuing faithful and in integrity in doing God’s expressed good and perfect will.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>46</sup> You want life! “And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly?” Do that which is risht and equal. Do not withhold from the “stranger that is within thy gates” his right, namely, to hear God's life-giving message. Freely thou hast received: rightly then, freely give. Show no partiality or respect of persons. Do not misjudge thy Christian brother or “neighbor”. Let him bear his own burden before the Lord and answer to his own Master, the Lord, who judges him.—Rom. 14:4; Gal. 6:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>47</sup> “And to love mercy.” This the Lord requires also. “For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice: and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.’’ (Hos. 6:6) Be forgiving, forbearing toward the faults and unintentional mistakes of thy brethren, helpfully pointing out to such the right course to take in their difficulty. Sound the Lord’s merciful warning to those about to die at Armageddon if unaided. Make return-visits upon those slow to understand but willing. Warn the honest and sincere against religion. Aid the refugees to find the Lord’s “city of refuge” for protection against God's Executioner at Armageddon and to abide there and keep the rules, within the city bounds, in integrity. Do good unto Jehovah’s witnesses, the “least of these [Christ's] brethren”, and do not take advantage of the war conditions to vent religious spleen on them for keeping God’s law and exposing religion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>48</sup> “And to walk humbly with thy God”; not contrary to him. That means to be not self-willed, but obedient to God’s law and organization instructions. Recognize the true “Higher Powers”. Do not support schemes that exalt creatures and organizations that oppose Jehovah and his universal domination by his Theocracy. Do not think thyself above God’s law and that man’s law is higher than God’s in some cases, especially in some man-made emergency. The world emergency with Armageddon at the door is the very time to most anxiously keep God’s law and obey him rather than obey desperate men. Only those who thus walk obediently with Jehovah God as Noah walked with God down to the Flood will have any chance to survive Armageddon and serve him beyond.</span></p></li></ul>

<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark13"></a>&quot;NEW WORLD” RULER AND ASSOCIATES</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">URNING away from a consideration of the beastly rule of this present unsatisfactory world, it is refreshing to consider the vision of the glorious new world and its majestic ruler, his title and his father, and his position and his associates in office One of those associates, named John, who was favored with the inspired vision thereof, describes it for the benefit of us living at the world's end:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: and they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.”— Rev. 14.1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Scriptures “mountain” is a symbol of God’s government or kingdom. The highest part of a mountain is properly called a “hill”. The highest part of God’s kingdom is the governor or king. Jehovah says. “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion” (Ps 2:6) Jehovah’s organization is described in His Word under the symbol and name of “Zion”, and it was typified by Mount Zion in Palestine. When David of Bethlehem was made king of the Jews Mount Zion was made the seat of government of the nation. There David built him a house of “cedar wood”, symbolic of the everlasting existence of God's kingdom. That was Jehovah God’s typical Theocratic government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A thousand years thereafter John in a vision beheld a beautiful mountain It must have been a white mountain, and glorious, because white is symbolic of puritj, and because the Lord is glorious. It was Mount Zion, Gods pure and holy organization, the Kingdom, the Governor of which is pure, holy and undefiled. He is Christ Jesus, the Beloved One of God. The fact that John the apostle saw Mount Zion indicates that God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus was born in A.D. 1914 and that thereafter the servants of God whom John pictured saw that Government and appreciated it as established and functioning, while the enemies thereof are still in existence and fighting o\er world domination. The day comes, and is not far distant, when Mount Zion will be the peace and joy of all that live forever on the earth. (Ps. 48.2) Jehovah loves Zion and the entrance into that organization. (Pss. 78:68; 87:2) Zion is the official dwelling-place of Jehovah God, and therefore Zion is pure and holy. (Pss 9:11; 132:13) Out of Zion God shines, because Zion honors the Lord God and magnifies his name.—Pss. 50 -. 2; 135 • 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">John says he saw a “Eamb” that stood on Mount Zion. The transfiguration scene ‘‘in the holy mount” when that Lamb of God was yet on earth in the flesh seems to refer to the same thing. (2 Pet. 1:17,18) This is “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world”. (John 1:29) His blood shed at Calvary is for sin atonement of believing humankind, and now the Lamb comes in his glory, clothed with all power and authority, to clean up and remove the sin-stain from those who shall live in the new world. Be it noted that in the book of The Revelation Jesus is called the “Lamb” twenty-eight times, which is more times than of any other name it gives to him. God must have a reason for emphasizing that title. “Lamb” is translated from the Greek word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">arnion.</span><span class="font5"> which, more literally. means “dear lamb” or “lambling”. The evident purpose of the title is to remind all creation that God is the Great Shepherd and that Jesus is the dearest one of God’s great flock. Jesus said: “Jehovah is my shepherd.” (Ps. 23:1, A. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">li.</span><span class="font5"> T.) The one standing on Mount Zion, therefore, is definitely identified as Christ Jesus, the glorious King, the promised Seed—Gen. 22:8. IS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus took his position on Mount Zion in 1914. John’s vision suggests of Him that, standing there, Jesus now ‘sees of the travail of his soul' in fulfillment of the words spoken by God's prophet (Isa. 53-11. 12), and that he is filled with satisfaction and joy because the time has come to vindicate his Father's name. (Jer. 11:19. 20 , Ps. 110: 2-6) Thirty-five centuries ago a lamb of the flock was slain in Egypt and its blood was used as the basis for the law covenant which God made with the Israelites in Egypt and later confirmed at Mount Sinai on their way to the Holy Land. Likewise, the blood of Jesus, the Lamb of God slain on earth, is the basic sacrifice for the “new covenant”, of which Jesus is the Mediator and which is made on earth and ratified on coming to the true Mount Zion (Heb. 12 24) He is the greatest as well as the most loved of all God's creation, and concerning his dominion it is written - “And thou, 0 tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, e\en the first dominion, the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.” —Mic. 4: S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His kingdom was born or began in 1914, before the travail of the “war in heaven” came upon Zion. “Before she travailed, she brought forth, before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child [the new-born Government!.” (Isa. 66:7) “Unto us a son [the Son of God] is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder.” (Isa. 9.6,7) This is true because he is God’s dear Lamb and anointed King now upon his throne. The law, or rule of action that shall govern the new heavens and new earth, goes forth from Mount Zion. (Isa. 2:3) Not in Rome, but in Zion. God’s organization, the dear Lamb of God is laid as the Chief Corner Stone, God’s Anointed King, and he is the sanctuary for the children or members of Zion. (Isa. 2S-. 16; S 14) Such members of Zion constitute the church and are “living stones” built up on him (1 Pet. 2:6-8) He is also laid as a stumbling stone for his enemies, who stumble over him as the world’s Rightful Ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Symbolically speaking, the church is “the Lamb’s wife’’, and after his coming to the temple for judgment it was time to tell her as a child of Zion, that she might rejoice over that fact: ‘Rejoice greatly, 0 daughter of Zion; and shout for joy; for behold, thy King cometh unto thee. He shall speak peace to the nations; and his dominion shall be throughout all the earth.’ (Zech. 9:9,10) The church is the “daughter of Zion”. It is Zion (God’s organization) that gives birth to her children who constitute members of God’s kingdom. Concerning such children it is written: “For as soon as Zion travailed [the travail came upon her in 1917 and 1918], she brought forth her children.”— Isa. 66:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Zion having now been built up, and her children having been brought forth, the Lord’s servant class or God's people on earth represented by the apostle John is given a vision of what has taken place. Therefore John adds concerning the Lamb: “And with him an hundred and forty and four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads.” (Rev. 14:1) This prophetic picture could not be fulfilled until the faithful Christians who had slept in death awaiting the Lord's return had been resurrected out of death to life in the spirit and the judgment at the temple had begun with the “house of God” and the remnant thereof yet on earth had been approved and brought into the temple condition and illuminated by the lightnings of Jehovah, his flashes of truth. Being brought forth as God's children begotten and anointed of his spirit and thus acknowledged by him, these would have his name in their foreheads. They would have an intelligent appreciation of the fact that they were God’s children, and, with the name in their foreheads, they are easily identified as children of God. The John or servant class, now in the temple, can see and appreciate the beautiful tableau, the first part of which appears to be Christ the glorious King and also his body members in God's organization. Those who are the children have begun and continue to sing Jehovah's praises and rejoice: “And Jehovah will reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for ever.”—Mic 4.7, A I? V</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The number that stood with the Lamb on Mount Zion is the same as that of those who were “scaled” of the spiritual twelve tribes of Israel, to wit, 144,000 (Rev. 7: 4) God had promised to -write upon his faithful ones Ins name. (See Revelation 3:12.) These are shown in the tableau as having received his name written in their foreheads. These are they that have escaped from the snare of the enemy’s organization Babylon; as it is written: “But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance [shall be they that escape </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(marginal reading)],</span><span class="font5"> and there shall be holiness; . . . And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau [Satan’s religious organization] ; and the kingdom shall be the </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord’s.”</span><span class="font5"> (Obad. 17-21) Under the power and influence of the demons the attempt is now being made to compel all creatures on earth to worship the “beast”, Satan’s visible organization, but upon the foreheads of those marked with their Father Jehovah’s name there is no room for the “name” or the “number” of the “beast”. Instead, there appears upon them the name of honor, reverence and praise to Jehovah and to his King. They are wholly devoted to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Gathered unto the Lord, that is, into a unity with him, his people are now out of Babylon and it is a time for them to rejoice and sing; and this they do. (Ps 126:1; Isa 52:7,8) It is the time also for God’s wrath to begin against that enemy organization Babylon. Therefore it is written ■ “The </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> our God . . . For his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord,</span><span class="font5"> the vengeance of his temple. And I will render unto Babylon, and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea [Babylonia], all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord, As</span><span class="font5"> Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.” (Jcr. 51:10,11, 24, 49) The time has now come to declare “the day of vengeance of our God”, and those of the organization of the Lord must declare it.—Isa. 61:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is service to be done. Some who were favored with the knowledge of God’s truth and who covenanted to do his will became ''wear: in well doing” and they have concluded that all they need to do is to manifest outwardly a “sweet character”, meet together and have what they call “fellowship’’, and then wait to be taken to heaven. They deceive themselves and are deceived. Jehovah, however, gathers his faithful people into Zion for service. He has visited the nations to take out of them a “people for his name”, and those taken out must be his witnesses to sing forth his praises. (See Acts 15:14; 1 Peter 2:9; Isaiah 43:10,12.) Therefore the apostle John, representing the servant class, hears “a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps”.— Rev. 14:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Version</span><span class="font5"> renders this part of the text, “the voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers.” The picture shows that the members of Zion can not and do not keep still. They cannot, because “in his temple doth every one speak of his glory”. (Ps 29:9) Being in the temple, they must sing forth Jehovah’s praise. ‘Where there are those who claim to be followers of Christ and who are using the “soft pedal” concerning Satan’s organization, or who insist on keeping still and ignoring the fact that Satan has an organization, such is conclusive proof that they are not of God’s capital organization Zion, whatever else might be their position Let no one who has entered into a covenant with the Lord be deceived into remaining quiet and inactive. This Revelation picture and many corroborating texts show that God’s temple elass must be active to the ven<sup>-</sup> end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">John heard the “voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters”, and this portends a downpour of God’s blessings “When he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, ... he maketh lightnings for rain.” (Jer 10: 13, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font5"> In that the voice was “as the voice of a great thunder”, it symbolically says that it is a message of God being proclaimed, which message is a rebuke to those who reproach his name. (Pss. 104:7; 18:6,7,13) But to those who love God it is a sound of refreshing truth announcing to them that God’s kingdom is come, and the time to rejoice and sing. The temple being now open, the time is come for the installation of the sacred singers and harpists who shall engage in singing the praises of Jehovah God. Such service was employed in the typical house of the Lord. In the typical temple of ancient times King David set aside certain musicians, &quot;v. Iio should prophesy with harps . . . for song in the house of the Lord.” (1 Chron. 25:1,3.6) In that temple semcc the singers, selected from the tribe of Levi, were caused to sing and to play upon the harp. (2 Chron 5 12,13) Thus God foreshadowed that when he gathered his spiritual Israelites into the temple they should sing forth his praises. The time of joy has arrived, and Christ Jesus at the temple, as the great Judge, says to those whom he approves: “Enter thou into the joy of thy lord.” (Matt 25:21) The approved spiritual Israelites enter the temple, and their songs and their harps sound with praise to the great Jehovah and to his King Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, whieh were redeemed from the earth ” (Rev. 14:3) In the Biblical record the earliest sinning is mentioned in Job 38:7. There the Lamb, the Beloved One of God. and who bears the title of “The Morning Star”, employed song to the praise of Jehovah. Thus is fixed the rule that must govern those of Zion now. The sonn which the apostle John heard sounds new, and therefore it would indicate that Jehovah’s servant class would have a change in their witness work from that of Elijah to that foreshadowed by Elisha, the latter being a service attended with no fear but with great joy. It is the love of God that prompts them to sendee, and the love such as Chi 1st has is that which constrains them and holds them together. These, possessed of such love, fear not the eneim or his organization, but boldly sing forth the praises of the great Eternal One.—1 John 4:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The remnant of Jehovah's anointed witnesses now on earth are enabled by God's grace to see and appreciate the fact that Jehovah's Elect Sen-ant is Christ Jesus and the faithful members of his body, and that these God has selected and installed as his sweet singers in the temple, to perform other purposes to which he assigns them. (Isa. 42:1; (Matt. 12:15-18) To these arc committed the interests of God's kingdom, and the obligation is laid upon them to make known God's purposes to the rulers and to the peoples of the earth. Since the building up of Zion, or from and after 1918, Jehovah has appeared m his aloiy, and by his lightnings has revealed himself and his organization and his purposes to Ins people as never before He has made clear to his people many prophecies that have been fulfilled, and now he gives them a gleam of other things that arc shortly to be fulfilled The time has come for them to sing, and they do “sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth”.—Isa. 42:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the human birth of Jesus nineteen hundred years ago the angelic hosts sang to the praise of Jehovah God, whose Son they announced as the Savior of the woild Now the King in glory stands upon Mount Zion with all power and authority to rule and bless, and all of God's organization join in the new song. The angels in heaven and the remnant on earth sing before the throne the praises of the Most High.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LONDON ASSEMBLY (BY AN OBSERVER)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Londoners are a peculiar people and love their London in spite of its mean dwellings and its grubby ugliness. So with the news of the Assembly, many a London pioneer serving his ‘zone’ in some far-away spot cast longing eyes toward the Metropolis. London is getting famous for its assemblies, and this one was to be held at the London Palladium at Oxford Circus, probably the most famous music hall in the world. Tickets of admission were printed and were sparingly handed out to the London units and those in the immediate vicinity. The Palladium, large as it is, will seat only 2,500, and the Lord’s ‘other sheep’ are fast coming in. Persons of good-will and model-study people were eagerly visited and invited to attend this assembly. Coaches and buses are no longer available for private hire as on previous occasions, due to further petrol restrictions; but, no matter, as The Palladium is right in the center of the West End of London, served by a network of underground railways, everyone attending had excellent traveling facilities regardless of from which point of the compass they came.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The title of the Assembly was </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">‘Integrity’,</span><span class="font5"> as it was held on the opening day of the great world-wide ‘Integrity’ Testimony Period (February). Came the day, and with it four inches of overnight snow and still snowing hard without the possibility of a break. Well, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">integrity</span><span class="font5"> test is on No need to worry about not filling the theater. Snow won't stop those who are determined. And it didn't! The assembly was due to start at 2: 30. By one o’clock there was a queue waiting in the snow outside, over 100 yards long. At 1:30 p.m. the doors opened and the eager publishers were ushered into a wonderfully comfortable and heated auditorium. The Theocratic orchesLa, a remnant of the pride of the Leicester Assembly last September, but nevertheless highly efficient, regaled us with light music while settling ourselves comfortably in the seats. Then the loved voice of Judge Rutherford was heard reproducing those fatherly and so human words he had to say to 15.000 ‘children of the King’ assembled at St. Louis, Mo. Memories—a flickering sadness just for a moment, followed by a confident j’oyousness with the realization that Brother Rutherford was more with us today than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The opening song 'Come, Ye That Love the Lord’, and then the </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower’s</span><span class="font5"> representative, Mr. Gill, from ‘Down Under’. We had all heard of his arrival in this country from New Zealand and were eager to hear what he had to tell about our Father's business in those far-away parts, particularly as the work had there been banned. How thrilled we were to hear of how our brethren in the name of the Lord challenged the ruling powers, ‘Do you allow Christians to assemble together for song, prayer and Scripture study? Answer Yes or No.” We have a feeling that this forthright dealing and ‘Answer Yes or No’ will be heard nearer to home in the near future. What a thrill it is to hear of Jehovah’s watchful care over his people and how so surely the Lord ‘has the enemy in derision’. The news that the Japanese had only been allowed to overrun those lands of the Pacific after the Lord’s witness work had been completed was received with a great ovation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Next Jesse Hemery, who has seen the Lord’s work in</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">London progress over 54 years, gave us 'timely counsel. First a few words about the newspaper reports regarding the death of Judge Rutherford. A fearless declaration to the world that its revilings will be recompensed by the Lord in due time, and once again the declaration of the Lord’s purpose to have his ‘strange work’ brought to a conclusion only in his due time. A reminder of the words ‘Millions Now Living Will Never Die’, and that the Lord’s people have not lost their faith in that great promise. Not a slogan, but a fact! Brother Hemery also announced the election of Nathan H. Knorr as the Society’s new president. Then counsel on Psalms 23 and 27: ‘The Lord’s people shall not want.’ That we know, whether in spiritual food, presidency or otherwise, the Lord will provide. We hax e not yet entered the ‘valley of the shadow<sup>1</sup>, but the Lord will be with his people during the dark days ahead, and the Good Shepherd will care for his Father’s sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The London Branch servant, A. D Schroeder, then followed with some poignant remarks addressed to the people of good-will now<sup>T</sup> associating themselves with the Theocratic organization. Our individual responsibility before the Lord was put quite clearly, and the steps outlined which must be undertaken by every seeker of righteousnes-, before one becomes a trusted servant of the Lord An invitation was given to persons of good-will to now take a stand and prove their integrity along with Jehovah s witnesses. Just before closing a resolution was passed to send a cable of greetings to Brother Knorr, our new president. The cable dispatched read as follows: ‘Greetings and hearty co-operation sent you as president from 2,500 London Assembly Sunday.’ Surely our heavenly Father will richly bless Brother Knorr in his new appointment. And so ended another memorable day of happy assembly as a body of the Lord’s people. Too soon the minutes fled by . . Now every minute, thought and action must be harnessed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Theocracy.</span><span class="font5"> Only in this way can we keep the demons at bay and maintain our integrity, by diligently keeping God’s commandments and serving God, and not man, and thus remaining ‘blameless in the day of our Lord’.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A TEST OF INTEGRITY (CALIFORNIA)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“On Saturday, February 14, as one magazine publisher took her place on the street in Mount Shasta, two Legionnaires in full regalia took their stand on either side of the witness. Shortly thereafter a fellow passing by on the other side of the street hollered over at the Legionnaires, ‘Where's your magazines, boys? Better get out your magazines there!’ Another passer-by further embarrassed them by observing, ‘Nice-looking girl you got there, boys’’ The ‘boys’ stuck it out for about an hour, and immediately after they left the good-will people began to manifest themselves. One who made it plain that he had observed the whole incident came up and said, ‘Well, you’ve been standing on the street here a long time, little lady. I’m going to take one of those magazines [handing the witness a dollar], and just keep the change.’ [It was used to further advance the Kingdom work.] . . . This afternoon a carload of about eight high-school students stopped by and got a magazine to investigate for themselves One of them opened the magazine and began reading it to the others as they drove away. It seems the younger generation are thinking for themselves.’<sup>-</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus Is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege It is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord's next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>SONG-CALL TO ACTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Jehovah, even Jehovah, is my strength and song.”—Isa. 12:2, Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH is the most glorious theme of all songs. He is deserving to be praised in joyful, grateful song by all his intelligent creation that lives. All creatures in his likeness he endowed with the power and ability to sing his praises as the heart expression of their adoration and devotion to him as the perfect sum of all righteousness and goodness. When he laid the foundation of the earth his two princely spirit creatures designated as “the morning stars” poured out their exultation in song of praise to the great Creator, and all the spirit sons of God approved and shouted out of sheer joy. At the human birth of Jehovah’s Son, whose birth was a step toward the future creation of new heavens and a new earth, the host of angelic sons of God appeared to the shepherds and let them hear their harmonious voices praising Jehovah and saying in unison: “Glory in the highest unto God! and on earth peace, among men of goodwill.” (Job 38: 4-7; Luke 2:13,14, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font4"> After his warlike victory over ancient Egypt at the Red sea, Jehovah’s prophet Moses led His delivered people in the song: “I will sing unto Jehovah, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. Jehovah is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: this is my God, and I will praise him; my father’s God, and I will exalt him. Jehovah is a man of war: Jehovah is his name.” (Ex. 15:1-3, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.) </span><span class="font4">That song celebrated the war in vindication of Jehovah’s name and word and all-power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> Since A.D. 1914 is the day of battle and war, beginning with the first “war in heaven” and culminating shortly in the universal war that involves heaven and earth and commonly called “the battle of Armageddon”. Everlasting peace to the universe can never come until that battle has been fought, and Jehovah of hosts again triumphs gloriously as he did at the Red sea. The words of the song of praise to Jehovah that shall then be sung by those who witness his victory and live have probably not been written as yet. But those having faith in his sure victory may sing now. In fact, Jehovah, the great Composer of song and praise, long ago inspired songs to be written and to be reserved for this very day of battle and war, and which songs must be sung by his singers now, before the final battle for universal domination. The basic theme of all these songs is the same, namely, the vindication of Jehovah’s name by his Warrior nation, The Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus, and the vindication of his indisputable right to the domination of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> The present-time “jazz-song” world does not enjoy and join in such songs, but tries to drown out the message thereof with its deafening blare of propaganda. It tries to silence the singers and to prevent any “men of good-will” from catching up and learning the songs of vindication and of life in a new world sustained by Jehovah’s Theocracy. All the religionists complain at the singing and bring down the wrath and power of the governments of this world upon the singers by calling the songs “seditious” and “subversive” and “disturbing to religious peace and the unity of religion and politics”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* Under the circumstances, with the whole world ranged up against The Theocracy and despising the name of Jehovah, it requires great courage to sing the songs as the Composer thereof commands. What cares the enemy that the mourning people who are being regimented into a totalitarian new order are comforted and filled with hope by hearing the songs! The enemy only gets madder and feels tormented to desperation and gathers his political, judicial, commercial, military and religious forces together against the little band of singers and steadily eloses in upon them to finally strangle them to keep quiet. Shall the enemy fully stifle the songs of victory in praise of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government? Regardless of the determined effort made to that end, the thing of immediate concern now is that the divine Composer commands his trained ones to sing on and to march ahead, faces to the foe, and singing as they march.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ The songs were prepared for this day of battle and war, and they must be sung by God’s devoted servants; else he would make the very stones to sing out, that the prophecy of his Word might be vindicated. Not with carnal weapons, nor depending upon Charging horses, nor trusting in the sturdy, seasoned legs drilled by totalitarian masters, do Jehovah’s servants tramp forward in offensive action against the enemies of The Theocracy, but solely clad in heavenly “armour of God” and singing the songs He has put in their mouths. (Eph. 6:11-18) The correctness of this manner of march was foreshadowed in the time of crisis during the days of Jehovah’s typical Theocracy, the capital of which was the holy city of Jerusalem. At that capital city the great Theocrat’s anointed king, Jehoshaphat, sat upon the throne of Jehovah, w’hich throne King David had once occupied. (1 Chron. 29: 23) The political, commercial and religious elements of the anti-Theocratic world, namely, the nations of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, had conspired and federated against Jehovah and his anointed king, and they stormed to the attack upon the city. Jehoshaphat’s name means “Jehovah-vindicated”. Warned of the coming attack, King Jehoshaphat assembled all the nation of Judeans to Jerusalem. He gathered them to Jehovah’s temple on Mount Zion and there prayed for divine help and deliverance, that the Theocracy might be preserved and Jehovah’s name might be vindicated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">1»5</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Then came Jehovah’s instructions by the lips of one of his trained temple singers, a Levite of the musical family of Asaph. The command was, not to hole up and take a stationary defense position, but to march to the offense, undismayed and fearless of the combined enemy of superior numbers and military equipment. The battle was to be Jehovah's, and likewise the victory. In order that the faith and integrity of his covenant people might be tested and demonstrated, Jehovah did not order horse-mounted warriors or horse-drawn chariots or hardened shocktroops strong of leg to take the lead in the aggressive action. Under heavenly guidance Jehovah’s anointed king put the chief emphasis upon declaring God’s name throughout the earth before Jehovah showed his power over the enemy and vindicated his name. “And when he had taken counsel with the people </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[(Hebrew)</span><span class="font4"> And when he had given counsel unto the people], he appointed them that should sing unto Jehovah, and give praise in holy array, as they went out before the army, and say, Give thanks unto Jehovah ; for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.”— 2 Chron. 20: 21, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. R. V.; Roth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>T</sup> That was contrary to proved and tested military strategy of the world, but it is Jehovah’s way for his Theocratic people, who are not of this world but are in a covenant with him. It is the way of heavenly wisdom. Jerusalem’s gates swung open early in the morning, and with the temple Levite singers courageously to the fore Jehovah’s covenant people marched forth, men, women and children, to witness Jehovah’s “strange act”. All the marchers took up the song. Afar off the battle began. The invisible hosts of Jehovah God must have enjoyed fighting against God’s enemies to the accompaniment of sacred song extolling the name of Jehovah, which name those enemies had reproached. “And when they began to sing and to praise, Jehovah set liers-in-wait against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, that were come against Judah; and they were smitten. For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another. And when Judah came to the watch-tower of the wilderness, they looked upon the multitude; and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and there were none that escaped.” (2 Chron. 20:22-24, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. R. V.)</span><span class="font4"> That strange deliverance of Jehovah’s covenant people happened as a type or prophetic pattern. The account thereof was preserved in the Bible record for the guidance and comfort of Jehovah’s covenant people living here in the end of the world. So it is authoritatively stated at 1 Corinthians 10:11 (marginal reading).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PROPHETIC SONGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ Among the divinely inspired songs that must be sung while the rival world powers grapple together in the total war for world domination is Psalm 147 found in the Bible’s Book of Psalms. In the ancient days before the invention of printing, and when the handwritten copies of the sacred writings were few and possessed mainly by Jehovah’s servants at the temple, these psalms were actually sung at His holy temple on Mount Zion by the Levites assigned to that duty there. Jehovah’s people of Israel, whose covenant with him obligated them to regularly attend the feasts of the Lord at his temple, heard the psalms sung and joined in responses of “Amen” thereto. They thereby became familiar with the psalms of Jehovah as well as other portions of God’s written Word which were read to them at the temple. Those psalms were not mere loose expressions of feeling such as distinguish this so-called “jazz age”, nor were they a mere throwing together of a lot of thoughts at random just to make a rhyme. The Psalms were based upou historical facts which were typical. Therefore those inspired songs were prophetic of things to come in connection with Jehovah’s Theocratic Government under Christ and with its marvelous work of vindicating his name and clearing out all objectors to Jehovah’s universal domination. Jehovah’s anointed King of that Theocracy himself speaks of the prophetic value and purpose of the Psalms. When the experiences of religious persecution, and death on the tree and resurrection from the dead had been fulfilled in him, Christ Jesus met with his faithful disciples and said unto them: “These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.” (Luke 24 : 44) That the disciples thereafter understood all the Psalms to be prophetic is proved in the record at Acts 1:20; 4: 25-28; 13: 32, 33; Hebrews 1: 8-13; 10: 5-13. When studied as a prophecy concerning The Theocracy and its establishment in power, and when compared with the well-known events since A.D. 1914, Psalm 147 fills us with awe, wonder and delight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HALLELUJAH!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>9</sup> Christ Jesus is the One anointed of Jehovah’s spirit of power to serve as his King of The Theocracy. Jehovah also seats with Christ Jesus in the throne of that Theocratic kingdom the obedient ones from among men who enter into a covenant as did their Leader and Head Christ Jesus to do God’s will and who thereafter follow in his footsteps and do God’s will, and not the world’s will, faithfully unto the death. Such ones, being begotten of God’s spirit as his sons and then anointed as his witnesses and assigned to a place in the ‘■'body of Christ”, are taken into the covenant with Christ Jesus for the Kingdom or Theocracy. These must die in faith and faithful that they may receive the crown of life immortal in the spirit with Christ the King. These must overcome the world as he did that he may grant them to sit with him in his heavenly throne as he also overcame and sat down with his Father Jehovah in His throne. If they suffer for being witnesses to The Theocratic Government, they shall reign with him therein. It is to these members of the “body of Christ” that Psalm 147 is addressed, particularly to the remnant of those members who are yet on earth to publish God’s name and Theocracy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> “Praise ye Jehovah; for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant, and praise is comely.” (Ps. 147:1, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> Note the expression with which this Psalm opens. In the original Hebrew it is “Hallelu Jah”, the name “Jah” being the shortened form for “Jehovah”. Therefore this is one of the eighteen “Hallelujah” Psalms, so called, which open with this rousing exhortation. It is no mere “jazz song” expression or wild “religious revival” camp-meeting outburst, but is an inspired call to action in praising Jehovah to one another and to all the nations, particularly the teachable ones thereof. The anointed remnant here addressed are by their anointing with God’s spirit of power commissioned to be his witnesses, witnesses to his honor and praise and not to his reproach. By their consecration of themselves to do God’s will, even when that will conflicts with dictatorial men, and also because they are taken by Jehovah into the covenant to serve him, they become the servants or ministers of God. By reason, further, of their anointing from him to preach His gospel or good news of the Kingdom they become Jehovah God’s ordained ministers of the gospel. From the binding obligation and responsibility to act as his ordained ministers there can never be any withdrawal, nor may they ever feel that after a period of work and because of advancing years they have done their share in God’s service and they may retire to ease and inactivity and enjoy a pension. Paul the apostle speaks of himself as “Paul the aged”. When so speaking he was not retired on a pension to let others do the work, but was a prisoner in chains at Rome for having kept on preaching and witnessing from house to house in obedience to his divine commission.—Philem. 9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> To quit preaching and being a witness, because of persecution or for any other selfish reason, this side of Armageddon’s fight means to be unfaithful to one’s ordination or commission and is a breaking of one’s covenant to do God’s will. By so doing one does not fulfill that term of the commission, “Praise ye Jehovah,” but brings reproach upon his name and denies him. Death is the penalty.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> The “praises unto our God” are written in His Word. They are beneficial, and point the hearers or readers to the only Source of life and blessing and of a righteous and perfect government. Those praises strengthen the faith, and lead one to a trust in Him who alone can give protection and deliverance. Those praises reveal the One who is the Supreme Power and who is to be obeyed and worshiped. Those praises to Him bar the giving of praise to creatures or demons or men and the fearing and heiling and worshiping of such creatures, which course leads to destruction. Hence it is of the highest good to sing praises to Jehovah God in fulfillment of one’s obligations as his ordained minister. Nothing could be more vital to the people in this time of “distress of nations with perplexity”, when the world is faced with utter destruction. The faithful servants of Jehovah will be on the alert against being entrapped into any other view of the matter. They will refuse to break their covenant vows and to yield to the world’s pressure to make them cease from praising Him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> It is Jehovah God, by his King of The Theocracy, who commands his ordained ministers, “Praise ye Jehovah.” The anointed remnant, who are espoused to Christ Jesus to be of his heavenly bride, obey. They praise Jehovah publicly by spreading his message abroad and thus letting others hear who have a hearing ear. The teachable ones who love righteousness and that which is for their highest good do hear. They show good-will toward Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government. In proof of their good-will and devotion they too consecrate themselves to Jehovah God by faith in Christ Jesus. Thus they also become God’s ministers or servants, with hope of everlasting life on earth under the Kingdom. What must they do now? That which is “good”, namely, praise Jehovah, just as the remnant of Christ’s bride do. The same terms of the commission or ordination apply to them as to the remnant. Hence it is written: “And the Spirit [Christ Jesus] and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come: and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” (Rev. 22:17) All of such who discern and appreciate their commission from Jehovah God through Christ and who seriously apply themselves to being Jehovah’s witness as their God-ordained life-work find it is a delightful work of ministry. All the reproaches and persecutions and hardships at the hands of the religionists cannot take away from the real pleasantness of praising Jehovah and his desirable Government to those who hunger and thirst after righteousness. They experience personally how comely it is to praise the Most High God and his King of The Theocracy rather than to make a name for oneself or to praise creatures and organizations of this world.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE THEOCRACY HERE!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> “Jehovah doth build up Jerusalem; he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.” (Ps. 147: 2, A. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font4"> I<sup>7</sup>.) This indicates that this Psalm was written after the seventy years of desolation of the typical city of Jerusalem and after the faithful remnant were released from captivity to Babylon. They returned to the site of the holy city and rebuilt the temple and also the city and its walls and hung the city gates thereon. That Jerusalem was the “city of the great King”, said Jesus. (Matt. 5: 35) This marks the time of the grand fulfillment of this “Hallelujah” Psalm as after A.D. 1914. That year the seven “times of the Gentiles”, which began with Babylon’s overthrow of Jerusalem in 606 B.C., ran out, and there the “time of the end” for the Gentile powers in control of the earth began. At the beginning of those seven Gentile times the typical Theocracy at Jerusalem was overthrown and taken away. At the end of those Gentile times, in 1914, the real Theocracy began, when the great King of Eternity, Jehovah God, bade his anointed Son at his right hand to start the exercise of his power as King of The Theocracy. That Theocracy is Jehovah’s capital organization, where he makes his official residence. It is therefore the “city of the great King”, typified by Jerusalem of old.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus is the “new heavens” and is “the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband”. (Rev. 21:1, 2, 9,10) Satan’s organization, which is called “Babylon”, had its headquarters in heaven till 1914. The New Jerusalem, then built up, immediately began war upon the enemies in heaven, and Satan and his demons fought back against the new Government, The Theocracy, but prevailed not and were thrust down to the vicinity of the earth, whipped. What a fall for Babylon! and what a cause for praise to Jehovah! As it is written: “And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: for true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. And again they said, Alleluia.”—Rev. 19:1-3; 12:1-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The Theocracy is Jehovah’s capital organization over the entire universe. All creatures that would enjoy everlasting life and peace must take their stand on the side of that Theocratic capital and be gathered unto it. To prevent this the Devil stirred up the anger of the nations against the new Government in the very year of its birth, A.D. 1914, and the World War broke out. It was the Devil’s scheme to militarize the world and use that condition to scatter Jehovah’s organized servants, the spiritual Israelites, and to prevent all announcement of the building up of Jehovah’s capital organization and thereby prevent the gathering of any creatures on earth unto or under that divine government. Jehovah’s servants of spiritual Israel were hated of all nations at war and were cast out from their organized condition of serving Him and the interests of his kingdom. Their hearts were broken at the disorganizing of the work by the religious and political agents of Great Babylon and at all the reproaches that were heaped on God’s name. They suffered great hurt and wounds by violent mistreatment, by betrayals of false brethren and by the cruel misrepresentations published about them by the modern-day Babylonians, particularly those of so-called “Christendom”; which things were intended to damage them beyond all future recovery in the eyes of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>,T</sup> Then for His name’s sake, and for the sake of his elect ones of his “holy nation”, Jehovah suddenly-sent his King and Messenger to the temple, in 1918, and stopped the World War shortly thereafter that same year. (Matt. 24:7-13,21,22) With Jehovah’s mighty Messenger, Christ Jesus, at the temple as Kang of the new world, who now in heaven or in earth could possibly hinder Jehovah’s message of the Kingdom, or Theocracy, from going to all nations of the habitable earth in fulfillment of the prophecy at Matthew 24:14? No one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Because of throwing the great Babylon down from its heavenly seat the King Christ Jesus was like Cyrus the king of Persia, who released the remnant of Israel from Babylon and sent them back to Jerusalem to engage in the temple work. (Isa. 45:1,13) Immediately after the halt of the World War Jehovah began gathering the faithful remnant of the “outcasts of [spiritual] Israel” to His Theocratic King at the temple. “He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.” (Ps. 147: 3) This Jehovah did in freeing them from Babylon’s restraint, particularly from the religious fear of creatures and of what they might do to a servant of the Lord for faithfully witnessing for Him. Jehovah revealed to them that he had a further work for them and that his King is at the temple and the time for everlasting rejoicing has come because it is the day for the vindication of Jehovah’s name before all creation. Then Jehovah by his King poured out his spirit upon the faithful remnant yet in the flesh. He sent them out as his official witnesses to all the nations. He brought them into his Theocratic organization, and willingly they submitted themselves to Jehovah and his King as “The Higher Powers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” “He counteth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.” (Ps. 147 : 4, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. R.</span><span class="font4"> I<sup>7</sup>.) This shows the time as being the night of Satan’s world, the period when “the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people”. (Isa. 60:1, 2) In the dark period is when Jehovah’s stellar bodies rise and shine and declare God’s glory to God-fearing persons on earth. Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s Chief Star, “the bright and morning star,” the foretold “Star out of Jacob”. (Rev. 22:16; Num. 24:17) The remnant of his body members must likewise shine, reflecting his light of the Kingdom, and they do so in obedience to God’s command, and turn many to God’s righteous Government. “And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness, as the stars for ever and ever.” (Dan.12:3) God counts thenumber of these stars who shine with Christ Jesus in the firmament of the new heavens, and he numbers them as 144,000. No more faithful ones than this shall be exalted to heavenly glory.—Rev. 7:4-8; 14:1,3; Luke 12: 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>M</sup> The names which the persecutors under demon influence call these of the ‘star’ class to condemn and misrepresent them do not matter; only the name which the Creator Jehovah calls them matters. He promised that the time would come when he would call these symbolic “stars” by a new name which his own mouth would name. That name was hidden away in his holy Word. Christ Jesus first officially receives that new name, but he also promised to share it with all the members of his “body”, including the “feet of him”, or the remnant yet on earth after his coming to the temple. To the overcoming remnant he gives a pledge of the new name, like a “white stone, and in the stone a new name written”, and he further says: “I will write upon him the name of my God [Jehovah], and the name of the city of my God [to identify them as citizens of that capital organization], which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will w’rite upon him mv new name.”—Isa. 62: 2; Rev. 2:17; 3:12; Isa. 43:10,12; 44:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> In 1931, after a “work-day” of twelve years of faithful activity in the vineyard of God’s service, the remnant were rewarded with the revelation of their new name, namely, “Jehovah’s witnesses.” Thereafter they joined in the great “Hallelujah” chorus with Christ Jesus, “The Faithful and True Witness,” as never in the years previous. Increasing numbers of persons of good-will heard the joyful sound and took their stand for Jehovah and his Chief Witness and they joined in and swelled the “Hallelujah” song, blending their voices in perfect unity with the remnant of spiritual Israel. These become the Lord’s “other sheep”. They know from God’s Word that the chief work and calling of the remnant is to give a witness to Jehovah in vindication of His name, and that this “one thing” the remnant must do. There are not two things, including a different commission for the “other sheep”. Hence nothing these dear “sheep” could do could take pre-eminence over what is the ordained chief work of the remnant, and therefore the “other sheep” must be the active companions of the remnant in doing the “one thing” of bearing witness to the truth concerning Jehovah and his Kingdom. Thus these “other sheep” become witnesses for Him, on the same wise that the faithful men before Christ’s death, from John the Baptist all the way back to Abel, were the never-quitting witnesses for Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SUPREME POWER</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” “Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite”; or, “of his understanding there is no number.” (Ps. 147 :5; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">•margin)</span><span class="font4"> The number of things which He understands perfectly is as infinite as his universal creation, because he created all good things for his intelligent purposes. He is therefore the Lord and Master, the Supreme One. In contradiction of the Devil, who ordains himself to seek universal domination and who also ordains the political-religious organization on earth to seek “world domination”, the Lord God Jehovah has ordained himself and his Theocratic King, Christ Jesus, to be “The Higher Powers”. (Rom. 13:1-4) Jehovah’s ordination of power alone shall stand the supreme test. He says: “I am Jehovah, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise unto graven images.” (Isa. 42:8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. R. V.)</span><span class="font4"> His King warns all the covenant people of God to be subject to the Supreme One of the Higher Powers, saying: “For Jehovah your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the terrible, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward.” (Deut. 10:17, A. R. 7.) His covenant people, therefore, place first importance upon Jehovah’s commands and obey him rather than worldly men. They hail Him as “great”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” In obeying Jehovah’s commandment to be his constant witnesses they are “strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might”. (Acts 5:29; Eph. 6:10) Though oftentimes they do not understand the meaning of all the difficulties they meet up with in his service, yet they trust him without question. They are persuaded that his infinite understanding grasps every detail of his “strange work” in which they are having a part. He understands every part of his organization of his witnesses on earth, understands all their perplexities, understands all their trials and sufferings at enemy hands, and knows how to handle them wisely and competently for his name’s sake and its vindication. There is nothing that the enemy attempt or do that He does not understand, even before their wicked plans are completed. As his courageous servants push ahead against nasty interferences concertedly springing up in all quarters, and as they carefully and anxiously look to what can be done to keep on going, Jehovah God has never failed to guide them and to outmaneuver their enemies with His perfect understanding and attention to the bewildering mix-up of details. His work must go through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> Jehovah sets the meek in contrast with the wicked. “Jehovah upholdeth the meek: he bringeth the wicked down to the ground.” (Ps. 147: 6, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. R.</span><span class="font4"> 7.) The wicked proceed upon the theory that God helps those who help themselves, and they set out to grab at world domination and at religious monopoly and other things unauthorized by Jehovah and in willful opposition to his Theocracy in the face of warning by his meek ones. They therefore ignore the stop signals. They violently trample over the meek to attain their goal, in complete disregard of the righteous laws of the land and the rights and liberties of the meek or teachable ones who look to God and Christ Jesus as their Teachers and who do what they are taught from God’s Word. By self-assumptions and by the help of religion the wicked exalt themselves to positions of power and authority in defiance of Jehovah and his anointed King, even to declaring it illegal to bear the “new name&quot; from God and to preach Jehovah’s Theocracy. But under this crushing world-pressure Jehovah’s everlasting arms hold up his meek and obedient servants, and these trample under foot the opposition of the wicked and carry on as His ordained ministers of the gospel. Christ Jesus, who is the Meekest of God’s meek ones, already has cast Satan out of heaven and down to the ground and has him and his demon and human agents under his soles as his footstool. At Armageddon He will twist his heel upon them all as upon a viper. Jehovah’s servants will walk over the places where these wicked ones once were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">KEEP SINGING</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’’“Sing unto Jehovah with thanksgiving; sing praises upon the harp unto our God.” (Ps. 147:7, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. R.</span><span class="font4"> 7.) Religious leaders and their allies in public affairs work against the good of the people when they frame mischief by law to prevent the keeping of this commandment of the Most High God. “It is a good thing to give thanks unto Jehovah, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High; to show forth thy lovingkindness in the morning [as by house-to-house calls with the message], and thy faithfulness every night [as by back-calls on the interested meek persons], with an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery [sound equipment to accompany the message given by the lips]; with a solemn sound upon the harp. For thou, Jehovah, hast made me glad through thy work [in which I am privileged to have an active personal part] : I will triumph [over the combined enemy opposition] in the works of thy hands.”—Ps. 92:1-4, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. R. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Here “the harp” symbolizes God’s Word as written in the Bible. The singing or declaration of the message by the voices .of Jehovah’s servants must be in tune and harmony with this foundation-toned Word, The Holy Scriptures. In parts of the earth where the enemies of The Theocracy have officially and judicially declared Jehovah’s good work outlawed and taken away the literature explaining the Scriptures, and in other parts where the upset world conditions have made it impossible to get supplies of literature, there Jehovah’s covenant-keeping servants continue as true Christians to preach as the apostle Paul did (Acts 20:20), and using just the Bible itself, either carried with them or already in the homes of the people they visit. They must keep singing praise to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” ‘Wlio covereth the heavens with clouds, who pre-pareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.” (Ps. 147:8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. R.</span><span class="font4"> 7.) Those clouds denote Jehovah’s presence by his representative Messenger, Christ Jesus, just as His pillar of cloud by which he guided the children of Israel forty years through the wilderness symbolized Jehovah’s invisible presence with and his protection over his covenant people by His mighty messenger or angel whom he sent before the marching Israelites. His mightiest Angel or Messenger has come to the temple for judgment. He is present with blessings and protection for the faithful remnant who pass the judgment and for the loving “other sheep” who do good to the remnant and w<sup>T</sup>hom the King at the temple places on his right side of favor and mercy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The heavenly King of The Theocracy constitutes the “new heavens” in power since A.D. 1914, and the blessings of Jehovah God come down therefrom like refreshing rain upon his faithful servants in the earth, the remnant and their companions. These have had their eyes opened by God’s Word to see the anti-Theocratic, totalitarian “abomination of desolation” standing up in place of and as a substitute for God’s kingdom. Therefore they have fled from all parts inside and outside of “Christendom” and taken refuge at the “mountains”, the Great Rock Jehovah and the Foundation Rock Christ Jesus, The Higher Powers. (Matt. 24:15-18) There all those who seek meekness and righteousness grow and flourish like the grass, increasing to a multitude without number, and they shall not be cut down by Jehovah’s Executioner of the wicked in the “battle of that great day of God Almighty”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” All living creation is dependent upon Jehovah’s providence. “He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.” (Ps. 147 : 9) When Job was suffering greatly from an incurable affliction and being condemned and persecuted by pious religionists before all the public, Jehovah strengthened Job’s faith in God’s concern for him and unfailing provision for him by pointing to the divine care for the brute beasts away out in the wilderness. Then He asked Job: “Who provideth for the raven his prey, when his young ones cry unto God, and wander for lack of food!” (Job 38:41, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. R.</span><span class="font4"> 7.) Many who are free and unencumbered, like those wild beasts and birds, and who could devote their entire time to the direct service of The Theocracy in the field, fail or refuse to take advantage of that blessed opportunity. Their excuse is the fear that they will not be taken care of by the Lord while so engaged as pioneers in daily and continuously praising him in obedience to His wise command. As answer to such an excuse the psalmist, and also the man without where to lay his head, Christ Jesus, pointed to the beasts and birds. If God sees to it that the helpless little ravens in the nest, which birds God’s own law classifies as unclean, are fed, will he not also faithfully provide lodging, food and raiment for one in a covenant with Him and who with lips clean of fear of man obediently carries out God’s commandments and glorifies him! The raven was the first creature to go forth from the ark and to stay out and trust to Jehovah God to provide for it in the earth cleansed by the Flood. (Gen. 8:6,7) “Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls!” (Luke 12: 24) Ask the hard-working pioneers; they will tell you. Neither does Jehovah fail to provide the spiritual food from his table to his servants who maintain their integrity right in the lair of the terrible totalitarian “beast”. By ways as strange as by the ravens which fed Elijah, Jehovah gets his spiritual food through to those who are determined to keep their integrity toward him and his Government even if threatened to starve physically for it as punishment.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>80</sup> The totalitarian powers put their trust in speedy vehicles of destruction and glorify the toughened limbs of their tramping hordes that goose-step to the attack on democratic principles and liberties, and on the free and open service of Jehovah God. While this crushing of God-given rights and God-ordained service goes on, the cardinals and other members of the Hierarchy bestow their blessings and pray to God to show his pleasure and grant military victory to these totalitarian aggressors. Will their being clergymen with skirts and crucifixes and split hats induce Almighty God to change his position on the matter and answer their prayers and high-low masses? The Provider for the weak, innocent young ravens answers: “He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh no pleasure in the legs of a man. Jehovah taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his lovingkindness.”—Ps. 147 :10,11, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. R. V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>81</sup> Said Jesus when a man on earth: “Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” (Matt. 10: 28) In such fear of God Jesus prayed in the garden of Gethsemane while the traitor Judas led “a great multitude, with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people”, to arrest him and drag him to his death. (Matt. 26: 3G-48) Jesus feared to displease Jehovah, his heavenly Father, and he taught and himself illustrated obedience to God rather than to men. Hence to him there came the Father’s voice from heaven: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.” (Matt. 17 : 5) His faithful remnant and his “other sheep” will therefore wisely do what he tells them to do; “because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” (1 Pet. 2:21) Following his example is the way to have the divine pleasure taken in one, and hence to receive the loving-kindness of God. The Lord God may permit his faithful and true witnesses to suffer long and keenly as in the case of Job. If, however, they refuse to be frightened off from his service by the “strength of the horse” and the “legs of a man”, be they even the two iron ‘flegs” of that terrible image described by Daniel (chapter two), God will in his well-ordered time show them his mercy as he did to Job for keeping his integrity. &quot;Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.” (Jas. 5:11) Jehovah never disappoints the hope of those who sound forth His praises and leave the fighting and deliverance to him at Armageddon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ORGANIZED PRAISE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” “Glorify, O Jerusalem, the Lord: praise thy God, 0 Zion.” (Ps. 147:12, Leeser’s translation) Here, both “Jerusalem” and “Zion” picture the capital organization of Jehovah, The Theocracy under Christ the King. Concerning him Jehovah says to all the rulers of this world who have set themselves against Jehovah and his Anointed: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Ps. 2:1-6) Who shall stand with Jehovah’s King on that “hill” or Government which is devoted to righteousness T The Revelation (14:1,3) answers: “And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads. And they sung as it were a new song before the throne [of Jehovah God], and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” The remnant on earth are gathered into unity with the Lamb of God at Mount Zion. The “other sheep”, who also follow that Lamb, take refuge under that capital organization in submission to The Higher Powers. They are like the non-Israelite Nethinim who returned with the remnant from Babylon to Jerusalem and took up service of assistance to God’s ministers at the temple on Mount Zion. (Ezra 2:43,58,70; 7:7; 8:17,20; Neh. 7:73; 10:28,29) The command to “glorify” and “praise” Jehovah God is addressed to “Jerusalem” and “Zion”, that is, to the entire organization as one. This, therefore, is a call to action to the faithful remnant together with their zealous earthly companions, the Lord’s “other sheep”, to serve the Lord God in an organized manner, that is, as one united organization dedicated to the praise and glorifying of the Great Theocrat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’* Why should these unite to “glorify Jehovah” and “praise thy God”, and be courageous and fearless about doing so! The good and undeniable reason is: “For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee. He maketh peace in thy borders; he filleth thee with the finest of the wheat [or, the fat of wheat </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(margin)].”</span><span class="font4"> (Ps. 147:13,14, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. R.</span><span class="font4"> F.) This is cause for the whole Theocratic organization in heaven and earth to rejoice, both the children of Zion who were sleeping in death and who were raised to life in the spirit at the Lord’s coming to the temple in 1918, and also the “remnant of her seed” who are yet alive and remain on the earth; and both parts do rejoice together. And the invisible part with Christ Jesus on Mount Zion join with him in assisting the visible part or remnant in glorifying Jehovah and praising the only true and living God, in whose name they walk from henceforth, even for evermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” No battering ram of the enemy organization can crash in those barred gates of Zion and Jerusalem. That Theocracy is the strongest organization in the universe. Hence </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">there</span><span class="font4"> only is the place of salvation for the remnant of Zion’s children. The Nethinim or “other sheep” must flee to it and take refuge under it before the battle of Armageddon begins for. the execution of all those who have not lined up on the side of Zion. Those that persecute the remnant and their companions because they take their stand for Zion and Jerusalem only cause themselves unnecessary troubles and hang a weighty stone about their necks: “Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah, and against Jerusalem. And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.” (Zech. 12: 2, 3) Let such remember what happened in one night to King Sennacherib’s 185,000 Assyrians that besieged Jerusalem.—Isa. 37: 33-38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’• Amid all their persecutions for bearing and praising the name of Jehovah God, Zion’s “remnant of her seed” and their earthly companions are blessed above all other creatures on earth. (Matt. 5:10-12) There is no peace and unity in the world, in any worldly nation; for Satan’s house is divided against itself in the contest for world domination. But among those who are separate from the world and in covenant relationship with Jehovah and serving him according to his Theocratic rule there is peace. They pray for this peace to continue among them. (Ps. 122: 6-9) In peace they do the Lord’s work together. Their fighting is only against the demons. (Eph. 6:12) They mark all who cause divisions and disturbances, and avoid them as not being of God’s Theocratic organization. (Rom. 16:17,18) Gathered about the Lord’s table in the presence of their enemies, they feed upon the fullness of the “fat of wheat”, that is, the choicest life-sustaining truths of God’s Word concerning his Theocratic Government under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“HIS STRANGE WORK”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” ‘Tie sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.&quot; (Ps. 147:15) Out from Zion goes forth God’s law to his remnant and their companions on earth, and likewise to them goes forth his word of doctrine from Jerusalem. (Mic. 4:2) His specific command to them is to declare his name throughout all the earth and to publish the Kingdom gospel to all nations. He provides them with the understanding of his Word to that end. This work of publication and of education of the people of good-will must be done before the final end of Satan’s war-riddled organization. The time is limited, very short now, because that disastrous end is so close. Therefore the work must be pressed daily with all one's heart, mind, soul and strength, because it must be done quickly. To the accomplishment of this Jehovah has provided his Theocratic arrangement for his organized people. During the past twenty years he has equipped them with his revealed Word in print in the form of books, booklets, magazines, tracts and leaflets, also with sound equipment on wheels and portable, such as phonograph, and with vehicles of transportation, and with radio transmitters and land wires for telephonic carriage of speeches, and with loudspeakers and public-address systems. By these means, and with a small band of lively, fearless Kingdom publishers permeated with the zeal for Jehovah, God's word has indeed run very swiftly and encircled the world since 1918. It continues to run. Hundreds of millions of pieces of literature have been distributed from house to house, in over eighty languages; 1941 was the greatest year, of the most tremendous distribution in a single year to date. Millions are reading. “Let them read.” Hundreds of millions have heard and other millions yet hear by means of radio and by portable and mobile sound equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> To religious “Christendom” it is a “strange work”, and she objects thereto. The demons now try to regiment the work off the earth and to regiment all the people against it and all the publishers out of it. God's Word will continue to run swiftly until the purpose for which he has sent it forth is accomplished. (Isa. 55: 10,11) What is that purpose? This: to publish God's name and Theocracy world-wide; to serve all, rulers and common people alike, with clear warning; and to point the meek persons of good-will to the way of escape to the mountains of safety, Zion and Jerusalem. There is no time to delay flight. The abomination that maketh desolate” has appeared. Says the King of The Theocracy to the refugees: &quot;But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day: for then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” (Matt. 24:20.21) The winter is the time of Jehovah’s “strange act” of the great fight of Armageddon, and it follows immediately after the swift running of Jehovah’s Word, “his strange work.” Concerning his “strange act” of the Armageddon “winter” Psalm</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">147 :16,17, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. R. V.,</span><span class="font4"> says: “He giveth snow like wool; he scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes. He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“HIS STRANGE ACT&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">'* Jehovah’s remnant of anointed witnesses and their companions are now’ undergoing experiences like those of Job. Out of the midst of the storm Jehovah spoke to Job of all His mighty works and asked Job: “Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow! or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war!” (Job 38: 22, 23) The Job class shall enter into an understanding of those secrets w’hen Jehovah performs his act of vindicating his name at Armageddon. There these phenomena shall operate to God’s praise: “Praise Jehovah from the earth, ye sea-monsters, and all deeps; fire and hail, snow and vapor; stormy wind, fulfilling his w’ord.”—Ps. 148: 7, 8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A. It. V.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> Then Jehovah will “be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may . . . bring to pass his act, his strange act”. (Isa. 28: 21) At Gibeon Jehovah fought for his covenant people Israel and pitched down from the skies huge hailstones upon the five anti-Theo-cratic kings and their combined armies: “they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.” And the very sun and moon appeared to stand still that day. Thereby also, besides vindicating his name, Jehovah delivered the people of good-w’ill w’ho were bottled up in Gibeon and threatened with death by the besieging enemies of God. (Josh. 10:9-14) The antitypical downpour of frozen destruction is yet due at Armageddon. Immediately after the Lord God sends his emphatic warning out of the north and troubles the totalitarian-world combine (Dan. 11:44), then the religionists of “Christendom” will say, as long foretold: “The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.” (Jer. 8:20) Then “his cold” will begin to set in, and they will seek refuge. There the biggest lie behind which the religious-political opposers of Jehovah’s Theocracy will hide for their protection is the “abomination of desolation”, which world organization they declare is the kingdom of God that they want and the real thing is not needed. Taking refuge in this organized lie will not avail at the time of the big fight. Warns Jehovah: “Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.”—Isa. 28: 17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>41</sup> In the winter months during the period of God’s “strange work” his witnesses have pressed on with the Kingdom message, thus losing no time. (Prov.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">31: 21) Also his King and the armies of heaven know how to fight in the cold of Armageddon’s battle as pictured in the exploit of King David’s fellow warrior: “And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.” (2 Sam. 23: 20) Describing God’s “strange work” and the winter action of destruction immediately following, Psalm 68:11,12,14 reads: “The Lord gave the word; great was the company of those that published it. Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil. When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in [Mount] Salmon.” The cold of God’s judgment without mercy comes out of the north. It will be executed at that tribulation of Armageddon against the wicked who have shown no mercy to Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers on earth. Of such opposers of his Theocracy and reproachers of His name, “who can stand before his cold?” Not one. (Job 37:6-10) Those foreseeing this evil to come shortly, should be wise, like the ant, and make provision now to come out of the cold into the warmth of God's refuge.— Prov. 6:6; 30:25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">*<sup>2</sup> Only those in and under God’s Theocratic organization during that battle shall weather the destructive cold of that terrible winter of Armageddon, and see the fair Kingdom weather that follows thereafter at Jehovah’s command. “He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind [invisible power] to blow, and the waters flow.” (Ps. 147:18) It will be as when the waters of the world deluge had finished their destruction of the ungodly who filled the earth with debauchery and violence: “God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth; and the waters asswaged.” (Gen. S: 1) Then Noah and his companions came forth into the cleansed earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">*’ So too after the winter of Armageddon the remnant and their companions will come forth from their protected place under God’s hiding and enter into the glorious season of the Kingdom in its undisputed power over earth. (Job 37: 22-24) Pointing to the events of our time since 1914 Jesus said: “Behold the fig tree, and all the trees; when they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand. So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. Verily I say unto you, This generation [including the remnant] shall not pass away till all be fulfilled.” (Luke 21:29-32) Then all that live on earth shall be cheered with the warmth of God’s mercy through his reigning King. Peace shall flow like a mighty river everlasting, and righteousness shall be multiplied on the earth like the waves of the sea, and His blessings shall drop like gentle rain. —Isa. 48:18; Ps. 72:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FAVOR AND RESPONSIBILITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“To whom is Jehovah God now showing these things of his Word, and to whom is he giving his ordinances and regulations to publish that word swiftly abroad 1 “He showeth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his ordinances unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation; and as for his ordinances, they have not known them. Praise ye Jehovah.” (Ps. 147:19,20, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.;</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font4"> The nations of “Christendom” are like Esau and have sold their claimed birthright for a mess of pottage for their bellies. Contrariwise, like Jacob, the remnant of spiritual Israel have received the approval of Jehovah and obtained the spiritual portion. For his faithfulness and integrity Jehovah gave Jacob the new name of “Israel”, meaning “wrestling with God”, that is, holding fast to Jehovah God and his Theocracy in the time of peril until one’s integrity is proved and the blessing obtained.—Gen. 32: 20-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ This showing of the glories of his Word and of what he requires of his covenant people, that is, his statutes, judgments, ordinances and regulations, places a tremendous responsibility upon those of Jehovah’s “holy nation” and their companions, who share their blessings and the accompanying responsibilities. This outstanding favor Jehovah bestows upon them for his name’s sake, which name must be declared throughout the earth before he shows his power over Satan and his organization in the showdown fight. There must be no slowdown; his word must yet run swiftly, for that is the statute and ordinance which his devoted people must obey. The nations of “Christendom” know not His word and Theocratic regulations, and will continue to oppose and persecute in proud, stubborn resistance till Armageddon’s winter freezes them into everlasting inaction. Well foreknowing this stiff opposition to His word and its swift bearers, and well aware of his exclusive mercies and favors to the remnant and their companions out of all nations, the Lord God commands as his closing word: “Hallelujah!” that is, “Praise ye Jehovah!” It is his urgent call to his favored ones to action. The faithful spring to the response.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">For Jehovah giveth wisdom; out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding: he layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; he </span><span class="font3">w a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">shield to them that walk</span><span class="font3"> «n </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">integrity; that he may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way of his</span><span class="font3"> satnts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">—Proverbs 2: 6-8, A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font4">HE issue is universal domination, or, more broadly stated, Who is supreme, and who shall rule the universe, Jehovah God or Satan! That issue will be decided in vindication of the name of Jehovah. Since this is to be accomplished by The Theocracy, or God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus, the Kingdom is the great doctrine of the Bible. There is the cost of self-denial to pay for any creature on earth to have a share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. (Matt. 16: 24) Those who have a desire to participate in the vindication of His name, whether as members of The Theocracy or as faithful subjects thereof, should study carefully the Theocratic Scriptures, that they may walk worthily before the Lord God. What the world calls “character development” could never alone bring to any creature Jehovah’s approval which means life to that creature. Those who serve Him and receive his approval therefor must do much more than merely lead a course of chastity and cleanliness. Their being chaste and clean is for a higher purpose than for mere respectability; it is for the purpose of being proper instruments in God’s service in behalf of the great issue. Those consecrated to God’s will must do more than merely exercise chastity and cleanliness. They must see to it that their every faculty, in the best of condition possible, is devoted to God and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No compromise can be approved; no neutrality, nor middle course. “What concord hath Christ with Belial! or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel! And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols! for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.”—2 Cor. 6:15-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This means that the members of the “body of Christ” and also his “other sheep” must be entirely separate from Satan’s organization and those who support that wicked organization, and must devote themselves unselfishly to God and his kingdom. Have any of the servants of Jehovah, then, a reason for saying they do not need to observe the rules of common decency! Could anyone for a moment conclude that by following a course of decency and chastity and cleanliness, such is the course of self-denial and meets all the requirements of those who gain everlasting life and serve for the vindication of God’s name! Certainly not!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Referring to God’s promises of receiving those who touch not the unclean thing as his children separate from the world, the apostle adds: “Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” (2 Cor. 7:1) Any filthiness, whether it be of the flesh or of the spirit, is abominable in His sight. Cleanliness of the flesh and spirit is the very opposite of filthiness, and means that the creature must be clean in body and in mind and use the natural faculties with which he is endowed to the glory of God. Having taken his position on the side of Jehovah in the great issue, and having been granted by Jehovah the great privilege of being associated with his Theocratic organization, he must deport himself in keeping with that holy organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The armies of “the king of the north” and of “the king of the south”, and the religious organizations with them, are seeing to it that those fighting for world domination are amply supplied with tobacco. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica </span><span class="font4">(Vol. 26) says: “As the continent of America was opened up and explored, it became evident that the consumption of tobacco, especially by smoking, was a universal and immemorial usage, in many cases bound up with the most </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SIGNIFICANT AND SOLEMN TRIBAL CEREMONIES.” </span><span class="font4">That means the use of that herb was associated with demonism, to bring its dupes under the power of the demons. Is the use of tobacco, then, clean or filthy within the meaning of the Scriptures! The use of tobacco is extremely filthy, regardless of the form in which it is used. It befouls the body and dulls the mental faculties. It makes the user offensive to those with whom he comes in contact, and works great injury to the user and is a dishonor to God and Christ. The use of tobacco has greatly demoralized the human race. It creates an appetite for other impure and filthy things. Under no condition is the use of tobacco approved by God’s &quot;Word, although not mentioned by name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It, therefore, does not seem consistent for anyone of God’s organization or those who have been privileged by His grace to enter the “cities of refuge”, to use tobacco. No one using tobacco is permitted to remain at Bethel home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord has been pleased to use Timothy to depict conditions in His visible organization at the present time. In 1 Timothy 4:12 we read, “Be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity” ; and in Romans 13 : 9,10 the apostle Paul clearly defines what constitutes the fulfilling of the law, emphasizing the fact that love worketh no ill to his neighbor. These scriptures bring forcibly to the attention of the Lord's people that those who are proper representatives of the Lord and the Lord’s organization must be examples to the believers and of the believers; that they must follow a course of action that will work no ill to their neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For these reasons those appointed to represent the Society as special or general pioneer publishers or as servants in the various company organizations are required to refrain from the use of tobacco in any form. If anyone using tobacco is recommended and appointed to serve in a special capacity and this fact is unknown to the Society, such person should inform the Society that he feels it necessary’ to use tobacco and therefore withdraws from the assigned position. Those who persist in the use of the harmful weed cannot be considered as proper examples in word, in charity, in spirit, in faith, or in purity, and by their course of action the example they are setting forth works ill to their neighbor. They are rebelling against a reasonable requirement of the Lord’s organization. As a consequence, according to the apostle’s reasoning in the thirteenth </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">chapter of Romans, </span><span class="font4">these people do not have love and the spirit of the Lord is not fulfilled in them, because they are walking after the flesh and not after the spirit.—Rom. 8:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To be sure, the Society has no power or authority or desire to say that a person who wishes to use tobacco may</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">not do so. Nor can it say, “You may not witness for the Kingdom.” But it can say who are its appointed representatives. Each one must decide whether he or she wishes to be in or out of line for privileges of service. The Society is committed first, last and all the time to the Lord’s side of every issue, and in this question must insist that those who are appointed as direct representatives of the Society in any capacity must refrain from the use of tobacco in all its forms. Those who represent the Lord and his kingdom must be clear of mind and avoid all things that would interfere with their Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” (2 Cor. 7:1) How may one accomplish that thing? </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Holiness</span><span class="font4"> means an unqualified devotion to Jehovah. In the language of the Scriptures that means to be blind to everything except God’s service. “Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the Lord’s servant?” (Isa. 42:19) The servant must at all times strive to do what is pleasing to the heavenly Father, and never qualify that course of action because of the fear of man or in order to receive the approval of man. “The fear of man bringeth a snare.” (Prov. 29:25) The approval of God is all-important. “In the fear of God” means deporting oneself in the manner that will please Jehovah; and to determine what that manner is he must learn it from the Scriptures. He fears lest he should fail to receive God’s approval. “The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.”—Prov. 8:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Evil” is that which works injury. No person is justified in working injury to himself, and certainly it is wrong to work injury to another. The use of such a poisonous weed as tobacco works injury both to the user and to those who are in contact with the user. This is particularly true with regard to smoking tobacco. If a man chooses to injure himself by the use of tobacco, no one has the right to say he shall not use it, but certainly no person has the right to blow tobacco smoke into the nostrils of another person. The habit of tobacco smoking is one of the most selfish that is exercised by human creatures; and, being selfish, it is the very opposite of love. The smoker fails to give any consideration to the rights and privileges of others about, to whom tobacco may be offensive. There is every reason against the use of tobacco; there is not one reason that supports its use. Surely, then, no Christian who is serving God could have an honest and sincere desire at any time to use the filthy weed. By doing so he is working injury, hence doing evil, and is following “the evil way”. These things God declares he hates. The fact that Jehovah hates that which works evil, coupled with the fact that tobacco does work evil, is conclusive proof that tobacco is the Devil’s weed employed for the purpose of demoralizing human creatures, particularly in the “time of the end”. The use of tobacco having originated with demonism, it should be expected that the “prince of the demons” would introduce its use into “Christendom” by religionists and popularize it there among religious practitioners. The contaminating influence thereof has spread to all parts of the earth. Imagine the “great multitude” of Armageddon survivors, under the righteous rule of the visible “princes in all the earth”, with cigarettes in their lips and trying to carry out the divine mandate to fill the earth with a healthy-blooded, righteous race!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MORALITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What is said concerning tobacco likewise applies to all things that tend to demoralize the creature. Any course of action that is filthy or unclean should be avoided by those who represent Jehovah. Some have foolishly tried to read into the Watchtower publications that which they do not contain, in order to find a justification for a wrongful course taken by them. Some have unwisely concluded that if they were engaged in the house-to-house witness work they could pursue with freedom from punishment any course their appetites might call for. One should remember that merely engaging in the witness work is not all that is required. The apostle Paul said he had “taught you publicly, and from house to house” (Acts 20:20), but he further said: “But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection; lest that by any means, when i have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway ” (1 Cor. 9: 27) Those engaged in the field service, therefore, should be pure and clean in their relations with any creatures; they should be kind, dignified, and employ proper language. It is wholly inconsistent for a representative of the Lord to carry a chip on his shoulder and walk up to a person and say: ‘You are of the Devil’s organization.” That is not the prerogative of Jehovah’s witnesses Our business is to comfort all that mourn and to present the truth from God’s Word in contrast with the wickedness of the Devil’s organization, and then let each decide for himself to which he belongs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning marriage, there seem to be some who have Entirely misconstrued what the Scriptures say about it and what has been published in the Watchtower publications. Persons who enter into a contractual relationship must first be qualified to make such a contract. If a man has a wife or the woman has a husband, then, of course, such are not qualified to make a further contract with another. The Scriptures provide that the marital relationship may be severed under certain conditions. (Deut. 24:1-4 ; Matt 5:31,32) When the relationship is duly severed, the innocent party is’ qualified to enter into a new contract. Marriage presupposes that the parties thereto are Scnp-turally and legally qualified to marry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A marriage in the sight of God, therefore, may be properly defined as a contract or agreement entered into between man and woman to become husband and wife, and by the full performance by both parties of the terms of that contract. A </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">legal</span><span class="font4"> marriage is properly defined as a contract entered into between man and woman to become husband and wife and then to have a ceremony performed in the presence of witnesses by one legally authorized to solemnize marriages. Such ceremonies comply with the law of the land, and it is proper to observe and obey the law where the law of the land does not directly conflict with God’s law. Since the law of God does not prohibit the performance of ceremonies, and the law of the land provides that they shall be performed by a third person, the ceremony by some such officiating person is lawful and proper. It is therefore seen that a ceremony performed by a justice of the peace, a magistrate, a judge of a court of records, or other judicial officer authorized to do so, is just as effective and binding as that performed by any priest or clergyman. The fee charged by the clergyman is often exorbitant and works a hardship on the poor. The marriage relationship is too sacred a thing to depend upon a few words spoken by an imperfect man, whether he be a priest or a judicial officer. It is also too sacred to be annulled by the whim, decree or opinion of some officer of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning the marital relationship the Lord Jesus said: “Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning, made them male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh ? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away [Deut. 24:1,2] ? He saith unto them, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so. And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.” (Matt. 19:4-9) See 1 Corinthians 7:1-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INTOXICANTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The use of wine is authorized by the Scriptures, but the use of it must be in moderation. To use wine in moderation is manifestly proper; otherwise the Lord would not have caused to be recorded in his Word, with his approval, instances of its use by his faithful servants There is a wide distinction between the moderate use of wine and the use of tobacco in any form. The latter is not approved under any condition, whereas wine is frequently spoken of with approval in the Word of God—Ps. 104:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Moderation in all things is the proper and Scriptural course. (Prov. 25:28) An immoderate eater is a glutton. A drunkard and a glutton are placed in the same class, and both are disapproved by the Lord. (Prov. 23:21; Deut. 21: 20) The Scriptural admonition is to take “a little wine for thy stomach’s sake”, but one who is suited for service in God's organization is “not given to much wine”. (1 Tim. 5: 23; 3 : 8) If one finds he cannot take a moderate amount of wine for his well-being, then he should avoid it altogether. If it works injury to himself or to any other person, then it should not be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In harmony with what is here said it is written: “Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.” (Prov. 23 : 20, 21) Manifestly Jesus used wine and ate food, and that furnished an excuse for the Pharisees to charge Jesus with being a winebibber and glutton and a friend of publicans and sinners. Concerning this matter Jesus himself said: “The Son of man came eating and drinking [not mere water, of course], and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom [also as to eating and drinking] is justified of her children.” (Matt. 11:19) Of course, the Pharisees charged him with excesses, but falsely, because Jesus always does right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Prohibitionists quote Proverbs 23:31: “Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.” Rotherham’s translation of this text reads: “Do not look on wine when it becometh red, when it giveth in the cup its sparkle, glideth down smoothly.” Some have insisted that this text means that no one should ever look at wine; but that is an unreasonable construction of the scripture. Wine made from certain grapes is red at all times and does not change its color. When a man, however, has drunk wine to excess he begins to see “red”. What this text really means is: Do not look on wine to use it when you see red, that is, when everything looks red to you. When it looks red to you, and slides down easily, then it is time to let it alone; you have had enough or too much. Do not tarry longer at it. —Isa. 5:11; Prov. 23 : 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When one is engaged in the Lord’s service, strong drink in any form should be avoided. To those who served in the priest’s office God gave such commandment in these words: “Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; and that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean.” (Lev. 10:9,10) Here the clear inference is that it was not improper to drink wine moderately when not serving in the tabernacle. At feasts the Israelites were commanded to bring certain offerings unto the Lord, and “the drink offering thereof shall be of wine [not unfermented grape juice]”. (Lev. 23:13) When one is engaged in God’s service he should avoid wine and other intoxicating drinks. That is not the proper time for such things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To decide the proper course, bear this in mind: The time has come to settle the primary issue and vindicate Jehovah’s name. He has graciously accepted the consecrating ones into his service and made them his witnesses and representatives of The Theocracy. The course of action pursued by such, then, must be in keeping with his Word, and such, therefore, must avoid and shun improper, unelean and unchaste things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The witnesses of Jehovah should deport themselves in keeping with his righteous Theocracy under Christ, which shall settle the issue to the vindication of Jehovah Let no one be so unwise as to think he can pursue any kind of loose course merely because he knows that humans cannot be expected to bring themselves to perfection in the flesh. The fact that he is imperfect does not mean he should not war at all times against the imperfections so as the better to serve the Lord. (1 John 2:6; Eph. 5:14-18) This is the “evil day”. Satan and his agents are using and will continue to use every possible means to cause Jehovah’s witnesses to deflect, turn away from the proper course, break their integrity toward God, and thus be not found “blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ”. (1 Cor. 1:8) It is therefore needful for each one to be watchful and to hold oneself strictly within the rules laid down by the Scriptures. Jehovah’s covenant people are in a real fight, and now they must maintain their integrity toward Him by faithfully representing him, perfecting holiness (perfect devotion to righteousness) in the fear of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">play it for me, then.’ After hearing the record ‘Instruction’ he immediately took the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font4"> and a year’s subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> Then he told me this: ‘Since you were here last I have read this book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> nine times clear through and get more good from it each time.’ This shows the importance of calling on all </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font4">obtainers with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> offer. Let them read!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">IN THE BASTION OF DEMOCRACY, ENGLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I was cycling through Fareham, wearing my </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine bag, when someone in the street called out to me to come back for a moment. I went back and recognized an air-raid warden with whom I had previously had several talks. It seems he had read the newspaper reports about Louisa Hercock’s imprisonment and was really mad about the false statements made about Jehovah’s witnesses. He asked me for the true facts of the case. I was able to give him a witness and he was thrilled about it all. He said: ‘It’s a pity there are not a few more people like you about. Let me give you something towards your work.’ I took out my sample </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> explaining its mission, etc. I told him he would receive a copy every fortnight in return for the money he had given me. He said he would be glad to have any more literature I could obtain for him, so that he could pass it on to his friends. This newspaper publicity is finding the ‘sheep’ as well as the ‘goats’.”—Portsmouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘‘We visited an old couple once a week. The woman was blind and we used to read </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> aloud and as far as possible hold a model study. Later they were removed to an institution. We followed them so that we could continue with the reading. This resulted in a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> book study being held in the ward. The attendance increased until they banned it. The institution has now been converted into an infirmary, and a number of people from Hull have been evacuated there. We have called on some of these and obtained a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription and started several model studies. One old lady of 91 is looking forward to being young in the Kingdom. Her knowledge of the Bible is wonderful. She had read </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children, Deliverance, Salvation, Religion</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font4"> and we keep her supplied with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> Recently a small group of us were doing pavement witnessing, when an army officer came up and asked whether we had any of ‘Rutherford’s tracts’. He said he had been on the lookout for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> bags for some time, but had not seen any about. He was seeking the truth. He obtained a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and model study booklet.”—British pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BEFORE THE FALL OF RANGOON, BURMA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Thank you [Gloucester company, England] for your great kindness in supplying the Rangoon company with the much-needed food. I am sure the company will appreciate this effort on your part and will praise Jehovah God for making it possible for us out here to get His message. At present I am 500 miles away from Rangoon, but will be going back for leave next week. The copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Religion,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font4"> you sent out are the only ones in Burma, and you can just imagine the eagerness of everyone to get hold of one of them. The Australian pioneers went to Chungking, China, and now the Burma government will not allow tiem to return until after the war. We miss them very much, and yet in their absence we get along, with the studies, back-calls and witnessing with Bibles. Anything coming from America gets burnt. We must carry on singing our victory song and never give in to the demons. Jehovah is our strength, shield and buckler, and in Him we trust.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OBEYING GOD IN MISSISSIPPI</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Sunday morning the county sheriff, a deputy and a paid ‘patriot’ came to our trailer to take us to jail because someone reported we were ‘overthrowing the government’. They would have jailed us except that the man on whose place we’re staying told them they had better investigate first because he had seen nothing wrong with our literature and lectures. After they had looked over the “Law-abiding' pamphlet and the booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">God and the State</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Exposing Fifth Column,</span><span class="font4"> the sheriff was satisfied, but the paid ‘patriot’ wanted to take our lectures and phonographs home to play. We told him they were in use every day but if he would sit down we’d run some lectures for him. That didn’t suit him. When he found the sheriff was not going to arrest us he told us to stop putting out the literature, for, although he knew we were sincere and innocent of wrongdoing, the people who wrote and published it had an entirely different motive and had put just enough enticing things in it to cover up their real purpose. Whereupon he was informed that in that case he was getting the eart before the horse in coming to us. And besides, there were people all over the world distributing this literature, and surely not </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font4"> of them eould be fools. The sheriff asked us to leave so he wouldn’t have to arrest us. He said the town (Wiggins) was all stirred up and we’d have trouble if we stayed. We stated our firm intentions of staying, by the Lord’s grace. The man on whose place we’re living watched, and, after thinking it over, became so indignant that he went to the sheriff’s home and gave him a good witness and reminded him of Matthew 18:6 concerning the millstone. Next day we went to the courthouse to show the sheriff some similar cases that had been won and tried to play him a lecture He was very reasonable, but in a few minutes the prosecuting attorney came in. He bellowed around and left after shouting we had no brains. Later the sheriff warned us again to leave the county so he wouldn’t have to arrest us, saying that the prosecuting attorney was bent on running us out and hinted at the new law passed by the state. We again informed him of our intention to stay. . . . A man of good-will told the sheriff and prosecuting attorney that if they put us in jail he was there with bond to get us out. They haven’t put us in. Not yet!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MEMORIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tuesday, March 31, after six p.m., is the date Scnpturally arrived at for 1942 for the memorial celebration to both Jehovah’s name and the sacrifice of the Lamb of God, Christ Jesus, his Theocratic King. Each Christian company, therefore, should assemble after six p.m. of March 31, and the anointed ones thereof celebrate the Memorial, their companions the “other sheep” being present as observers. If there is no competent person present to deliver a brief discourse immediately before the partaking of the emblems, that short article appearing in the March 15, 1939, issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> should be read before those assembled prior to partaking. Since the breaking of the bread and drinking of the wine both picture the death of Jesus, it follows that both emblems should be served together at partaking, and not separately. The emblems should be unleavened bread and real red wine. Jesus and his apostles used real red wine in symbol of his blood, and the anointed remnant should follow their lead. A report of the celebration should be made to the Society as instructed in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font2"> In preparation therefor the article “Memorial” suggested above will be studied with profit.</span></p>

This “Integrity” Testimony Period will be the opening month of the 1942 three-month </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> campaign, hence the people of integrity toward God will specialize on taking subscriptions for the magazine </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> announcing Jehovah’s kingdom or Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 2</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘'Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.&quot;—Ex. 20:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH'S name confers great honor upon the creature or organization that takes or receives that name. God chose the city of Jerusalem as a place of habitation for his covenant people, and he put his name there and thereby made it a most famous city. God caused his temple to be built at Jerusalem and made that the place to worship him. It was Jehovah’s city, symbolic of his organization on earth. The city of Jerusalem and almost all of the people there received the favor and name of Jehovah in vain, and this, of course, in violation of God’s commandment. Likewise “Christendom”, which was foreshadowed by Jerusalem, has received the name and favor of God in vain. To ‘take the name of God in vain’ does not mean the man in the street who uses vile language, as the clergymen are in the habit of applying this text. The one who consecrated himself to do the will of God, exercising faith in Christ Jesus as his Savior, and who starts to follow in the footsteps of Jesus and then draws back, has taken the name of God in vain. Or if he takes a course contrary to what the Scriptures point out, becoming heady, haughty and highminded and smiting his brethren, he has received the name of God in vain. Those who take God’s name in vain bring great reproach upon his name, and their end is destruction. Some may ignorantly get off on the wrong path after they have taken the Lord’s name, but, when receiving the warning and the knowledge directing them in the right way, if they would live they must quickly change their course and walk in the right way.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The wicked are those who have received enlightenment from God concerning his purpose and who then turn away from and put themselves in opposition to God. Lucifer was great in the organization of Jehovah, was enlightened, occupied a place of great responsibility, became covetous and ambitious, and turned himself in full opposition to Jehovah. He is therefore designated in the Scriptures as “that wicked one”. (1 John 3:12) All who have known God and Christ Jesus and who have then repudiated Jehovah’s Word and turned away from him have reproached his name and taken God’s name in vain, and are placed by the Lord in the class of the wicked. Jehovah has been long-suffering with the wicked, and concerning this the apostle says: “When once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing.” (1 Pet. 3:20) The English word “suffer”, as used, is given various meanings, among which is: To permit, or tolerate; to hold up, or delay; such as holding up or delaying the execution of a judgment. The Scriptural meaning of the word is often the same. It means being slow to express anger, forbearing, to defer, that is, to permit the wicked one to take his own course until God’s due time to act.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>3</sup> This forbearance or long-suffering of God does not mean that he ever looks with favor upon the wrongdoer. On the contrary, it is written: “God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day [God . . . hath indignation every day (A.R.F.)].” (Ps. 7:11) Again it is written: &quot;Ail the wucked will [God] destroy.” (Ps. 145:20) However, Jehovah waits his own due time to execute his judgment against the wicked. The followers of Christ Jesus also must learn to be long-suffering and forbearing. To such these words of the Scriptures are addressed, to wit: “Walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love.” (Eph. 4:1,2) “Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.”—Col. 3:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">‘ These scriptures cannot be properly construed to mean that one who has received the name of the Lord should never be angry. Righteous indignation against wrongdoing is proper and right, because the man who follows the Lord Jesus Christ cannot look with approval upon wrongdoing. The following words are addressed to those who have consecrated themselves to do the Lord’s will, and to follow in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">footsteps of Jesus, to wit: “Be ye angry, and sin not.” (Eph. 4:26) How can one be angry and not commit sin? How can one sin by becoming angry or because of anger? Sin is the transgression of God’s law. (1 John 3:4) When one becomes angry he may desire to give expression to that anger by administering bodily punishment to the one against whom he is angry. Such is a violation of God’s law, and therefore sin. The law of God says: “To me belong-eth vengeance, ... I will render vengeance to mine enemies.” (Deut. 32:35,41,43; Rom. 12:19; Heb. 10: 30) As the Lord is long-suffering toward his enemies, biding his own due time to punish them, so those who have received the name of Jehovah must be long-suffering and forgiving and leave it to God in his own due time to execute his judgment against the wrongdoers. The followers of Christ Jesus in the day of Jehovah’s vengeance have a work to do in connection with the expression of Jehovah’s vengeance, and that work is, as their commission states, ‘to declare the day of the vengeance of our God.’ (Isa. 61: 2) However, Jehovah declares in his Word his vengeance against all defamers of his name, but that he will do the executing. The scripture also says that all the saints shall have part in the execution of judgment, in this: that they have part in binding the wicked ones by declaring the judgments of Jehovah already written.—Ps. 149:8,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ The remnant must do the part assigned to them, which part is to boldly proclaim God’s purpose as expressed in his Word. Jehovah caused his prophets of old to declare and to write down the judgments, and it is these judgments of the Lord God heretofore written that his faithful witnesses now must make known, declaring to those who will hear God’s purpose of executing such judgments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE REASON</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> Taking up here now the further consideration of the prophecy of Micah, note that Jehovah’s word came to Micah, and Micah was commanded to declare that word; and now Jehovah’s witnesses, whom Micah pictured, must likewise declare the Word of God. “Christendom” has taken the name of Jehovah God; and by “Christendom” is meant the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the other clergy, “elective elders,” the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” the Judas company, and all others who profess to be servants of God, regardless of denomination or name, and who are associated together as a part of Satan’s organization. As there was only a remnant of Israel that remained true to Jehovah, even so now there is only a remnant of those who profess to be servants of God that remain true to their covenant. Jehovah by his prophet Micah now here states the reason why God will execute his vengeance upon those who have taken his name in vain. “For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?”—Mic. 1:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>T</sup> As used in this text the name “Jacob” (meaning “supplanter”) stands primarily for the northern house, that is, the ten tribes of Israel having their capital at Samaria. The remaining tribes of Israel had their capital at Jerusalem. Thus, antitypically, all “Christendom” is wrapped up in the disobedience of and in opposition to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ They are his enemies and shall suffer his vengeance. The prophet then propounds the question concerning the “transgression of Jacob”, and by another question answers the first, to wit: “Is it not Samaria?” King Omri, the father of Ahab, made Samaria the capital of the ten tribes of the house of Jacob. (1 Ki. 16:23,24) The prophet Micah later in his prophecy (6:16) says of the transgression : “For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all.the works of the house of Ahab [the Baal or Devil worshipers], and ye walk in their counsels.” Besides Baal worship, the “sin of Samaria” included the worship of the golden calves at Dan and Bethel which confounded the worship of Jehovah God with idols and turned the people away from the true worship of Jehovah at his temple. (1 Ki. 12: 26-33; Amos 8:14) It was also the kingdom of Samaria that formed the conspiracy or confederacy with Damascus in Syria to fight against Judah, and concerning which confederacy Isaiah prophesied that it should be broken in pieces for the reason, as the prophet stated, “God is with us,” his faithful people. (Isa. 7 :1-9; 8: 9,10) Therefore “the transgression of Jacob” applies to “the friendship of the world”, that is, Baalism, the Devil worship; also the giving of great honor to and worshiping creatures (especially religious leaders, who claim to represent or stand for God), and particularly honor and worship such as to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other clergymen who demand and receive such honor and worship from their subjects. It also includes the great honor and worship to men who are religious leaders in any organization of religionists that has taken the name of God and Christ Jesus; also those participating in the “confederacy”, or League of Nations, which is set up in the place of and in opposition to Christ Jesus the King, “The Lion of the Tribe of Judah.” All these things are included in that transgression or sin of Samaria. When the Greater Jehu, Christ Jesus, comes down to modern-day Samaria, he puts an end to such transgressions and to the transgressors by executing Jehovah’s judgment against them, as foreshadowed in the prophecies.—2 Ki. 10:1-27; Isa. 28: 1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLACE OF WORSHIP</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ Jehovah put his name upon Jerusalem and caused his temple to be builded there, and at Jerusalem was the place to worship Jehovah God. The “high places”, as that phrase is used in connection with Israel, were forbidden places for going through a form of worship. Jerusalem was the only lofty place for the worship of Jehovah and where it was done according to his law; therefore the question propounded in this prophecy: “And what are the high places of Judah?” meaning, Where is the responsibility for the high places throughout Judah?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> From the earliest times, as stated by historical authority, it was the custom among the heathen nations to erect a place of worship on a high or conspicuous spot. The Roman Catholics have ever followed this course. Call to mind now that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have erected their buildings in the most conspicuous spots in every country. They seek the high or lofty places to make great show of themselves. When God made the covenant with Israel in Moab, he there in the law stated to the Israelites: “Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree; and ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place. Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God. But unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there [that is, Jerusalem], even unto his habitation [his temple] shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come: and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks: and there ye shall eat before the Lord your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the Lord thy God hath blessed thee.” (Deut. 12:2-7) At the beginning of Solomon's reign there was no temple for worship at Jerusalem: “Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the Lord, until those days. And Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar. In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream bv night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.” —1 Ki. 3:2-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> Concerning the high places that were forbidden the Lord said: “Are they not Jerusalem?” The Jews, from the royal family down to the common people, because of unfaithfulness, did not confine their worship to the temple at Jerusalem, as commanded, but they sought other places to carry on a form of worship, both inside and outside of Jerusalem. Thus doing, Jerusalem, by reason of being the capital city, became responsible for the improper use of the liiirli places throughout the nation. Their course of action shows that they had taken and received the name of God in vain. The king failed to cut off those high places, and that brought still greater responsibility upon the city and the king. Then Solomon the king became unfaithful in his old age and turned to Devil worship.—1 Ki. 11:7-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> The prophet Micah began to prophesy in King Jotham’s reign, and concerning such king it is written : “And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord; he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done. Howbeit, the high places were not removed; the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the Lord.” (2 Ki. 15: 34, 35) As for Jotham's son, Ahaz, he grossly violated God's law: “And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.” (2 Ki. 1G: 4) The ten tribes of the northern kingdom of Israel also violated God’s law by using such high places for their forms of worship. When the ten tribes made a league with the king of Syria against Judah, Ahaz, the king, brought the kingdom of Judah into a league with Assyria: “And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria. And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him; for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.”—2 Ki. lG:5-9.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Modern-day worshipers, who make a pretense of worshiping God by indulging in forms of godliness and speaking meaningless words, do this while their hearts are far removed from Jehovah, and they insist upon what they call their “rights and liberties”, and set up their own organization of worship and adopt these forms of service to suit their own fancies. They have no interest in the kingdom of God, and the Kingdom interests are removed far from them, and for that reason the Lord gives these Kingdom interests ‘to a people bringing forth the fruits thereof’. (Matt. 21:43) These modern-day religionists make a league or confederacy with the iniquitous nations of this world which oppose Jehovah and his kingdom. King Hezekiah destroyed the high places of ungodly worship; as it is written: “He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">{{margin)</span><span class="font4"> a piece of brass]. He trusted in the Lord God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.&quot;—2 Ki. 18: 4, 5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Today one greater than Hezekiah is needed to clean out the unholy practice of the religionists, and Jesus Christ proceeds to do that very thing. The son of King Hezekiah went contrary to what his father had done and built high places contrary to God’s law: “For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. And he built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.’’—2 Ki. 21: 3, 4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies follow the same course of the wicked king Manasseh. The w’ord of the prophet Ezekiel applying to the unfaithful “Christendom” says: “Thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast made thee an high place in every street. Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms. In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as an harlot, in that thou scornest hire; but as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband! They give gifts to all whores; but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom. And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places; they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.” (Ezek. 16: 24, 23, 31-33, 39; see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> Book One, page 191 and following) Thus Jehovah foretells his purpose to destroy the religionists that have assumed his name and have wickedly reproached his name, and that have therefore taken his name in vain. These truths are now revealed and given to God’s people that they may carry the same to the people of good-will, who may now hear the command of the Lord coming from his temple and seek the Lord’s favor as he has directed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Jehovah then declares his purpose to ruin Samaria: “Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard; and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.” (Mic. 1:6) Even though Samaria was a strong and defended city able to withstand a siege for three years, which it did, in due time it fell. Likewise boastful “Christendom”, which claims to be so strong that it is unbreakable; it shall be brought down to ruin and become like a field of desolation. Describing the ruin that should come upon Samaria, and likewise upon “Christendom”, or organized religionists and their organizations, the prophet said: “I will make [it] . . . as plantings of a vineyard”; “vineyard plantations” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">{Leeser).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> Isaiah, who prophesied also in the days of Micah, said of unfaithful “Christendom”: “And now, go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard; I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down; and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor digged; but there shall come up briers and thorns; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant; and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.”—Isa. 5: 5-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> As Jehovah said concerning Samaria that he would “pour down the stones thereof”, so he thus foretells how he will completely wreck and ruin exalted “Christendom”, and especially the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allied clergy. Jehovah foretold the same thing by his prophet Obadiah. In this manner Jehovah emphasizes his purpose to destroy the hypocritical religionists, that no one will have any excuse to be ignorant of what is coming upon that great hypocritical and devilish organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The prophecy of Micah discloses Jehovah’s purpose to destroy “Christendom’s” superstructure and also that he will wreck it and tear it down to its very foundations and sweep away its great heap of lies, and expose it to shame and disgrace. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allied clergy and their “principal of the flock” have rejected Christ Jesus, the sure Foundation Stone, and now within a short time Jehovah shall completely destroy all of that wicked organization.—Isa. 28:16-21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>50</sup> For many years “Christendom” has practiced the Devil religion and has committed the sin of Samaria by extolling creatures, pretending to canonize and make saints of them and to exalt them as objects of worship, and has taught the people to pray to and worship such so-called “saints”, which “saints” never did in fact exist, but are wholly a fraud and a subterfuge. This wicked thing has been done in open violation of Jehovah’s commandment at Exodus 20:1-5. Graven images are everywhere used by “Christendom”, and particularly by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, to impress the people and to hoodwink them and to cause them to give honor and worship to creatures and things. Therefore Jehovah foretold by his prophet what shall come upon “Christendom”: “And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate; for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.”—Mic. 1: 7.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> The people of good-will who are of the “Catholic population”, and others of honest heart, must now learn of these truths, and the obligation is laid upon Jehovah’s remnant to see to it that they do have the opportunity to hear and to learn these great truths. The beating to pieces of Samaria’s graven images foreshadows the destruction that shall come upon the religious systems of “Christendom” that have used these inanimate things to deceive and rob the people. In Moab Jehovah commanded his people, saying: &quot;There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel. Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the Lord thy God for any vow; for even both these are abomination unto the Lord thy God.” —Deut. 23:17,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> Here Israel foreshadowed “Christendom”, which for a long while has practiced whoredom and continues to indulge therein. “Christendom” has brought “the liire of a whore” and “the price of a dog” into the religious organizations that have assumed the name of God and Christ; and all of such is a direct violation of God’s law. The religionists have sought after and committed whoredom or illicit relationship with all other parts of the Devil’s earthly organization. Crooked commercial traffickers and corrupt politicians have been invited and taken into the organizations of these religionists, and they have all worked together to extract filthy lucre from the people whom they have seduced and debauched by their devilish doctrines. By means of such whoredom the hire, or money derived therefrom, has been brought into the organization that claims to represent God on earth. A sodomite was likened unto the “price of a dog’’, and such have also been brought into the organization that sails under the name of Christ. Roman Catholic priests claim to be moral and stand as guardians of the people to safeguard and preserve their morals, but in truth and in fact they are the most lecherous crowd amongst men. They have used and continue to use the cloak of their so-called &quot;Christian religion”, by which to hide and carry on at will their immoral practices to satisfy their sensual desires.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> Jehovah gives full assurance that “Christendom” shall be destroyed and “all of the idols thereof will I lay desolate”. (See Ezekiel 23:2-10; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication, </span><span class="font4">Book One, page 303.) For what reason will the Lord thus do? “For she [‘Christendom’] gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.” All the images, beads, gold lace, holy water, dead women’s toes, crucifixes, and all manner of images for idol worship and practices by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies, stand lor nothing other than harlotry toward Jehovah, and that at the purchase price of some selfish inducement or &quot;hire&quot;. The clergy, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, have built up a fraudulent system into which they have drawn the worst kind of criminals, and have used the name of Jehovah and of Christ Jesus to induce the poor and ignorant to support them and to bring into the coffers of the old “harlot” their hard-earned money to satisfy the selfish desires of a crowd of dissolute men. It is cruel enough to practice fraud upon the people and to thereby fleece them out of their hard earnings, but it is far more wicked to use the name of the Lord as a shield for their practice of cruelty, in order to carry out their fraudulent schemes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> By their practices of idolatry those religion mongers have defrauded the people, enriched themselves with material things, and have defamed the reputation and name of Almighty God. Hence, says the Lord of them, they shall find their proper place, that is, in destruction. “For out of the reward of unchastity she gathered them, and unto the reward of unchastity shall they return.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font4"> Jehovah inspired his faithful servant James to address his words to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies, including the “principal of the flock” who have assumed the name of the Lord and have at the same time formed a part of Satan’s world, and therefore it is written: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.”—Jas. 4:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> For a long while those men have lived wantonly, using their ill-gotten gains for their own sensual pleasure. God announces his purpose to destroy their institutions and those who have budded them up. But, say the opponents of the Kingdom, why say anything about these things now? The answer is, Because Jehovah has commanded his witnesses to declare the day of his vengeance upon those who have defamed his name and have taken his name in vain, to the end that the people may be warned of their approaching doom, and that those of good-will who have been held in subjection to those practicers of fraud may have opportunity to flee to God and to Christ. The work of Jehovah’s witnesses in thus proclaiming the truth at the present time is done that the “great multitude” may find the way to Zion before the battle of the great day of God Almighty begins. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The W atchtower</span><span class="font4"> publishes these things for the benefit of all those who love and serve Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> The prophecy of Micah at this point makes a picture of what the religionists will do when they come to realize that sudden destruction is just before them: “Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.” (Mic. 1: 8) That picture is not one expressing sympathy with the religionists, but is for a sign unto them, indicating prophetically to “Christendom” what awaits that unholy organization. It is not the will of Jehovah that his faithful people should howl and lament for anyone that becomes unfaithful to God and his kingdom, and who has for that reason lost all. Anyone who howls and laments because the wicked suffer destruction shows that he is not faithful to and does not love the Lord God. This is made certain by the words of the prophet Jeremiah: “For thus saith the Lord, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them [symbolically]; for I have taken away my peace from this people, ^aith the Lord, even lovingkindness and mercies. Both the great and the small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, neither shall men [the Jonadabs or ‘other sheep’; the ‘great multitude’] lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them.”—J er. 16: 5, 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> Concerning this Jehovah instructed Ezekiel that he should not weep when his unfaithful wife was taken away suddenly in death, thus picturing those who are unfaithful to and defame God’s name. “Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke; yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down. Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead [who have been guilty of the sin of Samaria], bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.”—Ezek. 24:16,17; see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font4"> Book One, page 332.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> When one who has been in God's organization and in his service proves unfaithful and destruction awaits him, those who are faithful to God will not lament or weep for such. The greatest favor that ever came to man is to know and serve Jehovah and bear the name of Jehovah, and anyone who is unfaithful to that blessing and privilege is unworthy of sympathy. Further supporting this conclusion the prophet of Jehovah wrote: “And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.”—Jer. 25: 33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The prophet Micah says: &quot;I will go stripped and naked”; and by doing so a picture is made of the captives taken when the Lord ‘leads captivity captive’. (Ps. 68:18; Eph. 4:8) Concerning Assyrian treatment of the captives of Samaria the prophet of God wrote: “So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.”—Isa. 20:4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” Further depicting the miserable condition of the religionists when their calamity befalls them the prophet wails “like the dragons [crocodiles, (Leeser)].” The crocodile, when angry, produces a snorting sound; and according to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham,</span><span class="font4"> this text says the noise is like wild dogs. Likewise the clergy (“dumb dogs”), when fully realizing that their end has come, will howl. Furthermore the prophet says: “Mourning as the owls”; that is, with a loud and woeful mourning. Concerning those same religion mongers it is foretold by another prophet of Jehovah that these shall howl; as it is written: “Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock.” (Jer. 25: 34) James tells of the same crowd that will indulge in extreme howling in that day. (Jas. 5:1-6) The prophet Micah, therefore, by thus howling and going naked and wailing, foretells what shall befall the unfaithful “Christendom”, and particularly the leaders thereof.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> “Christendom” has already received a stroke from the Lord, and now she begins to give evidence thereof; but soon her howl will be much more distinct and distressing: “For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.” (Mie. 1: 9) Jehovah has given his word that “Christendom” shall receive the destructive blow with his “glittering Sword”. (Deut. 32:41) That stroke by Jehovah's Executioner will not be like the World War bump that was given the “beast” on the head that was afterwards “healed” (Rev. 13:3,12); but it will be a deadly blow from which there will be no recovery. It will be a devastating slaughter, “according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb.” (Isa. 10:26) The deadly wound received there cannot be healed. Armageddon will destroy the religionists and also the others that are against God, including the “man of sin”, the Judas class, and every part of “Christendom”, and all of Satan’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>32</sup> The Philistines hated the Israelites; and likewise the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the modern Philistines, hate God’s people now on earth. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy pretends to be friendly to all professing Christians who are called “Protestant” or by other names, and even friendly to the Jews, who completely reject Christ Jesus, but all this apparent friendliness on the part of the Hierarchy is hypocritical and dishonest. That cold-blooded organization has no kind feeling for anyone, but is entirely selfish. The news to the modern Philistines concerning the calamity that will come upon the other religionists would be good news to them. The prophet of Jehovah says: “Declare ye it not at Gath [In Gath do not tell </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)},</span><span class="font4"> weep ye not at all; in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.” (Mic. 1:10) The giant and champion of Gath, Goliath, was slain by David when David was a mere shepherd lad, and from that time on the Philistines had a bitter hatred against the Israelites and thereafter sought to “destroy it for the old hatred”. (Ezek. 25:15-17) In the prophecy of Micah the Lord says ‘it is not to be told in Gath’; and this appears to mean that the message is not to be told for the benefit of the modern Goliath, the giants of the modern Philistines, but Jehovah’s witnesses are to declare the vengeance of Jehovah for the benefit of those that are held in restraint by the Philistines, that is to say, the honest-hearted Catholics, to the end that these might learn the truth and flee from the doomed organization. While the message must tell of the wickedness of the modern Philistines, the real purpose is to benefit the honest people. The witnesses of Jehovah are not to weep at all because of the calamity that shall befall the modern Philistines<sup>-</sup>or any part of Satan’s organization. The adverse judgment of Jehovah is against all Philistines and all others who are against God and his kingdom, and there shall be no weeping because of the exposure of that crowd and the proclamation of the adverse judgment against them. Jehovah brings punishment upon that city or organization that has assumed his name, and it shall come upon every part of Satan’s organization. (Jer. 25: 28, 29) Says the prophet: “In the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.” The name “Aphrah”, as here used, means “dust”. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Margin)</span><span class="font4"> When Jehovah performs “his act, his strange act”, and Satan’s crowd see it about to fall upon them, they will wallow in the dust. This is expressly stated concerning the shepherds and the “principal of the flock”: “Wail, ye shepherds, and cry; and roll yourselves about (in the dust), ye leaders of the flocks; for full are your days for you to be slaughtered, and I will scatter you; and ye shall fall like a costly vessel.”—Jer. 25: 34, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> Jehovah chose Jerusalem and put his name there and made that place “beautiful for situation”. (Ps. 48: 2) Likewise when God, through Christ Jesus and his faithful apostles, began his organization upon the earth and God put his name upon it, that also was beautiful. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, thereafter organized by Satan, entered in amongst the true followers of Christ Jesus and corrupted the organization on earth, and in time all “Christendom” became corrupt, and the faithful servants of God withdrew therefrom. In relation thereto the prophet says: “Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel; he shall receive of you his standing.” (Mic. 1:11) The name “Saphir” there used means “beautiful; goodliness”; that which was once beautiful, and which became filthy by reason of the Devil’s planting selfish men therein to corrupt it. The Lord declares his purpose to strip “Christendom” naked, disgrace her. and expose her to shame and contempt. She is now no longer 'garnished by Jehovah’s spirit’. (Job 26:13) Gods faithful servant class alone can say, “The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup; thou maintainest my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage. 1 will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel; my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.” (Ps. 16: 3-7) “His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon himself shall his crown flourish.”—Ps. 132:18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">’<sup>4</sup> The prophet Micah here, according to the Ju-</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">thorized Version,</span><span class="font4"> says: “The inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel.” But according to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font4"> it reads: “The inhab-itress [female] of Zaanan hath not gone forth.” The name “Zaanan” means “migrating”, that is, moving habitually from place to place. This description fits well the hooded female division that is sent forth by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, moving about from place to place to extract hard-earned money from the pockets of the “Catholic population”, which common people are forced by reason of fear to dig up regularly for the support of the unholy organization. Jehovah’s Executioner comes up before the face of this wicked crowd; as it is written: “He that dasheth in pieces is coine up before thy face.” (Nah. 2:1) When this takes place, and is about to fall upon the enemy, these cannot migrate from place to place and gather sustenance from the pastures for the benefit of the worldly crowd of bloodsuckers who defame Jehovah’s name; and in this connection says another prophet of Jehovah: “The Lord hath spoiled their pasture.” (Jer. 25:36) The above-described gatherers of funds from the people go about in a mourning attitude, as if they were poor and needy; but the end of their hypocritical work is soon to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>,s</sup> In recent years the organization once known as “Protestant” has become the ally of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. In this connection note the words of the prophecy, “in the mourning of Beth-ezel.” (Mic. 1:11) According to the other translators it appears that this phrase does not belong to the preceding, but to the words that follow, to wit, “He shall receive of you his standing.” “At the lamentation of Beth-ezel shall he [that is, Jehovah’s Vindicator and Avenger] take from you his station.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham) </span><span class="font4">“The wailing of Beth-ezel [ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(margin)</span><span class="font4"> a place near] shall take from you the stay thereof.” (R.V.) The name “Beth-ezel” means “near-by house”, that is, a neighbor, a stand-by or an ally, or organizations allied together. The alliance of the Roman Catholic</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hierarchy includes all the neighbor religionists of &quot;Christendom”; and these allies, when it comes to the showdown, will be useless, and their mourning and lamentation will accomplish nothing. It will be no advantage to the allies to be thus associated, because Jehovah’s Executioner will bring down mourning and disaster on the allies, so that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and every other part of the religious crowd will be unable to stand and none will be able to fall back and receive aid and support their allies. Christ Jesus will execute all the enemies of God. These facts must now be known to those who love the Lord. For this reason he causes them to be made known, so that the man of God may be fully equipped for the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>86</sup> Immediately following the World War international schemes were brought forward and put into operation in an effort to stabilize the nations and to save the governments from crashing. Such schemes have accomplished nothing, and there have been many of them. Woe after woe has befallen the peoples of earth, and the rulers have refused to hear and learn the reason for such woe and distress. Concerning this it is written in the Scriptures: ‘Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.”—Rev. 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” It has been a time of great sorrow upon the rulers and upon the people, and only those who have turned to the Lord and serve him have understood the reason for such w<sup>T</sup>oe and distress. The clergy would make the people of their parishes to believe that the many woes and distresses upon the world are because the people are not faithful to their church organization. The Scriptures are emphatic in that all these woes proceed from the Devil for the purpose of turning the people away from and causing them to curse God. The clergy therefore are doing the work of Satan in inducing the people to believe that God is sending these woes at the present time, and thus inducing the people to curse God. Referring to this same time Jehovah’s prophet wrote: &quot;For the inhabitant [inhabitress </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham</span><span class="font4"> and Leeser)] of Maroth waited carefully [anxiously] for good; but evil came down from the Lord unto the gate of Jerusalem.” (Mic. 1:12) The name “Maroth” means “bitternesses”, such as bitter waters or springs of water. In the face of repeated woes the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, taking the lead, brought together all religious organizations and the principal ones of their flock, including the most unscrupulous politicians and heartless commercial traffickers; and all these together, and with great blare of trumpets, launched the so-called “holy year” and expressed in their loud-sounding prayers and speeches the hope that the “holy year” would sweep the nations into great prosperity. Dismal failure has been the result, and, instead of great prosperity, the woes increase. Scheme after scheme is brought forth, such as the NRA, which the Roman Catholic Hierarchy claims to have originated, and this falls flat. All such schemes have failed. As the prophet says: “Christendom” waited “anxiously for good” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.),</span><span class="font4"> but good did not come. Instead of blessings, such as worldwide prosperity which the worldly-wise prophesied would come, “Christendom” gets exactly what her name here means, that is, bitter things, waters filled with poison, schemes of death and destruction. “Christendom” has turned entirely away from God, and all “Christendom” shall be turned into destruction. “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.”—Ps. 9:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> The religionists, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, loudly proclaim that they will save the world from disaster, and the rulers who form the principal ones of the flocks join with the religionists in opposing and persecuting all who truly serve God and who declare to the people the real cause of the trouble and what shall be the remedy. Jehovah’s Word makes it clearly to appear that all human schemes for world recovery, reconstruction and stabilization, will end up with bitter realities and the schemes will all fail and disappear. “Organized religion,” the antitype of faithless Jerusalem, cannot possibly save the situation. Particularly since 1918 the organizations of this world have been a real “Maroth”, that is, ever-increasing ‘bitterness’, exactly as the Scriptures have foretold. (Rev. 12:12; 8:10,11) Jehovah will wind up and finish this organization with far greater bitterness at the battle of Armageddon. As the “seven last plagues” have been bitter to “Christendom”, even so with everincreasing bitterness will come the world’s complete destruction. “Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without; the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.” (Isa. 33: 7) “And I [Jehovah] will make it as the mourning of an only son. and the end thereof as a bitter day.” (Amos 8:10) “The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord; the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.” (Zeph. 1:14) As that bitter climax comes near God commands his witnesses in thunder tones sounding above the bitter weeping of the world, saying to his people: “Let not thine hands be slack.” (Zeph. 3:16) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> urgently calls attention to these things, and repeatedly does so, that the witnesses whom Jehovah has commissioned may not become negligent in obeying the commandments of the Lord. The “great multitude” must be warned and helped to see their privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>88</sup> Verse twelve of Micah’s prophecy further says: “Evil came down from the Lord unto the gate of Jerusalem.” Manifestly this refers to Jehovah’s “work”, which stings and brings into disgrace the religionists, and more particularly to Jehovah’s “strange act”, which will completely destroy unfaithful Jerusalem and all other parts of Satan’s organization. “Organized religion” and her allies continue to look to earthly things, human institutions, for good, entirely ignoring God and his provision for the human race. Instead of good resulting to them, their woes continue. The woe that the Devil brings upon the people is that of general suffering, whereas the “evil” that the Lord brings upon the clergy is first to disgrace them by exposing them and then to completely destroy them at Armageddon.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> Further addressing the headstrong and boastful, who have forsaken God and who are now God-forsaken, the prophet of the Most High says: “0 thou inhabitant [inhabitress </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Hebrew)]</span><span class="font4"> of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast [the steed </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font4"> ; horses </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)] :</span><span class="font4"> she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion; for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.”—Mic. 1:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>41</sup> The name “Lachish” means “obstinate, height, impregnable”. In ancient times the city of Lachish had. been made a fortified city by the unfaithful king Rehoboam. (2 Chron. 11: 5, 9) In bringing about the destruction of Jerusalem Nebuchadnezzar, the executioner of Jehovah at that time, fought against Lachish. (Jer. 34:7) Now “Christendom”, which is unfaithful to God and which was foreshadowed by unfaithful Jerusalem, is involved and is in for a cleanup. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has always been against God and his kingdom, although, falsely, claiming to represent God and Christ. In these latter days all the organizations religious have joined hands with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and all have trusted, and continue to trust, in the governments of the nations of this world, as high and impregnable fortresses, as a place of defense and security; but none of those so-called impregnable forces shall be able to stand when Jehovah’s Executioner moves into action.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>42</sup> In this part of the prophecy the beginning of the sin of “organized Christianity”, or “organized religion”, is named. According to another translation the text reads: “Bind the chariot to the swift steed, 0 inhabitant of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.”—Mic. 1:13, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>43</sup> The city of Lachish is not the “beginning of the sin”, but the beginning of the sin is “the chariot” to which the sw’ift steed is bound. Steeds or horses are symbolic of military equipment of the world of Satan. When God made a covenant with Israel in Moab, he anticipated that Israel would desire and would set up a king, and concerning the king Jehovah commanded what should be done, in these words: &quot;But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt [for military equipment or help], to the end that he should multiply horses [to be bound to chariots]; forasmuch as the Lord hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.”—Deut. 17:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>44</sup> But in time the Israelites entirely forgot this commandment of the Lord. It is written that Solomon had forty thousand horses for his chariots. (1 Ki. 4: 26) He had “cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen”, and “rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen”. (1 Ki. 9:19-22) He had horses aud chariots brought up out of Egypt. (1 Ki. 10:26-29) He forgot to depend on the Lord, but disregarded God's commandment and went according to the ways that “Christendom” now goes. “Organized religion” or “Christendom” has made a like grievous error. Those great religionists claim to represent God, but instead of depending on God they have depended upon the strong military arm of this world, that is, the 'chariots’ and ‘swift beasts’. In this they have shown a lack of faith in God, and because of fear of man the whole organization of “Christendom” has been brough: into the snare of the Devil. The beginning of this sin of the professed daughter of Jerusalem, that is, “organized Christianity” so called, was the putting of faith in and depending upon the military and strong powers of this world for help, and thereby entirely departing from Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>45</sup> Referring to this same thing the psalmist says: “Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.” (Ps. 20: 7, 8) But it is certain, as stated by Jehovah, that the power in which “Christendom” has trusted has completely failed her. “And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots.” (Mic. 5:10) Now &quot;Christendom” faces that foretold destruction. The transgression of God’s law is seen, and says God’s prophet: “For the transgressions of Israel [Jacob the unfaithful, who started to serve God] were found in thee.” Then the question is propounded, “AVhat is the transgression of Jacob [Israel] ?” (Vs. 5) The answer is: “The sin of Samaria.” It was found in unfaithful Jerusalem, and now that similar condition and sin is found in “Christendom”. The “sin of Samaria” was and is creature worship, Devil worship, rebellion against God's commandment, the worship of creatures and things, and all this in plain violation of God’s law. At the present time this sin has reached a climax in an attempt by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their allies to compel the people to salute men and flags and other things and thereby attribute protection and salvation to things of this world, whereas all protection and salvation is of God through Christ Jesus. The remnant and the Jonadabs stand out firmly against such sinful practice; and with determination to not yield to the enemy, these faithful ones attribute and boldly make known that all protection and salvation is of God through Christ Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>46</sup> Jerusalem was unfaithful to God, and likewise her antitype, “Christendom,” has proved entirely unfaithful to God. The judgment against the offenders has been written: “Therefore shalt thou give presents [dismissals </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Hebrew)</span><span class="font4">; a dismission </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font4">; a parting gift (A.R.P.) ] to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.” (Mic. 1:14) The name “Moresheth-gath” used in this prophecy means “possession of Gath, or, inheritance of Gath”, and the name appears to be used ironically towards Jerusalem, and her antitype, that is, “Christendom.” Instead of possessing and inheriting, Jerusalem would have to yield it up as a possession of her enemy, and would also be compelled to dismiss or let go her enemy with presents or gifts, thereby losing the city, and be compelled to pay in addition to that loss. This was illustrated when the Israelites were leaving Egypt and when the Egyptians gave to them jewels of silver, and of gold and raiment. The Hebrews spoiled the Egyptians. (Ex. 12:35,36) It foreshadowed what should come to “Christendom”. “Christendom” will be compelled to surrender what she looked upon as her possession and inheritance and to suffer additional ills. “Christendom,” and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, boastfully says: “We will possess and rule the world, because that is our right.” Instead of realizing that desire, “Christendom” will have to yield possession to her enemy, the Executioner of Jehovah, because Jehovah’s King has received from the hand of the Alo&amp;t High “the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron ; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel”. (Ps. 2:8, 9, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> Those who are faithful unto God and unto their covenant shall be with Christ Jesus and, by the grace of Jehovah, shall with him be joint-heirs in all of his possession and inheritance.—Rom. 8:16,17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">*' According to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Version</span><span class="font4"> the latter part of the verse (Micah 1:14) reads: “The houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of Israel.” The name “Achzib” means “deceitful, falsehood, or, a deceitful thing”. True to the name, the houses of Achzib became an unfaithful ally and yielded to Sennacherib, forsaking the alliance with Israel. The Hebrews called Achzib by the name ‘liar’ or ‘deceitful’. It was “as a liar, and as waters that fail” in the summer heat.—Jer. 15:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>48</sup> The religionists of “Christendom” have made an alliance with the commercial traffickers and professional politicians and all other elements of Satan’s seed, and look to such for help; but her allies or helpers will fail her and “Christendom” will say: “My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away.” (Job 6:15) The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and her co-religionists constitute ‘the house of lies and deceit’, and that wicked organization hides her crookedness behind such deceit and lies and depends upon the same for protection and strength. That hypocritical organization says, as God’s prophet foretold she would say: “We have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.” But the Lord declares that such refuge of lies he will completely destroy. The reason is, Jehovah declares that he will sweep away the refuge of lies and expose the wickedness of those religious organizations and completely destroy the same, and the religion mongers also. (Isa. 28:15-21) For a long while now the religionists have tried to make themselves popular with their allies, the commercial traffickers and politicians, by howling long and loud in defense of the present world powers, and declaring themselves as the supporters of these world powers. Thus they have shown themselves, as the Scriptures declare, as the open enemies of God; and being God’s enemies, they shall, together with all other enemies, suffer complete destruction.—Jas. 4: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>48</sup> Those who love and serve Jehovah are now being permitted to see the light shining upon the prophecies of Jehovah, by means of which they are given an understanding of God’s purposes to complete!} destroy the religious organizations and the men who use them to carry on their cruel racket, and to also destroy all other elements of Satan’s organization: and that such destruction is near at hand. The revealing of these truths to his witnesses in this day of Jehovah lays upon the consecrated and anointed ones a far greater obligation than they have heretofore had or seen. What is Jehovah’s purpose in now permitting his people to have an understanding of his prophecies? Manifestly his chief purpose is that his people, whom he has taken out of the world for his name, may see and understand their great privilege of bearing his name and exhibiting the same before the people and telling the people of God’s purpose before Jehovah’s great power is executed against the enemy. Never before has there been given to creatures such a privilege, and it clearly appears that there never again will be another such opportunity to bear witness to the name of Jehovah God. Long ago Jehovah appointed Christ Jesus the heir of all things; and the time is at hand for Christ Jesus to take possession of all things, and the time is also at hand for these great truths to be made known to the world, and particularly to those of good-will, that they may seek a place of refuge and safety. As the examination of this prophecy continues it will be seen that by his prophet Micah God foretells the taking possession of all things by the Lord Jesus Christ, and what shall follow. The greatest crisis of all time is here, and it behooves everyone that would live to acquaint himself with the present-day truths and hasten to obey the Lord, the rightful King of the world, who is now present and moving into possession of his inheritance. These truths </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">endeavors to publish in harmony with God’s will, and the privilege and obligation is laid upon all the Jonadabs, as well as upon the remnant, to study the prophecies, that they may be equipped to perform the part assigned to them in Jehovah’s great arrangement. These great truths Jehovah has hidden in his Word until his due time to vindicate his name; and that time is now here. It behooves all, therefore, who would live, to avail themselves of the opportunity of knowing Jehovah God and his purpose, and to sing forth the praises of his King and of his Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath.—Ileb. 6:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Men who have pledged themselves to serve Jehovah God have divided themselves into two classes: some have departed from that covenant, while others have been faithful. The failure of some, in turning away from their covenant, has in no wise altered His announced purpose. Having purposed it, he will do it. There cannot be the slightest doubt about the result in the mind of one who loves Jehovah, and for the comfort and assurance of his faithful servants Jehovah supports his word by his unbreakable oath. From Abel to the last of God’s holy prophets there were faithful men on the earth who not only believed in The Theocracy but staked their all on it and gladly suffered martyrdom rather than to yield to the enemy’s power, and thus they maintained integrity to God.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he hath chosen.—Ps. 33:12, Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Set over in contrast with the wicked are those who have covenanted to do God’s will and who faithfullj' and steadfastly abide by that agreement and carry out their covenant. The destiny for such is life everlasting in peace, joy and glory forever in the presence of the Most High. That “blessed nation” is the nation of which Christ Jesus is the Head, and including all who are made members of God's capital organization under Christ. Now God’s time has come when he, by Christ Jesus, is gathering to himself his “other sheep”. These should be enlightened concerning what is required of all who undertake to be servants of God and Christ. What God has caused to be written in his Word of and concerning others that have gone before serves to furnish a guide to those who are now seeking the way of faithful service and everlasting life.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">—John 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Man is given the choice of believing on the Lord Jesus Christ, if he would live and not perish. It follows, therefore, if he does not believe he will perish. Man was already subject to death by reason of inheriting the result of Adam’s violation of God's law, and now Jehovah was giving man an opportunity to choose to extricate himself from death by taking the side of the Lord Jesus Christ. If a man does not choose to take that step, then what? “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.” (Vs. 36) This is in harmony with the statement of the divine rule announced by Moses, in which Jehovah set before the Israelites life or death and permitted them to choose their way.—Deut. 30:19.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates Awake, aivake, Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song: Arise, Barak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">—Judg. 5:11,12,</span><span class="font2"> Am. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rev</span><span class="font2"> 1'cr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Four times the word “awake” is uttered. It was a call from Jehovah to his servants then to awake and stir themselves unto active service and praise of IIis name It was a fourfold call to awake, hence a full and complete call. The prophecy here foretells the call of Jehovah to his organization on earth (“Deborah”) at the coming of Christ Jesus (“Barak”) to awake and arise to activity and to advertise his name and his kingdom. This he does just preceding the time when he exercises his supreme power against Satan and his entire organization. Those of Jehovah’s organization must obey his commandment to immediately and actively participate in declaring the name of Jehovah in singing his praises, and declaring his judgment already written against those who are opposed to him and to his kingdom.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I delight to do thy will, 0 my God; yea, thy law is within my heart.—Ps. 40: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Because of his full and complete obedience unto his Father under the most trying conditions Jesus was given life immortal, the highest place in the universe next to Jehovah, and the administration of Jehovah’s will (Phil. 2:8-11) Because of his complete obedience Christ Jesus is made the Author of eternal salvation to all that obey him. (Heb 5: 8, 9) It is of the greatest importance to know these facts, if one would live. All humankind were born in sin because of the sin committed by Adam, and therefore all of his children inherited death. God has provided redemption and salvation of men from death by and through the sacrifice of the man Jesus unto death God therefore provides the gift of life to all men who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as the Savior and who then covenant to be obedient to the laws of God and hence obedient to Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.—Ps. 34:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah beholds the righteous in distress, hears their cry for help, and delivers them. He deals exactly </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font2"> an opposite manner with the wicked, and the memory of them shall perish from the earth. As all are born in sin by reason of the disobedience of the first man, a man becomes righteous only by faith in Jehovah and in Christ Jesus’ shed blood as his redemptive price, and by full consecration and obedience to God and Christ. Before man can be made righteous he must show’ his faith in God and in Christ Jesus by willingly making a covenant to do the will of the Most High, and then he must maintain his righteousness which he has received through Christ Jesus by faithfully performing the terms of that covenant. He must be entirely for Jehovah and his kingdom and not compromise with the enemy. IV </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.—Gen. 6: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Perfect” is defined by the best Biblical authorities as “blameless, sound, sincere, undcfiled and upright, one of integrity and a bearer of the truth”. Noah was a man of faith, and he was faithfully obedient to God. He ascertained God’s commandment and rendered himself in obedience thereto. It follows, therefore, that every’ other who may expect and hope to receive God’s approval must be just, sincere, pure in thought and action, a bearer of the truth, and one who maintains his integrity toward God. He must have faith in God and be faithfully obedient to God’s will or commandment. Noah was a “preacher of righteousness” at a time when the earth was filled with violence. Undoubtedly he maintained his integrity toward God under great adversity and shunned not to declare the truth under all circumstances, which truth he received from God.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">His secret is with the righteous.—Prov. 3:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The purpose of Jehovah is a secret to sinful men. Since each announced purpose of Jehovah is a secret, his covenant is a secret to all against The Theocracy. What, then, is required of man before he can be taken into covenant with Jehovah’’ He must fear God. He must have knowledge that the Almighty God is Jehovah, the Creator, the Fountain of life, and the only Giver of life everlasting He then recognizes Jehovah as the all-powerful One who is just and righteous and entirely unselfish. Believing that all blessings flow from Almighty God, the creature man fears to take any course that would cause him to miss the blessings God gives. He believes that disobedience to God would cause him to lose God’s favor, and fears lest he might not receive God’s favor. He desires to be taught of God, that he may’ go in the right way.

<p><span class="font2">Why have so many creatures failed? There has been one chief besetting sin that has caused failure, and that besetting sin is demonism, otherwise ealled “religion”. It was that close-girdling sin, religion, concerning which the apostle wrote to those who had made a covenant to be faithful servants and witnesses of Jehovah: ‘Let us lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily besets us ’ God's people today have all the wealth of his revealed Word and the record of faithful men who have gone before and who proved their integrity tow’ard God, together now with an abundance of physical facts which have come to pass in fulfillment of God’s prophecies, to uphold and strengthen them and to fully fortify them against all opposition and violence heaped upon them by the enemies of The Theocracy.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Lord preserveth the faithful.—Ps. 31:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are those who have made a covenant to do God’s will and who later, because of fear of man. and particularly’ of those who rule, have declined to take any part in His “strange work” and have withdrawn themselves from activity. Such fearful and negligent ones will not receive any protection and blessing from the Lord. The faithful and obedient ones, who do not fear men but who fear God and joyfully obey his commandments, will receive protection and blessings from the Lord Jehovah and his King. The faithful “remnant” and their true “companions”, the Lord’s “other sheep”, now read the prophecies and their explanations which God has provided, and, so doing, they rejoice that the evidence is clear that the day’ of deliverance from oppression is near at hand and the day’ of vindication of Jehovah’s name will be the result.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life.—Prov. 6: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The person who desires God’s approval must be guided aright. The Bible, which contains God’s Word, is true and is the correct guide: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” (Ps. 119:105) The Bible guides sincere persons to desire and pray’ for the most important things that may result to their welfare. God has put such prayers into the mouth of his sincere servants, and one of these prayers is this: “Shew me thy ways, 0 Lord , teach me thy paths. Lead me in thy truth, and teach me” (Ps 25:4,5) The sure and unfailing promises of God to such sincere seekers for truth arc certain, and God will fulfill those promises. He who would be wise in things that are right seeks pure knowledge, such as is contained in the Bible: “Wise men lay up knowledge.”—Prov. 10:14 IV </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathercth not with me scattercth—Luke 11:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A man may be ignorantly against The Theocracy and the King thereof, but when he is enlightened he must quickly turn about and take the right course, and, doing so, he will be forgiven. When a man learns of Jehovah and his gracious goodness manifested through Christ Jesus and then treats that great truth with indifference or with willfulness, his wrong course is not forgivable. He thus sins auamst light or against the holy spirit, which is light The blood of Christ Jesus is the price that purchased mankind, and is not a common thing. Therefore when a man sees and understands that his hope of life is by faith and obedience unto Jehovah God and Christ and he then spurns or disregards that favor, the wrath of God remains upon him and his end is with all others of the wicked class.

<p><span class="font2">The people in Noah’s day heard the sound of his voice warning of the coming flood, but they gave no heed to that warning. They knew Noah was building the great boat, which was a testimony of his faith in God, but the people who saw it regarded it as of no importance. Noah’s work and testimony were so important in the carrying out of Jehovah’s purposes that God used him to foretell what must come to pass at the time of setting up the Kingdom. The ark which Noah built at Jehovah’s command pictured the organization built by the Host High through Christ Jesus and which is God's capital organization with Christ Jesus as Head. Carrying the eight persons over the flood pictured the survivors of Armageddon that God will carry over to the new world. IV </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Who will hear, give heed, understand, and choose the way of life </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font2"> Jehovah's answer is: “The wise shall understand.” God's Word shows that there are two classes now on the earth: (1) those who will be wise and shall find the way to righteousness and life; and (2), the other class, which continues in wickedness, darkness and religion, and remains under condemnation and suffers eternal death. The present is “the time of the end”, that is, the end of Satan’s uninterrupted rule. Such is the due time for those who are wise to understand Jehovah’s purpose and take the course that leads to life everlasting. Now is the due time when those who shall form the &quot;great multitude” must hear and choose wisely, and will understand. For this reason the Lord causes the message of The Theocracy to be sounded.

<p><span class="font2">Centuries ago Jehovah announced his purpose to create and set up a paternalistic government, to be presided oier by his beloved Son. That government is the great Theocracy, by which Christ Jesus exercises a paternal care over the interests of the people that shall live on the earth. lie is the King and the Father of them that obey him, and they, as his children, will address Christ Jesus as “Father&quot;. Jehovah God is the King of Eternity, and the fountain of life None can get life contrary to his will. Jehovah has delegated to his beloved Son, the King, full authority to administer life to those who shall receive life everlasting.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Integrity</span><span class="font2"> means “innocence, blamelessness, that is, without fault”. Job stood for Jehovah and his promised Kingdom. Job held fast his integrity, and therefore was blameless before God. Was he blameless because he was perfect in organism and had the right to life? No; he was the offspring of Adam and hence under condemnation. His integrity, or blamelessness, consisted in the fact that he refused to be moved from his steadfast devotion to God and his coming Kingdom by the Messiah. Job would suffer all things rather than be unfaithful to The Theocracy. Job’s integrity foretells that those whom he pictured must be immovabh devoted to the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, and that regardless of what the enemy is permitted to inflict upon them. They must remain faithful, true and wholly devoted thereto. In no other way could they be blameless before God. IT </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/41</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Due to the uncertain and disrupted conditions on earth over which we have no control the information for the compilation of a report of the work world-wide for the service year 1940-1941 is belated. Hence the production of the 1942 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font2"> has been unavoidably held up. Announcement of its publication will be made shortly, and which report, we believe, will be well worth waiting for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1942 CALENDAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The text chosen for the year 1942, to wit, “Blameless in the day of our Lord” (1 Cor 1:8), provides the theme for a calendar picture which is most befitting these days of decision Highly artistic and novel, the picture clearly and eloquently sets out the choice God’s covenant people must make concerning the great issue of world domination Beneath is a neat calendar pad, indicating the line of activity of Jehovah’s blameless ones for each month of 1942, naming the special Testimony Periods and also the special endeavors to be made during the intervening months. The contribution for this service calendar is 25c each, or $1 00 for 5 copies mailed together to one address. Companies should send in combination orders, with remittance to cover, through their local company servant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TAKING THEIR STAND IN NEW MEXICO</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Another magazine publisher and I called at each room in an Albuquerque hotel, assisted by the bellboy, who told us when the people in the different rooms would be in. Completing the rooms, we proceeded to the lobby to offer the magazines there. One man refused </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> saying that it was against the government and we were conscientious objectors and should all be in concentration camps and that’s where we would be soon. The hotel manager, having overheard the conversation, said he was glad to contribute for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> as he knew something about us, that he knew our organization was the first that had been stopped in Germany. The man who had refused </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> overhearing the hotel manager, had nothing more to say. In an apartment house, my knock caused two adjacent doors to be opened at the same time. The clergyman answering one door said: 'Don’t go in there: that woman’s mind is unbalanced.’ The lady at the door where I knocked stepped out and said: ‘Young man, how dare you tell anyone not to come into my house with a phonograph. I will have the law put you out.’ Then to me she said: ‘Come right in and play the record.’ At its conclusion she remarked how well she appreciated it, inviting me to call back again. She expressed shame that her preacher-neighbor had ordered me away, saying she knew he sold dope and that she would make it necessary for him to move away. Around the block, a young lady of about 25 answered the door and invited me to play the record. Inside, the landlord Catholic priest quickly rose from his chair and said: ‘No, you don’t want to hear that—it is against us Catholics’ (waving his arms in rage). The girl said: 'Yes, I want to hear it.’ He said: ‘No, if you listen to that you arc not a true Catholic.’ She: ‘You can’t give me life, and I want life.’ The priest then addressed me: 'You can't play that in my house.’ I then showed her </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font2"> (with one of the conspirators glaring at me, white with anger). Said the lady • ‘Yes, I want that, he can’t keep me from reading it, and you people call again when he is not in.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">IN BOMB-SCARRED LIVERPOOL</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot;One Saturday morning I called upon a lady. After explaining to her the message on my Testimony card, she decided to take the booklets </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees.</span><span class="font2"> I called back to see how she enjoyed them, and she told me she started to read them the same night, when she was alone, owing to her husband’s working as a bus conductor until midnight, as it was his turn to work late duty. This lady lives in Kensington, a suburb of Liverpool, and this particular night was the worst they had ever had for air raids. Strange to say, she never heard the air-raid warning, neither did she hear the noise of exploding bombs, and was quite surprised when her husband came and told her what a terrible night it had been. I started a model study of the Bible with her, which she greatly enjoys, and she has subscribed for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> She now comes out on the work when she can, and also attends the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">study. She is full of questions when I go. Her husband also reads the publication. She says the truth is marvelous, and she realizes that religion has become political and commercial. What comfort those first two booklets gave!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">UNDER THE SAME CARETAKER</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“A publisher (Bergen, N.J.) brings Mrs. H---- </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> every week, and learns that she has a crippled sister in Leicester, England, from whom she has not heard recently. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> she reads of bombing raids on Leicester, and wonders about her sister, and writes, mentioning the article in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> and that it is the first she has heard of the raids. A lovely calm letter returns from the sister, assuring Mrs. H that she is all right and not mentioning the bombing raids at all, but rather that two lovely Jehovah witnesses sisters call on her regularly and bring her great comfort—and now hold a study in her home each week. P. S. Mrs. H sees the Lord’s care over her sister all the time </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">she</span><span class="font2"> has been anxious about her, and now Mrs. H is a Jehovah’s witness herself'.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">IF YOUR MAGAZINE ACCOUNT IS GOOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“While engaged in street-witnessing work with the magazines, at Tucson, Arizona, five of us, all pioneers but one, were arrested for ‘peddling without a license’. We were thrown into a filthy jail, full of drunks because this was the week-end, and all night long the place was a madhouse. Fighting and cursing went on till Sunday morning. However, when most of these sobered up, they were of good-will, and resented the injustice done to us, and they gladly received the message of God’s kingdom. One prisoner, being held for burglary in several states, reminded us many times to send him literature when he goes up to serve eight years in prison. Another Mexican, who had been fighting all night, asked questions all the next day, and he promised to come to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> studies when released. (He came to our house the other day and took the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children.) </span><span class="font2">We were in jail five days and found many ‘sheep’ who recognized our message as the truth. One army boy, arrested for stealing an auto while drunk, told us when he sobered up that he came from St. Louis, Mo. On being asked if he remembered the Theocratic convention of Jehovah’s witnesses, he immediately answered: ‘Oh, sure, I went to hear Judge Rutherford, “one of the boys.” I’ve been to some </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> meetings, and they’re the best I’ve ever been to.’ Many other prisoners eagerly ate up all we had to tell them. When we were finally released on bail, immediately we made preparations for Saturday’s magazine work We printed stickers entitled ‘Free Sample’ to be placed on our magazine bags. Also all the back-date magazines we could get hold of were stamped ‘Free sample copy’ (we had been arrested following the State Supreme Court decision that receiving a contribution for literature was selling). Several hours were set aside that Saturday for street distribution, and by the end of the first hour we had placed, by the Lord’s grace, 300 magazines. By evening we placed the grand total of 787 magazines. These were placed in the hands of many people of good-will for the reason that the ‘goats’ refused to take them, even though they were free. The police could find no excuse to interfere, and a great many people said they saw no reason for arresting us in sueh a wonderful work. Thus was shown again to the Lord’s people how Satan’s plots backfire and work to the interest of Jehovah’s Theocracy.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God's law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are bom sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH'S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it Is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God's kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord's next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to ‘‘fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Rejoice not against me, 0 mine enemy: when I fall be a light unto</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TEHOVAH turns the tables upon his own enemies I and hence upon the enemies of those who worthily </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font6"> bear his name. The great enemy rebelled against Jehovah God, and challenged His power, and put the question of universal domination in dispute. Turning perfect man in Eden into like rebellion against the great Theocratic Ruler, Satan, whose name means “opposer”, began building his organization of rebel creatures, and man became involved in with the issue of domination of the universe. The great opposer also drew many angels into the rebellion. With them he built up his invisible part of the organization under himself as their prince and god. To confuse and deceive creatures Satan called his organization “Babil”, or “Babylon”, meaning “gate of god”, that is, the mimic god, who enviously says: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be like the Most High.” (Isa. 14:14) From its very beginning the organization Babylon was under Satan, its lord and master, and has been the enemy of Jehovah’s faithful creatures. For a full and time-tested proof of the great issue God Almighty has permitted Satan and his organization visible and invisible to remain till the final showdown of opposing strengths, Jehovah’s strength against and over that of the combined enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> The closing chapter of Micah’s prophecy points to the proof that the showdown matching of power is very near. Those who stand in awe and fear of the vast strength and power of Babylon, Satan’s organization, and who therefore worship and serve it and who now proudly ask, Who is like this creature? and who can fight against it? are in for the strangest surprise. (Rev. 13:4) At various times in the past God has permitted the enemy organization to apparently triumph over his covenant people upon whom his name is called. This he has allowed for a test of the integrity and devotion to him of his name-people, and also that the hypocritical enemy might have opportunity to cast aside their cloak of religion and show what is in their hearts and expose themselves as hating Jehovah God and his Christ</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">and his servants and witnesses. On this wise the enemy mark themselves as servants of the Devil and fit for destruction when Jehovah shows his power over Satan and over Babylon at the battle of Armageddon.—Ex. 9:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ The most recent seeming triumph of the enemy organization over Jehovah’s servants was during the first world war, 1914-1918. At the instigation of the religionists of great “Babylon” the enemy made a vicious and unwarranted assault upon the faithful worshipers of Jehovah and publishers of his kingdom under Christ. It looked like the finish of them and their work, as prophetically expressed in Micah’s words, chapter seven, verses one to four. For a time the enemy were on top. Then the Lord turned the tables on them; and his prophet comments: “The day of thy watchmen [religionists] and thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.” (Mic. 7: 4) This visitation is from the Lord God. It began when he sent his great Messenger, Christ Jesus, for judgment. (Mal. 3:1-4) It is not a visitation of favor from God, but of his contrary judgment, which “judgment written” is first declared by his witnesses as process-servers and thereafter executed upon the doomed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘ The rulers and the people have made the clergy the watchmen over their spiritual interests. Such watchmen, being not of God’s appointment, have failed to see the sword of judgment about to fall at Armageddon and have not warned the people. Like the priests of the city of Anathoth, near Jerusalem, who objected to the prophet Jeremiah’s preaching of destruction coming upon the religious organization, so the modern-day “watchmen” oppose the proclamation by Jehovah’s witnesses of the “day of vengeance of our God”. “Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy.” (Mic. 2:6) To the watchmen of “Christendom” those who proclaim God’s judgments reply in the words of Jeremiah: “0 Lord of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause. Therefore thus saith the Lord of the men of Anathoth [religious clergy] that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the Lord, that thou die not by our hand: therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, I will punish them; the young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine; and there shall be no remnant of them, for I will bring evil [disaster] upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.”— Jer. 11:20-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>s</sup> “Now shall be their perplexity.” Jesus confirmed that statement of Micah. He prophesied that one of the unmistakable proofs that we are in the “time of the end” of Satan’s organization Babylon would be what is seen by all since the first world war: “upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity.” (Luke 21: 25) True, the nations are in great perplexity over the failure of their schemes for world order, peace and prosperity; but the thing chiefly meant by the prophecy is their perplexity at the turning of the tables. This God did by reviving his devoted remnant of witnesses whom the enemy organization had thought they had finished off in 1918. God sent them forth thereafter to declare the establishment of his Kingdom and also his judgment message against the nations that hate and forget God. Jehovah’s judgment message of doom upon Babylon appears before their vision and perplexes them, like King Belshazzar of typical Babylon, when he saw the hand from the Lord that “wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king’s palace . . . MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.” “Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.” (Dan. 5: 5-9, 25-28) Jehovah God uses his faithful ones like Daniel to make known to the perplexed nations the Lord God’s own interpretation of the modern handwriting on the wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> The religious rulers and their congregations in “Christendom” stumbled over The Stone in Zion, to wit. Christ Jesus, whom Jehovah enthroned as Rightful Ruler of the world in 1914. Jehovah’s refusal on that account to answer their prayers for peace and plenty and, besides that, the increasing bold proclamation by his witnesses of his vengeance to be executed at Armageddon fill the religionists with perplexity and dismay at this “evident token of perdition” for them. (Isa. 8:14,15; Rom. 9:32,33; Phil. 1: 28) The perplexity of the situation is increased for them because the remnant and their companions, obedient to God’s command, will not be bulldozed by official threats into silence, but keep on coming continually and always stronger, and the enemy refuse to recognize God’s commission and command to these his witnesses. Only by using totalitarian methods to suppress the preachers of God’s kingdom and vengeance do they feel that they shall solve their perplexity and at length be able to cry “Peace and safety!” (1 Thess. 5:3) Then Jehovah will turn the tables on them, to stay turned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BETRAYAL OF CONFIDENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">* The Lord’s servants are in the world or enemy’s country, but are not of it, and hence are surrounded with spying enemies, scheming damage to the things of Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. The interests of that righteous government or kingdom have been committed to God's “faithful and wise servant”, his devoted remnant under Christ Jesus their Head. (Matt. 24:45-47) This is a position of great trust, and they must anxiously safeguard those “goods” or Kingdom interests against the destructive enemy; for they must give account to Jehovah God and his King. “For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.” (Rom. 14:4,10) The enemy are everywhere about and use “fifth column” ways to get in among or next to those having a trust from God and to spy and gather information to use against Jehovah’s organization. This is true now, and it was true during those perilous times of the assault on Jehovah’s covenant people at the climax of the first world war. Concerning the safe and proper course then Jehovah by his prophet says to them: “Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.” —Mic. 7:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">•Jehovah God is the real Friend, who loves his tried and tested ones all the time; and Christ Jesus likewise proved his friendship by laying down his life for God’s friends. (Prov. 17:17; 18:24; John 15:12,13) There are, however, those who claim to be friends of God, and hence friends of His people, but are false. They commit spiritual adultery with the world, and so make themselves the enemies of God. Such are like the three apparent friends who got next to Job and plagued him with their presence, adding to his torments by their false accusations against his innocence and blamelessness, and they endeavored to make him curse God and break his integrity toward Jehovah. Such untrustworthy friends include the religious clergy, who stirred up the persecution and arrests during the World War; also the “elective elders” of the congregations who would rule as bosses; and the “evil servant” class who were in line for the “kingdom of heaven” but who prove slothful and unfaithful toward the Kingdom interests and smite the faithful brethren and seek honors, protection and favors from the worldly powers. (Job 2:11; 16: 20; 19:14,19, 21) Those who love and care for the Lord’s interests may not trust such ones with any information. The record shows they have betrayed their brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ Religion is a snare that traps one into disobedience to God. Those who practice or act as leaders in religion are not safe guides, but blind guides leading the blind. Back there they used their influence -with the rulers to stop the witness work, and they have not repented of this course, and are not guides in whom to put confidence. The pope puts out feelers now in this world crisis to act as the spiritual guide of the world. The clergy of other religions call him a “good neighbor” and follow his lead; but those with eyes opened by the enlightening Word of God see that that ruler of Vatican City continues to guide his dupes direct toward the ditch of destruction.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> God’s Word states the wise rule: “I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.” (Ps. 39:1) That the greatest caution must be taken, the prophet emphasizes: “Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.” That refers to anyone who is in a close and tender relationship, like that of a wife. Suchlike make loud professions of love for the creature from whom they hope to wheedle out information; but they do not keep God’s commandments or do his witness work, thereby showing love for the creature rather than for God. “For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.” (Rom. 16:17,18) Such ones are like Ezekiel’s wife, for whom Ezekiel was commanded to make no signs of mourning when she was cut off from life by God’s judgment executed against her. (Ezek. 24:15-25) Further such ones are like Delilah, the Philistine woman whom Samson loved and whose lap she let him make his pillow. This intimacy she encouraged in order to learn the secret of his strength and cripple him for the war against religion. (Judg. 16: 4-21) God’s Word warns to leave such ones, who profess to be His people, and “go from them”. Why? “For they be all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men. And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies; but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth: for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the Lord. Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders. And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity. Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the Lord.”—Jer. 9:2-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> In these final days even more so than in 1918, and now when “evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived” (2 Tim. 3:13), each one who really loves God and The Theocracy will carefully and constantly safeguard the interests of God’s work and of his brethren who are “labourers together with God”. (1 Cor. 3:9; 2 Cor. 6:1) A slip by one betraying vital information to the enemy not merely affects the careless, loose-speeched one, but also endangers the organization. Let not your tongue bring you within or under the power of any agent of Satan and his demons. For aid, comfort and heart-to-heart fellowship do not rely on any human relationships and companionships, but lean wholly upon Jehovah and Christ, showing devotion to them wholly independent of any earthly creature. Look to Jehovah through our “advocate with the Father”, who is Christ Jesus, and have intimacy and fellowship with his faithful organization, Zion. Human affection between creatures, which is generally passion according to the flesh, is no basis for one to place confidence respecting the Lord’s Kingdom interests in another earthly creature not in covenant with Him and not meeting his requirements. This was proved by many examples during the days of 1914-1918, as especially foreshadowed by Delilah when she betrayed Samson into the hands of the enemies of the typical Theocracy. Concerning that dangerous situation the prophecy correctly says:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">” “For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughterin-law against her mother-in-law; a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.” (Mic. 7; 6) Having no love or fear of Jehovah or devotion to The Theocratic Government, they do not consider close earthly relationship as obligating them to protect the confidence of relatives serving Almighty God. This serious warning is repeated by Christ Jesus, and he applies it specifically to the end of Satan’s uninterrupted rule and the coming of the Lord to his temple. “Blessed are those servants, whom the lord, when he cometh, shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them. . . . Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division: for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.” (Luke 12:37-53) &quot;And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death. And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake; but he that endureth to the end shall be saved. . . . And a man’s foes shall be they of his own household. He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me.” (Matt. 10: 21, 22, 34-37) Concerning the false spiritual brethren, not to speak of earthly relationships, at the end of Satan’s world, Jesus further prophesied: “And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.” (Matt. 24:10) Such traitors to the greatest, most glorious cause in the universe, and just at the time when it is about to triumph over all foes, the Lord Jesus by his angels clears out of God’s sanctuary. However, the demons are now more active than ever and the “evil servant” class and other religionists are still hanging around with malicious designs against the interests of The Theocracy. Hence none of those who shall prove faithful unto the final end will relax their vigilance against the subtle enemy. Creaturelove will not entice them into carelessness. They will love Jehovah God with all they have.—Matt. 26:41; Deut. 6:4,5; 1 John 5:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1J</sup> All those in covenant relationship with Jehovah today must see to it that the proper information is meted out to their fellow-workers of The Theocracy at the proper time. We must have faith in our brethren who have shown their steadfastness and their faith by their works. Lines of communication have been cut off to many parts of the earth, but the meat in due season and the organization instructions do get through eventually. When these instructions are received the information contained therein should go to those of The Theocracy, and not to persons who have not proved their devotion to the Lord by their service. The Lord has committed unto the faithful servants the interests of his kingdom, and when these interests of the Kingdom fall into your hand for their advancement, use wisdom in the dissemination of these truths and instructions. Trust your faithful brethren. You that receive the information, be sure that you ‘sin not with your tongue’ in disseminating it to others, and, above all, ‘keep your mouth with a bridle when the wicked are before you.’ (See Philippians 2: 19-22.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” “Therefore I will look unto the Lord [(Am. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> But as for me, in Jehovah will I keep watch </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">{margin)]</span><span class="font6"> ; I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me.” (Mic. 7: 7) Thus, human relationships proving untrustworthy, and human agencies of relief proving to be under demon control, the faithful remnant in 1918 were obliged to look unto Jehovah and keep watching his leadings. They must continue to do so at present and until Armageddon clears out all traitors and false friends of the world. Jehovah never betrays the confidence and trust of those who rely on him. To look unto and keep watching him, however, does not mean to let our powers and faculties lie idle and unused. It means to keep on fighting for The Theocracy and for our right and liberty to proclaim that Government. It means to use all the legal means still at our disposal for the gaining of and defense of freedom of worship. But, over and above the legal provisions or qualifications, it means always to ask for and be guided by and to use the ‘wisdom which cometh down from above’ and which the Lord God gives liberally to all his covenant people that ask for it in faith. (Acts 25:9-11; Jas. 3:17; 1:5, 6) He will then direct the issue or way of escape.—1 Cor. 10:13, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott </span><span class="font6">translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ “Salvation belongeth unto [Jehovah]” (Ps. 3:8), and the faithful remnant were made to know that He is “the God of my salvation”. To test out the faithfulness of his covenant people under the discipline of persecution and deprivation of liberty Jehovah has often seemingly delayed, but never really so, the deliverance of his people from the enemy’s restraining power. The test is whether they will ‘go down to Egypt for help’ and compromise with the enemy to secure a release, or relief, or a permit to witness, or immunity from violent attacks. The ones keeping their proper relationship to the Lord make no deals with the enemy, but continue to keep trust with and to obey God. Then their deliverance, when it comes, will be the Lord’s salvation and will prove Jehovah’s promise true. Keeping on working to the full use of all circumstances about them, they can afford to wait for his salvation, fully assured that it will come. Meantime they continue their fervent prayers to the great Savior, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ “My God will hear me.” This shows that the devoted remnant were praying to Him during the affliction. The situation for them looked hopeless outwardly, and the enemy’s triumph looked complete; but Jehovah God heard the prayer of his afflicted ones. Their petition was not selfish, but that the reproach upon God’s name and cause might be removed. They prayed, not for peace between “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” then at war, but that the way might be opened for the Lord’s witness work to go on and that all obstacles and restrictions might be surmounted and overcome, and that they might prove their sincerity and love toward God and his kingdom by having a part in that further service for the honor of his name. Such prayer the Lord noted and answered. “From heaven did the Lord behold the earth; to hear the groaning of the prisoner [in antitypical Babylon], to loose those that are appointed to death; to declare the name of the Lord in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem.” (Ps. 102:19-21) “The Lord looseth the prisoners.” (Ps. 146:7) Their prayer was: “Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.”—Ps. 142: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” Jehovah sent his executioner, King Cyrus, against ancient Babylon to deliver His faithful remnant from its power and send them back to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple on Zion. In A.D. 1918 he sent the Greater Cyrus, Christ Jesus, to the temple for judgment. Thereafter he stopped the World War with the release of his chosen or elect remnant in view. By thus cutting the time of tribulation in the middle, which tribulation began on Satan’s organization in 1914 and which must and will be renewed by the Lord at Armageddon, Jehovah God shortened “those days” of tribulation. “And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he hath chosen, he hath shortened the days.” (Mark 13:20; Matt. 24: 22) In this present interim before Armageddon the faithful remnant, joined now by a multitude of joyful companions, offer themselves as “willing volunteers” for the work which must be fullv carried out to its completion before that battle. —Ps. 110:3.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> God’s organization Zion, speaking for the afflicted remnant thereof in 1918, said to Babylon, the great rival organization, which was holding the fallen remnant in captivity: “Bejoice not against me, 0 mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me.” (Mic. 7:8) “Enemy” here is in the female gender in the Hebrew, showing that it applies to Satan’s “woman”, his organization Babylon, which brings forth the 'seed of the Serpent’. (Gen. 3:15) At verse 10 Micah further identifies the enemy as Babylon, saying: “Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>19</sup> On earth is the visible part of “Babylon”, foremost in which are the nations calling themselves “Christian”. “Christendom” is nothing else, however, than a modernizing of ancient demon-worshiping Babylon, and operating under the cloak of religion deceivingly called “Christian religion”. In 1918 it was the religionists that particularly rejoiced, the “man of sin” company. Such were foreshadowed by Edom (Idumea) and Mount Seir, who rejoiced at the fall of God’s typical covenant people into the power of typical Babylon: “As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, 0 mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it; and they shall know that I am the Lord [Jehovah].” (Ezek. 35:15) ‘Tn the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them. But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of [their] distress.” (Obad. 11,12) Revelation 11:10 further pictures the malicious glee of the religionists at their stopping the work of Jehovah’s “two witnesses” in 1918: “And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>50</sup> “When I fall, I shall arise.” The remnant of Zion did not fall away from Jehovah and his organization, neither was their falling due to stumbling over Christ Jesus reigning as King from 1914 on. On the contrary, He is “the stone of stumbling” over which “Christendom” stumbles to her destruction. (Isa. 8:14,15; Rom. 9 : 32,33) God’s consecrated ones were overwhelmed by the enemy and fell into their power and were forcibly restrained, the religionists making false accusation and using the disturbed world conditions as a subterfuge to stop the “Elijah work” of Jehovah’s servants. There the modern Philistines sheared the Samson class of their locks and weakened their strength to serve God boldly and freely. But Samson’s locks grew again and he rose again in Jehovah’s service to his greatest exploit against religion. Likewise by devoting themselves to keeping of the covenant-obligations upon their heads, as symbolized by Samson’s regrown hair, and by being blinded to all else than God’s “strange work” against religion, the faithful remnant arose, in the strength of Christ their Head. Jehovah delivered them from restraint, particularly the restraint due to fear of men and fear of worldly ruling organizations, and he commanded them to arise to his service, the “Elisha work”, with courage and boldness.— Judg. 16:22-30.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>81</sup> Concerning this the prophetic Word of God says: “The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord; and he delighteth in his way. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.” (Ps. 37: 23, 24) “The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.” (Ps. 145:14) True repentance is not shown by keeping lying idly on the ground and mourning over sins for which the Lord’s forgiveness has been asked and assured. It is shown by getting up, taking the course marked out by the Lord, and busying oneself in the one thing of doing His work. “Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.” (Isa. 52: 2) &quot;Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.” (Isa. 60:1,2) ‘Tor a just man falleth seven times [a complete number of times down till the end of the enemy’s power], and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief. Rejoice not [0 enemy Babylon] when thine enemy [the hated remnant] falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth; lest the Lord see it, and it displease him, and he turn aw<sup>r</sup>ay his wrath [his discipline, chastening] from him [as Jehovah did toward the remnant in 1918].” (Prov. 24:16-18) The seventh and last fall of Jehovah’s “just” ones will be when the witness work of his remnant and their companions shall shortly be closed down in every land on earth and the enemy jubilantly begin to cry “Peace and safety!” Then, suddenly, the wicked enemy shall themselves fall into the “mischief’ that the Lord prepares for them, his “strange act” at Armageddon. Then the faithful remnant and the Lord’s “other sheep” shall arise, never to be downed again; and the great enemy organization, Babylon, shall fall, never to rise again. (Rev. 18:21) The tables will be turned upon her by the Lord.—Ezek. 11: 2-7; Esther 7:10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> Further describing the Lord’s deliverance of his remnant from and after 1918 Jehovah’s witness Micah says: “When I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto me.” The darkness is that into which the enemy organization casts Jehovah’s servants, the gloomy condition of captivity and restraint, such as Samson experienced in the Philistine dungeon. During their dark experience and condition in enemy hands at the time of the Lord’s coming to the temple the consecrated ones are described as “such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron”. (Ps. 107:10) For the time also there was darkness in their minds as to the understanding of why God’s enemies should be permitted apparently to triumph over them while honestly and diligently seeking to do his will. (Hab. 1:13-17) Hence those in covenant relationship with the Lord prayed: “Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.”—Ps. 74: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>25</sup> “God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.” (1 John 1:5) His covenant people had yielded to fear of men and were guilty of iniquity of lip in failing to ‘offer the calves of their lips' in the sacrifice of praise to God and to his kingdom. (Heb. 13:15; Hos. 14:2) In God’s displeasure and for their chastisement he had permitted them to fall under the enemy organization Babylon. Now noting their repentance of heart and their prayerful resolves to serve him if given further privileges, and noting also their unbreakable cleaving unto Jehovah, he turned his brightening favor upon this remnant of Zion. By his Judge at the temple he ordered them delivered, and the enemy were obliged to yield. “He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.” (Ps. 107:14) He enlightened their teachable minds as to their commission on earth to be a “people for his name”. Then he sent them forth to reflect upon others that light which he shone upon them by Christ Jesus, who is at the temple and reflecting the glory of Jehovah God&quot;—2 Cor. 3:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>24</sup> Now the delivered remnant know the truth of Psalm 112:4: “Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.” Psalm 18:28: ‘Tor thou wilt light my candle; the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness.” Now the remnant, together with their companions at their side, say: “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?” (Ps. 27:1) The Lord brings them unto his organization Zion and assures them that, continually abiding there unto the end, never shall they come into darkness again: “Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.” (Isa. 60: 2, 20) “The city [the new Jerusalem, in which the remnant have their citizenship] had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb [of God] is the light thereof.”—Rev. 21: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> In A.D. 33 the Lord Jesus came to the prophetic temple at Jerusalem, cleansed it, and shortly thereafter was betrayed unto his enemies, the religionists. His disciples all forsook him and fled. After his resurrection from the dead Jesus regathered them. This correctly fulfilled the prophecies. It also foretold that at the time of the Lord’s coming to the spiritual temple in 1918 he would find a displeasing state of affairs among the consecrated. Concerning this the prophecy said: “Thou wast angry with me.” (Isa. 12:1) “Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips [due to failure to boldly preach the Kingdom], and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.” (Isa. 6: 5) Whereat Jehovah says: “I was but a little displeased [with you], and they [the persecutors] helped forward the affliction.” (Zech. 1:12,15) Realizing their failure to keep their vital covenant obligations, and duly repenting thereof, the remnant said: “I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.”—Mic. 7: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">*’ The Lord’s “indignation” here mentioned is not his indignation at Armageddon, which is against all the nations that helped forward the affliction upon his covenant people and still do. (Isa. 34:1-5; Zeph. 3:8) It is his chastening upon his people for their iniquity of lip in not carrying on the bold publication of the Kingdom under the affliction by the persecutor nations. To bear such indignation means to endure such righteous chastisement without taking offense or rebelling against the Lord, knowing that “if ye endure chastening, God deale th with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not!” Such chastening was for their profit, that they might be “partakers of his holiness”, complete devotion to righteousness without any compromise with the enemy. (Heb. 12: 7,10) Jehovah deals with his covenant people as an organization. His chastening comes upon the organization, and the innocent must likewise endure the wholesome chastening. Remember how Daniel and his three companions were carried off captive to Babylon with the other Israelites that had come short of their covenant. Daniel did not excuse himself from the sin of his people, nor did he receive an earlier deliverance from Babylonish captivity, but waited upon God’s deliverance of all the remnant of His organization. (Dan. 9:4-19) The purpose is to purge out the undesirable ones who are without integrity toward God. Jehovah now has a chastened and purged organization maintaining integrity toward him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’<sup>T</sup> In 1918 the consecrated ones as an organized company had sinned, and the finger of blame is not to be pointed at individuals. Such sin was due to the soils of religion upon the garments of their identification as God’s covenant people. It was due also to fleeing from Satan’s threatening “woman”, pictured by that woman Jezebel who threatened Elijah after his destructive work against religion, and caused him temporarily to drop the Lord’s public work and to flee into the wilderness. Such sin was due to looking upon the worldly powers of Satan’s organization as being “ordained of God” to be the “higher powers” with authority to dictate concerning the Lord’s work. Hence the consecrated, out of fear, neglected the public worship of the Lord, which worship is the declaring of his name and the preaching of his “gospel of the kingdom” and proclaiming of his vengeance. This failure made them “of unclean lips”. After their repentance the Lord God by his Messenger at the temple purged away such iniquity of lip and reinstated them in His service. (Isa. 6:6,7) Thenceforth they offered themselves joyfully as willing volunteers and in the beauty of holiness or absolute devotion to the Lord. With profit such willing volunteers now ponder over what constituted that iniquity of lip which makes unclean, and they consider what led to such a state of uncleanness in God’s sight. The faithful are determined that never again shall they yield to the fear of men and hole up and stop preaching His word. They are determined to exercise only the “fear of the Lord [which] is clean”. (Ps. 19:9) They purpose to and do obey Him rather than men and will courageously face and endure the punishment at enemy hands for being Jehovah’s faithful and true witnesses unto the end. They are resolved to hold fast their integrity to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PLEAD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” While under the Lord’s indignation the remnant carried out their determination to hold fast and wait upon him “until he plead my cause”. This pleading was against the enemy organization, the nations which oppressed and helped forward the affliction of Jehovah’s consecrated. Such pleading Jehovah did by causing them to stop their war and by rebuking the religionists through the release of his people from bondage and restraint. Jehovah with action answered the prayer: “Judge me, 0 God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: 0 deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.” (Ps. 43:1) &quot;Consider mine affliction, and deliver me; for I do not forget thy law. Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word. Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies.”—Ps. 119:153,154,157.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” Let God’s covenant people always bear in mind that as long as they are faithful to him and his name which they bear, and as long as they carry out his commission to them, their cause is God’s own cause. They may pray: “Arise, 0 God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily. Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth daily.” (Ps. 74:22,23) “The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together, and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go. Their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of hosts is his name; he shall thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land [his organization], and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.” (Jer. 50: 33, 34) “The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and, My blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say. Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea [the world population upon which the great whore Babylon sits], and make her springs [of religion’s poison waters] dry. And Babylon shall become heaps.” (Jer. 51: 35-37) Let public officials pause and consider the above truths before yielding to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other religionists and before afflicting God’s faithful servants and thereby violating God’s command to the rulers: “Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.” (Ps. 105:13-15) Jehovah will plead against such violators at Armageddon with violent destruction upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” 'TJntil he plead my cause and execute judgment for me.” This judgment Jehovah began executing in 1919. The judgment had begun at the “house of God” at the Lord’s coming to the temple in the spring of 1918. Those professing to be of God’s house but whom the judging process showed to be of the “evil servant” class were cut asunder from God’s organization. “Christendom,” particularly the religious leaders thereof, had denounced Jehovah’s covenant people as false prophets, as wresting the Scriptures, as cursed of God and headed for a “hell of torment”. Now at the temple judgment Jehovah by Christ adjudged his purged remnant as approved of Him although not approved of men. He constituted them his “faithful and wise servant” and committed to them the Kingdom interests and made them his witnesses. As his approved official witnesses Jehovah “covered [them] -with the robe of righteousness”. (Isa. 61:10; Mal. 3: 1-4) Then in 1919 he released them from the bonds of the Devil’s crowd and sent them out into his service with the “testimony of Jesus Christ” and to declare the “judgment written” against the oppressors. This greatly amazed the self-righteous religionists. It was an open token of God’s disapproval and rejection of them, much to their chagrin. Thenceforth they could do nothing but weep and wail and gnash upon Jehovah’s faithful remnant with their teeth. This reversing of the enemy’s action is the doing of Jehovah, “which executeth judgment for the oppressed.” (Ps. 146:7) He has vindicated his word, that “Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts [or returning ones; the remnant] with righteousness”. (Isa. 1: 27) “He will bring me forth to the light,” adds Micah. It is the light of God’s favor, that light of liberty due to the fear of God and to freedom from fear of man; also the light of the lightning flashes of his truth from his written Word and shining forth from his temple. (Rev. 11:19) Jehovah openly displays his witnesses to the light of open and public inspection as a “people for his name&quot;. What the Lord tells them in the temple in secret, which is dark to the enemy, that they boldly speak in the light; and what they hear from the Lord in their ears, which are turned to his Word, that they preach openly, publicly, as upon the housetops. (Matt. 10:27,28) This they do because they fear only God, the All-powerful One.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>,l</sup> “And I shall behold his righteousness.” Jehovah’s great act of righteousness is the vindication of his name by his Righteous Government, The Theocracy. This act Jehovah will do at Armageddon. The remnant delivered and brought forth into the light now behold these truths through the revelation of his Word, and they look forward jubilantly to actually witnessing God’s act in that final battle, which Jehovah will win over all enemies. There his judgments will be executed in righteousness against them. The remnant also behold his righteousness in all his faithful dealings with them in complete fulfillment of his word of promise. Being covered with his robe of righteousness, they say: “He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.” (Ps. 23: 3) “The Lord hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the Lord our God.” (Jer. 51:10) To them Jehovah has given “beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.” (Isa. 61: 3) The enemy continue to reproach and persecute them as unrighteous, but the Lord says to the remnant; “Every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord; and their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.” (Isa. 54:17) The latter end of the remnant and their companions who continue faithful in their integrity shall be litre that of Job, whose latter end was more blessed than his beginning: “also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.” (Job 42:10,12) All this vindicates Jehovah’s word and name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” “Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her which said unto me, Where is the Lord thy God1 mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.” (Mic. 7 :10) During the sorrow of 1914-1918 the religionists justified themselves before the people and promised that there would be a great spiritual revival after and as a result of the world war. The war stopped, and they were put to the proof. The Protestants began their Interchurch World Movement and other revival schemes, and the Catholic sect’s head began and spread Catholic Action throughout the world. The promised spiritual revival of “Christendom” never came, proving that the Lord God was not with them. What Dm come was the greatest activity and increase of Jehovah’s witnesses, whom the enemy thought they had knocked out permanently. There came the widest and most intensive declaration of Jehovah’s name and kingdom by his witnesses that the world has ever known. This is as Jehovah God foretold at Exodus 9:16. Next, and shortly, will follow the showing of His almighty power over Satan the Devil and all his organization, Babylon. Since 1918 the “strange work” of Jehovah God by his witnesses shows his approval upon his remnant and his acceptance and use of them. It likewise covers the enemy organization with shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the war time when she was on top she taunted Jehovah’s servants and said: “Where is the Lord [Jehovah] thy God?” Now let her say it! The tables have been turned!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” Concerning the righteous acts of Jehovah’s witnesses in his “strange work” he says: “And the Gentiles [the persecutor nations] shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name.” (Isa. 62: 2) That God-given “new name” is, to wit, “Jehovah’s witnesses.” (Isa. 44:8; 43:10,12) The Kingdom’s publication by these to the ends of the earth is a proof of Jehovah’s power and of his deliverance of them from Babylon: “The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.” (Isa. 52:10) Armageddon will be a still greater demonstration of power and deliverance. Concerning the work of His remnant and their companions in dispensing God’s Word to the poor in spirit or teachable ones, the Lord says: “A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth [the Kingdom message]: he will guide his affairs with discretion. He hath dispersed [God’s truth], he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever: his horn shall be exalted with honour. The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away; the desire of the wicked shall perish.” (Ps. 112: 5,9,10) “Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed; because thou, Lord, hast holpen me, and comforted me.”— Ps. 86:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ Being put to embarrassment and confusion by Jehovah’s blessing upon his “strange work” through his witnesses, the Babylonish religionists put up the howl of hurt “religious susceptibilities”. At the straightforward declaration of Jehovah’s judgments against religion they raise the hue and cry of ‘Intolerance !&quot; and the need of religious unity. They try to shield themselves by forcing the passage of unconstitutional “anti-ridicule” laws. Great is their shame now because of God’s declared message which shows forth the two opposing organizations and which exposes the Devil’s organization and its religious and political and commercial elements. At Armageddon, however, shame shall smother them. Concerning them God's Word prescribes this prayer for his covenant people to say: “Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, 0 Lord. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame [at not being God’s favorites, not being right, not being supreme, and not being on the ■winning side], and perish: that men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Most High over all the earth.”—Ps. 83:16-18; also Pss. 109:26-28; 71:13; 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” That the primary issue before all creation is world domination is proved by the enemy organization’s taunt. In the type Babylon made war upon the typical Theocracy, overthrew the unfaithful religious organization, also took captive the remnant faithful to the Theocracy and then reproached their God, saying, “Where is the Lord thy God ?” In other words, Who is supreme now, your God, Jehovah, or our god, Satan the Devil? The same taunt was hurled at the faithful remnant while in the power of the modern-day Babylonians, in 1918. This is why Jehovah must act for his name’s sake. He gave effective answer in delivering and releasing his remnant and thereafter giving through them the most far-reaching testimony to his name, and that, too, in the teeth of the greatest persecution and opposition. Such has been to the end that the enemy might be warned that at Armageddon it will be Jehovah that smites them in proof of his supremacy as the Almighty God. This has enraged the demons and their earthly dupes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">*<sup>6</sup> By means of Catholic Action, and particularly by totalitarian-religious dictators, the enemy seek to take away the democratic freedoms of all nations and to crush Jehovah’s witnesses in all lands. In the countries which have been swallowed up by the anti-Theocratic “abomination of desolation” and where they have gotten the persons of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses in their power they brutally torment them, and say, “Where is Jehovah your God?” Even in the land called “the land of the free and the home of the brave” un-American mobs engineered by Catholic priests and their dupes have assaulted the witnesses engaged in Christian activities and have ridiculed them with the sneering question: ‘Where is your Jehovah? Let him help you now!” A judge in an eastern court raged at the Christians haled before him for obedience to Jehovah God, and said: “I am Jehovah here!” The power of the totalitarian-religious gangsters and sympathizers spreads and the persecutions upon the faithful witnesses increase, and the scripture describes their experience: “As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they sav daily unto me, Where is thv God?”—Ps. 42:10. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> In the minds of the remnant and the Lord's “other sheep” there is no question as to how the issue will be settled. They have God’s word for it, and they know they shall see the desire of their eyes in the vindication of Jehovah’s name by the destruction of all who reproach it. (Ps. 92:11) “Mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets,” says Micah. By the revelation of the prophecies they now see Babylon, of which “Christendom” is the chief visible part, as Satan’s organization. “Christendom” has tried to mask her identity and ensnare the peoples, but God’s Word has exposed her and now all persons of good-will toward God hehold her to he what she actually is. The nations of “Christendom” have gathered round about God’s organization Zion as represented by the remnant of her on the earth, and they say: “Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.” (Mie. 4:11) But as “Christendom” has designed to do unto God’s organization, so it has happened to her and she stands shown up. (Deut. 19:19) Satan's organization which she outstandingly represents on earth was pictured in Israel’s history by the wicked Jezebel who persecuted Jehovah’s witnesses, his prophets. Then Jehovah raised up Captain Jehu as his executioner. At Jehu’s command the haggish old devilworshiper Jezebel was dropped from her lofty window and trampled under the hoofs of Jehu’s horses and devoured by the carrion-eating dogs. As the prophet Elijah had foretold: “In the portion of [the city of] Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel: and the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.” (2 Ki. 9: 30-37) Likewise shall “Christendom”, and all of the enemy organization of Babylon, be debased to the lowest and trodden under the hosts of Jehovah's organization, and no memorial shall be left of the vile, shameful thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DECREE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” The Jewish remnant that returned from Babylon to Jerusalem in 536 B.C. rebuilt the temple on Zion and later also the walls of the city, but under conditions of difficulty that required the defense of themselves against the enemy while at work. (Isa. 44: 28; Neh. 2:17 to 6:15; Ezra 9: 9) This pictured a like remnant of God’s present-day covenant people from and after 1918 returning to the service of his organization, engaging in his temple work, building up the interests of his Theocratic organization, and defending and safeguarding such against the enemy to this day. Nehemiah’s words ring in their ears: “Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren.” (Neh. 4:14) Concerning this time, therefore, Jehovah by his prophet says: “In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall the decree be far removed.” (Mic. 7:11) The “decree” here specified may mean several things. The religionists have decreed that the kings rule by divine right, and that the political powers, including the dictators of totalitarian Germany, Italy and Spain, are the “higher powers&quot;. (Rom. 13:1) This unscriptural decree the religionists have applied against Jehovah’s servants to frighten them into stopping their worship of God at the command of demonized rulers. Since 1918 Jehovah has given his people the spiritual understanding of this vital subject. Thereby the power of the enemy’s baseless decree has been far removed from them and they obey Jehovah God and Christ Jesus as the only “Higher Powers” rather than man, and they let no such invalid decree of men stop their worship of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” At Zephaniah 2: 2, 3 Jehovah warns of his decree of destruction against all not gathering themselves to him for refuge: “Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before the day of the Lord’s anger come upon you. Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.” Zion is Jehovah's approved organization upon which his name is called. The remnant thereof is yet on earth, and the multitude of their companions, the Lord’s “other sheep”, flee from religion and take refuge under God’s capital organization, The Theocracy. Both remnant and “other sheep” shall be hid from the expression of Jehovah’s fierce and consuming anger at Armageddon. His decree of destruction will not be directed at them. Its execution will be upon the peoples and nations who are “far removed” from his Theocracy in that they are opposed to it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>40</sup> As one term of the Christian’s commission at the end of the world Jehovah by Christ Jesus issued the decree: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) The remnant and their zealous companions willingly volunteer for this service. Since 1918 they have preached this Kingdom gospel everywhere on earth, including lands outside “Christendom”. Thus Jehovah’s decree has applied and been carried out in lands “far removed”. It must not be and it has not been confined to within the assembly halls of Jehovah’s covenant people, but has been carried forth abroad, far and wide.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> Other renderings of the text are: “On that day far away shall be thy boundary” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham')</span><span class="font6">; “In that day shall the bound be afar off.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Variorum, </span><span class="font6">margin) That is to say, Jehovah’s visible part of his organization on earth, together with the “strangers within her gates” who are companions of the remnant, shall increase in numbers and spread out in her realm of activity. Their boundary or bound shall not be limited, but shall be pushed out to the ends of the earth in order that all those seeking life under God’s Kingdom may be brought into the place of refuge and preservation before Jehovah's decree against his foes is executed. Therefore his organization Zion, which had seemed to be barren of children before the birth of the Kingdom, in 1914, is now called upon to sing and cry aloud for joy. Why! Because of the increase of the children of her organization and of their earthly companions: “For more are the children of the desolate [hitherto desolate Zion] than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord. Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords [guy ropes], and strengthen thy stakes [tent pins in the ground]: for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles [the Lord’s 'other sheep’ from all nations], and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.” (Isa. 54:1-3) “Measure Jerusalem [the restored remnant thereof on earth], to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof . . . Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein.” —Zech. 2:2, 4; 1:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>42</sup> In all lands the demon enemy organization desperately fights to prevent this increase of Jehovah’s organization. Nevertheless, even in the totalitarian-controlled lands the faithful witnesses continue to carry on against great obstacles and dangers. In the lands yet open for the work there is the final ingathering to be done of those who must turn to the Lord to be sheltered from the great whirlwind of Armageddon. For the comfort and strengthening of those willingly volunteering for the final work in these perilous times Jehovah says: “Fear not; for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west: I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; even every one that is called by my name; for I have created him [to bear my name] for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him. . . . Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord . . . This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.”—Isa. 43: 5-10, 21.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark9"></a>SAFETY DURING WORLD EMERGENCY</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">I</span><span class="font5">N THIS year 1942 all nations are in the grip of fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In every nation there is internal distress and disturbance. Many think that armsd conflict involving all nations of the earth is just at the threshold; and hence all nations are attempting to fortify themselves against such an emergency. Is there any way to escape to a place of safety </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font5"> Only those who believe, understand and confidently rely upon God and his &quot;Word know what is soon to come to pass. Sincere persons are anxious to know how and whence salvation may come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word “salvation” means deliverance from impending disaster, and the finding of refuge in a place of complete safety. Because the greatest tribulation ever to befall the world is just at the door an unexampled emergency confronts all the peoples of the earth. There are certain universal rules which are unchangeable and which disclose the cause of the impending disaster and also point to the only means of escape and safety. To become acquainted with those rules will result beneficially to those who give heed thereto. Both profane and sacred history furnish an abundance of proof that about 4,000 years ago the world fell under the overwhelming disaster of the flood and a few persons were saved. Since then from tune to time other emergencies have arisen; but the greatest one of all is yet to come, and concerning that emergency the evidence is indisputable. Those who will now examine and weigh such evidence with unbiased mind will see that action must be taken immediately by those who may hope to escape to the place of safety.—See Matthew 24:14-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All persons of good-will and who desire to see righteousness prevail readily recognize that the great Creator is the Almighty God, “whose name alone is JEHOVAH” (Ps. 83:18), and that the Bible is a sacred record of the truth, which the Almighty God has caused to be kept for the aid of those who love that which is right. For the express purpose of telling the truth and being a witness for Jehovah, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of the Almighty</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God, came into the world (John 18: 37) He bore testimony to God’s universal and unchangeable rules above mentioned which all men should learn for their own good He made known the cause of disasters that befall men and nations, and plainly set forth the only means of escape to safety and complete salvation. He told of the flood of Noah's day and said that the wicked conditions that immediately preceded that deluge of waters would again exist throughout the earth, and which conditions would be proof that the greatest of all disasters was quicklv to follow —Matt 24:37-39. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus is the greatest of all prophets and was prefigured by Moses. (See Acts 3:20-23.) Uis prophecies must all come true, because he is the spokesman of Almighty God who tells of the purpose of Jehovah, whose purposes never fail to be carried out. (Isa 46 11,55 11) 'When we observe conditions that have come to pass about which Jesus prophesied, and see that the phvsical facts well known to us exactlv fit the prophecy, then we are sure that it is the time for the fulfillment of the prophecy and that these events have come to pass for that very purpose Jesus prophesied concerning the conditions now existing in the world, and which conditions immediately precede and lead up to the greatest of all disasters that the world can ever have. He foretold the first world war. which began in 1914 and was suddenly stopped in 1918 He stated that such war would be accompanied or quickly followed b\ famine, pestilence, and great disturbances in the earth, and that such would be the beginning of sorrows immediately preceding the great disaster soon to befall the world (Matt. 24:7) He prophesied that following the “war in heaven” described at Revelation 12:7-12 and accompanied by the World War on earth many woes would come upon the nations of the earth; and the facts show a fulfillment of that prophecy. He foretold that following the World War his true followers, who are witnesses for Jehovah, must go amongst the people and tell them the cause of these disturbances and inform them emphatically that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. For more than twenty years now that prophecy has been in course of fulfillment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus further prophesied that the anti-Theocracy “abomination of desolation” would appear in the earth, and the Scriptures make it clear that such abomination is the combination or combined effort of the religious, political and commercial elements of “Christendom” to arbitrarily rule the peoples of the earth and take away all their liberties and make them serfs. That prophecy is now being fulfilled; and in this connection and for the benefit of all persons of good-will Jesus added that, ‘when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not to stand, then flee to the mountains,’ that is, to God’s organization, the only place of safety, (Mark 13:14, Matt. 24:15,16) And why flee then 1 Jesus answers: “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” (Matt. 24:21) Concerning that great tribulation Jeremiah 25: 33 prophesies: “And the slain of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord </span><span class="font5">shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.” Such prophecies now in course of fulfillment show that there is impending an emergency such as never before confronted the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was long ago foretold: “Darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people” (Isa. 60:2) There never was a time in the history of the world when there was such great ignorance generally concerning God’s purpose as set forth in the Bible, and particularly amongst religionists. The people of good-will toward God are just within reeent years coming into the light of a new day and these, being enlightened, see before them the great emergency. They see the mad waters of the river of humanity alienated from God rushing, like the Jordan river, downward to be swallowed up m the “Dead sea”, that is, the turbulent and uncontrollable conditions just ahead. They have a vision of the greatest catastrophe ever known, while all the other people, who are not of good-will, are totally ignorant of what is just ahead. The flood of waters or deluge in the days of Noah was a prophetic picture foretelling this very time and concerning which Jesus prophesied ; “And as it was in the days of No'e, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that No'e entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.”—Luke 17:26,27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What will be the result to those not of good-will? and what is the possible means of escape? With the emergency aforementioned the whole world is now faced. What is done must be done quickly, and only those persons of good-will toward Jehovah God will give heed to the warning and act quickly and find the place of safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Humankind could have escaped falling into such a world emergency and period of destruction. God created the earth for man, and then created perfect man and woman and put them on the earth to inhabit it. (Isa. 45:12,18) To the perfect human pair God issued his mandate to “be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth”. (Gen. 1: 28, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font5"> God made Lucifer a spirit creature or invisible overlord of the world, including perfect man. (Ezek. 28:14,15) At that time all creation in heaven and earth gave honor to Jehovah God, and that properly so, because every creature owes the privilege of life to the Almighty God. The exception to this rule was Lucifer, who began to covet what he was not entitled to, namely, the honor and praise that was rightfully bestowed upon the Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lucifer rebelled against God and attempted to set himself up as God’s equal, and in this rebellion he led away from the path of righteousness both angels and men, and Adam found himself involved in that rebellion. The name Lucifer Jehovah God then changed to that of Satan, which means “adversary”; and to Dragon, which means “devour-er”; and to Serpent, which means “deceiver” , and to Devil, which means “slanderer”. Since then that great rebel has been known by the four names, Dragon, Satan, Old Serpent, and the Devil. (Rev. 20: 2) The Devil then defied God and challenged him to put on the earth men who would prove faithful and loyal to God, and at the same time Satan declared he could cause all men to curse God to His face (Job 2:4-6) That wicked challenge of the Devil raised the question as to who is supreme and who shall exercise </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">universal domination.</span><span class="font5"> If Satan could cause all men to curse God, that would prove Satan at least the equal of Jehovah God, if not his superior. God would have all creation to hear and see the proof, that there could nexer be a real doubt as to who is the supreme one. God had entered the judgment of death against Satan, but, instead of destroying him immediately, God deferred the execution of that judgment and accepted the challenge of Satan in order to give Satan full opportunity to make proof of his boastful challenge. Therefore God said to the wicked one • “But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power.” (Ex. 9- 16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser'i</span><span class="font5"> Thus it is seen that God announced his purpose to give Satan the rebel a full and free opportunity to prove his challenge and that in due time the day of final reckoning must come, and that when that day arrives God would first cause his name to be declared in all the earth and then he would exhibit his supreme power against his adversary, the Devil</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Adam and Eve, because of the sin of rebellion, were also sentenced to death, but God permitted them to live for a season that they might bring forth children Thex could never fulfill the divine mandate to fill the earth xvith a righteous race of people, because they xvere sinners, but they could exercise the function of producing their own species, even though they were imperfect. All of their children were hence born in sin and shapen in laxx lessness, and for that reason all such must in due time die. (Ps. 51 5, Rom. 5:12) Emphasizing the issue of supremacy God gaxe his word of promise that in his due time he would send to the world a Savior who would purchase the human raee or offspring of Adam and that he xvould provide a means whereby those so purchased might be saved and receive life everlasting. That would mean that all of the offspring of Adam who escape and who are saved must comply with Jehovah’s rules and must maintain their integrity toxvard God, and all so doing would be a vindication of Jehovah’s </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">nam</span><span class="font5">e; and that of itself would prove Satan a liar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God did not deprive Satan of overlordship of the world, but permitted him to continue in that position in order that he might have a free hand to carry out his wicked challenge, if possible. Thereafter when Jesus was on the earth Satan was the invisible prince or overlord of the world, and Jesus spoke of Satan as “the prince of this world”. (John 12:31; 14:30) Satan well knew that if God should set up a kingdom on earth, with Christ Jesus as the King and invisible overlord, that would mean Satan’s rulership must end and his execution must take place. Satan therefore determined to exercise everything within his power to defeat God’s purpose. The kingdom of heaven, with Christ Jesus as King, is the deadly foe of Satan and of his advocates. While Jesus was on the earth the Devil and his religious agents continuously attempted to kill Jesus, and finally succeeded in having him wrongfully convicted of treason and causing his death on the tree. God suffered Jesus to thus be put to death, knowing that he would raise Jesus out of death as a spirit creature and place him at the head of his kingdom and that this would be accomplished in his own good time and to his own glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus had told his disciples that he must go away and receive the kingdom and that then he would return and take unto himself his faithful disciples who should be associated with him in his kingdom. (John 14-1-3; Luke 22:28-30) Within three days after his laying down his life God raised Jesus out of death, and he was clothed with full power and authority in heaven and earth; and in forty days thereafter he ascended into heaven, and he was then the King of the world, the duly anointed and commissioned Ruler, whose right it is to rule. (Matt 28:18; Phil. 2: 9-11; Acts 2: 32-36) Thereafter the faithful apostles of Jesus Christ continued to look for his second coming and his kingdom, about which he had informed them and which he stated to them would take place at the end of Satan’s world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the true followers of Christ Jesus for centuries have likewise looked for and hoped for the coming of that kingdom under the Lord Jesus Christ. So keenly interested in his coming and his kingdom were the apostles that they propounded to Jesus this question, shortly before his death: “What shall be the sign [evidence] of thy coming. and of the end of the world [that is, the end of Satan’s uninterrupted rule]?” (Matt. 24:3) In response to that question Jesus said that the first evidence discernible by men would be the world war, in which nation would rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. That came to pass in A.D. 1914. Jesus said that the war would be quickly followed by famine and pestilence and earthquakes ; and everyone knows that these things did quickly follow the World War. Then Jesus said to his disciples: ‘When you see the abomination that maketh desolate standing where it ought not to stand [that is, claiming the right and authority to rule the world], then flee to the kingdom.' (Matt. 24:15,16; Mark 13:14) That has also come to pass at the present time, in this, that a few men, called dictators, and the great religious system of the world together claim the right to rule and regiment the people and take away their liberties and to rule the world in the place and stead of Christ the King. Furthermore Jesus said that great woes would come upon the peoples of the earth because of the activities of the Devil to thwart</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s purpose. (Rev. 12:12) All the world is now experiencing woes such as never before have afflicted the nations, and these woes have come with increasing force since the end of the first world war, in 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As further evidence of his invisible presence in the spirit as King of the new world and also as evidence of the end of Satan’s uninterrupted rule, Jesus said: “There shall be . . . upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea [meaning the peoples alienated from God] and the waves [the radical, disturbing elements thereof made mad by the present conditions] roaring [causing much trouble] ; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.”—Luke 21:25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Exactly those conditions now prevail upon the earth, as every observing person well knows. During all the time of the existing conditions aforementioned, evidencing Christ’s presence and the end of Satan’s uninterrupted rule, Jesus declares and commands to his faithful remnant of anointed followers: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end [the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">final end]</span><span class="font5"> come.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It follows that those who love God and Christ must obey this commandment. In obedience thereto a little company of Christian people made up of men and women who are’known as “Jehovah’s witnesses” have been and are still continuing to go about the country preaching the good news of the kingdom of God. This preaching of the gospel must continue until the great threatening emergency comes to a elimax. When this preaching of the good news of the Kingdom is completed, and it shortly will be, according to all indications, what shall follow? The </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">final end</span><span class="font5"> of Satan’s ruling organization, and that amidst the greatest trouble of all time: “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.”—Matt. 24: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That great tribulation is the battle of Armageddon, which conflict is also called “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”. (Rev. 16:14-16) It is the battle of Almighty God because in it he will finally and for ever settle the question at issue as to who is supreme and whether God can carry out his announced purpose by his </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocratic Government</span><span class="font5"> under Christ Jesus or not. That great battle will result in the complete destruction of every trace of Satan’s supporters and organization, both invisible and visible. The demon rule of the world shall for ever end</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Armageddon having ended with victory for </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah </span><span class="font5">and his </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocracy,</span><span class="font5"> the righteous rule shall prevail everywhere in the universe, including our earth. Gradually the earth will be brought to a condition of Edenic paradise, because such is the promise of Almighty God, who made the earth to be inhabited by righteous men. Gradually the earth will be filled with righteous people by means of the survivors of Armageddon who now see the emergency ahead and who flee from the religious-totalitarian organization of the world and take refuge under God’s kingdom or </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocracy</span><span class="font5"> and trust in Him for salvation. Such “great multitude” of Armageddon survivors shall be favored with the privilege of carrying out the divine mandate to “multiply and fill the earth” with their offspring, born in righteousness and unto life under a perfect, righteous government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEERING IN CUPAR, FIFE CO., SCOTLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“After sitting inside a barber's shop for a few minutes I spied the price list—lOd. for a haircut. I thought this a bit stiff, and was prepared to leave, but decided to sit still. A few minutes elapsed, and a polite ‘Good evening’ from a young girl who serves in the shop. On seeing my magazine bag on the seat she asked if I was finished for the day and what did I actually do. I briefly explained, producing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy.</span><span class="font5"> ‘Oh, I have that red book,’ she said, ‘but I will take the small one.’ I then proceeded to introduce the model-study work and arranged for a model study. Our conversation was heard by those in the shop (four), including the barber. The mention of ‘Jeho'vah’s witnesses’ resulted in some meaning glances going round. Seeing this I walked over to the barber, who was shaving a gent. I explained how we had been much misrepresented by the press, and told him of the Theocratic rule. He seemed impressed, and started asking questions. After a few explanations he admitted: ‘This Theocracy is all right!’ I made the bold suggestion that I had the lecture recording ‘Government and Peace’ (Parts 1-4) with me and if he cared I would play them for him right there. He agreed; so on went ‘Government and Peace’ in the barber’s shop. He even left his clients in order that he could follow it in the booklet. By this time he seemed quite excited. Others in the shop were drawn into the conversation, and, needless to say, none had a better government than </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Theocracy.</span><span class="font5"> I was getting my hair cut by this time. The barber told the girl not to use the electric clippers, as he could not hear all. My hair cut and the model study arranged, I was about to leave, when they asked if I had had tea, and they offered a cup, which I gladly accepted. I was ushered into a little cubicle where the girl was also having tea; so I kept on witnessing to her. Just as we had finished our tea in rushed the barber: ‘Play these records to this man!’ and to the newcomer he said: ‘These are Jehovah’s witnesses, who have been greatly misrepresented. Just you listen to this Theocracy! It’s all right!’ On went ‘Government and Peace’ again. Of course, there were many questions and queer ideas, but I think I made things clear. The girl and the barber were arguing as to who should listen and who should attend to the customers All this ended in an attendance of eight, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> placed, a model study arranged, and three hours’ witnessing in a barber’s shop. I think this is the finest opportunity I have had of making known Jehovah’s King and kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GROWING INTEREST IN THEOCRACY (MASS.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Here in our assignment it continues and was given quite an impetus when ‘Father’ Currie himself showed up three weeks ago at our little room where we hold a public </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> study. Nineteen Catholics (many had attended mass that morning) were sitting with their books, and I as chairman was just starting the meeting, when the door opened and there stood ‘Father’ Currie, arrogant and bold. He would not remove his hat and looked the gathering over carefully. At his side stood one of the ‘principal of the flock’, a prominent Portuguese businessman, a sort of bellwether. I asked: ‘What is your business, sir!’ Answer: ‘I am looking to see if any of my Catholic people are here.’ My reply was: ‘There are none here, sir; what you see are some of the “other sheep” class, and they belong to the Lord, and not to you or me.’ I realized that these ‘sheep’ must not be disturbed by any ‘dog”, and a ‘dumb’ one at that; so up I got and went to the door and outside. Currie refused to talk and went to his car with his companion, and I went back and quieted the ‘sheep’ and proceeded to our study. The next day I took along a fellow witness and went to the rectory and spent three-quarters of an hour in his study. I made it plain that he was entirely out oi order, had violated our constitutional rights in attempting to intimidate those attending a peaceable assembly, that he lacked even common courtesy in failing to remove his hat, and that if anything even remotely resembling his act occurred again I would take it up with the attorney general’s office. His hands shook; he made feeble reply that he would tell his people what he wished. I heartily agreed that such was his privilege, but warned him that overt acts committed were quite another matter. I outlined the usual technique of the Roman Hierarchy during its 1500 years of existence and suggested that he flee from the devilish system before he died with it. I suggested that, since nearly all his parishioners had </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font5"> he do so too. He has it now, as well as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Consolation,</span><span class="font5"> booklet, etc. The following week he was seen to spend much time interviewing the people, also the owner of our little hall (a Catholic). We also spent the week among these honest but perplexed Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The reaction was good to see. Remarks like this were frequent: ‘What a nerve he had!’ The result was that our attendance nearly doubled the following Sunday: 33 in attendance. We also went to see Currie’s companion and followed the same procedure there. We found the man’s wife devoted to the Lord . . . This episode was the principal topic of conversation for some time among these good Portuguese people. Thereafter one of our back-calls got up her courage, and came to a meeting a week ago. During the following week the priest came to her house to give flioly communion’ to the elderly mother, who was blind. The priest was informed they would dispense with his services from that date forward. Amazed, he asked: ‘What are you reading!’ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font5"> was brought out. He got one look, put on his hat, and out he went!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GIVING REAL “BEAUTY FOR ASHES” (SEATTLE)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“This witness is a beauty operator and owns her own little shop. She has a radio there, and in the little room back of the shop she has a radio broadcaster. Whenever she is giving a permanent wave she transmits the recorded lectures, mostly ‘Comfort All That Mourn’. She keeps a file of- all her customers concerning their hair-do, so she just writes on each card what lecture she played for that customer and the literature she placed. She has a file of over six hundred names since last April. I might add that it has not hurt her business in the least. She has more customers than she can handle, and those that do not like the talks just do not come back. If a witness happens to be witnessing from house to house anywhere in the district of her shop, the ladies that answer the doors say: ‘Oh, I heard those talks at the beauty shop!’ ”</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.”—1 John 2:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH’S purpose to build a new world is about to be fulfilled. This is cause for all lovers of righteousness, truth and liberty to rejoice. All such, honestly examining the Creator’s promises and descriptions and acts concerning that new world, are led to love it. That is like Jehovah God. He too loves it and has proved his love for it. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” In those words, at John 3:1G, the Son explained why he was on the earth as a perfect man, preaching the coming establishment of a new world under a new government, “the kingdom of heaven.” This spells the doom of the present world now in the throes of “distress of nations, with perplexity”. The year 1914, remembered by men as the year of the outbreak of the World War, marked the turning point for the affairs of the universe. By the political, military and religious maneuvers of the nations since then they now stand at the “place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon”, and all Bible prophecy and world events combine to prove that the great battle at that “place” is very soon to be joined. No mere international or capitalist-labor or Catholic-Protestant war will that be, but a war between worlds, with the kingdom of heaven of the new world fighting to victory on the right side against the demons and wicked men of “this present evil world” on the side of defeat and destruction. The “new heavens” and “new earth” of God’s unforgettable promise shall thereafter hold sway and shall endure forever to the unfading glory of Jehovah and to the blessing of all lovers of the new world.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1</sup> It is of God’s great mercy that he has not completely wiped out the human race ere now for all its unrighteousness which stains every page of its history. Sober-thinking men ought to tremble at the thought that he will wipe out all the worldly nations at the impending Armageddon fight and thereby at last, after a wait of six thousand years, vindicate his name and lus almighty power for righteousness and truth. Only human creatures who now set their love and confidence and hopes on the new world of God's creation and who immovably take their stand for it and publicly confess thereto will be spared to enter into its joys, privileges and blessings. Now is the destiny-making time, the time to decide whether to work for the preservation of this wicked world, with certain disappointment in the end, or to serve the interests and prove oneself worthy of the new world with its endless joys that will outweigh all the sufferings for righteousness endured at present. God in his loving-kindness has made all needed provision whereby men who have been born of the sinner-race may’ escape the condemnation of death due to sin and may qualify for everlasting life, some in the “new heavens” of that new world, and a far larger number on a purified earth under those new heavens. Such provision of God is through his only begotten Son, who qualified to be the King of the new world and King of all who live in that world without end. This is the wonderful meaning of the truth contained in the words: “We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.”—1 John 2:1, 2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’ Those words of comfort were addressed under inspiration directly to those who will be associated with God’s anointed King in the “new heavens”. They also hold out glorious hope for all men who love truth and who turn from sin and desire to do right on the earth under new heavenly government, The Theocratic Government. Such men of good-will toward God and his kingdom strive to do right to the best of their ability now and according to God’s standard of truth and righteousness. To such “men of goodwill” God extends peace on earth through his King. None of those who now turn to the new world and who advertise it to others can at present do perfectly. Hence they need the help of the “advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous”. “Advocate” means helper. All men descended from Adam have been “shapen in iniquity, and in sin did [their] mother conceive [them]”, and this through no choice of their own. (Ps. 51:5) Sin entered into the world before the birth of the first child of Adam and Eve. That was in Eden, when Adam chose to follow his wife in transgression of God's law, which transgression brought the penalty of death.—Gen. 2:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ Eve acted just as selfishly and willfully as her husband. In fact, she ran ahead of her earthly head Adam and showed insubordination, and hence Eve, although deceived by the subtle serpent, was inexcusable and “was in the transgression”. (1 Tim. 2:11,13,14) God made promise in their hearing concerning “childbearing”, that is, concerning God’s “woman” who should bear the Seed that should crush the Serpent’s head. Only this holds out any hope for those of Adam and Eve’s offspring who turn from the Serpent and its deceptions and turn to the Seed who delivers from the power of the Serpent. (Gen. 3:15; 1 Tim. 2:15) Thus it came about that “by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men [by human birth and inheritance], for that all have sinned”.— Rom. 5:12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Being conceived in sin and shaped in iniquity, Adam’s offspring are imperfect as well as sinners and hence under the condemnation of death and have no right to human life. They have no claim upon God and God owes nothing to them; rather by God’s long-suffering and mercy they enjoy what conscious existence they have on earth. At death they return to the dust, to a state of non-existence. No hope of future living again would be possible for any of them excepting for God’s providing of a sin-offering, a “propitiation” for sins, for those willing to accept the benefits of it on God’s terms. The principal term upon which they receive the good effects of that sin-offering or propitiation is that they must forever be for a vindication of God’s name in contradiction of the infamous reproaches that the Serpent has brought upon God’s blameless name. “Propitiation” means that thing which makes propitious, favorable, that is to say, the thing which removes the reason for God to condemn the creature and which therefore brings the creature into the mercy, favor and loving-kindness of God. “The wages of sin is death”; and sin is charged against all men by inheritance from their first father, Adam. The propitiation removes the charge of sin as the cause of condemnation to death from all who avail themselves of the propitiation, and is the sin-offering.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">•The first man on earth, Adam, was perfect, because he was the creation of God, and, as for God, “his work is perfect.” (Deut. 32:4) God made Adam in His likeness, that is, possessed of a suitable measure of wisdom, justice, love and power. He made Adam in His image, that is, as God’s visible representative on earth. (Gen. 1:26,28) Jehovah is a “God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he”. There was no iniquity or injustice or unrighteousness in his creation Adam, because Jehovah God is not the source or author of such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>T</sup> As such perfect creature, Adam had the right to life in his perfection. His Creator stated that Adam could possess that right forever by continued obedience to Theocratic law, that is, the law of his God. As long as Adam thus continued in perfect obedience to his Maker and Sustainer Adam was a part of the universal organization of God and was the visible or earthly part thereof. Adam’s wife, Eve, being likewise the creation of God, was also perfect, as was Adam. Both were acquainted with God’s law and both were intelligently under test to prove their worthiness either of everlasting life or of being cut off from life without any hope or promise of recovery. Their choice as manifested by their course of action thenceforth must determine their everlasting destiny. They chose death. In their case God could not reverse his law or recall it. For God to do so would make his judgment and his law and his word unreliable, and creatures throughout the universe would have grounds for believing that the life of a mere creature is more to God than his own word, and that creatures could willfully sin against God and yet have the hope of universal salvation by God’s reversal of his own penalty for the sin of willful sinners. It was the Serpent, Satan, who promised universal salvation, by persuading Eve that despite her willful sin against God she would be saved, and she could enjoy sin against God and also enjoy salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">•Jehovah God vindicated his own law and turned Adam and Eve to destruction before a “day” or period of one thousand years passed. (Gen. 2:17) He instantly withdrew from them the right to life, and left them to die amid the thorns and thistles outside Eden. He permitted them to reproduce their kind and rear children, and this God did for his name’s sake. To these children he let the information be handed down that God would in due time produce a Seed by his “woman”, and which Seed would destroy the Serpent, who by deception had brought sin and death on them. It is the father who gives or transmits life, through the mother, who supplies the organism to the creature born. Adam, having forfeited the right to life for himself, could not transmit that right to his imperfect, sin-cursed offspring. It was therefore the right to life as a perfect human creature that he parted with both for himself and for his offspring by Eve. Adam and Eve, having been directly on trial and failing therein, could never recapture that right. However, their offspring had not been personally on trial to determine their destiny, and could take advantage of whatever merciful provision God might choose to make in harmony with his justice and out of love for a new world and in vindication of his word and name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ If any of Adam’s offspring did not by faith choose to take advantage of God’s arrangement for life in the new world, such ones would be the losers. God will have the new world of his love, regardless of who refuses to seek life in it, and he will vindicate his name by the Theocratic Government of that new world. Certainly no creature born in sin, and hence under condemnation of death, could gain life in the new world if he did not choose the Builder thereof and also its King. To that effect it is written: “And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in tris Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.” (1 John 5:11,12) “The Father . . . hath given all things into his hand. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.”—John 3:35,36.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Sin and the condemnation due to it rested as a disability’ upon Adam’s descendants. In order that such of them as turn to God in faith and obedience might have the way opened to gain and enjoy life in the new w’orld, that disability must be lifted and removed. God alone could do that, by furnishing a sin-offering to make atonement for the sins of those wanting to come into harmony with him. The “sin-offering'’ is the victim, whose offering is made necessary by sin, and which sin-offering is of such value and power as to be able to cancel or wipe out the effect of the sin.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> The word “atonement” is used in God’s law by Moses and in the writings of Christ’s apostles. It has the basic thought of “cover” and “exchange”; that is, the thing exchanged or applied instead of another thing must exactly cover, correspond with or duplicate that other thing. The English word “atonement” is derived from the expression “at one”, and has the Bible meaning. The thing which makes satisfaction for another thing that is lost or forfeited must be “at one” with or cover, coincide with and be exactly equivalent to that other thing. This, therefore, shows what must be required in the “sin-offering”<sup>-</sup>. It must correspond perfectly, without overlapping or without shortcoming, with the thing for which it atones or makes just satisfaction. Only by atonement through such a sin-offering could favor be restored to one who is under a natural disability before God. Therefore the one who is offered as the victim or sin-offering is the “propitiation” or the thing which makes God favorable to the one hitherto disabled and under God’s wrath and condemnation by birth. It was God’s love of the new world and of those who meet his requirements for living in it that moved God to furnish the means of propitiation. “Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.”—1 John 4:10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MIRACULOUS PROVISION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> How could God’s only begotten Son become the sin-offering to propitiate for sins? Certainly not by remaining in his original condition. God his Father is spirit, the Supreme One, invisible to man and almighty’ in power. When Almighty God Jehovah brought his first-born son into existence, that only begotten Son was like his Creator-Father, a spirit or heavenly person, higher than man and more powerful. 'Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature.” (Col. 1:15) As such the only begotten Son was perfect in mind and organism and possessed the right to everlasting life in heaven in association and communion with his Father and his God, Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” The Lord God made this first-born, only begotten Son his ‘Word”, or mouthpiece and executive, toward all creatures that should thereafter be created. Jehovah used this Word thenceforth in the creation of all things animate and inanimate, ineluding angels and men. This Word of God (John 1:1-3) was therefore higher than angels, and, since man was made “a little lower than the angels”, he was far higher than man. Adam had been made a perfect man, and when he sinned he lost for himself the right to life in absolute human perfection. God made this earth not in vain; “lie formed it to be inhabited” by perfect men. (Isa. 45:12,18) Adam forfeited that right for all his descendants. For any of his offspring to come into enjoyment of that right a sin-offering must be provided with the exact value-content of a perfect human life together with the right thereto. The life of the Word of God in heaven was not of equal value with that, but far more excellent. Hence it was not suitable for a sin-offering. Note now the wisdom and power and justice and love of Jehovah God, in meeting his own exact law, namely, “Life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.”—Deut. 19: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> Instantly that sin had entered into that first world by Satan’s rebellion and Adam’s transgression, Jehovah God purposed to build a new world of which man on the earth should be a part, and which new world would be governed by a new heavenly government, The Theocracy’, under his only begotten Son. His Son would be the Seed of God’s “woman” entrusted with the honor of vindicating God’s name by destroying sin from the universe, and all prac-ticers thereof, including Satan, “that old Serpent, which is the Devil.” That Son or Word of God was the highest one in God’s universal organization, and the Lord God had used him in the creation of all the rest of God’s universal organization. (Col. 1:15-18) Thus God’s only begotten Son occupied a special relationship with his Father toward that universal organization, namely, that of joint-creator thereof with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> It is written: “Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.” (Acts 15:18) “Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure.” (Isa. 46:10) Jehovah God purposed that the government of the promised new world should be cut out of his universal organization as its “mother” and should be made the capital organization over and above his entire universal organization. Also his only begotten Son should be the anointed King in such capital organization. The great Organizer of this new government also purposed that there should be associated with his Son in the capital organization a body of 144,000 faithful members over whom Iris Son would be the Head. All these together, the 144,000 and One, should compose Jehovah’s royal family of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Tliis great privilege, however, was not to be gained without cost to the Son, namely, the cost of absolute and complete obedience to his Father under the most severe test. The Son had from the very beginning of his life been obedient to Jehovah his Father, but now he must be perfected in his obedience in order to qualify for the glorious position immediately next to the Most High God. This obedience must be perfected by holding faithful and true under the greatest suffering at the hands of the organization of the great Serpent, who is at enmity with the Seed of God’s “woman”. In agreement with this it is written as to God’s method: “For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto [heavenly] glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.” (Heb. 2:10) The Son must be willing to exchange all he had and undergo even the deprivation of life itself, in order that he might fully demonstrate his obedience to Jehovah God and his love for Him and his Theocratic Government of the new world. In brief, the Son must be “faithful unto death”, and must trust his Father to use his almighty power to raise his Son out of death as a reward of his Son’s perfect obedience and faithfulness. Hence the Son said: “Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.”—John 10:17,18.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> The great adversary challenges Jehovah’s universal domination. He raised the question of doubt that Almighty God is able to produce any creatures of perfect integrity who, if exposed to assault b\ the Devil and his organization, would continue to acknowledge God’s universal domination and to abide in his universal organization. God’s only begotten Son, by proving his devotion and obedience perfect under suffering, would supply a complete and lasting answer to that question and prove the Devil a false accuser. At the earth, where Satan was the invisible overlord of fallen man, that question had been raised by the Devil in connection with man. Therefore it must be that God’s Son undergo the thorough test of his obedience, devotion and integrity on the earth. He must become a man and undergo the loss of life itself in order to provide the perfect answer to the question in vindication of his Father’s name and word. Laying down his life in obedience to God would, however, not mean the loss of his right to life; rather it would prove his worthiness to resume his life with his Father in heavenly glory and to be ‘clothed upon with immortality’ as a reward and to sit down with his Father in His throne, there to reign as King of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government. Secondly, by laying down his life and putting aside the humanity he had assumed he would provide the sin-offering. Thereby he would open the way for devoted men and women to be redeemed from among humankind and to be given a change to heavenly life, to be associated with their Redeemer and Head in the kingdom of heaven, The Theocracy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> At God’s chosen time he revealed this purpose, which was before that a hidden mystery, to be hi&gt; beloved Son. Joyful at the opportunity to be the vindicator of his Father’s name, the Son gladh accepted his Father's will for him and agreed to do it. The same love his Father had for the new woild was manifested by the Son. God was willing to irive his beloved Son to be the governmental Head of that new world. The Son was willing to give his all for the privilege of clearing the Father's name of all reproaches from the adversary. This giving of his all Jesus pictured in two parables, saying: “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman, seeking goodly pearls; who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.” (Matt. 13:44-46) The “field” which the Son bought at the cost of his all was Jehovah’s universal organization, in the creation of which he had been a colaborer with God his Father. (John 17:10; Heb. 1:2) The “treasure” hidden therein, and the “one pearl of great price”, was and is the “kingdom of heaven”, the government of the new world. It included the privilege of being the Head thereof and to have associated with him in his throne 144,000 redeemed from among men. Thus in the selling of all he had the Son laid aside his life and glory in heaven and became a perfect man, poor in comparison.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” The laying aside of heavenly life and glory was not a part of the sin-offering. “The law of the Lord is perfect,” and it provided that like should go for like. The sin-offering must therefore have a value exactly equal to that which was lost or forfeited by the perfect man Adam. (Ps. 19:7; Lev. 24:20,21; Ex. 21: 23-25) The sin-offering in man’s behalf must be a ransom of exactly corresponding price or value. The spirit life and glory of which the Son divested himself to become the “man Christ Jesus” was far higher and of far greater value and worth than anything the perfect man in Eden possessed and enjoyed. Hence the Son’s emptying himself of this heavenly power and position was not part of the sin-offering, but was part of his proving perfect obedience to his Father. It was in order that he might become a perfect man and maintain his integrity toward his Father under the crucial test and thereby provide Jehovah’s complete answer to Satan’s lie. This would be for the vindication of Jehovah’s name and would prove the Son to be worthy to be Head of Jehovah’s capital organization and as such the Vindicator of God's name. Thus viewed, the chief purpose of God’s beloved Son in becoming a perfect man was, not to provide redemption for humankind, but to bear witness to Jehovah’s name and new government and to vindicate His name.—John 18: 37, 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What, then, is the “sin-offering”? It is the perfect Victim that provides propitiation for the sins of all those of Adam’s descendants who are eventually redeemed or delivered from sin and death. When God’s fullness of time was come his heavenly Son divested himself of all above and Jehovah God his Father transferred his life to the womb of a virgin of the tribe of Judah. Hence this virgin was a descendant of Abraham, who was called “the friend of God”. She was also a descendant of David, the anointed king of Israel. Jehovah had declared to Abraham His unconditional covenant to set up The Theocratic Government and that the seed of Abraham should rule therein, and that in Abraham’s seed all men who will may bless themselves by faith and obedience. Thereafter, with Abraham’s descendant David, Jehovah made the covenant for the Kingdom and declared in this covenant that of the seed of David God would set the Ruler upon the throne of the promised Theocratic Government.—Gen. 12:3; 22:18; 2 Sam. 7 :12-16; Ps. 89: 20-37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Jehovah further promised that the future Ruler would be born at Bethlehem in the tribe of Judah. (Mic. 5:2) In keeping with all his promises God’s Son was miraculously conceived and born by the virgin at Bethlehem; “concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh; and declared to be the Son of God with power.” (Rom. 1: 3,4) His human birth was not an incarnation making him part man and part spirit person. No; but in this transfer of his life to the virgin’s womb Jehovah’s God-like Son divested himself of everything spirit and heavenly and became a man. His serving as the “sin-offering” absolutely required this. (Phil. 2:5-8) “And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.” (John 1:14) As a man his name was called “Jesus”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PERFECT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Being born of an imperfect woman descended from Adam, was Jesus perfect in the flesh? or was it possible for him to have the right to perfect human life and at the same time not have a perfect human body? Job had reference to a child’s father when he asked the question: “Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.” (Job 14:4) But Jesus did not have an unclean father, as his life was not from Adam, but direct from God, the Holy One.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">** It should not be necessary’ to discuss this question. As early as 1897 the Watchtower publications (Volume Five of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the Scriptures)</span><span class="font5"> referred to it in these words: “Of the two false but popular theories one claims that our Lord Jesus was the Almighty God, Jehovah, who merely garbed himself in human flesh, without really having actual sensibility’ of humanity’s trials, temptations and environments. The other theory claims that he was a sinful man, partaker of the blemishes of our race, just as others, but more successful than others in combatting and resisting the motions of sin. . . . Since this was the divine program—that our Lord should not only be the Redeemer of the world, but also a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">pattern </span><span class="font5">for the ‘brethren’ who would be his joint-heirs,— therefore, in carrying out this divine program it was fitting that he should in all his trials and experiences be ‘made like unto his brethren’. Tie was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.’ (Heb. 4:15) It will be noticed that this statement is not that our Lord was tempted in all points like as the world is tempted, but like as we, his followers, are tempted. He was not tempted along the lines of depraved appetites for sinful things, received by heredity, from an earthly parentage; but being holy, harmless, undefiled and separate from sinners, he was tempted along the same lines as his followers </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">• • . ”—The At-one-ment Between God and Man, </span><span class="font5">pages 107,109,110.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’* The Scriptures do not state that God’s Word was made imperfect flesh; nor do the Scriptures say God’s Son was made in sinful flesh, filled with inherited weaknesses. Romans 8:4 (Weymouth’s translation) states: ‘For what was impossible to the Law— thwarted as it was by human frailty—God effected. Sending His own Son in the form of sinful humanity to deal with sin, God pronounced sentence upon sin in human nature; in order that in our case the requirement of the Law might be fully met.’ Jesus’ body was real flesh, but not sinful or imperfect; it was merely in the “likeness of sinful flesh”. Jesus was in the likeness of other men whose power of existence was transmitted from the sinner Adam; but Jesus was not exactly such as other men are, because only his mother was human and God was his Father. Because of Jesus’ likeness to other men, the religionists accused him of being born of fornication, not recognizing God as Jesus’ Father. Jesus “made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men [children of Adam]: and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross”. —Phil. 2:7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> The argument is raised that Jesus had the right to human life, but was born imperfect, with the human frailties of sinful men, just so he might in himself personally experience what it felt like to have such frailties to fight against and overcome, in order that he might be able to sympathize fully with humankind as their High Priest. Such argument magnifies the creature man. It overlooks the primary purpose for which Jesus was sent to earth to become man. The real issue was not how it felt to be a man imperfect and sinful in tendency and how hard it was for such an imperfect, sin-laden creature to fight and overcome the weakness of the flesh. It was not sympathy for sinful man and the need therefore to taste their frailties that brought God’s Son to earth. The question that was linked to the issue of God’s universal domination and which must be settled was: Adam as a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">perfect</span><span class="font5"> man had failed to resist the Devil and his temptation. Could Jehovah, then, put his Son as a perfect man on earth, subject him to the temptations and sufferings at the hands of Satan and his demons, and still have Jesus maintain his integrity absolutely flawless and not be forced out of God’s organization? Would Jesus show perfectness of obedience under such experience of temptation and suffering, even unto death, and thereby vindicate his Father’s word and name? Would he be faithful and true as a witness for Jehovah and his Theocracy under the reproaches and oppositions by the enemy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> By his faithful course which led to his death on the tree Jesus answered that principal question at issue to the honor and vindication of his Father. The matter of being frail, infirm and imperfect as sinful humans are was not involved or required for the settlement of the issue at all. Jesus healed of their sickness and diseases those that came to him in faith, and this at the cost of virtue which went out from him. Thus he partook of the infirmities of men and women of faith and showed his feeling for and loving-kindness toward them. (Mark 5: 30: Luke 6:19; 8: 46) This was in fulfillment of the prophecy, at Isaiah 53:4. It would have been impossible if he had himself been filled with frailties and infirmities and imperfections in his own flesh. (Matt. 8:16,17) The inspired writer cites a proof of perfection in the flesh by this example: “If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.” (Jas. 3:2) To prove Jesus’ perfection the divine testimony is: “Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.” (1 Pet. 2:21-24) To his religious accusers Jesus said: “Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.”—John 8: 46, 47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2T</sup> It is inconsistent to say Jesus could be imperfect in the flesh but could have the right to everlasting life because of the perfect integrity of his heart toward God. The ancient record truly does say that “Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generations”; and that God commanded Abraham, “Walk before me, and be thou perfect”; and that God said that Job was a “perfect and an upright man”. (Gen. 6:9; 17:1; Job 1:1,8; 2:3) But the perfection in the sense there meant did not of itself entitle them to the right to perfect human life. Their receiving the right to life depends upon the sin-offering of Jesus applied in their behalf. This proves that Jesus had more than mere perfection of heart integrity as those faithful men had it. Jesus had perfection of flesh, of human organism, and because of this he was able to ptovide the sin-offering. Concerning the animal offered as a typical offering upon God’s altar Jehovah’s law required: “It shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.” (Lev. 22: 21) This does not refer to perfect heart integrity, for a dumb brute has none; it refers to its physical condition. All this has forceful meaning when taken in connection with Jesus’ words: “I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”—John 6:51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” Jesus’ fitness to be the sin-offering required his perfection in the flesh together with the right to human life in such a perfect human body. As it is written: “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” (2 Cor. 5:21) It is the sin-offering that makes atonement. That means it supplies the perfect satisfaction and coverage for that which was lost or forfeited and which it is the desire to buy back or recover. This is according to God’s perfect law that like shall go for like in absolute justice. Adam was created with a perfect human organism, and he had the right to human life in such an organism. By willful transgression of God's published law Adam lost both these valuable things for himself and his offspring. Therefore Adam died. God’s justice was perfectly satisfied in his death and shall forever be satisfied therein, and the sentence upon Adam shall never be reversed, for the great Judge, Jehovah God, changes not.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> Adam’s offspring by Eve were not born of an innocent woman, for she was “in the transgression” and hence under the same sentence with him. Their children were born imperfect, and dying, and perforce under God’s wrath and condemnation. In due time all must perish for ever, unless God made provision for those having faith and obedience to live in the new world. For the human perfection and the right to human life to be recovered for them a sin-offering must be presented to God in their behalf. None of Adam’s offspring possessed the values to fit them to provide the sin-offering. In loving-kindness and for his name’s sake God did so. To provide the exact equivalent of what Adam had forfeited by sin, it was necessary that Jesus divest himself of his heavenly position and powers and become a perfect man, possessed of the right to human life. This Jesus did. Moreover he must lay down these human things of value and for ever part with them by presenting them to the great Life-giver Jehovah. Then the Lord God could justly bestow such valuable things upon all or as many of Adam’s offspring as would please God and prove worthy thereof by faith and obedience toward Him and his High Priest Christ Jesus. So it is written: “But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour: that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.” —Heb. 2:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SPIRIT-BEGETTING</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” Jesus as a boy was a perfect child, with a perfect child’s mind. Hence he sought information at God’s temple in Jerusalem. To his earthly caretakers he there said: “How is it that ye sought met wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business!” (Luke 2:42-49) When he grew to perfect manhood, arriving at the age of thirty years, he was released from all subjection to his human homekeepers and he applied himself directly and exclusively to his heavenly Father’s business. He consecrated himself to Jehovah God to do his will. In public symbol of this consecration to be dead to his own will as a man and to be alive to God’s will as God’s servant, Jesus submitted to baptism, being totally immersed beneath Jordan’s waters by John the Baptist. Immediately thereafter the revelation of his heavenly Father’s will came to him; figuratively, “the heavens were opened unto him.” God expressed his acceptance of the consecration by the pouring out of his spirit upon Jesus, the descent of the spirit being accompanied by that heavenly symbol of peace, the dove. (Matt. 3:13-17) There for the first time Jesus was announced to human ears as the Son of God: “And, lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.” That meant that Jesus’ condition was altered again from what it was at the time of his human birth. How!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> Jehovah’s will was that Jesus should lay down his life to vindicate his Father’s name by proving faithful under suffering even unto the death. Thereby he would come to the perfection of his obedience toward God and would overcome Satan’s world and so would prove worthy to sit down with his heavenly Father in his celestial throne. (Rev. 3: 21) He must suffer in order to reign thereafter. Hence Jehovah in his prophecy gave the promise that when Jesus should thus die faithful to Him he would not leave Jesus’ soul in hell (Sheol, the death condition), but would raise him out of death on the third day unto life evermore. (Ps. 16:10; Acts 2: 23-32) This’meant that Jesus would return to life in the spirit with his Father in heaven.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> Moreover, and in a secondary order, it was Jehovah’s will that Jesus should at the same time offer his perfect human life as a sacrifice, to serve the purpose of a sin-offering, that faithful men might have the way opened to gain life in the new world. (John 14: 6) Thereby Jesus would become Jehovah’s High Priest to offer sacrifice for the sins of the people. Also by holding fast his integrity under crucial suffering unto the death on the tree he would prove worthy to become God’s Tiigh priest after the order of Melchizedek’, that is, a high priest upon a royal throne, a king-priest like Melchizedek of old. (Heb. 3:1; 5:1-6; 7:1-17; Ps. 110:4) Therefore when Jehovah God accepted Jesus’ consecration at Jordan the heavenly Father took Jesus into the covenant by sacrifice. (Ps. 50:5) That covenant was made beyond repeal or recall. Hence when Jehovah accepted Jesus for sacrifice, Jesus was as good as dead as a perfect man. Immediately thereupon the great Life-giver begot Jesus by his almighty invisible power to life in the spirit, and Jesus became the spiritual Son of God, having the right to life in the spirit. For this new reason Jehovah acknowledged Jesus as his Son who was and is well-pleasing to his heavenly Father. Jesus was still in the perfect body of flesh, but he was nonetheless a “new creature”, because by his Father’s begetting of him by the spirit Jesus now had right to life in the spirit with the sure and certain hope to “ascend up where he was before”. (2 Cor. 5:17; John 6:62) When he should in due time ascend up there, then he would present at the throne of God the value of his human sacrifice as a ransom for every man that believes in Jehovah God and in his provision for life through Christ Jesus.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’’Having begotten Jesus by the spirit, Jehovah God also took him into the covenant for the Kingdom or Theocracy and anointed him with the spirit of power to be the King thereof. There God’s Son became Christ Jesus, that is, the Anointed Jesus, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christ</span><span class="font5"> meaning “Anointed”, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus</span><span class="font5"> meaning “Savior”. That Jesus was then anointed or commissioned to be the Theocratic King is evidenced during Jesus’ temptation thereafter in the wilderness, when the Devil showed Jesus all the kingdoms of this world and offered them to Jesus for his worship of the Devil. Jesus turned down the offer flatly and held to the worship of Jehovah. (Matt. 4:1-10) In fulfillment of his commission to announce the Theocratic Government of the new world to men, Jesus, as soon as he came forth from the wilderness, began to teach and preach, “Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”—Matt. 4:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus then by this preaching began to gather about him the first ones of the 144,000 who were to be joined with him in his kingdom. When he ascended up on high after finishing his earthly course, he did not immediately begin the active operation of that heavenly kingdom over men. It was not then God’s time for Satan’s world to be ousted and destroyed. Hence Jehovah God bade his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, to await the due time to act against the enemy world. <sup>&lt;f</sup>But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting [awaiting] till his enemies be made his footstool.”—Heb. 10:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ Ten days after his ascension to heaven came the day of Pentecost, and the faithful disciples of Christ Jesus who had like him consecrated themselves to God were assembled together in Jerusalem. There Jehovah God by Christ Jesus poured out his spirit upon them, begetting them of the spirit and also anointing them as his commissioned witnesses and putting them in line for a place in the government of the new world with their Head Christ Jesus. (Acts 2) From then on Jehovah God by these anointed witnesses has continued the proclamation of his kingdom under Christ. Thereby he has been selecting out from the worldly nations others to complete the number of 141,000 to be united with Jehovah’s King in The Theocratic Government. (Acts 15:14-18; Rom. 11:11, 25) All these must hear the Kingdom gospel, must exercise faith in Jehovah as God and in Christ Jesus as his King and must accept of the benefits of his sin-offering for humankind. They must prove their faith by making a complete consecration of themselves through Christ to do God’s will. Then they must follow carefully in his footsteps and be faithful and true witnesses to God and his kingdom as Jesus was. If God is pleased to take them into the covenant by sacrifice, he jus'i-fies them for that purpose on the basis of the merits of Jesus’ sin-offering. He then accepts them to be sacrificed and begets them with the spirit of his power to be his spiritual children. (Rom. 5:1; 8: 1; Jas. 1:18) These follow Jesus’ example and publicly symbolize their consecration to God by being baptized in water.—Acts 2: 37-41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” If these consecrated ones in the covenant by sacrifice prove faithful under test, Jehovah God baptizes them into the “body of Christ&quot; and anoints them as members thereof with his spirit and brings them into the covenant of faithfulness for the Kingdom of God. (Rom. 6: 3-5) They must be baptized in the likeness of Jesus’ death in order to share m his resurrection unto life in the spirit. They must sul’fei with him if they would reign with him in the Kingdom. They must be perfected in obedience under suffering and prove their integritv toward God under the crucial test, in order to be associated with Christ Jesus in the vindication of his Father’s name. (Matt. 20:22,23; 2 Tim. 2:11,12) When the Lord comes in his kingdom and comes to his temple for judgment of those worthy and those unworthy to enter into the new world, the faithful body members are united with the Lord Jesus Christ in the Kingdom. Those body members that slept in death are awakened at his coming and made like him in the “first resurrection”. The remnant of body members yet alive on earth are engaged in giving a faithful witness concerning the Kingdom unto all nations for a testimony. They must finish their earthly course faithful unto death in completion of their covenant by sacrifice. Then they are given an instantaneous resurrection-change, to be made like him and to see him as he now is in divine glory. (1 Cor. 15: 50-54;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1 John 3:1,2) Christ Jesus and all these who participate with him in the “first resurrection” constitute together the “new heavens” which Jehovah God promised to create for the new world.—Rev. 20:4, G; 21:1; 2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“THE WHOLE WORLD”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">*<sup>T</sup> Christ Jesus is the propitiation for sins not only of those associated with him in the “new’ heavens”, but also of the “whole world”. This would include the “other sheep”. These the Lord is now’ gathering, and to them he extends the hope of surviving the battle of Armageddon and thereafter living upon the earth, forever enjoying righteousness and peace and prosperity under the “new’ heavens”. Since this is the period of the “covenant by sacrifice”, the “other sheep”, who shall remain forever on the earth, will not be justified until after Armageddon, to carry out the divine mandate to multiply and fill the cleansed earth with their righteous offspring. That “w’hole world”, wherein righteousness shall reign, will include also those faithful men who occupied the relation of earthly fathers to Christ Jesus and who died faithful prior to Christ’s ascension to heaven and selection of the “kingdom of heaven” class. Because his propitiation for sins includes those faithful ones of old, they shall receive life from him as their father in a “better resurrection”. Hence they shall become the children of “The Everlasting Father”, and he will make them “princes in all the earth”. As such they shall rule as the visible representatives of the “new heavens” and shall constitute the “new earth” or visible ruling organization over men that live on the literal earth.—Ps. 45:16; Isa. 32:1; Heb. 11:35-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’’ Furthermore, that “whole world” for which Christ Jesus is the propitiation for sins would include those who have “done evil&quot; because of birth in sin and w’ho have died, but who have not perished because of practicing willful rebellion and wickedness against God. Such ones sleep in the graves, and shall be remembered when the One who is the propitiation for sins calls forth all such in the general earthly resurrection under the Kingdom. They shall have a “resurrection of judgment” if they avail themselves of the propitiation and then devote themselves to Jehovah God and obey his Theocratic Rule.— John 5:28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO HAS PART IN THE SIN-OFFERING T</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">”It is thus seen that the spiritual class of the Lord’s followers who reign with him in the “new heavens” are first to receive the benefits of the propitiation, from Pentecost forward. The others who shall live as perfect human creatures on the earth in the new world receive the benefits thereof under the established Kingdom or Theocratic Government. Since A. D. 1914 that Government has been in operation for the bringing of Jehovah’s glorious purpose to a grand climax in vindication of Iris name and word. Since 144,000 are to be finally associated with him in that Government of Righteousness, and since these have been justified and taken into the covenant of sacrifice with Christ and must carry it out faithful unto death, do these have part with Christ Jesus in the sin-offering 1</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> During the World War, which marked the “beginning of sorrows” for the old world now facing its final end, the newspapers published the statements of certain religious preachers that the men who fell in death in the line of duty to their earthly country had a part in the sacrifice of Christ and therefore had an immediate passport into heaven. As ’part of the sacrifice of Christ’ the preachers meant that the fallen ones bestowed benefits like Christ’s on the rest of humankind that survived them. For hundreds of years, particularly since the sixth century, Roman Catholic popes and priests have been celebrating the so-called “mass”, whereby they claim to call down Christ Jesus from heaven and to sacrifice him anew under the forms of bread and wine upon their religious altars. So doing, each priest is understood to have an indispensable part in passing on or releasing further benefits of Christ’s sacrifice to those contributing money for the mass and those assisting at the mass.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> In answer to the question here raised the following quotation is made from the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font5"> published in 1939: “It has been repeatedly said that the church, that is, the glorified members of the body of Christ, by reason of their sacrifice, have a part in the sin offering; and in support of that theory the following scripture is offered: ’Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat.’ (Leviticus 16:15) Neither the foregoing nor any other scripture sustains the conclusion that the body members of Christ have any part in the sin offering. It is the lifeblood of the man Jesus alone that is the valuable thing, the purchase price, and which price is presented and paid over as a sin offering.”—Page 197, fl 1,2.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>SINGING IN THE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">I</span><span class="font4">T WAS a time of crisis when the Lord Jesus Christ ate his last passover with his faithful apostles and set the memorial of his death as ‘the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world”. Nevertheless, when he had finished speaking to them about God’s kingdom, symbolized by Mount Zion, it is written, “when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.”— Matt. 26:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those faithful apostles were only the first of the company of 144,000 who follow Christ’s steps faithfully unto death and who shall therefore reign with him in his heavenly kingdom, the Mount Zion. At the end of Satan’s rule, the time of the world’s great crisis, this company is visualized as singing without fear of men or governments the praises of Jehovah God and his Righteous Government for such of humankind as obey God. “And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father’s name written in their foreheads. And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.”—Rev. 14:1,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The singers have The Throne, and not who they are, in mind. They are not the important ones. It is Jehovah and his King, whose praise they sing. In the grand chorus the 144,000 are singing “before the four beasts”, that is, in the presence and hearing of Jehovah’s universal organization, four-square, perfect, symbolized by four living creatures. Thus they are made a “theater ... to angels, and to men”. (1 Cor. 4:9, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font4"> Even the “prisoners” of the enemy organization Babylon are hearing the song and are being loosed by the Lord God. The 144,000, including the remnant on earth, sing to each other and sing to all who love Jehovah God; they lift up a standard for the people and point them to God’s kingdom. (Isa. 62:10-12) They bring good tidings of great joy; they publish peace and say unto those of Zion, “Thy God reigneth”; they see eye to eye the wonders of God’s purposes, and together they lift up the voice and sing. (Isa. 52: 7-9) All those who by reason of growth and maturity are “elders” in Christ and who have been raised out of death in the first resurrection likewise hear the song. All who are of the 144,000 must sing now, and they do sing. The singing in the hearing of all of God’s organization implies that the remnant on earth must now be singing as their theme God’s supremacy in the throne, in order that his word and his name might be made known and in due time fully vindicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“No man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand.” This means that no one aside from God’s anointed can appreciate and join the invisible members of God’s organization in the song of joy. One must appreciate a thing in order to really rejoice therein.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>WORLD’S CRISIS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Anciently in the temple at Jerusalem only the Levites were trained and allowed to sing in the temple service. (1 Chron. 6:31,32; Neh. 12:46,47) From the Levites the priests were taken, and these are the singers. Not everyone who can make a noise would be chosen to sing before the King Only highly trained voices would be given that privilege. No one could ever learn the song except God’s anointed who shall be God’s royal family. The Hebrew word “learn” means “accustom oneself to”. And so it is that practice, and much of it, is required; and constancy in the work of witnessing to Jehovah’s name and kingdom is a thing essential. Only those who do the required practice are pictured in this group of singers. That explains why there is a remnant that really earnestly and faithfully docs the work of making the word and name of Jehovah known. And they must learn the text of that song, and the harmony ; and this they do by making use of the “meat in due season”, which by the grace of God is provided for the remnant. That “meat in due season” is the illumination and publication of his Word of truth from time to time. That textbook of song is “sealed” to the earthly learned and the religionists and to the “old men”, who are dreamers and prefer to snore rather than to sing with enthusiasm. (Joel 2:2S) The persons of good-will who become the earthly companions of the remnant become familiar with the theme of that “new song” sung officially by the remnant, and they sound it forth to others who are pleased to hear (Rev 22:17) The faithful are rejoicing, and they pray for success and prosperity from the Lord as they sing. (Ps 118:24,25) They say: “Give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.”—Ps. 119:73.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To his children of the royal family the Lord God gives instruction, and the same rule applies to their earthly companions, the Lord’s “other sheep” , to wit: “A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels&quot; (Prov. 1:5) “Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet w iser • teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.” (Prov 9:9) It is therefore the wise that understand and giie praise to the Lord God and that delight in his service, “the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the -wise shall understand” (Dan 12:10) Further, it is written: “The sweetness of the lips increaseth learning. The heart of the wise teacheth (or, maketh wise] his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips ” (Prov. 16:21,23) The wise are they that hear the commandments of the Lord and hasten to obey them They use their lips in obedience to God’s commandments and learn to sing that “new song”, the song of the new world, the “new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness”.—2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning the 144,000 it is written that they were “redeemed from the earth”. (Rev. 14: 3) The last members of these are yet on the earth singing the song. This faithful remnant are “redeemed” through the love of God and by the blood of “The Lamb”, Christ Jesus. They are literally separated from the earth, being “in the world, but not of it”, and in due time they, having finished their earthly course and service, shall be taken from the earth to be forever with the Lord in the heavens of the new world. “They shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.”—Rev. 20:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The faithful remnant are further identified and described in the vision (Bev. 14: 4, 5) : “These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.” How are they not “defiled with women”? The “women” here referred to must be dissolute women, which symbolically represent the “god of this world” and are in his service. In the Bible the term applies to the religious systems that practice deceit and draw men away from Jehovah God. Here, however, the term “women” means much more than that. It represents the devilish influence, sly, deceitful and seductive, that tries to induce those who are begotten of God’s spirit to violate his law either positively or negatively. That means either to refuse to keep and perform God’s commandments or to neglect to do so. Sometimes a legal earthly wife of a consecrated man may cause him such defilement, or the husband may exercise the same influence to cause the wife to refrain from serving the Lord. As stated at Luke 14 20 concerning those invited to come to the Lord: “And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Also literal mothers, sisters and daughters, and others, are used by the great adversary to draw consecrated ones away from God’s service. “If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.” (Luke 14:26) One who is in a covenant to do God’s will must love Jehovah God with all his heart. That does not mean he is to do injury to anyone, but, with him, to please God is that of first importance. The Scriptures explain that the wrongful influence is due to the fact that, to quote 1 Corinthians 7 : 29, 33, “he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife,” and hence manifests love for his wife rather than for the Lord and his kingdom. Therefore the advice is given: “The time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none.” Earthly relatives often induce one to divide his affections with ‘things of this world’, which pertains to Satan’s organization, by giving less consideration to God’s service and his kingdom. Such relatives argue that one should not make himself foolish and obnoxious to the world, but should show the proper honor to the world and to the men and institutions of the world. Thus they are led to worship or give honor to the Devil’s organization and are defiled. The faithful remnant must be absolutely and completely separated from Satan’s organization. They stand out boldly as God’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In ancient time dissolute women were attached to the heathen temples. The unfaithful prophet Balaam suggested to King Balak, who wanted to demoralize the Israelites, that he employ such immoral women to entice God’s covenant people and to ‘call the people to the sacrifices of their demon god’. Balak had some success-: “and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.” (See Numbers 25:1-6.) The counsel of Balaam thus caused the children of Israel to commit trespass against Jehovah God in the “matter of Peor” (a devilish worship with lewd rites). Thus Balaam instructed Balak to cast a stumblingstone before the Israelites, to eat the things sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication. Revelation 2:14 mentions this incident, and declares that those who compromise with the Devil’s organization, thereby committing spiritual adultery, are an abomination to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The faithful hundred and forty-four thousand singers are described as “wise virgins” that are separated and devoted in singleness of life and purpose to God. The apostle Paul was anxious to safeguard them, “that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.” (2 Cor. 11:2) Their eye is single to one thing; and that is, faithful service to the Lord amid the world’s crisis. They “follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth” and delight to walk in his footsteps. (1 Pet. 2:21; Rev. 14:4) The account states that these “were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto [the Lord]”. Their presentation to the Lord was foreshadowed by the “two wave loaves” presented by Israel’s high priest on the day of Pentecost, fifty days after the offering of the first-ripe sheaf of grain. As to those “two wave loaves”, “they are the firstfruits unto the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord.”</span><span class="font4"> (Lev. 23:17) Hence Pentecost was called “the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours”. (Ex. 23: 16) On Pentecost of A. D. 33, fifty days after Christ’s resurrection, there was a fulfillment of that prophetic picture in a miniature way. But in 1918, at the coming of the Lord to the great spiritual temple for judgment of the ehureh and of the nations, that feast of the firstfruits was fulfilled in a complete way by the resurrection of the faithful ones asleep in death and by the gathering of the remnant of the 144,000 to the condition of unity with the Lord at Mount Zion. The 144,000 is a very small number compared with the billions that shall live forever on earth under God’s kingdom, and are therefore spoken of as the “firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These are without guile or lies, and “are without fault before the throne”. (Rev. 14:5) They “walk in the light”, and hence enter into the heavenly city. They are not false Christs, that is, false anointed ones, but are true to their anointing or commission to be Jehovah’s witnesses. They do not turn the truth into a lie by worshiping the creature instead of the Creator. (See 1 John 1:7; Revelation 22:14; 21: 27; Matthew 24: 24; Romans 1: 23, 25.) They do not honor men; but they worship and serve and obey God, and do not lie when they say that they “know him”. The remnant shall not do iniquity or speak lies. (1 John 2:4; Zeph. 3:13) They do not add anything to God’s Word, lest they be found liars thereby. (Prov. 30:6) “A faithful witness will not lie,” and the remnant must continue as faithful witnesses.—Prov. 14:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah predestinated not the individual creatures, but that those he selects for his service and kingdom shall be faultless as to their love and devotion to Him. (Eph. 1:4) They devote themselves to God and endeavor to carry out his will so “that the ministry be not blamed”, and in this endeavor they shine as “the light of the world”. (2 Cor. 6:3; PhiL 2:15,16) God keeps them by his power and in due time the remnant yet on earth shall finish their course here and shall have their instantaneous change in the “first resurrection” and be presented “faultless before the presence of his glory”. (Jude 24) As the number of this faithful remnant on earth decreases, the number of their beloved companions who shall abide on earth forever in peace and happiness increases to a great multitude. These now join with the remnant in the joyful song of praise to Jehovah God and his kingdom by Christ.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>RIGHT ACTION AND GOVERNMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">F</span><span class="font4">ROM the beginning the great First Cause knew his purposes. In perfect wisdom he declared his purposes, and there can be no successful hindering to the carrying out of his purposes. One of his great purposes is to establish a government of righteousness on the earth. After affording creatures ample opportunity to feel the iron hand of the cruel oppressor and to mark the oft-repeated hypocritical human plans for reform and relief, then he will reveal to all his government which shall dash to pieces all wickedness. In his government there shall be no vacillating or uncertain policies. There shall be no oppressors, fraudulent politicians, or hypocritical teachers or judges. His government must be righteous, equitable, and true, and will claim and have the absolute confidence of all honest creatures. His own zeal will accomplish his righteous purposes. —Isa. 9:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He is the Most High God. (Ps. 91:1) To those who give their unqualified allegiance to him he is complete and absolute security. He is a sanctuary for those whom he has taken into a covenant with him to do his will. •‘Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?” (Ps. 77 : 13) In Ins due time all governments, powers and principalities will be made to know that they aie beneath him and subject to his disposition He will exercise his unlimited power, not for selfishness, but for the good of those who obey him forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One who serves Almightv God and keeps covenant with him well knows that in this day God’s servant is in constant danger of the religionists and totalitarians and that without the protection furnished from God he could not stand He fully realizes that the agents of the “god of this world”, Satan, are seeking the destruction of servants of Jehovah and his government. With confidence such servants look up to the Most High God and say ■ “But thou. 0 </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord, </span><span class="font4">art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.” (Ps. 3:3) They realize that Jehovah God is their Protector. They have complete confidence that God will vindicate his own name in his own due time and will deliver those who love him. Being unselfishly devoted to the great Theocrat, they cannot keep back the song of praise to him and his Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The prophecy foretold that when Jehovah’s servants were restrained by the governments of this Babylonish world they would pray to Him: “Take away al) iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.” (Hos. 14:2) The servant of God now realizes that he must watch his way and walk circumspectly that he may do that which is lawful and right in the sight of his God. He prays that he may not be found lawless to God, but be found loyal, true and faithful. Then with confidence he can ask that God will graciously receive him. That relationship truly existing, he will render unto his God the calves of his lips. It is with the lips that we give praise. Strength is in the calves of the legs. Therefore the calves of the lips represent the strength of the lips (Heb 13:15) That means that if, worldly governments to the contrary, the servant of Jehovah has divine approval he has entered into the “joy of the Lord” and is therefore giving the strength of his song of praise unto his God</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is written: “Where there is no vision, the people perish” (Prov. 29:18) No one who is “taught of God” now has any good reason for being in darkness. The disobedient religionists, however, will not have a vision of the truth. Those who decline to see the truth as God gives it to has people must of necessity fall. Jehovah is causing his “lightnings” to flash from the temple to his faithful witnesses The faithful arc privileged to have a vision of his pui poses. It is no mirage that they now see They see the truth as God reveals it, and understand it and rejoice in the increasing light on the Bible and give to God its Author all the glory thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On an occasion the Israelites of old were in the wildei-ness without water They were in distress Then God caused Moses to smite the flinty rock with his rod. and water gushed forth abundantly, thus God manifested his pre-'ence with his people Therefore Psalm 114:7,8 says “Tremble, thou earth at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob ; which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters ” In the wilderness of the world where there is great thirst for truth God is now manifesting his presence He has caused his truth to gush forth through his organization for the benefit of those who are devoted to him. Seeing the manifestation of his presence and his loving provision, Jehovah’s faithful witnesses sing forth his praises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some who claim to have given themselves to the Lord God reproach their fellow Christians for speaking in strong terms against the hypocritical clergy of “Christendom” The Scriptures make it clear that those religionists are the children of the Devil, who is God’s enemy. The clergy are the enemies of God. therefore, because they bring reproach upon his name. God’s enemies must be made the enemies of his servants. The true child of God regards his Father’s enemy as his own enemy. Being wholly on the Lord’s side, the true servants of God hate iniquity and the workers of iniquity and those that speak against Jehovah God. “Do not I hate them, 0 </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font4"> [Jehovah], that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">CPs. 139:21) No one can consistently sing the praises of Jehovah God and his government and at the same time even passively show favor or honor to the enemy. Any reproach upon the name of Jehovah God is a dart of poison shot against his servants and witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning rebellion and favoring the enemy it is written : ‘‘Rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord,</span><span class="font4"> he hath also rejected thee from being king.” (1 Sam 15.23) Witchcraft is here mentioned that God's servants may profit. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Witchcraft</span><span class="font4"> means going over to the enemy for counsel; while rebellion means taking a course of action against God’s will. Stubbornness in accepting Jehovah’s will is as reprehensible as idolatry because it is selfishly holding out against God’s will. God is gracious to those who try to serve him. He is now making the way plain to those who desire to glorify his name. Such are not expecting or desiring the approval of any of God’s enemies They have taken their stand on the side of Jehovah and his Theocracy and they sing His praises. Any attempt, therefore, to make peace with the religionists, who are the sons of Satan, means to consort with the enemy and to practice witchcraft and rebellion. That means unfaithfulness to Jehovah the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the hands of Moses Jehovah gave his covenant people his commandments. Then Moses said: &quot;And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font4"> our God, as he hath commanded us.” (Deut. G: 25) Righteousness means more than merely keeping God’s law. True righteousness is having the approval of God, which approval results to those who do His will out of a pure heart. The servant of God is not righteous merely because he has been brought into God’s organization through Christ Jesus He must prove his devotion to God and obey his commandments out of a pure heart and by so doing receive God’s approval. If he is found diligent in thus doing he will be found singing unto the Most High God. That constitutes right action, though it be contrary to the standards and laws of worldly governments.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark13"></a>THEOCRATIC ASSEMBLY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">W</span><span class="font3">AR is no time to forget God That is the very purpose of the demon-driven totalitarian Nazi-Fascist hordes tn their violent drive through all nations for the seizure of world domination, namely, to turn the people in bitterness against God Such result would be more disastrous to the people than the physical damage and loss wreaked upon them by the wicked aggressors. In these faith-trying times comes the solemn warning from the inspired Word of Almighty God: “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.”—Psalm 9 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mow, more than at any time in past history, persons who seek life, peace and happiness should turn to God Almighty and make special efforts to gam a knowledge of his purpose, his works and his will. In this darkest period of the world the Most High God and his promised Government of Righteousness shine forth as a light. There is joy in light, and “light is sown for the righteous”. We are in the most significant time of all human existence. Events of world-changing importance and power are at hand. It is a tune for individual decision, on which hangs one’s destiny for a life of everlasting joy and blessing or for everlasting death. There is universal need, therefore, for light and understanding to give each one guidance. The day long foreseen and described by inspired prophets m glowing terms is at hand. It is therefore also a time to assemble together to unitedly study together the will of God that we may do it and have his blessing and protection in the destructive time yet ahead. “Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another: and so much the more as ye see the day approaching” —Hebrews 10 : 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In spite of disrupted world conditions an unusual opportunity for assembly for those interested in the new world of righteousness now presents itself. Jehovah God has always kept his people informed as to what he would have them do. He is very merciful toward all persons of good-will who are feeling after him, if haply they might find him. Assembly with those who are his people is a certain way to find him. Readers of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> know that the Lord has used the occasions of the conventions or assemblies of his people to inform them concerning his immediate purposes. In these perilous times it seems pleasing to Jehovah that his witnesses and persons of good-will assemble this year and make plans for further activity, so that more persons of good-will may be comforted. There is undoubtedly much work yet to be done in behalf of those hungering and thirsting after righteousness and who do not find it in religion. As the times become more distressing and the opportunity of witnessing to the Kingdom becomes shorter, all those who have entered into a covenant with God Almighty should seek ways and means to further advance the interests of the Kingdom and thereby set forth the only hope of humankind To tins end the Theocratic Assembly has been arranged for 1942, on the dates September IS, 19 and 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So as to make it convenient to all </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> readers, this general gathering will assemble simultaneously in 53 different cities throughout the United States, besides simultaneous assemblies in foreign countries, if possible. Arrangements are being made to tie all these American cities together by direct wire communication By having the assemblies scattered throughout all of the country, it will be possible for more of al! interested persons to attend m these days when it is difficult to travel long distances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The abnormal conditions make it all the moie advisable that every person who loves righteousness and a righteous government should plan now, so that his arrangements may be completed for attending one of the 53 assemblies that will be announced later Nothing could be more important than the assembly and association of Christian people together m these days of stress and perplexity, when men’s hearts are failing them for fear of the things that are coming upon the world. The violent conflict for world domination is now gripping the nations and absorbing the attention, but those who are acquainted with Jehovah’s purpose and prophecies know the outcome thereof. Such ones have the only hope for the people who desire righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All persons who are seeking the promised new world, “wherein dwelleth righteousness,” will not alone plan to attend, but will also pray to Almighty God, with whom all things are possible, that his blessing will be upon this Assembly. Ask in prayer that he will guide all arrangements, to the end that his name may be honored and magnified. The Assembly is the provision of the great Theocrat. Honor his invitation with your presence, if possible. Plan now to spend three full days, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, September 18, 19 and 20, at a convention city.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“Undoubtedly this country (Eire; 93 percent Roman Catholic), where religion has such a stronghold, is one of the Devil’s chief strongholds, but the ‘old boy’ is not having things all his own way, and some of the ‘other sheep’ in this city (Dublin) are escaping out of his clutches. I should like to tell of a whole family consisting of father, mother and four children, whose ages range from seven to thirteen years, their grandmother and also a friend, taking their stand for The Theocracy. One day on the house-to-house witness work I was invited inside by a lady, who took a book and was exceedingly kind. She told me her husband was very interested in the Bible but was dissatisfied with his own interpretation of the Scriptures. I arranged to call back the following Friday evening. I found he was more than interested. As the precious truths contained in the Bible were opened up his joy knew no bounds. He told me that an understanding of God’s purpose and a vision of the full establishment of the Kingdom had transformed his whole outlook on life and, instead of being in despair regarding the future, he was now happy and overjoyed at the prospect before him. He volunteered to distribute </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> on the magazine routes and later participated in the Sunday morning field service. Sometimes his wife, her mother and a friend who came to visit them would join in the studies, but it was thought desirable that a pioneer sister should conduct a study for the benefit of these ladies. This was arranged, find now all three have taken their stand for The Theocracy. With the exception of the grandmother, the whole family and the friend attended the Belfast Theocratic assembly [1941] and there the three adults were immersed. This convention greatly encouraged them, and since then the four children have regularly participated in the witness work.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“Their presence soon made the district sit up and take notice. The demons soon got busy, working through evil-minded persons. They were turned out of their lodgings and the little meeting-room they had obtained was also taken from them. They immediately took a room at a public house, but after a few weeks the public house was boycotted by its patrons; so this room had to be vacated The girls got a furnished cottage at 10/- per week, and were there for three months. Mischief was then started and they were given notice to leave. When the Society’s representative visited them he was able to conduct model studies with two ‘special’ policemen, and both of these have opened their homes for regular meetings and have become regular and keen associates. They and their wives are expected to take a firm stand for the truth and they have befriended the three pioneers. The adversary soon got busy again, and one of the girls. Sister Scott, was removed from her place of service and sent to prison because she refused to give up her God-given work and accept state service. She was given a two months’ sentence. Considerable publicity resulted, and the people began to take sides more than ever. Many people have identified themselves as friends. A local farmer and his wife with whom model studies were conducted said that the girls must go and live with them, and there they are now with plenty of friends and plenty to eat. Blessings have been showered upon them in the Lord’s</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“The office sent us some outlying </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription slips. We called on one of them. This lady never saw a Jehovah’s witness before, but had received a IVatchtoicer from a neighboring farm. She enjoyed it so much that she sent in a subscription. She spoke of it as if she was one of Jehovah’s -witnesses. She is now going each week to another farm farther into the country and having a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study with the lady there. We then called on the lady who had passed on </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and found she had all the books and had sent to America for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font4"> She had not seen any of Jehovah’s witnesses for more than five years, but had been witnessing herself, out in the wilds of Scotland. She and her daughter had gone to the cottages and farms round about with the booklets they had.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">AFTER THE TRIAL, WELLSTON, OHIO</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I had been standing on the street corner about an hour, when I decided to rest on a railing a half block back. It was the Saturday following my trial in which I was fined $25 and costs for ringing doorbells. A large number of townsfolk attended the trial. As I rested I heard someone shout, ‘Hi, you! come on and get on the job. I want one of those magazines.’ As I gave it to him he said: ‘I don’t believe in your d----religion, but there must</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">be something to it if this town had to go to all that trouble to try to stop it. I was at your trial the other day, and you sure got a dirty deal.’ He talked more, so I got his name and address and arranged to make a back-call. As he walked down the street he began telling everyone about it, showing them the magazine. I always find it best not to talk too much on the street corner, but arrange to call at their homes and let the phonograph do the talking,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">EDUCATIONAL WORK IN NORTH CAROLINA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“When I found her several years ago in the country she knew the least about everything of any person I ever met. Honestly, she did not even know she lived in North Carolina, had never been to school but three months in her life, and could neither read nor write. She had a burning desire to know the Lord and get understanding of the truth. She would sit as near my phonograph as she could and try to take in every word, but it was so hard for her to get the meaning. Then she did hard farm labor in the field to obtain the literature. Still she could not read it. I decided to spend quite a lot of time with her and teach her, and so I did. I made ABC’s for her to copy until she learned to write. She learned to read when I gave her a phonograph and records, which she could play over and over and follow the words in the booklets. I also began taking her to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font4">book study. When she began to get a little understanding she did not wait to be invited out in the service, but </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">asked </span><span class="font4">to be given a little territory near her home in the country. She would walk for miles and miles. When the special publisher work began, she at once set her goal at 175 hours and 50 back-calls. Then, when she got her questionnaire from the Society, was she happy 1”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">♦ G. T. Mitchell, the bigoted marshal of Croton, Ohio, is dead of fire burns. In the early part of 1941 Jehovah’s witnesses visited the village and were immediately the objects of illegal attack by the ignorant and conceited marshal now dead. Without any right or any authority to do so he boisterously ordered the witnesses to get out of town, shouting so that he could be heard a full block away. He followed some of the witnesses, and grabbed one young girl by the arm, rushing her to his car. She left the car and went right back to her work. He tried to incite a riot, but failed. All he did was to make one Christian girl cry because of his profanity and his threats. In August of the same year Marshal Mitchell was burning grass with a blowtorch, when his clothing caught fire and he died of the burns. One less bigot left to be slain at Armageddon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Mobocracy “Takes Over” Little Rock, Springfield, and Klamath Falls</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font10">HREE American cities fall to the dictators! Not to Hitler, Mussolini or Hirohito, but to dictators nonetheless. Dictatorial fingerprints are the same the world over; their mark is plain upon three American cities. Three American cities, geographically American, go totalitarian; but doubtless they would say any resemblance to Nazi Germany, real or imaginary, is purely coincidental. The dictators’ blitzkrieg against the “four freedoms” is on throughout the earth, and now it has struck here at home, from within. These three cities are totalitarian just as surely as if some unseen, gigantic hand had lifted them up out of the United States and set them down in Nazi Germany for three days; the conquest just , as complete as if the Nazi swastika whipped in the breeze overhead, as if Nazi storm-troopers goose-stepped through the streets below. Democracy has been overruled by officials and mobs in Little Rock, Ark., Springfield, Ill., and Klamath Falls, Oreg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While fighting for its life on many far-flung battle fronts against enemies from without, is democracy to be stabbed to death from within? On September 18, 19, and 20, demoniacal mobs in Little Rock, Springfield, and Klamath Falls deliriously shouted a bloody Yes! Do the majority of you people in these three cities join the demonized chorus, or will you by your actions answer with a thunderous No?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Certainly only outrageous deeds could support such a heavy charge. What are they? Just this: Hellish mobs loosed to overrun these cities unhindered; property destroyed, cars and trucks overturned, telephone lines cut, assembly halls damaged, bonfires of Bible literature crackling and blazing in the streets; crowds of men, women and children assailed; children stoned, teeth knocked out, noses broken; Christian women foully cursed, brutally beaten and then robbed; Christian men feloniously assaulted, clubbed, slugged with blackjacks, knifed and shot; victims left bleeding, clothing torn completely off some, others left lying unconscious in the bloodsoaked remnants of their apparel; bruised and beaten bodies cast off the road to lie for hours unattended and indeed left for dead, and the contemptible </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Arkansas Gazette</span><span class="font10"> felt so sure of it. that it plastered its front page with the headline, “Four May Be Dead”! In a later edition it carried many pictures of these brutally pummeled Christians, including the four it gleefully thought to be dead. Beneath the picture of these four sprawled grotesquely in the ditch where human devils had hurled them, this damnable </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font10"> viciously and cruelly says after discovering they weren’t dead: “However, it developed that they were either unconscious or ‘playing possum’.” How great must have been the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette’s</span><span class="font10"> disappointment! Such venomous insinuation would shame the most depraved, except the loathsome </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette.</span><span class="font10"> Such filthy sheets masquerading as public-spirited newspapers yet catering to bestial mobs have no influence with decent folk, in Arkansas or anywhere else. The apostle Paul was stoned, dragged outside the city and left for dead; but he rose and continued preaching. These four will do likewise!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What did the police do to quell these outrages'? Arrested seven of the mob victims, yawned, and said the incident was closed! In these three cities the local police made no arrests of mobsters, no charges, no arraignment before court; but rest assured that in these three blots on America during those three dark days these mobsters were identified, charged and convicted before the great Bar of Justice in Heaven, and that sentence has been passed, and shall be duly executed at Armageddon. They have been arraigned before the Judgment Seat alongside Hitler and other totalitarian-spirited devils, and though they may not be the “big shot” the one across the pond is, and may run in a different gang, they are in the same racket!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What unspeakable crimes provoked such violence? you ask. A Christian assembly! On September 18, 19, and 20, in 52 cities in the United States, over 80 throughout the world, simultaneous assemblies were arranged. Christians not knowing the Constitution had been shelved in Little Rock, Springfield, and Klamath Falls, these cities were included. The ones assembling were Jelibvah’s witnesses, a group grossly misrepresented because of their conscientious refusal (in obedience to God’s law) to salute any flag. (Exodus 20: 3-5) Jehovah’s witnesses have deepest respect for the American flag, adhere to the principles for which it. stands, give a pledge of allegiance to the laws of the nation; in short, render the worth-while and practical observance of all laws in harmony with the Constitution and God’s supreme law, as once stated by a federal judge. They favor democracy over any other form of human government, and hope for its continuance until God’s kingdom supersedes all human rule. It was in the interests of this Kingdom that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">New World Theocratic Assembly was arranged. Millions, doubtless including the mobsters, hypocritically pray for that Kingdom; other millions sincerely pray for it; Jehovah’s witnesses pray and work for it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Judases of Democracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The FBI has publicly announced the unquestionable patriotism of Jehovah’s witnesses and condemned mob violence against them; but what care anarchistic mobs for such democratic agencies? In the name of Americanism they practice anarchism. Oh yes, they’ll salute the flag till their arms drop from their sockets, and immediately turn and show by their actions their venomous hatred for the principles of which the flag is the emblem. Maybe these flag-desecraters would not openly salute the Nazi swastika, but in actions they salute and grovel before that emblem of brutal-itarianism and fchoose it as their standard to follow! They will salute the flag with the Judas kiss and then betray it to the methods of the modern totalitarian Caesars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Despite all opposition, however, the assemblies were held. The “important” men, officials and others, of these three cities made it plain Jehovah’s witnesses were not wanted by them in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font10"> city. Pressure by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the so-called “American” Legion caused the refusal of hall accommodations and even the breaking of one contract after another as they were signed. But the assemblies were arranged there anyway. Why? Because the Constitution of the United States grants freedom of assembly and worship to its citizens; because Little Rock, Springfield, and Klamath Falls are geographically still in the United States, though it may irk their “important” men; and, finally, because there must be honest people in these cities who would enjoy having a Christian assembly there and hearing the truths of God’s Word discussed. With civic leaders such as theirs, they are doubly in need of God’s comforting truths. The Lord commissions His witnesses to preach these truths everywhere, even in these three “sanctums of the mighty”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nineteen centuries ago like-minded men didn’t want Christ, and mobbed and killed Him. Bloody Europe under Roman Catholic despotism didn’t want His followers, and this unpopular minority came to America’s shores. Now inquisitional violence has pursued and overtaken Christ’s followers here, and temporarily destroyed democracy in Little Rock, Springfield, and Klamath Falls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But in these cities there are others (who are themselves Christian) who do not hate Christians. The necessarily harsh words used in an attempt to describe the acts of these mobs along with conniving officials, Legionnaires, Catholic priests, and others repugnant to honest persons, do not apply to many people in these three cities. Such gestapo storm-trooper tactics do not meet with their approval, just as the Hitlerian despotism on a larger scale in Europe does not meet with the approval of many there. The people have a right to know the facts of these cases. In view of the capitulation of a spineless press to mob rule and their failure to publish true accounts, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font10"> submits the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As this lurid tale unfolds one can hear this guilty one say, “It’s misrepresented,” and that one gnash his teeth and angrily retort, “It’s a lie”; but the facts testify, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“It is the truth!”</span><span class="font10"> Let the guilty officials and the misnamed “American” Legion and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy howl! What mobsters or mob sympathizers say is of no consequence. These pearls of truth are not for the swine. They are for the honest, the sincere, the people of good-will toward God. They are for Americans in fact. Americans are not in mobs, nor in sympathy with them. Americans do not run in packs. Wolves do, and among such the Lord said He would send His witnesses as sheep to test their integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But here are the facts for you honest-hearted ones; face them. They will speak, if you will listen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scene 1. Little Rock, Now “Little Reich”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is now against the law to be mobbed in Little Rock. Police, under the capable direction of Sheriff Gus Caple, are most efficient in enforcing this new unwritten law legalizing mobs. One must not disturb the peace of Little Rock mobs. The penalty, according to Judge Harb, is $25 fine, court costs, and thirty days in jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But to start at the beginning. Several suitable halls were refused Jehovah’s witnesses because of American Legion pressure. A contract was signed with the Missouri Pacific Booster Club, which they broke. Travelers Field was contracted for with the Little Rock Baseball Company, with the result gloatingly reported in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Arkansas Gazette: </span><span class="font10">“Earlier this week the Little Rock Baseball Company, at the request of members of the M. M. Eberts American Legion post, refused the society permission to meet at Travelers Field [the baseball company prefers &quot;playing ball’ with mobs]. Several members of the Eberts post stripped signs from Witnesses who were parading and distributing literature in Little Rock, Saturday. They asked the police to bar the society from the streets, but were told police had no authority to take such action so long as the paraders did not distribute literature [the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font10"> just said they were] or accost anyone.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Legion didn’t know how .the new law worked as yet, that merely destroying personal property and stripping signs from the backs of the Witnesses was not sufficient evidence that their (the Legion’s) peace had been disturbed, that the Witnesses must be mobbed and clubbed and shot before they could be properly arrested by the valorous Little Rock police. The police were willing, understand, but their hands were tied by a meager semblance of remaining democracy, This was on the 18th; on the 19th this “leaven” of democracy was purged out of “Little Reich” and the dictatorship under Fuehrer Caple burst into full bloom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A mob of 175, armed with pipes and heavy wrenches, attacked eight Witnesses at a filling station on Asher avenue, opening the assault with a hail of stones and bricks. Arthur Light, one of the Witnesses, was hit in the back with a brick and dropped paralyzed. He was subsequently jailed , and treatment for his injuries was denied. The mob stormed the filling station, demolished its equipment, and brutally beat the Witnesses. After the mob finished its grisly work, the police came, arrested five Witnesses, and refused to arrest any of their assailants. What caused the assault? The mobsters objected to a Bible lecture about God’s kingdom. The trailer-camp residents who later made up the mob tried to drown out the talk by playing their radios full blast and aimlessly running a huge caterpillar tractor around in circles. The con-ventioners did not object. After the lecture the convention moved to the Country Club Hospital, leaving the eight men behind to clean the grounds and care for the equipment. Then the mob deemed it safe to attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Leader of the Pack</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And now, though the convention had moved away from them and five Witnesses had been arrested, they were not content, but, intoxicated by their success they recruited a larger force and followed to the new location, some twenty miles out of Little Rock. Eighty cars were required to bring the mobsters. Note, if you please, the occupants of the leading car, as stated in an affidavit by a Witness: “I had been appointed signal man at the main entrance. A priest with four bodyguards drove up stating there was a bunch of men forming down the road and they were drinking, several of them drunk, and he heard them say they were going to drive Jehovah’s witnesses away from here. 'Now,’ he says, 'if I were you, I would get the women and children inside, because they mean business. They are going to beat all you guys up.’ He pulled down the road a block, stopped the car, and right after he left a clap was given, the signal for the mob to approach.” Why didn’t this priest face the mob, hold up his hand before them and cause them to disperse? That’s the way the newspapers always paint their valor in quelling rioting strikers. If afraid to do this, Why didn’t he at least call the police, as a Christian would have done? Why did he stop a short distance away? The reason is, he instigated the whole thing and led his devilish storm-troopers to the spot; otherwise, merely driving along the highway in a car he’d never have known so much about the mob and their objectives. He came ahead to get the women and children . out of the way because excessive injury to them would be too odious publicity for his witch-hunt. The Hierarchy are backing Hitler tooth and nail and favor his methods, regardless of their propaganda speeches to the contrary. This was nothing less than a modern crusade led by a priest and sanctioned by the officials!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This Witness further states in his affidavit: “The truck [driven by a Witness] drove up and they stopped it. I didn’t see, as I was watching the two men after me, but shortly afterward I could hear terrible noises from that Witness and could hear them beating him, and Witness Hurd also was able to hear this. The newspaper photographer was along in the gang, second car from the rear.” Perhaps this explains the pictures, looking like scenes from a German concentration camp, splashed all over Little Rock papers. Evidently this photographer was from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette;</span><span class="font10"> for that paper boasted: “The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">[Gazette]</span><span class="font10"> photographer </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">who accompanied the group </span><span class="font10">[mob] into the grounds snapped a picture of the armed Witnesses immediately before the fight started. . . . Maybe it was loyalty to his newspaper, maybe it was appreciation of the dramatic, and maybe it was just plain damned foolishness, but Joe Wirges, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font10"> photographer-reporter, rushed out in front of the attacking party to snap this picture of the embattled Jehovah’s witnesses. ... A second later, as the intrepid Wirges stepped back, a shot was fired, the attacking party moved in and the fight was on. . . . Most of those beaten were searched for literature, which was handed to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font10"> reporters. . . . Soldiers and army officers in some of the automobiles stopped to learn what was going on. They were invited to join the attack, but none accepted [they are fighting to preserve, not destroy, democracy].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The admitted “damned foolishness” of Wirges is that he would be loyal to such a cause as Fascism and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette. </span><span class="font10">Apparently the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font10"> reporters knew all about the mob’s plans, yet didn’t report it to the police; or possibly did, so that the police could be conveniently absent. The noble </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font10"> applauds, saying, “The mob went about its predetermined program in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">orderly manner.”</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> A </span><span class="font10">mob orderly! Whoever heard such asinine stupidity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Power of the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ten Witnesses, armed with sticks, held the gate against a hundred priest-led mobsters armed with clubs, pipes, blackjacks, knives, and guns. Several shots rang out, two Witnesses fell, one shot in the leg, the other in the hip. One of these was a 57-year-old man. The Witnesses’ line held, however, and the mobsters retreated to the road. By the Lord’s power His people won the decision over demonism, holding their meeting as scheduled. The odds against the Witnesses were ten to one, and the cowardly wolves, who had held back till the stragglers of their pack had come up to assure this numerical advantage, moved in for what they thought to be the “kill”. Scared individually, 100 encouraged one another, with the aid of liquor, to assault 10 Witnesses; the anarchists, armed with guns, the Christians with insignificant sticks, but with the all-important power of Jehovah God. Jehovah gave the victory. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font10"> admits it, giving the account thus: “The battle started when about 100 of the pipeline workers, armed, with guns, sticks, blackjacks and pipe, swarmed into the hospital grounds about 8 p.m. ... About 10 Witnesses blocked the road about 150 yards from the highway, and the trouble started when the angered pipeliners started through. Six or seven shots were fired during the struggle which lasted about five minutes. The Witnesses swung heavy sticks and successfully resisted the assault despite their injuries. Their opponents retreated into the surrounding woods and back to the gate leading from the highway.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There they stopped cars and assaulted isolated Witnesses where the odds were more favorable, a hundred against one or two. According to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette,</span><span class="font10"> clothing was stripped from two Witnesses and burned, along with Bible literature and the upholstery of cars overturned by the gangsters. All traffic on the road was stopped and car occupants were asked, “Are you one of Jehovah’s witnesses?” If the answer was ‘Yes’ they were dragged forth and beaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">No Witness from the Country Club Hospital could come out to give first aid to the wounded without being attacked. Here’s the way in which a resourceful and devoted servant of the Lord, Clarence Bradley, aided a fellow Witness, as recounted by an eye-witness: “One of the bravest acts was that of a colored pioneer Witness who, in seeing what happened, stripped down to his ‘natural suit’, walked down through the woods to the place of fighting, picked up a Witness who was shot in the leg and carried him to the building, unseen by the enemy because of the night.” Blaine Arnold, a Witness, was badly beaten over the head, his face gashed and big blisters raised clear across his back. As shown by a picture in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Arkansas Democrat, </span><span class="font10">his clothing had been entirely torn off and his face covered with blood. He hasn’t been arrested yet. The police finally arrived, but found no Witnesses to arrest this time, as most of those assaulted were under doctor’s care. Plenty of the priest’s lawless mob were about, but the officers didn’t want them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The next afternoon, Sunday, the police arrested two more violators of the new unwritten law of Little Rock, Clarence Costly and Fred Smith. They went to the filling station on Asher avenue, not knowing the Sunday meeting had been changed to the Country Club Hospital. They were summarily assaulted. Costly’s affidavit states: “They got me off my feet, stretched me out in the air, and hit me about the head and shoulders and across the hips. Some hit me with their fists, and a woman, I know, hit me with a blackjack.” The statement relates' how Sheriff McDonald stopped the assault and called Sheriff Caple. Caple was going to take them away in his car and, the affidavit continues, “about that time a big fellow walked in and said, ‘Now listen here, Sheriff, I’m an American Legion [the password?] and I run this barber shop here. I’m not going to have nothing like that around here. The best thing you can do, Sheriff, is to take them away.’ ” Caple and the officer with him [Aklin] gladly obeyed, vilely cursing their prisoners as they took them to jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The total arrested now was seven, all held without charges’ being made. Here’s an enlightening report on Dictator Gus Caple: A statement made by two of the Witnesses he hauled into jail asserted that he threatened them by saying he would be willing to string them up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Who Tipped Off the Mob?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Later that day the fourth mobbing took place. It was on this occasion that some of the mobsters said, “The police sent us.” The Assembly was scheduled to continue on into Sunday evening. The mob knew this. The evening session was canceled. The mob didn’t know this. As the final work was being done preparatory to leaving, Sheriff Gus Caple was there. One Witness who had some responsibility in directing the Assembly writes: “Mr. Caple seemed much surprised to find we were preparing to close the convention, and shortly left for Little Rock [20 miles away]. About thirty minutes later the majority of the conventioners headed for Little Rock.... The mob was waiting on the Arch St. Road just outside the city limits of Little Rock.” How did these devils know to be there at this time to continue their hideous rampage? How did they know the Witnesses were leaving early? Were they lying when they said the police sent them? You be the judge. It is reported Gestapo Chief Caple said he’d like to lead the mob. He didn’t, because the priest beat him to it, but he flatly refused to stop it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The' highway was blocked, traffic stopped, and those who were Jehovah’s witnesses were treated in the same brutal fashion as on the previous evening. After some time the state police arrived. One drunk mobster prowled about with a knife in one hand and a baseball bat in the other, doing his gruesome work. The police merely told him to “go home”. No one was arrested. Here’s a portion of the affidavit of one of the women, Janet Patterson, assaulted at this session of the demons’ spree: “I met a car and the old woman in the back seat said, ‘There she is!’ They turned around and followed me and he cut me off. They dragged me out of the car. They were all round me hollering at me and slapping me, and some woman hit me over the head with a cane two or three times. Some of the men would have killed me but others sorta held them back and said, ‘Let the women at her first, and then if they don’t do it, we’ll finish her ourselves.’ They pulled my thumb back, spraining it. The woman who attacked me had a big goiter on her neck [so identified by other victims also] and her teeth were all stained with tobacco. I asked her if she thought the Lord would approve what they were doing, and she said ‘Yes'. [See John 16:</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">2.]</span><span class="font10"> They said something about getting the FBI, and I said, ‘You can get the FBI or the law, either one, and turn me over to them’; and they said, ‘It was the law that sent us!’ They ransacked my car and purse and got my money [$10], driver’s license, Social Security card, hospitalization card, and my hat. When they let me go they told me to get in the car and get out of town and stay out and not come back, but about that time the police came and they just told them to not block the highway and they didn’t arrest anyone.” Days later Mrs. Patterson was still confined in bed with a black eye, battered nose and body bruises, hardly able to move. And the mob-shielding </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette </span><span class="font10">once said: “Only men of the sect were assailed.” This newspaper never saw fit to air the mob’s atrocities against women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And the police couldn’t identify any of the assailants. Four mobbings in two days by the same gang, and none identified! Were the police so unbelievably incompetent, or—? Mobsters bragged ‘The police sent us’. Refusal of police to arrest them, and their alacrity to snatch up and jail the victims, substantiate the mob’s boast. Little Rock and Pulaski county pay their police. The peace officers accept the money. Why? To maintain order and preserve civil rights by apprehending law-breakers? Apparently not. To protect those unlawfully assaulted by mobs and arrest the mobsters? No. To protect the mobbers and arrest the mobbed? Apparently this is the reason they accept their pay; for it’s the service they render. Surely that isn’t the reason the people of Arkansas put them in office and pay them. Doubtless these officials would pretend to render services and accept pay for upholding civil liberties; they gain money under false pretenses! Nullifying the law by indifference and discrimination and wrongful application, they set themselves up as dictators as to to whom it shall apply and to whom it shall not apply, as to who shall or shall not have freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font10"> quoted Sheriff Caple as saying he had given the Witnesses until 6 p. m. Sunday to be outside the county limits. The dictator speaking! Obviously the man idolizes Hitler’s methods if not Hitler personally. It’s these totalitarian methods that Americans hate, without or within, openly or in the hypocritical “fifth column” disguise of patriotism!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Final Curtain</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Two of the seven arrested Witnesses were convicted in Judge Harb’s court, fined $25 and $6.90 court costs and given thirty days in jail. Oscar H. Winn, a Little Rock lawyer, had offered to defend the Witnesses without charge, as published in the newspapers. In response to an anonymous letter, this man went to the vicinity of the Asher avenue filling station and was mobbed and had to be taken to the University hospital. Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Harry Robinson said one of his alleged assailants, “a man named Gwynn,” who operates a barber shop, wasn’t home when he called. He said there may be no charges and he “just wanted to make additional investigation”. Gwynn was identified as a participant in the mobs assaulting Jehovah’s witnesses, too. He’s working overtime for Fascism. Of course, this time there were no charges or arrests made, as there were none of Jehovah’s witnesses lying around battered up by the mob, to be arrested. Those incredible police could always identify the Witnesses!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One Witness in attendance follows his account of the violence with the words, “But by Jehovah’s grace we had an assembly, and we continue to pray that we may be found ‘blameless in the day of our Lord!’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sheriff Caple said, “The incident is closed.” Closed indeed! He’s not the one who will dismiss this case! Jehovah God, by the execution of His righteous judgments at Armageddon, will ring down the final curtain on this revived Inquisition against His servants in Little Rock, Arkansas!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scene II. Springfield, Illinois</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;Strangers and sojourners upon the earth, dwelling in tents.’ That is the picture given of Abraham and the other faithful men of olden times. That picture was literally fulfilled by those who are Christ’s, hence Abraham’s seed, at the New World Theocratic Assembly in Springfield. Visualize several acres just outside Springfield covered with over seventy tents, dominated by the huge tent of assembly in the center accommodating over 2,000 persons. This camp of God’s people had plenty of the antitypical demonized Philistines howling about, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But why tents? .you ask. Doesn’t Springfield have any auditoriums? Yes, but it is like that other city that pushed the human mother of Jesus off into manger accommodations. A contract had been signed to use the Lanphier Baseball Park, but was canceled. Great sums of money had been expended by the Witnesses in extensive advertising; but no matter. Mr. MacWherter, superintendent who signed the contract with the Witnesses, said he had no authority to do so, had never before signed a contract of this kind. His keepers shouldn’t let him play with a loaded fountain pen. The Witnesses were referred to Frank Buedel, who substantiated Mac-Wherter’s cancellation, as the authoritative one; but he couldn’t be seen. He was attending an American Legion convention in Peoria. These Little Rock and Springfield businessmen scrap contracts as easily as Hitler does treaties!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mob violence against the Witnesses flared forth Sunday morning, September 20, when they were out inviting the people to the afternoon lecture to come in from Cleveland, Ohio. When some of the Witnesses were assaulted the city police told them to ‘go back to the country, where they belonged’ (the tent just beyond the city limits). Numerous mobbings took place, Witnesses were severely beaten—one suffering a broken leg—cars were damaged, and literature was burned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here’s a sample of Springfield’s city police, as shown in an affidavit by Viola Deutsch: “I was engaged in the street magazine work, about noon today, almost in front of the police station. I saw three men run in and out of the station and stand in front talking with a policeman. The three men had a flag and came and surrounded me and tried to tear my bag off, and one man reached in and tore my literature and threw it in the street. They ordered me to get in the car, but I walked across and spoke to the policeman who witnessed the affair. He said, ‘Go into the station and talk to the sergeant.’ I went in and explained what had happened. He talked loud and said we had no right to expect the police to protect us, as we were only stirring up trouble, and that he did not intend to protect us. He gave me no opportunity to speak, but ordered me out of the station.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another group of Witnesses who were assaulted had obtained pictures of their assailants. The police confiscated the camera, and the affidavit of one of these Witnesses states: “This afternoon we went down to the station to retrieve the camera. The sergeant, who would not identify himself other than as ‘just one of the boys [mobsters]’, said, among other things, that if the camera wasn’t demolished when it was brought in, he would see that it was.” This disgraceful specimen, along with others of the Springfield police force, gave the “green light” to the mob, his “boys”, and is guilty of criminal negligence and nonfeasance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the Witnesses did go back to the “country”, their tent, for the Assembly, the mob wasn’t satisfied. They followed. Long before the lecture the mob began to form. It is reliably reported that the Catholic priests Sunday morning in their Baal temples agitated their blind dupes, and doubtless sent them out just as did the religionists in the days of the apostles. (Acts 17:5-8) About a thousand of these mobsters, along with more than two thousand Witnesses, heard the talk. The priests had better keep their blind ones away: their eyes might be opened, and then they’d turn on their former prison-keepers. (See Revelation 17:16.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the end of the talk one of the troublemakers struck at a Witness with a stick, and was escorted from the grounds. The mob surged forward with clubs, and the state police, who were indifferent as to halting mob rule, threw gas bombs on Witnesses and mob alike. As a result of the melee that followed, one Witness, Earl Windhorst, who was assaulted, was falsely arrested, jailed, and beaten again that night by the inmates of the jail. He was released next morning on $500 bail. Two of the gangsters, Rex Easton and R. Rogers, were taken into custody; but don’t be so stupid as to think they were held. They were two of the sergeant’s “boys”! That morning a cripple Witness, reported to have an artificial leg, was the victim of a cowardly assault, with the result that his other leg was broken. He was taken to the hospital. His assailants go free, in harmony with the ethics of Springfield’s city police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">One American in Springfield</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sheriff Eielson was one peace officer there who did his job. He is to be commended. He is against mobocracy. (Can’t you decent people of Springfield find more like him to represent you? His </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">type </span><span class="font10">of man seems rare around there.) In an attempt to dispel the mob, he asked the Witnesses about flying the American flag over the main tent, saying, “If you put a flag up, these [Catholic] Irish will leave.” The Witnesses, of course, had no objections. It was done. The Associated Press reports this, accompanied with the lie that the Witnesses saluted it and that the “spectators” cheered and left. A statement of the facts was given to the newspapers, but they invariably prefer publishing lies instead of the truth. The Witnesses did not compromise in their conscientious belief about saluting any flag, but did show their respect by standing, and some applauded. According to federal law, duringflag-saluting ceremonies full respect is shown by civilians by merely standing at attention! But compliance with the federal laws isn’t enough for those favoring totalitarian forced salutes. The AP delights in calling mobs “spectators” and “patriotic”, and the devils didn’t leave, as the AP account says, but continued their demoniacal howls far into the night. The Witnesses held their evening meetings in the main tent, circling all their cars and trailers around the outside as the old western pioneers did their wagon trains when resisting attacks by wild Indians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Officials conferred with those directing the Assembly, urging them to cancel the evening session. Jehovah’s witnesses did not quit, not being bluffed by the mob. One Witness writes: “By the Lord’s grace, we stood our ground and Jehovah gave the victory. Most of the friends stayed till the close, and thus enjoyed the added blessing of the closing Assembly and were not molested by the mob when leaving the grounds, whereas many of those leaving earlier had to run through a barrage of rocks thrown by the mobsters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After the last evening meeting Sheriff Eielson demonstrated, in addition to his love for democracy, his good-will toward the Lord by showing kindness to His servants. A witness reports: “Sheriff Eielson, of Sangamon county, co-operated in every way he could. When taxi service was stopped, Mr. Eielson made about twenty trips taking the friends to various depots from the convention grounds. By this time the police had succeeded in pushing back the mob (by use of riot guns) several blocks away from the convention grounds.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nearly a hundred Witnesses spent the night in their city of tents, “pulling stakes” early next morning for their respective territories, determined to continue the fight against demonism until Jehovah’s Armageddon victory cleanses the earth of all workers of violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scene III. Nazi fled Klamath Falls</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For the third nightmare in this gruesome drama of democracy’s “black-out” travel “west, where men are men”, but not in Klamath Falls. Why not? A heavy stone hurled by Klamath Falls sails through the air and smashes a little girl full in the face, knocking out her teeth and breaking her nose! There are other reasons. What’s more, Klamath Falls dictators do not want any real men and women there. Jehovah’s witnesses were unable to locate any suitable halls that would be rented to them. Finally, and as a last resort, a vacated automobile salesroom was obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Little Rock launched for separate mobbings; Klamath Falls went “all out” for mobocracy in one big “putsch”. Sunday, September 20, was “der tag”. Briefly, here’s what happened: The mob set up a war bond booth across the street from the meeting hall, played patriotic music, and vehemently urged the Witnesses to buy bonds. The Witnesses were inside listening to a Bible lecture. (Does this mob go to Catholic and Protestant churches during Sunday services and call for the religious flock to desert the services to buy bonds? The fact that they would come during a meeting to sell bonds shows they were not sincere, but there to incite trouble. Something strange and incongruous about those who sell bonds to preserve democracy, yet practice mobocracy!) The howling mob swelled to 1,500, rock-throwing began, followed by a futile attempt to storm the meeting. The rioters did not break up the Assembly as the “wishful thinking” Klamath Falls </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Herald and News </span><span class="font10">claimed. One preferring Fascism to constitutional government started cutting the wires bringing in the talk “Peace— Can It Last?” from Cleveland, Ohio. A score of witnesses rushed out to prevent this. Subsequently the wire was cut. Democracy-hating townspeople tried to force open with crowbars the now heavily barricaded door, to completely destroy freedom of assembly and worship, since the talk continued, though the wires were cut. It was being read over a microphone inside the building. Furious fighting at this door ended in defeat for the mob, who retired to the front of the hall. Literature and phonographs were piled in the street and burned. These devilish fiends favoring mob rule, called “patriotism” by the Associated Press, hurled stones and stench bombs, breaking the windows and injuring men, women and children alike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For over four hours the Witnesses were besieged. During that time the modern crusaders pillaged and plundered, overturning and demolishing many cars —estimates vary from 25 to 200. The siege was lifted by arrival of the state militia, called by Jehovah’s witnesses. The AP, which glibly lied against the Witnesses in Springfield, paints the Klamath Falls mob as docile and law-abiding, saying: “Peace was restored after Gov. Charles A. Sprague had appealed from Salem for the crowd to disperse.” These anarchists were dispersed only by the decisive action of the state militia, who threatened to use their riot guns, and by no mere “appeal”. The AP and UP both lied flagrantly; but why waste space with lies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Fighters for the New World”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here’s a truthful and gripping account by Ruby Morse, a Witness who was present:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“About 1:30 the ushers, hearing a noise in the alley, opened the side door, and that was when the big rumpus started. I was sitting with the children about center front hall, and as the door slid open we could see fists flying, as well as clubs. Then suddenly the lecture stopped, and that meant the enemy had succeeded in cutting the wires. We could see the rear door slide open and then suddenly shut, about five times, and clubs flying. The Witnesses captured about ten of them. One was a former post commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. He was looking pretty sorrowful with one big gash across his face as well as eyes swollen shut, and, as Jim put it, ‘just a sample of what these New World fighters can really do; and, believe me, am I glad I had a privilege of taking part in it!’ It was wonderful to hear him say that, as before he just wouldn’t take his stand. [Just the day previous the Witnesses had enjoyed a lecture from Cleveland entitled “Fighters for the New World” and the Witnesses in all three of these demon strongholds certainly acquitted themselves as faithful and zealous ‘fighters for the New World’!]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The enemy finally fell back when they saw how many of them were being captured, and as soon as all the Witnesses were inside they locked the door. Then the rock-throwing began real heavy all around us. While all this was going on we still had children trouble; so Gilbert took over the mike [the lecture had been finished] and told us, ‘This is what we’ve been expecting; let’s take it like Jehovah’s people should.’ Before many minutes we were all singing, Who Is on the Lord’s Side ?’ and ‘Give Praise to Jehovah’, and many other of the Lord’s songs, with Gilbert leading the singing—he that can’t sing a note. It was funny, and all the children laughed with me as they too joined in the singing [the singing continued four hours].</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The mob threw in a full box of burning kerosene rags. The children took it like brave little soldiers. Gay-Lea kept saying through her tears, ‘Mother, Jehovah won’t let His people be killed, will He ?’ and that made us pray for His help all the more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The police were more scared than we. All women and children had been put toward the rear side of the building, with the men all around us. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The enemy then threw in a large rock, which hit a little girl square in the face, knocking out her teeth and breaking her nose.</span><span class="font10"> By that time we were all ready to fight! Later a Marine sergeant came inside. This marine said he was for us; he had been outside, pleading with the crowd to go away and leave us alone as we were minding our own business. Some left; very few. He said he’d rather fight on our side, as from the looks of things the Witnesses were clean, good fighters [the papers mentioned a Marine recruiting officer who appealed to the crowd to go home; few left].</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“We were told to go home [after the militia had the mob under control], and on reaching the parking lot we saw more destruction. As far as we could see every J. w. car was overturned. As soon as the Witnesses got to the lot they began righting the cars, not saying a word. The militia captain, speaking over his loudspeaker said: ‘You Jehovah’s witnesses, please get in your cars and leave as soon as possible. We are trying to protect you and do our best, but please hurry.’ And here were some of the cars with tires stolen, cut; the cars they couldn’t turn over they had rammed the radiators full of holes, pulled out connecting wires, threw away tops of distributors, and put sugar in the gasoline tanks! [Some of the Witnesses were still stranded at the hall late that night, their cars a total wreck.]”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Following is another report by the one in charge of the Assembly, giving more details and exposing the conspirators against the “four freedoms”. The writer claims every statement can be proved in court. Here it is: “[During the rioting] a well-known doctor (we have his name) tossed a gallon jug half-full of ammonia and it burst on the concrete floor among the women and children [the chief of police, Earl Heuvel, stepped aside to let him do it] and the ushers had to fight their way with the children through this awful odor and poison gas, with the children screaming and the mobsters cursing and breaking glass and throwing rotten eggs, tomatoes and other things. The ammonia served a purpose against the mobsters, because they could not enter the building themselves; and that gave the ushers opportunity to get the women and children into the main building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“During this time the ushers were in a gripping struggle with the mobs at the rear of the building. They caught the gangster that cut the telephone wires and took the hack saw from him and brought him into the hall [this “thing” and one other were caught red-handed and turned over to the police, who promptly released them to continue their sinister work!]. . . . All this time the chief of police and other policemen stood by and never tried to do anything, but finally the chief saw that he could get inside the main building and came busting in with another policeman with a sawed-off shotgun and paraded among little children and women, not trying to do anything with the mob outside. One policeman was standing in the main door and some one of the mob threw a tomato and hit him, and all of a sudden he drew out a special chrome-colored gun and fired; and that was the extent of the police resistance. About 2:30 the chief stepped upon a chair and ordered: ‘Your convention is all over. Stop milling around and go home. It will make it easier on me; I’m tired.’!!! . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The seven o’clock session was carried out, by the Lord’s grace. When I was reading the ‘President’s Message’ the chief appeared again and wanted the convention stopped. During that time another mob was formed and led by a well-known American Legion (Fred H. Heilbronner [the H for ‘Heil’ or Hitler?]) and went to the Kingdom Hall, at 201 East Main St., carried out counters, Bibles, books, phonographs, cabinets, went into the rear apartment, where ten pioneers slept, and took their clothes and carried everything into the street and burned it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“It was well known that on Saturday night different lodges and unions met to stop this Assembly, and they had planned to storm the auditorium Saturday night but the gang got so intoxicated they could not get anyone to take the lead. The radio station here in Klamath Falls broadcast on Wednesday 6 p.m. by a commentator that a delegate called on police chief Heuvel and the chief said you can do anything you want to to Jehovah’s witnesses. All this trouble seems to have been hatched with the city attorney [Attorney Carnahan was quoted in the papers as saying Sunday’s measures against the Witnesses ‘were effective’], city council, chief of police, the American Legion, AFL unions, and the Eagle lodge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Good Citizens” of Klamath Falls</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This statement then identifies some of the mobsters as follows: Heilbronner, Legionnaire and draft board member; Harvey Martin, city councilman; Kenneth Gordon, AFL leader. and of the Eagle lodge; Ben Gibson, insurance agent; Ted Case, draft board clerk; and Dr. Adler, the ammonia-throwing M. D.; and, as identified by the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Herald and News,</span><span class="font10"> John Chase, former post commander of Veterans of Foreign Wars and now a police officer!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Comment on Klamath Falls is difficult, baffling. That citizens would have such a motley crew of Fascist-minded men to represent them is dumfounding. The people elected them; they are responsible for them. And the police had the ringleader who cut the wire dropped in their lap, and let him go! If it were possible Klamath Falls’ Heuvel is worse than Little Rock’s Caple, but it isn’t. They are triplets—Caple, Heuvel, Hitler!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An editorial in the Klamath Falls </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Herald and News</span><span class="font10"> comments, saying Jehovah’s witnesses asked for the violence; created a situation that caused this strongly patriotic American community to momentarily suspend law and order; that the townspeople’s resentment could be understood since the country was fighting for things that made it possible for the Witnesses to freely operate; that it hoped Sunday’s “incident” served a “good” purpose; and spoke of the “good citizens of such communities as ours”. No </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font10"> community suspends law and order, even momentarily; no one, not even a moron, could understand why people would resent Jehovah’s witnesses’ exercising freedom of worship and assembly because the country is fighting to preserve those very liberties; mob rule never serves a good purpose; and the only ones qualifying as good citizens of communities devoted to mobocracy would be mobsters, just as stormtroopers are good citizens of Nazidom!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Did that thick-skulled editor approve the “good citizens’ ” demolishing cars, burning Bible literature, making a hall a shambles, assaulting Christians and denying United States citizens one of the “four freedoms”? Did he, like the AP, think the “good citizens” were fired with “patriotism” when they went down and flung </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> heavy rock full in the face of a little girl, knocking out her teeth and breaking her nose? Just as sure as there is a God in heaven, a terrible vengeance will be wreaked upon such devils that make earth a hell! Such atrocities fill honest men with righteous indignation; how much more so the all-righteous Jehovah God. His King Christ Jesus said: “Whoso shall offend one of these little ones who believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea!” Rest assured the Lord has identified the one who threw that rock! And if all these atrocities don’t make your blood boil it isn’t red!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Are these things what America is fighting to save? Honest millions througliout the country emphatically answer No! But what do we hear from Little Rock, Springfield/ and Klamath Falls ? Silence. Literal stench bombs were smelled in Klamath Falls, but the far greater stench of decayed democracy reeks from these three cities and drifts over the U. S. and is foul in the nostrils of Americans. It seems fragrant in Germany; for Hitler has boasted this country would go from within. These mobs and officials would prove him right. Above all, the stench of mobocracy against Jehovah’s servants reaches to the high heavens, will be traced to its source, and for ever extinguished at Armageddon!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The churches raise no protesting voice against this destruction of freedom of worship. Why? Because they are like the religious clergy of Jesus’ day who were willing to subject themselves to totalitarianism, saying, “We have no king but [dictator] Caesar!” in order to “get” Christ Jesus. The clergy today would pay the price of accepting Fascism to rid themselves of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Shall the Answer Be?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is strange that democratic people have totalitarian-spirited officials to represent them. Liking Jehovah’s witnesses is not the issue, but right and wrong principles. You people of these three cities who love democracy and hate mobocracy, can’t you see the injustice of it? Do you approve of it? wink at it? You cannot dodge the responsibility; you elected these men. You chose them. To do this? If not, then changes are in order. It’s your move. The officials of Jerusalem, both in Jeremiah’s and in Jesus’ day, brought innocent blood upon the city’s inhabitants by injuring Jehovah’s servants. (Jeremiah 26:15; Acts 5:28) When Jehovah’s Executioner makes inquisition for blood at Armageddon, He will find bloodguilt upon these three cities because of their officials. Will you let them sweep you into destruction with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Democracy in your cities has fallen. Will you regain the ground lost to Hit-leresque usurpers of government by the people? Demonized men will try to intimidate you, but, remember, “the fear of man bringeth a snare.” (Proverbs 29:25) Perhaps these three cities may be retaken by level-headed, honest-hearted, freedom-loving Americans who are not terrorized into silence by these cheap, pocket-size editions of Adolf Hitler! It is hoped so. It isn’t too late. This battle to regain freedom must be waged by stout-hearted Americans. The fight must be fought in the democratic way, in the courts and other duly constituted bodies to safeguard constitutional rights; not by gangster methods under a cloak of feigned patriotism. Constitutional liberties are what Jehovah’s witnesses desire to protect. And to do it they will fight mobs, “law officers,” judges, the press and all others who condemn the innocent and justify the wicked!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s witnesses knew the American Legion and Catholic religio-political groups and other admirers of Hitleristic methods did not want Christians to meet in these three cities, but the Witnesses are not interested in those who would have the country run from Papal Rome. They are interested in “sheep”, not in “goats”. Surely in Little Rock, Springfield and Klamath Falls there must be some of the Lord’s “other sheep” who sigh and cry because of such abominable acts as herein described. If you live in one of these fallen bastions of democracy, and if you are of sheeplike meekness and desire to be gathered into the one fold of the Great Shepherd, then, by God’s grace, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to visit you and give you opportunity to take your stand for the great Theocracy and against mobocracy! So doing, you will, until Christ’s Theocratic Government replaces all worldly rule, be as “salt” to preserve the best form of human government ever existing at any time in any place, namely, democracy!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Will some people of good-will toward God be found in these three cities, or will mob rule make necessary the application of Jesus’ counsel, ‘Depart out of those cities and shake off their dust from your feet,’ and thus bring divine punishment upon themselves worse than that suffered by Sodom and Gomorrah? (Matthew 10:14,15,22,23) Will Little Rock, Springfield and Klamath Falls continue following in the footsteps of typical Sodom and Gomorrah, mobbing God’s servants, ‘not having even ten righteous therein,’ and thus suffer fiery destruction at Armageddon, or will they repent as did the great city Nineveh, and be spared? Time holds the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As for Jehovah’s witnesses, they will continue serving the Most High, come what may. Jehovah is their strength and protection. Remember the King Christ Jesus’ words: ‘As ye have done unto the least of these my brethren, so have ye done unto me.’ No man can bring just retribution for those vile deeds. Jehovah’s witnesses have no desire to. From the throne of heaven comes in solemn, measured tones the voice of the Most High: “Vengeance is mine; I will repay!” His people wait upon Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Did It Just Happen at Pryor?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Shortly after Pryor, Oklahoma, beat up Jehovah’s witnesses a storm swept the town, doing $1,000,000 worth of damage, killing nearly or quite 100 persons and injuring 300 more. The Devil in his wrath at being cast out of heaven is responsible for such storms and woes before the battle of Armageddon. (Revelation 12:12) It would be a very easy thing for one of Jehovah’s holy angels to deflect such a storm away from one who had been kind to one of God’s little ones.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Does Soul Exist After Death?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">N</span><span class="font10">OVEMBER 2 is observed by religionists as “All Souls’ Day”. What is this thing called “soul”? A reading of the article “Soul” in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font10"> Volume XIV, leaves it very uncertain and foggy as to exactly what a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">soul</span><span class="font10"> is. It says: “Origen taught the pre-existence of the soul. Terrestrial life is a punishment and a remedy for prenatal sin. ‘Soul’ is properly degraded spirit: flesh is a condition of alienation and bondage. . . . Spirit, however, finite spirit, can exist only in a body, albeit of a glorious and ethereal nature.” It says further: “The mutual compenetra-tion of soul and body in their activities is just what Catholic philosophy (anticipating positive science) had taught for centuries. Man is two and one, a divisible but a vital unity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The only authority on </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">soul</span><span class="font10"> is the written Word of the great Creator of souls, namely, the sacred Bible. It clearly answers the question, Does soul exist after death ? Against what did God manifest His justice after man’s original transgression in Eden? Did man’s Creator sentence the body of man or the soul to death ? Is religion true in teaching that the soul of man is immortal? and if so, how could God put it to death?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is helpful to define terms before attempting to discuss them. The definition given should be supported by proof from the Bible. Let us do this before answering the question here asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Immortal” applies to that which can not die or something that can not be destroyed in death. “Soul,” as referring to man, means a moving, breathing, sentient creature, that is, a creature possessing faculties and using them. To understand whether a soul is immortal or not it is first essential that we determine from the Bible what constitutes a human soul. The Creator’s Word, at Genesis 2:7, reads: “The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” Hence the word </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">soul</span><span class="font10"> is here equal in meaning with the words “creature” and “man”. The dust out of which the Lord God Jehovah formed man’s body was not conscious; it had no life in it. After God had used the elements of the earth to form the body, He breathed into its nostrils the breath of lives, which breath animated the body, caused the lungs to begin to work, and sent the blood tingling through the arteries of the body and returning through the veins. Therefore there resulted a moving, breathing, sentient creature, a man, which is a soul. There was no “pre-existence of the soul”, such as the Alexandrian scholar; Origen, claimed. Man’s body aside from the breath does not constitute the soul; but it requires the uniting of the breath with the body to constitute the human soul. And when the breath separates from the body the living soul no longer exists. The Holy Scriptures do not say that God breathed into man’s body immortality, or a spark of His own person, but merely that the soul resulted by animating with breath the human body after it had been created. Such animation, therefore, resulted from the breath of lives which God breathed into the nostrils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As an illustration, a locomotive may be used. It stands upon the railroad track with no fire in the box, no water in the boiler, hence no steam. It is spoken of as a dead engine. Then the steam is produced by heating the water and is forced into the cylinders of the engine, the throttle being open, and the locomotive moves. Withdraw the steam and it stops. Of course, the locomotive is not equipped with any brain and hence needs a man at the throttle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As to the human soul: When the body was formed it would be inanimate and inactive while without breath. When the breath of life was breathed by God’s power into the nostrils and the body organs began to functionate, man was then a breathing creature, hence “a living soul”. When he ceased to breathe he was dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">According to the Maker’s Word, man is a soul; he does not possess a soul divisible from the body. Every creature on earth that breathes is a soul. To the lower orders of animals created long before man’s creation God’s Word applies the words “living soul”. (See marginal reading of Genesis 1: 20.) That all breathing creatures are included under the term “souls” is proved by Jehovah’s words, at Numbers 31:28: “Levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep.” Accordingly all souls die alike, as stated at Ecclesiastes 3:19, 20: “For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity. All go unto one place: all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the manifestation of divine justice God the Giver of life said to the man Adam: “Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat . . . : for in the day that thou eatest thereof, dying thou shalt die.” (Genesis 2:17, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font10"> When man rebelled and sinned, this sentence was pronounced against man, the creature, the soul. If there could be any doubt about this, it is definitely settled by another statement in God’s Word, which reads: “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4, 20) That not merely the body goes to the grave, note Psalm 89:48: “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The religious idea of immortal human souls originated with man’s enemy, Satan the Devil. He approached man’s wife. Eve, and said: ‘If you eat of this forbidden tree, you shall not surely die.’ Such statement Jesus Christ denounced as the first lie ever told, making Satan the father of lies. (Genesis 3:4; John 8:44) From the day of Eden till now Satan has been blinding the minds of men to the truth by getting into their minds a false conception of Jehovah’s arrangement; and the basis for this blindness is chiefly the first lie told: “Ye shall not surely die.” All false doctrines are based upon this first lie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If man possessed an immortal soul it could not be put to death. Hence God would be unable to enforce His judgment against a sinner, and justice would fail. The Scriptures, however, plainly tell us that the quality of immortality belongs originally only to Jehovah, “who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see.” (1 Timothy 6:16) Immortality will be given as a great reward to faithful Christians and to none of humankind who live on earth forever under God’s kingdom. Such Christians who on earth continue faithful unto death are promised incorruption in heaven, the crown of life. (1 Peter 1:3,4; Romans 2:7; Revelation 2:10) The apostle Paul says that such “seek for glory, . . . honour and immortality”; and a man does not seek that which he already possesses. Again, Paul says to those Christians who faithfully finish their earthly course: “This, mortal must put on immortality.” (1 Corinthians 15:53) If a man, a soul, were already immortal, he could not subsequently put on immortality. No one of the human race will ever be made immortal in heaven except the faithful Christians. God has a different eternal reward for others of mankind who are obedient to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Defense of the Most Sacred Freedom</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">V</span><span class="font10">ICTORY on the home front, and for a heritage in defense and maintenance of which the nation’s forces are fighting on all foreign fronts, is of no less importance and consequences than </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">military victory abroad. The twentyeight nations now united in the eSort to halt the encroachments of the totalitarian octopus are battling for certain freedoms, announced to be four, namely, freedom of speech and expression; freedom to worship God in one’s own way; freedom from want; freedom from fear; and all these “everywhere in the world”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Though listed as second, this “freedom to worship God in his own way” is held by God-fearing persons to be the most sacred, vital and precious freedom of all; and for its sake many devoted men, women and children have been willing to suffer martyrdom at the hands of rabid, intolerant religionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In all cases the credit must be given to the conscientious faithfulness of a minority and their courageous insistence on what is right, that victory in the cause of free worship has been wrested from the hands of tyrannical ruling bodies. The fact that the victory has been gained by or decided in favor of a despised, hated and persecuted minority does not lessen the value and importance of the victory in its beneficial effects upon the majority as a whole. And the majority should not deny the victory or disregard it just because the victorious minority is contemptuously called a “sect”. Such a term used in a reproachful or misunderstanding way by religious opposers does not prove that those, of the despised “sect” are not Christians and do not have the truth and do not practice the right worship according to the commandments of the Most High God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The apostle Paul became the foremost of the twelve apostles and wrote most of the Christian “New Testament”, and of him the prosecutor Tertullus in the court of the Roman governor Felix made this charge: “We have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes [Jesus of Nazareth being so called].” (Acts 24:5) Also, as showing the unpopular status of Christianity and the true Christian church throughout all the world, the Jewish religionists came to the apostle Paul in prison at Rome and said: “We desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.” (Acts 28:22) Hence the application of the term “sect” today against a group fighting for the right should not prejudice fair-minded, rightloving persons against such group and blind the eyes to the real issue. Remember, the gospel in defense of which the apostle Paul stood in his day as “ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes” duly challenged the world’s attention and is of most vital importance to all nations today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The newest victory for freedom of worship, which commands attention and deserves the greatest publicity possible, is that won in the state of West Virginia, as of date October 6, 1942. Incidentally, less than three weeks prior thereto, namely, September 18-20, mobs were rioting against conventions of the New World Theocratic Assembly at Little Rock, Arkansas, and Klamath Falls, Oregon, and Springfield, Illinois, on the specious excuse that ‘Jehovah’s witnesses do not salute the American flag’. Hence the fact that an orderly, dignified three-judge Federal court meets in the Southern District of West Virginia and, after due deliberation, rules that Jehovah’s witnesses have a right to refuse to salute the national flag, is of great significance. It is also a heavy rebuke to those un-American mobsters of recent and more remote days. That these three sane-minded judges have so ruled on such a touchy subject amid a time of bloody hostilities and war-agitated minds marks them as men of rare courage these exciting days, men of impartiality, unswerving convictions and devotion to the righteous principles for which the flag of the United States stands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This has taken place, too, while the 8-to-l decision of June 2, 1940, of the United States Supreme Court on the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">flag-salute</span><span class="font10"> case of the Minersville (Pa.) schoolboard against the Gobitis children, still stands uneeversed. The ruling of the three-judge court in West Virginia is at complete variance with such Supreme Court decision. What then? Is there judicial anarchy breaking out in the land and weakening the foundations of law and bringing into contempt the supreme court of the land? No; not that! But the heartening truth is that the nation’s Constitution and its Bill of Rights also stand unreversed, and they still mean what they say. And there are honest men astute and courageous enough to recognize such truth and to express their disagreement with anything high or low that would transgress upon and nullify that fundamental law. That such is the case is manifest not only by these three Federal judges in West Virginia, but also by the highest-tribunal justices Murphy, Douglas and Black in their voluntary admission made when the Supreme Court handed down another adverse decision last June 8 against three other cases of Jehovah’s witnesses. In their joint opinion the three justices declared that the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gobitis</span><span class="font10"> flag-salute case had been wrongly decided against Jehovah’s witnesses and that now they took the occasion to express their dissent from such decision in harmony with Justice Stone’s dissenting opinion, and thereby to reverse their own position before the whole nation in the interest of justice and freedom of worship. Thus, as matters now stand, and with the recent resignation of Justice Byrnes, there are on the bench of the highest tribunal of the land four justices (including the chief justice himself) who dissent from the adverse flag-salute decision, and three justices who uphold it or have as yet registered no change of attitude; which is a majority against it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Human courts are fallible, and this is not the first instance where tribunals, even the highest, have, after a period of years and of developments and clarification of the issue, reversed their stand. For like reasons, it is clear that the June 2, 1940, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">flag</span><span class="font10"> decision is not irrevocable nor beyond reversal as an unwise measure, prejudicial, injurious (as serious consequences have since proved), un-Christian, and in violation of inherent rights guaranteed by the fundamental law of America. It takes such rulings as those of this West Virginia special court and the Supreme Court of Kansas to demonstrate the advisability, &quot;fitness, timeliness, and urgency of reversing the unfortunate </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">flag</span><span class="font10"> decision of the Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Because of the cumulative effect of this West Virginia decision following so closely on the Kansas Supreme Court decision (July, 1942), </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font10"> gratefully devotes space to publishing this clear and forthright decision in full. This ruling follows as a result of a suit brought by three witnesses of Jehovah who are parents of children of publicschool age. They sued for a restraining order against the enforcement of the flag-salute requirement in West Virginia public schools against their children. These children have by their Bible-reading parents been taught to respect Almighty God’s commandment, the second of the Decalogue, at Exodus 20:4, 5, which reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; for I Jehovah thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the 'third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">—American Revised Version</span><span class="font10"> translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hence these children refuse to join in the flag salute and pledge of allegiance for the same reason that Jehovah’s witnesses in Nazi Germany have from the start refused to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">heil Hitler!</span><span class="font10"> and Jehovah’s witnesses in Fascist Japan refuse to bow down before the shrines of the Japanese political-religious cult of Shintoism, the state religion. The reason is that they worship the God of Abraham, of Isaac, of Jacob, of Moses, and of Jesus Christ, namely, Jehovah God, and they refuse to disobey His commandment. Hence the children’s refusal to render the salute and allegiance pledge is not because they do not respect the flag and the principles it symbolizes, but because they render to God that which is God’s and obey Him rather than men.—See Matthew 22: 21 and Acts 5: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The West Virginia judges recognized and upheld the right of these Christians under the Constitution to thus worship Jehovah God, without endangerment to the State even in this time of total war. The judges took over the case as being within their jurisdiction, not merely because of the amount of money liabilities to the three plaintiff Jehovah’s witnesses, but rather because “the suit is for the protection of rights and privileges guaranteed by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment” of the Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The three Federal judges also set aside the counter motion of the defendants made to dismiss the plaintiff’s bill and which claimed that the salute regulation of the West Virginia State Board of Education is a proper exercise of power reposed in it by the state legislature. They upheld the supremacy of the Constitution over the state’s lawmaking body, and granted the injunction in behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses, and thereby nobly and faithfully fulfilled their sworn duty toward oppressed Americans. The injunction is a sweeping, state-wide one, being a restraint upon the West Virginia State Board of Education, and all other boards, officials, teachers and persons subject to the state board. Being interlocutory, the injunction stands in force until the question is finally resolved by the tribunal of last instance. The decision as read by Circuit </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font10">udge Parker follows herewith:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">PARKER, Circuit Judge :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is a suit by three persons belonging to the sect known as “Jehovah’s witnesses”, who have children attending the public schools of West Virginia, against the Board of Education of that state. It is brought by plaintiffs in behalf of themselves and their children and all other persons in the State of West Virginia in like situation, and its purpose is to secure an injunction restraining the State Board of Education from enforcing against them a regulation of the Board requiring children in the public schools to salute the American flag. They allege that they and their children and other persons belonging to the sect of “Jehovah’s witnesses” believe that a flag salute of the kind required by the Board is a violation of the second commandment of the Decalogue, as contained in the 20th chapter of the book of Exodus; that because of this belief they cannot comply with the regulation of the Board; that, if they fail to comply, the children will be expelled from school, and thus be deprived of the benefits of the state’s public school system; and that plaintiffs, in such event, will have to provide them education in private schools at great expense or be subjected to prosecution for crime for failing to send them to school, as required by the compulsory school attendance law of the state. They contend, therefore, that the regulation amounts to a denial of religious liberty and is violative of rights which the first amendment to the federal Constitution protects against impairment by the federal government and which the 14th Amendment protects against impairment by the states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A motion has been made to dismiss the bill on the ground that the regulation of the Board is a proper exercise of power vested in it by the State of West Virginia, and that, under the doctrine of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Minersville District</span><span class="font8"> v. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gobitis, </span><span class="font8">310 U. S. 586, the flag salute which it requires cannot be held a violation of the religious rights of plaintiffs. The case was heard on application for interlocutory injunction; but the parties have agreed that it be submitted for final decree on the bill and motion to dismiss. No question is raised as to jurisdiction; and it appears from the face of the bill that the case is one arising under the Constitution of the United States involving, as to each plaintiff, a sum in excess of $3,000.00, since it is alleged that each of plaintiffs would be required to incur expense in excess of that amount if their children should be excluded from the public schools. And it seems clear that there is jurisdiction, irrespective of the amount involved, since the suit is for the protection of rights and privileges guaranteed by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, and jurisdiction is given by Judicial Code Sec.24 (14). </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Hague</span><span class="font8"> v. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">C.I.O.,</span><span class="font8"> 307 U. S. 496, 525. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">There is, therefore, but one question for our decision, viz.: whether children who for religious reasons have conscientious scruples against saluting the flag of the country, can lawfully be required to salute it. We think that this question must be answered in the negative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ordinarily we would feel constrained to follow an unreversed decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, whether we agreed with it or not. It is true that decisions are but evidences of the law and not the law itself; but the decisions of the Supreme Court must be accepted by the lower courts as binding upon them if any orderly administration of justice is to be attained. The developments with respect to the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gobitis</span><span class="font8"> case, however, are such that we do not feel that it is incumbent upon us to accept it as binding authority. Of the seven justices now members of the Supreme Court who participated in that decision, four have given public expression to the view that it is unsound, the present chief justice in his dissenting opinion rendered therein and three other justices in a special dissenting opinion in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Jones</span><span class="font8"> v. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">City of Opelika,.........</span><span class="font8">U. S.........., 62</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">S. Ct. 1231, 1251. The majority of the court in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Jones</span><span class="font8"> v. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">City of Opelika,</span><span class="font8"> moreover, thought it worth while to distinguish the decision in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gobitis</span><span class="font8"> case, instead of relying upon it as supporting authority. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Under such circumstances and believing, as we do, that the flag salute here required.is violative of religious liberty when required of persons holding the religious views of plaintiffs, we feel that we would be recreant to our duty as judges, if through a blind following of a decision which the Supreme Court itself has thus impaired as an authority, we should deny protection to rights which we regard as among the most sacred of those protected by constitutional guaranties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is, of course, nothing improper in requiring a flag salute in the schools. On the contrary, we regard it as a highly desirable ceremony calculated to inspire in the pupils a proper love of country and reverence for its institutions. And, from our point of view, we see nothing in the salute which could reasonably be held a violation of any of the commandments in the Bible or of any of the duties owing by man to his Maker. But this is not the question before us. Admittedly plaintiffs and their children do have conscientious scruples, whether reasonable or not, against saluting the flag, and these scruples are based on religious grounds. If they are required to salute the flag, or are denied rights or privileges which belong to them as citizens because they fail to salute it, they are unquestionably denied that religious freedom which the Constitution guarantees. The right of religious freedom embraces not only the right to worship God according to the dictates of one’s conscience, but also the right “to do, or forbear to do, any act, for conscience sake, the doing or forbearing of which is not prejudicial to the public weal.” Chief Justice Gibson in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth</span><span class="font8"> v. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Lesher, 17</span><span class="font8"> Serg. &amp;&nbsp;R. (Pa.) 155.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Courts may decide whether the public welfare is jeopardized by acts done or omitted because of religious belief; but they have nothing to do with determining the reasonableness of the belief. That is necessarily a matter of individual conscience. There is hardly a group of religious people to be found in the world who do not hold to beliefs and regard practices as important which seem utterly foolish and lacking in reason to others equally wise and religious; and for the courts to attempt to distinguish between religious beliefs or practices on the ground that they are reasonable or unreasonable would be for them to embark upon &gt;&nbsp;a hopeless undertaking and one which would inevitably result in the end of religious liberty. There is not a religious persecution in history that was not justified in the eyes of those engaging in it on the ground that it was reasonable and right and that the persons whose practices were suppressed were guilty of stubborn folly hurtful to the general welfare. The fathers of this country were familiar with persecution of this character; and one of their chief purposes in leaving friends and kindred and settling here was to establish a nation in which every man might worship God in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience. and without interference from those who might not agree with him. The religious freedom guaranteed by the 1st and 14th Amendments means that he shall have the right to do this, whether his belief is reasonable or not, without interference from anyone, so long as his action or refusal to act is not directly harmful to the society of which he forms a part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This does not mean, of course, that what a man may do or refrain from doing in the name of religious liberty is without limitations. He must render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s as well as to God the things that are God’s. He may not refuse to bear arms or pay taxes because of religious scruples, nor may he engage in polygamy or any other practices directly hurtful to the safety, morals, health or general welfare of the community. See cases cited in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Minersville School District</span><span class="font8"> v. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gobitis, 3</span><span class="font8"> Cir. 108 F. 2d 683, 689. To justify the overriding of religious scruples, however, there must be a clear justification therefor in the necessities of national or community life. Like the right of free speech, it is not to be overborne by the police power, unless its exercise presents a clear and present danger to the community. Cf. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Herndon</span><span class="font8"> v. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Lowry,</span><span class="font8"> 301 U. S. 242, where it was said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The power of a state to abridge freedom of speech and of assembly is the exception rather than the rule and the penalizing even of utterances of a defined character must find its justification in a reasonable apprehension of danger to organized government. The judgment of the legislature is not unfettered. The limitation upon individual liberty must have appropriate relation to the safety of the state.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Religious freedom is no less sacred or important to the future of the Republic than freedom of speech, and if speech tending to the overthrow of the government but not constituting a clear and present danger may not be forbidden because of the guaranty of free speech, it is difficult to see how it can be held that conscientious scruples against giving a flag salute must give way to an educational policy having only indirect relation, at most, to the public safety. Surely, it cannot be that the nation is endangered more by the refusal of school children, for religious reasons, to salute the flag than by the advocacy on the part of grown men of doctrines which tend towards the overthrow of the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The suggestion that the courts are precluded by the action of state legislative authorities in deciding when rights of religious freedom must yield to the exercise of the police power would, of course, nullify the constitutional guaranty. It would not be worth the paper it is written on, if no legislature or school board were bound to respect it except in so far as it might accord with the policy they might choose to follow. For the courts to so hold would be for them to abdicate the most important duty which rests on them under the Constitution. The tyranny of majorities over the rights of individuals or helpless minorities has always been recognized as one of the great dangers of popular government. The fathers sought to guard against this danger by writing into the Constitution a bill of rights guaranteeing to every individual certain fundamental liberties, of which he might not be deprived by any exercise whatever of governmental power. This bill of rights is not a mere guide for the exercise of legislative discretion. It is a part of the fundamental law of the land, and is to be enforced as such by the courts. If legislation or regulations of boards conflict with it, they must give way; for the fundamental law is of superior obligation. It is true of freedom of religion, as was said of freedom of speech in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Schneider</span><span class="font8"> v. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">State,</span><span class="font8"> 308 U. S. 147, 161:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“In every case, therefore, where legislative abridgment of the rights is asserted, the courts should be astute to examine the effect of the challenged legislation. Mere legislative preferences or beliefs respecting matters of public convenience may well support regulation directed at other personal activities, but be insufficient to justify such as diminishes the exercise of rights so vital to the maintenance of democratic institutions. And so, as cases arise, the delicate and difficult task falls upon the courts to weigh the circumstances and to appraise the substantiality of the reasons advanced in support of the regulation of the free enjoyment of the rights.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Can it be said by the Court, then, in the exercise of the duty to examine the regulation here in question, that the requirement that school children salute the flag has such direct relation to the safety of the state, that the conscientious objections of plaintiffs must give way to it ? Or to phrase the matter differently, must the religious freedom of plaintiffs give way because there is a clear and present danger to the state if these school children do not salute the flag, as they are required to do? It seems to us that to ask these questions is to answer them, and to answer them in the negative. As fine a ceremony as the flag salute is, it can have at most only an indirect influence on the national safety; and no clear and present danger will result to anyone if the children of this sect are allowed to refrain from saluting because of their conscientious scruples, however groundless we may personally think these scruples to be. It certainly cannot strengthen the Republic, or help the state in any way, to require persons to give a salute which they have conscientious scruples against giving, or to deprive them of an education because they refuse to give it. As was well said by Chief Justice Lehman of New York in his concurring opinion in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">People</span><span class="font8"> v. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sandstrom,</span><span class="font8"> 279 N. Y. 523, 18 N. E. 2d 840; “The salute of the flag is a gesture of love and respect—fine when there is real love and respect back of the gesture. The flag is dishonored by a salute by a child in reluctant and terrified obedience to a command of secular authority which clashes with the dictates of conscience.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The salute of the flag is an expression of the homage of the soul. To force it upon one who has conscientious scruples against giving it, is petty tyranny unworthy of the spirit of this Republic and forbidden, we think, by the fundamental law. This court will not countenance such tyranny but will use the power at its command to see that rights guaranteed by the fundamental law are respected. </span><span class="font8">We are not impressed by the argument that the powers of the School Board are limited by reason of the passage of the joint resolution of June 22, 1942, pertaining to the use and display of the flag; </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">but we are clearly of opinion that the regulation of the Board requiring that school children salute the flag is void in so far as it applies to children having conscientious scruples against giving such salute and that, as to them, its enforcement should be enjoined. Injunctive order will issue accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">[Note by plaintiffs’ counsel: “Joint resolution of June 22, 1942” mentioned in concluding paragraph of foregoing opinion is United States House of Representatives Joint Resolution 303 (Public Law 623), approved by the president on June 22, 1942, after enactment by Congress, Section 7 of which Act provides: “civilians will always show full respect to the flag when the pledge [of allegiance to the flag] is given </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">by merely standing at attention”.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some state constitutions, in the language of their statute protecting the freedom of worship, are broader and more comprehensive than is the national constitution. To such state clauses in defense of free worship the above federal judicial decision therefore adds strength and effectiveness. Hence Jehovah’s witnesses who are citizens of their respective states and whose children are made victims of school-board flag regulations may rightly insist on their privileges of worship as guaranteed by the free-wor-ship clause of the state constitution. Judges in the states’ courts, when confronted with this issue, will not be guided solely by the unreversed majority-decision of the Supreme Court, but by the specific guaranties embodied in state constitutions, and as now reinforced by the increasing dissenting opinions of other judges, state, federal, and supreme court. Such judges will wisely consider that to take away from children the freedom of worship because of regulations of school boards takes away likewise the rest of the four freedoms, namely freedom from fear of penalties for worshiping Jehovah God; freedom of speech and expression voicing consecration and allegiance to Almighty God rather than to any thing; and freedom from want of education due to expulsion from school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Democratic-minded judges will fortify the bars of this Republic against further mobocracy of fanatics, and will aid in righting a great wrong from which great damage has resulted to a God-fearing, law-abiding, order-preserving minority of citizens, Jehovah’s witnesses. Following such course, judges may clear themselves of joint responsibility for the ugly blot of religious intolerance and persecution which has lately defamed the Most High God Jehovah’s name and defied His Theocratic Government through Christ Jesus and disgraced the proud record of a democratic nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Germany’s War Machine Sows and Reaps </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">{In Three Parts—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">G</span><span class="font10">ERMANY has long planned the conquest of the world. Ruthlessly she has seized the youth of the nation and trained them as machines, a part of the war machine. But the modern warfare of “blitzkrieg” tactics requires more than this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is not merely a war of men and machines, but one of economics, production of supplies and maintaining supply lines to all the far-flung battle fronts. It is Germany’s problem not only of holding her own lines of supply intact but also of attempting to cut those of her enemies. To this end are aimed her submarine warfare in the Atlantic, her operations from Trondheim on the coast of Norway, and the attempt to deprive Russia of access to her own Caucasus oil supplies, not merely wanting them for German use. It is the Nazi “Divide and conquer” plan which is used socially in application as military strategy. It is the attempt to divide the Russian armies, to separate Russia from the democracies, and is extended to try to divide the United States and Great Britain. The plan is to divide the earth, to break up the unity of the Allied Nations, to weaken the coalition against Germany by disrupting the communication and supply lines welding the Allies together, and at the same time maintaining those which link as one the “new order” combine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Civilization “All Out”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fighting goes beyond the matter of supply lines. It is a war of science, the making of synthetics and substitutes, the application of psychology and propaganda, the war of words. For the deciding of this great battle and the primary issue involved, world domination, the Devil has thrown everything into the fight. Every field of human knowledge and progress of civilization has been turned into the channel leading to the grand climax, Armageddon! In every sense of the word it is “total war”! Involved therein is the destiny of every creature of the universe, because the issue is universal domination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Civilization</span><span class="font10"> is ordinarily used to distinguish from barbarism and as consisting of greater enlightenment and humanity. Now looking at the world as a whole, seeing it locked in a death struggle, the most brilliant and enlightened minds focused on destruction and death, one wonders about civilization. Certainly no savages ever attained the dizzy heights of butchery upon which twentieth-century civilization now perches; no barbarians ever surpassed the horrors of the rejuvenated Inquisition prevailing under Catholic Hitler. Enlightened civilization of Europe, where resides the one many believe to be the head of “Christendom”, has put savagery and barbarism on mass production. As for the humanity element, where is it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Apologies Due the Beasts</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many say of totalitarianism that it is rule by brute beasts. It is not mere brutality; it is demonism. The herd of swine feeding peacefully on the hillside in Jesus’ day were brute beasts. When the demons which had been ejected from a man entered into them they went mad, plunging to their own destruction. Now the demons have returned to men. Today the dictator swine are demon-possessed and plunging headlong towards the doom yawning before them. No power can stop them. No one would want to. So long as they live there will be no peace on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Before the great Judge of the universe “Christendom’s” civilization is being weighed in the balances. Do you, frankly, think she is found wanting? Is the great Judge pleased with what He beholds upon the earth? Are the works thereof devilish or Godly? Will the generous religious whitewashing of the twentieth century hide the bloodguilt from Him whose ‘eyes behold, whose eyelids try, the children of men’? Will Hitler’s Jesuit principle “The end justifies the means” justify before the courts of heaven his “new order” should it be established and clothe the earth in its “peace” for a thousand years?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hitler’s war machine was able to crush Poland, sweep into its orbit the Baltic and Balkan countries, and knock out a fifth-column-infested France. But the vaunted military might of the German Reich are the victims, not the victors, of a 1942 spring offensive. Machine gun and cannon are of no avail. The dreaded Stukas hold no terror for, nor can the rumbling tanks stem the onward crawl of this new combatant. They multiply as they move, these gray guerrillas. And the word of their coming spreads panic. The damage they do is retributive, for the Nazis created the element in which they thrive—hunger, dirt, cold, crowded populations, but especially hunger. They respect no persons, not even the “master race”. The sixth column. Typhus lice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hitler’s hysterical hatred of the Jews is at least partially responsible for the opening of this new front. He herded them into ghettos, and made them endure the privations of cold, filth and hunger, and the lice came. With them came spotted typhus. Now “consistent” Hitler presses into service all available Jewish physicians, releasing them from concentration camps to cope with the new terror, to try to finish a fight he started. But the lice are winning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Soldiers returning from Russia are carefully examined before permitted entrance into Germany, and if infected they are refused entrance. In one city not named, but probably in Poland, the German military authorities killed a thousand of the typhus sufferers. Despite the frantic efforts of the Nazis, the scourge spreads. Slowly creeping through Germany, it has reached the western occupied countries, even having made its appearance in France. So the lowly louse, scourge of armies, carrier of typhus fever, “blitzkriegs” the “blitz-kriegers”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Looking Ahead</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Saturday Evening Post,</span><span class="font10"> issue of June 13, 1942, carried a short article entitled, “Hitler Has You Card-Indexed.” It states in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Germans are proud of their great military machine, prouder of the Nazification of Germany, but proudest of their plans for control of the world. The Reich is working today toward the- one great goal of world domination. . . . The American people are conscious now of the greatness of the German military machine, and they have a fair understanding of the Nazification of Germany, but I do not think they are aware of the extent to which Hitler has organized his information service to accomplish world domination after the military has done its job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It will surprise many to learn that German fifth-column reports cover all forty-eight states of the Union, Canada, Mexico, and all of Central and South America. If you work in a factory that has some connection with import or export trade, Hitler has your number. He has you classified by groups, racially, religiously, socially and politically. His research institutes have further classifications as to the individual’s efficiency, both in a business way and also looking toward political leadership. . . . Americans naturally will ask, “How was it possible to make a world survey of this magnitude ? Does it not require the service of an army of men?” It did require an army of men, an army of fifth columnists organized by Nazi Germany into </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Bunds</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ver eins. </span><span class="font8">In the case of the United States, much of the information now on file in Germany was collected as long ago as 1936 and continually brought up to date. The spadework was done by German-Amerieans who returned to the fatherland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Americans may ask, but they will not be fully answered by the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Post.</span><span class="font10"> The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Post, </span><span class="font10">with its head in the sand as usual, either through choice or stupidity, does not identify the real fifth column, the priests of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. The priests through the confessional and the Jesuits through the natural cussedness and duplicity of their order, gain the desired information and pass it along to the Vatican, which, in turn, forwards it to Germany through its diplomatic representatives. But the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font10"> even if the writer of the article would have so answered, would not have published this truth. Rather it shields this “sacred cow” and blasphemes those who do expose the real fifth column. The article does show that the issue is world domination, not merely a matter of 'diving space”, and that Hitler looks ahead to and prepares for the subjugation of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Internal Conditions</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As the German war machine surges back and forth with the changing fortunes of combat what takes place at the home front ? This has already been shown to some extent as it pertains to the production and training of human cannon-fodder. Also the elimination of those of no further use to the Nazi scheme of conquest. In addition to these, everyday living conditions are greatly altered by the war. Many of these conditions prevailed before the war actually started and were in preparation for the big “putsch”, not against Austria, Czechoslovakia, or even England, but against the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Regimentation is complete, from the army, navy and air force down to every individual man, woman and child. Even the beggar in the street is registered. Trades, professions, industry, agriculture, all are geared to keep pace with the war needs, or try to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Food rationing is changing to actual food shortage. One of the most trying situations for the German housewife is the queuing up at every store to get her daily supplies. After standing in line for hours she may find the store has no commodities and be forced to go elsewhere and repeat the process. Many times she returns to her home in despair with an empty basket. One of Jehovah’s witnesses recently returned from Germany makes the following observation on shortages:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now it is almost impossible to get even necessities. The small store keepers are desperately in need of supplies for their stores. The government requires that they keep open for business; yet they have little or nothing to sell. The windows may have a fair display, but by order of the State these articles may not be removed for sale until replacements are received. A display therefore does not mean that articles such as those shown are actually on sale in the store. Frequently the display consists only of empty containers. The actual stock of the store is just as empty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An inventory is kept of all the livestock throughout the country. Anyone who slaughters a pig, a cow, a sheep, etc., without consent of government authorities, is subject to a death sentence. The life of a pig is valued more than that of a man. In Berlin itself the city is down to bathing reservations. The people cannot afford to have hot water in their homes or apartments, and so seek the public baths. Reservations for these must be made in advance. Soap is rationed. Clothing and leather goods are limited. Taxicabs may be used only by officials or in emergencies. At least one woman hobbles around on crutches until she can get a taxi, and, when she gets to her destination, walks home with them under her arm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The plight of the Jews inside<sup>-</sup>Germany is not new with the war. Their systematic annihilation has been in progress for some time. In Berlin Jews may not enter public conveyances until all others are in, and may not sit in them until all others are seated. Jews are barred from all cultural institutions and their own institution's are dissolved. Privileges to purchase certain commodities are withheld. The war, however, has intensified and added to their persecutions. Thousands were ordered out of their homes, to be deported to ghettos in Poland. Two hundred thousand were affected by the order. The deportees were allowed an extra suit, several shirts and six hand-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">kerchiefs. Synagogues were used as way stations to ghettos in the east. Orders to move were given at night. Some were allowed two hours to pack, others ten minutes, governed by the malice of the deporting officials. The excuse for the ejections was to provide homes for Aryans bombed out by the British. How would you like to leave home on the edge of winter with all your belongings in a single suitcase, and only $20 in cash?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The only offset is that Jewish doctors have been released from concentration camps to work in hospitals. The steady stream of overcrowded Red Cross trains from the eastern front has created an acute shortage of hospitals, physicians, nurses and medical supplies; rubber gloves, for instance, being so scarce that surgeons are often compelled to operate without them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Serfdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The “master race” must have its servants, slaves. The acute shortage of man power has become one of the most pressing of Germany’s internal problems. This is due to the increasingly large numbers of German men that must be sent to the fighting fronts to replace the terrific losses in men suffered. As Hitler’s fight for “living space” flourishes larger and larger armies of occupation are required to hold this “living space” too large to be settled by the German people themselves. It seems that a change has taken place in Germany’s needs. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Newsweek,</span><span class="font10"> March 23,1942, comments on this under the heading “Too Much Lebensraum”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of the 315,000 Germans who read “Volk Ohne Raum” (People Without Space), a stodgy 1926 political novel by the German Hans Emil Wilhelm Grimm, none was more impressed than Adolf Hitler. It prompted him to seek more lebensraum for Germany’s jobless surplus population. In his proclamation of February 1, 1933, the newly elevated Fuhrer told his countrymen, 6,000,000 of whom were on relief: “Within four years unemployment must be finally overcome.” It was one promise Hitler kept. By 1938, unemployment had been virtually wiped out. A shortage of skilled labor arose and the war, absorbing huge chunks of man power, accentuated it. Instead of a “People Without Space” Hitler’s Reich became a space without enough people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This serves to illustrate the shortsightedness of men and their inability to foresee the rise of future problems. The remedy for one difficulty often creates others. The establishment of a well-ordered and balanced government does not lie within the power of men. Democracy is man’s best effort toward that goal; totalitarianism is his worst. Only Jehovah God, the One who knows the end from the beginning, can and will bring about the complete cure for all human ills. But ambitious men, like their god, prefer to ruin rather than have The Theocracy rule. They shall not have their way. Jehovah by Christ Jesus shall maintain world domination, and this to the blessing of all creatures that live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To meet this newly created problem, the Nazis, in addition to the “State mother” ideology, the fruits of which will not be reaped for several years, introduce the serf system. The “slaves” are imported from the occupied countries to serve the “master race” responsible for their woes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Axis has summoned all its nationals abroad to come home; large numbers of women are employed in the German war industries; and now there are over 2,000,000 foreign workers sweating in Germany to alleviate the critical labor shortage and keep German soldiers at the battle fronts. Of this number 1,000,000 are said to be Poles; the next in line so far as numbers are concerned are the Italians, 270,000 of them. Of course, Hitler would say Italy is not an occupied country, but only Mussolini would believe him. The remainder of the 2,000,000 come in varying numbers from Czechs, Belgians, Yugoslavs, Dutch, Slovaks, French, Danes, Hungarians, and about eight other countries yoked in bondage to the Nazi State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The slave army is growing. The Germans have been reluctant to exploit the Russians in this fashion, for fear of sabotage and Communistic propaganda, but so acute is this problem that the “privilege” is now extended to all. Russians, civilians from occupied areas and war prisoners, are being shackled to work in Europe’s sweathouse. The Office of Facts and Figures said, on April 5, 1942:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A Berlin broadcast boasted recently that Germany will increase the number of foreign workers in the Reich to more than four million. Field Marshal Goering, in a broadcast to German farmers, said: “The crushing need, the pressing need, for necessary labor forces for agriculture will be met by the application of usable auxiliary laborers from occupied Eastern territories and by the use of foreigners and prisoners of war.” “We shall win the war,” said Dr. Goebbels, “if we organize our work better and avoid waste of time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This may stir the German workers to greater efforts, but it must have quite a different effect upon the slave-workers of the Reich. Indeed this conglomerate army of laborers is a potential powderkeg to the domestic peace of the Third Reich. What drastic measures do the Nazis employ to cope with the precarious situation ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Germany has sown, the time of reaping draws near. What shall the harvest be?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">(To be continued)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Invention</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Fabric from Sequoias</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ The oldest living things on earth are the big trees of California, called the “Sequoias”. An inventor has just discovered that between the rough epidermis and the inner layer of the bark there are quantities of short, kinky fibers which readily blend with wool fibers, and, blended with wool fibers, can be napped, brushed, carded, combed, and spun into fabric. Blankets and clothing made of blended wool and sequoia fibers will be lighter than all wool. The inventor was led to his discovery by observing balls of the fiber in the belts of machines used in debarking logs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Useful and even great inventions are often the result of simple discoveries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Flying Fortresses Haven’t Hit Ceiling</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">♦ Bomber Command,</span><span class="font10"> a British work, states that American Flying Fortresses are excellent in design and construction, fly thousands of feet higher than most planes, and that their ceiling has not yet been discovered. Uncle Sam means business, and seems to have men with the brains needed to do things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Push-back Seat</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ The man who figured out the push-back seat for automobiles and for theaters is deserving of honorable mention. The man with long legs and the girl with short ones now have an equal chance to drive the same automobile in comfort, and without carrying around a lot of in-the-way cushions. And in the theater the early-comers can shove back their seats six inches temporarily so that the late-comers can walk by them without walking all over them as in days of yore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Getting at the Kernels</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Five men of the University of California solved the problem of how to open nuts almost instantaneously and send the unbroken kernels flying into one receptacle and the fragments of the shell into another. Holes are sawn or drilled into the shell, a mixture of oxygen and acetylene is inserted and ignited, and the resultant explosion delivers 60 percent of the kernels without breaking them. Away goes the nutcracker, following the hammer and the flatiron of a generation ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Judicial</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Thomas Works for the People</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ J. G. Thomas, superintendent of mails, Charleston, S. C., has a job working for the American people, but seems to think he is working for Hitler or Pacelli or Hirohito or somebody like that. On July 14, 1941, he sent out an order calling upon all employees at three postal substations asking that he be furnished the names and addresses of all persons receiving copies of three publications which he named, i. e., </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Worker, The Pilot,</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Southern News Almanac. </span><span class="font10">The information requested was to be treated as confidential and under no circumstances were the recipients to be advised that the list of subscribers had been recorded. Thomas wanted the information sent to him under cover. Why all this injecting of the proboscis into people’s private affairs six months before Pearl Harbor? If the American people want to read the above publications, to agree with them or to disagree with them, have they not that right? Or do they need Thomas to take them into his private office and tell them that they ‘had better not read such stuff’; that he does not approve of it? Who is this bird, anyway, and when and where did the American people bestow upon him the right to select and criticize their reading matter?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Still Some Bootleggers</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ It seems that with the advent of the bootlegging industry a more or less permanent business was set up. It is a good while since prohibition was repealed, but in a single recent year 10,663 stills were seized, along with about 6,500,000 gallons of mash, and the industry was hardly touched. The Illinois congressman who supplied this information claims that 82 percent of all the stills seized were in the 14 Southern states that still have traditions of mountain dew and mint julep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Ludwig’s Little Black Book</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Kurt Frederick Ludwig, German spy in America, was a smart man. He wrote his notes in obsolete Gabelberger German shorthand, mingled with German script and English. When he was captured one of the FBI cryptographers took his stuff apart and explained it all to the jury as easily as you would explain an item in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font10"> magazine. Ludwig suspected he was being followed, and burned his notes. The FBI came along behind him and photographed the charred fragments of his little black book, and the man will probably lose his life or get a long term in prison. There are no more clever cryptographers in the world than in the office of the FBI.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Britain Will Laugh</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ Britain will laugh to learn that, when a Washington air-raid warden called the Office of Civilian Defense to know what kind of tape should be used for taping windows in event of a raid, that highly intelligent source of public information replied, “It depends on what kind of bombs are dropped.” Talk about “muddling through”! Are the muddlers any worse in Britain? Is it necessary to select the leash intelligent politicians for the most important jobs ? Or isn’t civilian defense important?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Negro Leaders Given Well-deserved Honor</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ The president of the Tuskegee Institute and the director of the Associated Negro Press have been named special assistants to the secretary of agriculture. It is an honor that is well deserved. The Negro has proved that with equal opportunity he is the equal of any. “God is no respecter of persons” (Acts 10: 34), and, anyway, God “hath made of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font10">blood all nations of men”. (Acts 17:26) If one accepts the Scriptures as the Word of God and the way to life, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font10">must believe what is written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">^ABANDON the OLD for the NEW! |</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Led on with darkened minds, millions of sincere people have fought | for and relied upon this present unrighteous, rebellious world in hope | of an enduring peace, which hope and peace are continually shattered. I</span></p>

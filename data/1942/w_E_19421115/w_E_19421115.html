<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this uorld, then would mi) servants fight.&quot;—John IS: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TEHOVAH has declared his unchangeable purpose I to give over the occupancy of the earth wholly </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font4"> to those who worship him as the Most High and Almighty God. Both the prophecies and the shattering world events of the day in fulfillment speak eloquently to testify that the execution of his purpose is shortly to take place. The final outcome will be a Paradise to the four corners of the earth, and inhabited by perfect human creatures in Jehovah’s own image and likeness. “For thus saith Jehovah that created the heavens, the God that formed the earth and made it, that established it and created it not in vain, that formed it to be inhabited: I am Jehovah: and there is none else. By myself have I sworn, the word is gone forth from my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that unto me every knee shall bow. every tongue shall swear. Only in Jehovah, it is said of me, is righteousness and strength; even to him shall men come; and al) they that were incensed against him shall be put to shame.’'—Isa. 45: IS. 23. 24, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver., </span><span class="font4">margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> That is no mere Jewish view. Centuries after Jehovah's above pronouncement the Christian apostle Paul bore witness for the same Jehovah and said: “For it is written, As 1 live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.’’ (Rom. 14:11,12) it therefore becomes crystal clear that the most pressing personal issue for each one who desires life on earth in the new world is the worship of Jehovah. The acquainting of the people with the truth about Jehovah that they might know, love and worship him is the most vital need of the hour. It is a service of highest value, being alone of lasting benefit to humanity now headed for destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ The war for world domination is raging, and the religionists of every stri]&gt;e and creed are emraged therein. The schemers for world domination do not pause to consider the words of the Leader in Christianity: “’For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then lie shall reward every man according to his works.” (Matt. IC : 2G. 27) The Son of man has come into his Kingdom, beginning A. D. 1914, and in the big fight at Armageddon he will reward the planners and battlers for world domination with destruction of their souls as enemies of Jehovah’s new world. They have fallen victims to the very enticement that the god of this pre.-ent wicked world held out to the Son of man as the price for his worship of the Devil. In meeting the searching test the Son of man put the worship of Jehovah God foremost as all-important. He brushed the outward glories of this world and its commercial domination aside as contemptible. Note this Perfect One's stand, which stand is right, let religionists say what they will against Jehovah. “And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God. and him only sh.alt thou serve.’ (Luke 4:5-8) Jesus here quoted from Deuteronomy 6:13: “Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; and him shalt thou serve, and shalt swear by his name.”—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">*The purpose of Almighty God that only those fearing, serving and worshiping Jehovah shall occupy the earth forever was pictured in miniature when lie gave the land of Palestine to his chosen people Israel. To their forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Jehovah had promised to give the land to the Israelites. In fulfillment of this covenant he brought them forth out of the demon-worshiping land of Egypt. On their journey to the Promised Land Jehovah halted them at Mount Sinai in Arabia and inaugurated over them a typical Theocracy or government administered by God. As Lawgiver in such Theocracy Jehovah gave them the Ten Commandments. the first two of which commanded his covenant people to worship only Jehovah as God and not to make any idols or representation of any creature and worship such. (Ex. 20:2-5) This law’ was to protect his covenant people from religion, which is the worship of the demons and which is harmful and death-dealing. (Gal. 3: 19) The effects of religion as at present visible in “Christendom” and in all other nations prove the wisdom and prime importance of these commandments of Jehovah’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> For forty years, at the hand of Moses, Jehovah led the Israelites through the waste and howling wilderness and finally brought them to the plains of Moab on the east side of the Jordan river and opposite to Canaan, the Promised Land. On the way Jehovah God did not permit his chosen people to invade or overrun the lands of Edom and Moab and Ammon. Passage through those territories peaceably would have made the journey to the Promised Land shorter and more convenient, but the demonized rulers of Edom, Moab and Ammon would not agree to it, and backed up their refusal with a show of military might. The Israelites had no fight with them, and marched around, minding their own business. Then the Amorite nations east of the Jordan, under King Og of Bashan and King Sihon of Heshbon, attacked the Israelites and Jehovah destroyed the aggressors before his, people and gave them the lands of those heathen nations. Miraculously Jehovah divided the flood waters of Jordan and marched his people through, and the conquest of Canaan began. The demon-worshiping heathen in the land resisted the execution of Jehovah’s good purposes toward Ins people, and were destroyed, except the Gibeonites, who made a covenant with the Israelites. Their lives were therefore spared that they might become the servants of Jehovah God at his temple.—Joshua 9 and 10. <a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark8">1</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;<a name="footnote2"></a><a href="#bookmark9">2</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• Such wmr of the Israelites was a righteous war. because it wms commanded of Jehovah of hosts and was for his Theocracy in Israel. Israel’s invasion of Palestine was under the leadership of the Creator and Owner of the earth. The invasion was therefore no act of selfish, greedy totalitarian aggression. The destruction of the heathen inhabitants was no violation of the sixth commandment nor of God's everlasting covenant with humankind concerning the sanctity of the blood of life. The Israelites were commanded to act as God’s executional forces. The execution of those heathen squatters in the Promised Land was righteous, because they were demonworshipers and hence anti-Jehovah and anti-Theocracy, and their living presence in the land would be dangerous and ensnaring to His people. Their belligerent opposition to the entry of God’s covenant people proved this. In giving the Promised Land to the “nation whose God is Jehovah”, the Lord God was providing a homeland for the operation of Theocracy in full force therein for the honor of Jehovah’s name and for the protection of his people against the snare of religion. (Deut. 7: 1G. 25) Such was the typical picture foreshadowing how Almighty God will cut off from this earth all nations that forget Jehovah God. Then he will settle permanently in the cleansed earth all who turn from religion and worship Him and obey bis Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CHALLENGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ In the days of Jephthah the Gileadite the nation of Israel had to decide this question of Jehovah’s worship. Unwisely and in disobedience to their covenant with Almighty God they had yielded to the snare of religion and forsaken his worship. Theieby they forfeited the protection of Jehovah God. and the Philistines and the Ammonites oppressed them for eighteen years. Toward the close thereof the Israelites repented and returned to Jehovah’s worship. To drive them back again into religion or demonism the Ammonites in great military force invaded Israel’s territory and encamped in the land of Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> In harmony with the law of God granting the right of self-defense, which right is recognized by all nations except the Nazi-Fascist totalitanan powers, the Israelites mustered out an army for self-defense. To make certain of Jehovah’s help and deliverance, they turned to his Theocratic government and offered their services to Jephthah the Gileadite. Jehovah God, the Theocratic Ruler of <a name="footnote3"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark10">3</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;<a name="footnote4"></a><a href="#bookmark11">4</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote5"></a><a href="#bookmark12">5</a></sup>&nbsp;Israel, had marked him as His appointed judge and leader for Israel. Jephthah agreed to accept the captaincy and headship provided that Jehovah God would manifest his approval by delivering over the enemy aggressors to defeat. The elders of Gilead then brought Jephthah out of exile and to Mizpah of Gilead. In Mizpah (meaning “Watchtower”) Jephthah confirmed all his words of this matter before Jehovah God. At “Watchtower” (Mizpah) he established his home, and there his one and only daughter resided. (Judg. 11:34) Having submitted all matters to Jehovah the great Theocrat for guidance and disposal, Jephthah then challenged and called a halt to the demon-worshipers that encroached upon the interests and the worship of Jehovah's Theocracy in Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">° &quot;And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come unto me to fight against my land&quot;?<sup>-</sup>’ (Judg. 11:12, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.) </span><span class="font4">Jephthah's procedure here followed the Theocratic rule, namely, to serve notice upon the Lord's enemy before finding it necessary to take action violently. Before Jehovah brought the great Deluge, which destroyed the “world that then was&quot;, He gave due warning by his prophet Noah. Before destroying Egypt’s prized firstborn ones and her mighty chariots and armies in the Red sea, Jehovah served notice by the prophet Moses upon hard-hearted Pharaoh. The serving of notice and warning resulted in a great witness for the name of Jehovah throughout the earth; and concerning this Jehovah said to Pharaoh: “For this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.”—Ex. 9:1G, Leeser’s translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’&quot;For eighteen years the Ammonites had had their way over Israel. Now they set out upon a course of violent destruction as a climax to their oppressions upon Israel. They were spoiling for their own destruction at the hands of the God of Israel, whose Theocracy they both despised and were out to cut off from the face of the earth. The time, therefore, was appropriate for Jehovah’s name and works to be declared to them as counsel and warning, that the responsibility for the destruction coming upon them might rest upon their own heads.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> In considering the modern application of Jeph-thah’s protest, let this be remembered: Jephthah as visible head of the typical Theocracy pictured Jehovah’s Theocratic organization under Christ Jesus, and of which organization the Watch Tower Society is the visible representative and servant The Ammonites under their “king-god’ Moiech. or Chemosh (meaning “Subduer&quot;), pictured the woild powers that go totalitarian in their effort for world domination and that are hence against the worship of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government over the earth. Such totalitarian Ammonites are therefore against the Watch Tower Society because it is Theocratic in organization and it acts as the administrative servant of Jehovah’s witnesses who publish His name and his kingdom under Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> It must here be remarked, unmistakably, that it is not pure democracy that has occasioned the protest of the Greater Jephthah. True democracy stands for and observes the principle of freedom to worship Jehovah God according to his will and commandments, and freedom to publish his name and his Righteous Government as Christ Jesus and his apostles did. For this reason Jehovah's witne^i-have for the past decade and more stood out pi eminently before the nations and proved themselves to be in the forefront of the fight for such righteous principles of democracy and against the modern Ammonites who would stop the exercise of &lt;uch principles in America. The protest raised be tin Greater Jephthah has been occasioned be religion which has fostered totalitarianism in order to gam world domination and hold the monopoly of worship, to the intolerant exclusion of free worship according to conscience and uncensored by religion. Ilcli-gion of “Christendom&quot; declares its aim to convert the world. Ominously there is one brand of religion, with headquarters at Vatican City, which claims the right and the God-given authority to foist its own form of worship upon the whole world and to mak&lt;-all nations subject to the religious bead at the Vatican. “We must make America Catholic.” said Archbishop Ireland at the Hierarchy's anniversary held in Baltimore, November 10, 1SS9. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(The elicited Catholic)</span><span class="font4"> “It is God’s plan that the Holy Father of Rome should be the temporal and spiritual head of his kingdom on earth.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(The National Cath oho Register)</span><span class="font4"> Hence the Vatican’s concordats with the Fascist and Nazi governments, and its exchange of ministers with Fascist Japan March 27, 1942. followed by unavailing protests by the United States Department of State.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses under the Greater Jephthah have no fight with human creatures. Ephesian- G. 12 expresses it: “For we wrestle not against flesh and</span></p></li></ul>

While the Vatican has stood, there has been no world peace; and there never will be as long as the Vatican remains with its so-called ‘’infallible” pronouncements of its papal ruler and the unchanging ambition and continual grasping for religious world domination. Only Jehovah’s &quot;strange act&quot; against religion at the battle of Armageddon will clear the way for uninterrupted peace in the new world. &quot;Babylon” must go, by Jehovah's grace and power.—See Revelation 17 and 18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PROTEST</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> Let the reader now scan the fulfillment of the prophetic drama of Jephthah in the deeds of the Ammonitish totalitarians that have provoked righteous protest. As heretofore stated in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch-touer,</span><span class="font4"> the Theocratic rule of operation was published June, 193S, and then through the Watch Tower Society it was put in practice among Jehovah's witnesses beginning October 1, 1938. A world-wide convention embracing 30 cities was arranged to be held three weeks before that date, to wit, September 9-11. The Protestant stronghold of London, England, was the convention center. In the arranging for the convention halls in the other cities of the chain there was great opposition by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and its political allies of the Nazi-Fascist type, such as mayors, judges, civic bodies, law-enforcement bodies, pseudo-patriotic bodies, and Catholic Action groups. During the actual holding of the convention specially violent overt acts were committed against Jehovah's witnesses peaceably assembled.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> The assaults upon these faithful Christians, the interference with their rights and privileges as God-fearing citizens, the disregard displayed by public officials and religious leaders for law and order and constitutional government, and the foul part that the Hierarchy of the Vatican played in these insults to democracy, liberty and Christianity, all this has been published in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> of 193S, the magazine reporting this world-wide convention. Up to that time it was the worst invasion, on an international scale and all timed for the same period, such as Jehovah’s witnesses have suffered of their rights and privileges as Christians. Especial!} notorious were the developments at Clmago. III. Rochester, N. Y., New Orleans, La., and Ottawa. Canada. All such was evidence of the internatimia' pressure by the religions Hieiarchy upon the supposed ‘‘people’s servants” and upon so-called “patriotic” societies to force the doing of what the Hierarchy wants done. It was proof positive of religion's world organization for boycotting and slugging its way to world domination. As a re-ult only 47 of the proposed 50 joint conventions could be held: 118 radio stations broadcast the speeches fiom London.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> This attack of modern-day Ammonites upon the right and privilege which all freedom-loving, democratic Americans, Britishers, and others cherish almost dear, namely, freedom of worship and freedom of assembly for such worship, was vicious It called for instant protest to the &quot;king of the children of Ammon”, the Nazi-Fascist totalitarian mon-trositv and its religious backer at Vatican City. Immediately when the president of the Watch Tower Society got back from the key convention at London, arrangements were made for a protest meeting m New York city, Sunday, October 2. In conjunction with this assembly, at Mecca Temple, six joint conventions were held in other cities, including Ottawa and also New Orleans (this time by moan- of a Federal injunction against Catholic oll’n-ials and dupes there). The Protest speech wa- on the subject. “Fascism or Freedom—Which Shall We Have ’&quot; It was also broadcast over a network of 62 radio stations, two of which cut the message short due to religionist howls while the speech was going out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” That public protest put the question up to the “Ammonites ’ to answer why they were invading, denying and trampling down God-given and constitutionally guaranteed human rights and freedom-The speaker said: &quot;Jehovah's witne--e- are true Christians, that is, followers of Christ, and God -command to all such true Christians is that the} must tell the truth, that the people of good-will max learn the way to righteousness and life (John 18:37) No human agency can rightfu 11 } interfere therewith. Those who object to the full publu ation of truth of God’s Word and the facts in support thereof thereby declare themselves against Jehovah God and Christ Jesus his King. Honest men will lay aside prejudice and calmly consider the facts.’ (See published speech in booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font4"> page 5, paragraph 1.)

<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> &quot;And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from [river] Arnon even unto [river] Jahbok, and unto Jordan; now, therefore, restore those lands again peaceably.” (Judg. 11:13) It is the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, who has brought up the spiritual Israelites out of the world symbolized by &quot;Egypt”. As Judge he carne to the temple m 191S. enlightened his remnant of followers with the truth, and delivered them from the bondage to Satan's organization. He showed them that the kingdom of God K all-important in that it shall vindicate Jehovah's name by destroying all parts, visible and invisible, of Satan's organization. Hence a worldwide witness must now be given to the establishment of the Kingdom in 1914, and the primary purpose of the Kingdom, and its bounteous blessings for all taking their stand on its side. In 1929 the King and Judge at the temple shed light on the Bible to reveal that the worldly political powers are not what the Scriptures call &quot;the higher powers” (Romans 13: 1), but that Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are such. To them must Christians subject themselves in cases where the political law conflicts with the higher law of God, the Supreme One. To the heavenly, invisible ’ Higher Powers” must all salvation and protection be ascribed. Homage and worship are to be rendered to Them, and not to the modern Ammonites and the things that these idolize and honor with religious e remonies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> The religious-totalitarian Ammonites object to the above. They claim it takes away what they from ancient time have enjoyed and been entitled to. It i&gt; a failure, say they, to render to Caesar what is Caesar's, a failure to recognize the supremacy of the state and that the total state is the all-in-all and the individual citizen is nothing except for the state's service and interests, which means that God has no prior or higher claims upon his covenant people at all. The &quot;Ammonites” argue that Jehovah's witnesses drive them out of a field they have claimed from Nimrod's time and which field, therefore, Jehovah's people have not the right to invade and occupy or to explain and</span><span class="font1"> ADVERTISE </span><span class="font4">to others. So they deniaml that Jehovah’s witnesses back down from then Christian position, and that they do so without trouble or fighting back, else they will suffer dire consequences.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> To these threats the “Ammonites” add force by acts of discrimination through public officials, by arrests, conniving at mob action and lawless police action, by laws mischievously framed contrary to the Constitution, just to &quot;get” God's servants. In totalitarian lands, Germany, Italy, Japan, etc., they are rounded up and put into concentration camps and dungeons. In other lands under the Vatican's influence they are dragged into court, their children are unschooled and put in state reformatories, and they are declared judicially and officially to be an &quot;illegal organization&quot;. This hacks up the &quot;Ammonite' demand for Jehovah's witnesses to compromise their stand for The Theocracy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> “And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon.” (Judg. 11: 14; Jephthah did not crawfish nor yield any Theocratic ground. This is true today. Jehovah's visible organization under Christ Jesus keeps on sending out his messengers with the same uncompromising menage of Jehovah’s supremacy and kingdom. More interested persons are brought in, trained, and sent into the active service as publishers to help give a wider spread of the message. The London Convention speech &quot;Face the Facts&quot; and the Protest speech &quot;Fascism or Freedom&quot; were recorded as originally given, on phonograph records, and these speeches were reproduced on many thousands of phonographs carried from house to house and on sound-cars and also through public-address systems to many othei thousands. This is no activity interfering with the defense of democratic nations, but is a making of them more awake and alive to the real enemy and danger to their democratic principles. Je»us said. “No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.” Jesus’ followers are not inducing anyone to quit his worldly allegiance. It is Jehovah God that does the drawing of creatines to his organization. Jehovah's witnesses merely give the testimony of the truth, and God does the ie«t, and what he does is right and is irresistible. What reason, then, have the &quot;Ammonites” to object and complain and pick a fight?</span></p></li>

Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon.” (Judg. 11: 15) As chosen “head”, Jephthah discharged the responsibility to speak in reply to false charges. At present the one responsible for the message of God’s covenant people is Christ Jesus, the Head of the Theocratic organization and who represents God Almighty. Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s Chief Witness, “The Faithful and True Witness,” and he leads his faithful followers on earth. Jehovah’s witnesses. Theirs was and is not a man s message. They are not a religious sect or cult; for they do not follow the traditions of some man or men nor any religious rigmarole.

<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> That Jehovah's covenant people took no land away without authority from Him. note Moses’ words on the plains of Moab, shortly before the Israelites crossed the Jordan into Canaan. “And the Lord said unto me. Distress not the Moabites (&quot;children of Lot], neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give thee of their land for a possession, because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession. And when thou contest nigh over against the children of Amnion, distress them not. nor meddle with them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon [also descendants of Lot] any possession: because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession. Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou earnest not, nor unto any place of the liver Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the Lord our God forbad us.’’—Dent. 2:9,19,37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> Centuries later, in the face of like invasion by Ammon and its allies, Jehoshaphat king of Jerusalem confirmed Moses' words. He did so in prayer to God, who knows the truth, saying: “And now, behold, the children of Ammon, and Moab, and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not; behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.”—2 Chron. 20: 10, 11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> The modern application of King Jehoshaphat’s statement is interesting, as given in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtou er </span><span class="font4">of July 15, 193S, paragraph 23;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“Jehovah’s witnesses on the earth now fulfill this part of the prophecy, in this, that they have never at any time been commissioned by the Lord to destroy literally those who compose the visible elements of Satan's organization. They have been plainly told that vengeance belongs to Jehovah and he will repay; consequently their work is different from using carnal weapons. For that reason Jehovah’s witnesses have not advocated or engaged in revolutions, or any like attempts to overthrow worldly institutions. They have never encouraged anyone else to do so. Their sole duty and commission is to inform the people of God's purpose to destroy Satan and his supporters, thereby giving warning to those who are of good-will toward God that they may flee to the place of safety in God's organization. Jehovah's witnesses have never attempted to use politic’ [Ammon's province] or any like means or the legislative bodies or the courts to deprive any person of the freedom of thought or the operation of their organization or to prevent the expression of their views and convictions, because they clearly see that Jehovah has permitted the wicked institutions of the world to remain until his due time to show hi* power against all his enemies. It is therefore the commission and obligation of his witnesses to non tell the people of and concerning Jehovah's purpose'. Jehovah’s witnesses follow strictly the rule that there should exist and be freely practiced the freedom of speech, and freedom of belief and expression.'</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> The above statement to the “king of Ammon' was made the next thing after the Lord God disclosed that his approved organization is Theociatic (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoieer,</span><span class="font4"> June, 1938.) In agreement with the foregoing statement Jehovah’s witnesses have strictly followed the rule laid down by the Head of the Theocratic organization, namely, ’Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, and unto God that which is God’s.’ In thus doing Jehovah's witnesses have neither taken away the &quot;land&quot; nor denied anything that properly belongs to the state.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> Further. Jephthah said: &quot;But when Israel eanu-up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea. and came to Kadesh; then Isiael sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying. Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the kin? of Edom would not hearken thereto.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">27 In answer to the king ot \uimon what conduct of Edom and Moab toward Israel did Jephthah call to bis notice’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>5S</sup> In tlie Bible symbohsms “Edom” pictures “organized religion”, under the dominance of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy; and “Moab” pictures the profiteering commercial element of the world. All the facts testify that Jehovah’s witnesses have never done any bodily or property harm to religionists, but have discussed merely religious doctrines publicly taught. A world deception was pulled off in 1933 when, in April, Pius XI declared a “holy year” throughout “Christendom”. This was a reproach to God’s name, and Jehovah’s witnesses took issue with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy by a radio broadcast over 55 stations in the speech “Effect of Holy Year on Peace and Prosperity”. The speech was also recorded as given and thereafter reproduced on sound machines throughout “Christendom”. Whether Jehovah’s witnesses were right in declaring the so-called &quot;Holy Year” an unscriptural farce, let all honest persons judge by the totalitarian aggressions and the measure of peace and prosperity that have followed since 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2,1</sup> Hot resentment filled the Hierarchy at this approach to their territory, and they engineered boycotts and programs of violence against those who dared call in question the “infallibility” of the Vatican. Offers were made to the Hierarchy for debates over the radio upon the subjects of Catholic church doctrines as regularly taught by them publicly. Such proposals the Hierarchy consistently turned down and ignored, despite a Petition for such a coast-to-coast radio debate signed by 2.G30.001 petitioners in America. The Hierarchy treated all such fair and honorable proposals as contemptible and beneath their ‘Toly” notice. They refused to grant any favors or considerations in behalf of enlightening the public on the truth. They roused up violent Catholic Action, in like manner as Edom did of old: “And Edom said unto [Israel], Thou shalt not pass hy me, lest I come out against thee with the &gt;word. And the children of Israel said unto him. We will go by the high way; and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it [as illustrated by the offer to pay for half of the radio-debate broadcasting expense]: I will only, without doing any thing else, go through on my feet. And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand. Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.” (Num. 20: 1S-21) So Jehovah’s witnesses turned away from the Hierarchy and visited the ’ Catholic population” in their private homes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>,0</sup> “Big Business” and the rest of the commercial element have played “Big Brother” to religion and have supported it financially, granting it free time on radio networks, free advertising in newspapers, together with large and always favorable reports of religious activities and speeches, such as the pope’s encyclicals and “Christ-mass” and “peace” speeches printed in full, free. This same commercial element imitates ancient Moab and does not “consent” to any favors to Jehovah’s witnesses, but charged them regular commercial rates for broadcasts on the Bible. It refused them radio facilities because the Hierarchy threatened stations with boycott and “more drastic action” if the witnesses were given the air. In the commercial newspapers “Moab” publishes lying reports written by religionists against Jehovah’s witnesses. “Moab” has broken contract for advertisements, paid for in advance, of Bible lectures. Now commercial laws, never intended to be used against ministers of the gospel, are applied against the gospel-preaching by Jehovah’s witnesses as against peddlers. By its 5-to-4 decision of June *, 1942, the Supreme Court of America ruled that license-tax ordinances of towns and cities may be applied against Jehovah's ministers of the gospel as though common ambulating vendors. Also the commercial element join in the hue and cry for “more religion!&quot; They ask that religious teaching be introduced into the public schools as being the most important thing in a public-school course, and many public schools let the children take time off from regular school hours to get religious training outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>S1</sup> The Edomites and Moabites made it hard, wearisome going for the Israelites to reach the Promised Land. Said Jephthah: “Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon [river], but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the [northern] border of Moab.” (Judg. 11: IS) The people who have been visited in their homes know, and the testimony offered freely in the courts prove, that Jehovah's witnesses have not imposed on the commercial “Moabites&quot; nor violated the commercial laws and regulations by their witness work. In the manufacture and distribution of Watch Tower literature they have avoided everything savoring of commercial motive, practice and profit. They have distributed the printed and recorded message unselfishly out of love for God and in obedience to Him. Nevertheless, as in the Theocracy trials in Kentucky</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">30 How have the modern Moabites shown favors to the religious element but 'consented' to none for Jehovah* witnesses<sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">31 (a 1 Due to the actions of Edom and Moab, how was the coins tyr the Israelites on the waj tn Canaan<sup>9</sup> /1&gt;'• Do the fact- show that Jehovahs witnesses have imposed on the commercial ‘Moabite*&quot;' and what have the prosecutors in court trials charged and tried to prove on this question? </span><span class="font4">and Indiana and elsewhere, the state prosecution tried to make it appear Jehovah's witnesses were a commercial organization opeiating under a religious appearance for profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AUTHENTIC FACTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” How. then, did Israel get the disputed territory? Jephthah answered: “And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Hesh-hon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.&quot; (Judg. 11: 19) This fact proves that the Ammonites were not occupying and had never occupied the land which they said Israel took away from them, namely, the land northward “from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and [westward] unto Jordan”. (Verse 13) It was the Amorites under Sihon that occupied and held such land in possession when Israel reached the southern border of it: &quot;for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.” (Num. 21:13) The Ammonites, however, occupied land to the east of Sihon's country, and hence their territory did not run as far west as Jordan. Furthermore, Numbers 21: 26 says: “Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of tlie Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.” This is additional proof that the Ammonites never once possessed this land.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>33</sup> Sihon's name means “sweeping”: as when a warrior sweeps all befoie him. He was an Amorite, and hence a descendant of the accursed Canaan. (Gen. 9: 25: 10: 15, 16) The Amorites were Canaanites and also demon-worshipers. &quot;Amorita&quot; is understood to mean “mountaineer&quot;. Their likeness to &quot;organized religion” is clear; for religion claims to dwell in the mount of God’s kingdom, but it goes out after Moabitish commercial gain and commercializes religion and sweeps all before it. Hence the modern Amorites resist Jehovah's witnesses, who have renounced all commercialism. They feel hurt at exposure of their religious racket, and lienee show Jehovah's witnesses no favors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> Jephthah continued: “But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jaliaz, and fought against Israel. And the Loud God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.” (Judg. 11:20,21) Jephthah's statement agreed with that of the prophet Moses, at Deuteronomy 2:32-37 and Numbers 21:21-31. Bv this familiarity with the Bible history of Isiael Jephthmi showed he was not some rough desperado and wildlife ignoramus, but that he studied and was v ell acquainted with the written Word of God. He had faith in its records of Jehovah's judgments successfully executed against all enemies. For the vietor&gt; over Sihon Jephthah’s words gave the credit to Jehovah God. Jehovah’s part in the battle was the important thing; it was His victory and HL conquest. Nothing stopped him in establishing hi-worship in the land then, and nothing will stop hi-establishing it through the whole earth now, no matter who opposes. Christ Jesus, who refused to worship the “prince of the demons&quot;, is now rightful King of the earth. With him in office it must be. Out with religion, which is demonisin' He, as Gods agent, will establish Jehovah's worship over all the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> Jephthah continued: “And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto .Ionian. (Judg. 11:22) Had this territory been Ammmi-. then God would not have permitted Diael to gair it; for Jehovah God had told the Isiaehtes n&lt; t to distress or meddle with Ammon. (Dent. 2: 19) B) thus clearly defining the limits of the conqueied territory Jephthah showed he was not disposed to compromise or to yield to the enemy one meh of anything God had given to His covenant people. Said Jephthah to Amnion: &quot;So now the Lotto God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou pos-ess it<sup>1 </sup>(Judg. 11: 23) This sets the right example for God'' servants today.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> In 191S Jehovah sent to the temple for jud&lt;rm&lt; nt his “Messenger of the covenant'. Chri-t Jesti-. (Alai. 3:1-3) Every advancement since then m knowledge and understanding, anil all pi&lt;&gt;gr&lt;&quot; toward a pure and proper service of the Lord &lt;rod. has meant just that much of a pushing back of the power and forces of religion and a gaming of victoi \ over religion.

Jehovah, by Chri-t Je.-us at the temple, is the One responsible for (leaning up hi-witnesses on the earth. He drove out religion and religionists from among them and gave them tiemastery over that snare and racket. He brough<sup>4 </sup>them into the privileges of proclaiming the Kingdom</span></p></li></ul>

Hence the clergy and their allies scoff when God’s witnesses declare themselves ordained ministers of the gospel and present identification cards to trial-court judges and others to that effect. Jehovah’s servants have shown the falsity of the claim of the religious clergy to being God’s ordained ministers and representatives. Now the clergy try to regain and hold on to that position in the minds of the people, from which position Jehovah’s witnesses have driven them out by exposure. So the religionists of the day appeal to the Amnionitish political element and urge them to try to drive back the Lord’s witnesses from the ground they have gained against demonism and its pi actitioners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From whom do religious totalitarians derive all their powers? Revelation 13:2 answers. From Satan’s organization, the dragon. To that effect Jeph-thah said: ■‘Wilt not thou possess that which Cheniosh [meaning ‘Subduer’] thy god giveth thee to po-sess? So whomsoever the Loud our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.” (Judg. 11: 24) The Bible and the worship of Jehovah are not the field for control by the demon-serving political element. Neither are the politicians the interpreters of the Bible to decide the difference between religion and Christianity. On the other side, Jehovah’s witnesses do not mix in the politics of this world. They do not even exercise the citizen’s right of suffrage or vote. Whatsoever Jehovah God has permitted the “god of this world” (“Chemosh”) to help his religious totalitarian element to take possession of, with such Jehovah’s witnesses do not interfere, knowing Almighty God will take care of it at Armageddon. They know Jehovah has permitted Satan, “the prince of this world,” to remain till that battle. Daniel’s prophecy, chapter eleven, has foretold how the totalitarian-religious element would gain ground at this end of the world. Hence God’s servants join in no subversive movements against any of the political governments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">His prophecies, he has given them repeated triumphs over religion and its clergy. All gains for truth and for the Kingdom interests which God’s witnesses have gained by His grace, they refuse to yield up even under threats, ultimatums and the cruel pressure of religion’s political allies, the Nazi-Fascist powers particularly. God-given conquests they will uphold and abide by. and not yield to any countermove by the enemy to thrust them back into darkness and bondage. Being given the liixht. they will not put it under the bushel which totalitarian rule would use as a black-out; they will put the light on the candlestick to give litrlit and comfort to those mourning in darkness. (Matt. 5:15,16) Like Ehud, they do not draw out the sword from the fat belly of the antitvpical King Eglon, “organized religion.&quot;— Judg. 3: 21. 22.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>39</sup> For this reason Jehovah’s witnesses have battled their way clear through all courts up to the Supreme Court in their defense of and demand for constitutional rights, privileges and liberties as citizens and Christians. Where the highest human court refuses to protect their conscientious rights, then thev take the punislmient rather than yield and compromise. They resort to all other constitutional and Clirist-like means to preserve the rights and liberty of Christianity.

<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> The modern-time Ammonites should contemplate Jephthah's further words: “And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab’ did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them while Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years’” (Judg. 11:25, 2G) According to the Nazi-Fascist way of reasoning, the Moabites should have found a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">casus belli</span><span class="font4"> against Israel, fiom what is written at Numbers 21: 25. 26: “And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites. in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof. For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the fi'rmeh king of Moab, and taken all his land out or His hand, even unto Arnon.” From the time of Israel s action against Sihon the Israelites had had more than three hundred years of judgeships over them, and during all that time the Moabites had not tried to wrest from the Israelites the territory thev had by Gods help taken from King Sihon.

<p><span class="font4"><sup>42</sup> Jephthah therefore threw back the responsibility upon the heads of the Ammonites with this last word: &quot;Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the Lord the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.’’ (Judg. 11:27) In the present world crisis Jehovah’s witnesses have not sinned against the worldly political element, but have stuck to Jesus' command, ‘Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.' The wrong which the political forces do against them is at the insistence of the clergy, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority, who hate Jehovah's name and Theocracy. As the president of the Watch Tower Society stated in the public address on the subject &quot;Government and Peace&quot;, at Madison Square Garden. New York city, on June 25,1939, and which speech the Catholics and Nazis jointly tried to break up by a twelve-minute riot, but failed: “The fight,&quot; said the speaker, “is not Catholic against Protestant; the issue is not Fascism or Communism against democracies; but the is»ue is, man rule under Satan against Theocracy by Chri&lt;t Je.-cs. It is religion and state against Christ and his kingdom. There is no middle ground, because Jesus emphatically says: ‘He that is not with me is against me.' (Luke 11.23) . . . Why such violent and persistent opposition? Is it because Jehovah's witnesses are endangering the welfare of the people? No, not at all. The sole reason for such opposition is that religious leaders and allies are against the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus.&quot;</span></p></li>

Let him set the .judges of modern Ammon in their place. What Almighty God the Supreme Judge thinks, decides and rules is of highest concern, not what the worldly courts and judges hand down concerning those who faithfully safeguard God’s Kingdom interests and represent His Theocratic Government. Those under the Greater Jephthah today know that Jehovah has committed to him all judgment and the execution thereof, and that he is on the throne of his glor&gt; and all the political element and allies of all nation<sup>1</sup>-are gathered before him. He is judging such one' as to their treatment of His brethren and companions, Jehovah’s witnesses.

<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark19"></a>IS '-CHRISTMAS” CHRISTIAN?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font3">HIS is a timely question. There is good historic precedent for raising it, in this: The Jews left the keeping of the commandments of Jehovah God, and to offset this they became very religious and indulged in a lot of giving or offering of sacrifices; but was this acceptable to the Lord God? Ills own answer, as delivered under inspiration by his prophet Isaiah, proves interesting in the light of holiday giving and feasting:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord: I am full of the burnt offerings or rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats. When ye come to appear before me, who h vth required this at your hind to tread my courts’ Bring no more vain oblations: incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies. I cannot a«av with - it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea. when ye make many prayers. I will not hear your hands are full of blood.&quot;—Isa 1: 11-15</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today the world witnesses the spectacle of religion bringing together the elergy and dictators whose hands are ’‘full of blood’’, and fully proving that the Nazi-Fascist dictators are not trying to stamp out religion as certain religious clergymen are publicly and loudly declaring as a screen to hide their co-operation with the criminal dictators In support of this, note two press dispatches In a wireless to the New York </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font3"> dated London, October 12, under the heading, ‘'Nazis in Poland Establish Two Separate Catholic Groups.&quot; it was stated • ‘‘Two Catholic associations, one for Poles, the other for Germans, hare been formed with Polish Bishop Dymek and the German Franciscan, Bieitniger, as heads of the respective societies News of the Vatican's appointment of Breitmger as the leader of German Catholics in occupied Poland grievously surprised Polish circles in London. . . . complaining of the violation by the Vatican of the concordat with Poland . . the Polish ambassador to the Vatican had protested vigorously against the appointment of a German to a church post in Poland.&quot; An earlier dispatch by the International News Service, dated Rome, January 3, 1941, reads “Marking perhaps the first time that the Vatican has obtained any important concessions from Russia, Josef Stalin especially relaxed Soviet anti-religious laws in order to permit Catholics in Russian-occupied territories [including part of Poland at the time] to attend Christmas services, it was learned today. . . . Chancellor Hitler acted as intermediary between Pope Pius and the Soviet dictator . . . The pontiff sent his personal thanks to Hitler through Monsignor Orsenigo ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That so-called “Christmas” is religious, even the Jews, the Moslems, the Chinese, and the Nazis and Fascists and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Communists will admit. But is it Christian’ Its celebrat.on by certain religious organizations does not make it Christian, any more than bingo games, lotteries, or card parties in religious parish houses or parish schools are for that reason Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Look high and low in the Christian writings of Jesus’ apostles and their companions, and you will not find once the word &quot;Christmas”, neither the word “mass&quot; Not only is the date of Jesus’ birth not given anywhere for the purpose of having it celebrated, but the oulx b'.rthdav celebration mentioned is that of the adulterous King Heiod whose step-daughter Salome danced to make the celebration “merry”, yes, merry by having the head of the forei miner of Christ, namely, the head of John the Baptist chopped off (See Matthew 14:6-12, Mark 6 21-29 ) Eien Origen of Alexandria (A.D. 1S5-254). who is celebrated as one of the “early church fathers&quot;, was sharp enough to see the point, so that he stated that “in the Scriptures sinners alone, not saints, celebrate their birthday&quot;. Jesus (’bust nowhere instructed his disciples to celebrate his nmnan birthday on cither the legitimate day or any fictitious date , and for religionists to engage in such a celebration on a religious fixed date, winch date is furthermore sacred to a heathen false god. is a case of adding to the Word of God. Concerning this it is written, at Proverbs 30.5. G “Every word of God is pure- he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar&quot; —See also Deuteronomy 4:2 and Revelation 22 IS, 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The early Americans, such as the Pilgrims, the Puritans, the Quakers, etc . would have nothing to do with &quot;Christmas&quot; celebrations Scotland to this da\ does not observe “Cnristmas&quot; as a national holiday, but views it as &quot;popish&quot; The early Christians did not celebrate it, because undci-standmg it to be the pagan “feast of the sun&quot; T.'iat least was celebrated the third d;n after the winter solstice, namely, on December 25. and it was used to back up the Devil's lie in behalf of the great anti-Jehovah huntsman Nimrod (Genesis 10:8-10) The Devil's lie was, ‘There is no death,’ and the so-ealled “Christmas tree&quot; practice symbolizes the lie that the dictator Nimrod is not dead, but is immortal in the spirit world. (Gen 3-4,5) As shown by every encyclopedia, centuries before the birtn of Jesus the heathen worshipers celebrated the rebirth of Sol, the sun, in that connection making use of holly. the mistletoe, the yule log, and the evergreen, which last is the &quot;Christmas tree&quot; of modern times used by the religionists of “Christendom” about which to have a “joll\ good time&quot;, not barring drunkenness, gluttony and licentiousness</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Says a world history, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">On the Road to Civilization,</span><span class="font3"> page 164, used as a textbook in American high scnools “The feast of Saturn, the Saturnalia, was a winter festival which lasted for a week beginning on the twenty-fifth da\ of December, and was celebrated with dancing, the exchanging of gifts, and the burning of candles. The Saturnalia was later taken over by the Christians as their Christmas, and given a new significance.” Despite the Saturnalian hilarity practiced at “Christmastide'’ with the full connivance of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, yet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font3"> tries to sidetrack the people from the truth by saying, “The origin of Christmas should not be sought in the Saturnalia (1-23 December).” However, concerning the picking of the date from the heathen worship it admits this- “The well-known solar feast, howeier, of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Xatalis Invicti</span><span class="font3"> [‘Birthday of the Unconquered’], celebrated on 25 December, has a strong claim on the responsibility for our December date.” The celebration became popular after the Nicene Council convoked by Emperor Constantine in A. D 325, and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia</span><span class="font3"> therefore speaks of another “early church father&quot; who defended the celebration of the new custom on December 25 • “Home, therefore, has observed 25 December long enough to allow of Chrysostom speaking at least in 388 as above ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fact that Jesus was not born in the dead of winter makes no difference to the celebrators Have not the Roman Catholic priests, from the pope down, said mass on December 25 for centuries since 388, and is it not therefore &quot;Christmas&quot; ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus being thirty-three and a half years old at the time of Ins death at Calvary at the beginning of spring, the evidence is that he was born m a season a half-year earlier, namely, at the beginning of autumn, or about October 1, at which time the shepherds could reasonably be watching their flocks by night out in the open fields, and at whieh time of the year also John the Baptist could seasonably be baptizing repentant Jews in Jordan nr er and could baptize Jesus now come to thirty years of age (Luke 2 7-16. 3-.21-23) Hence, according to the inspired Scriptures, the evidence is that the annunciation to the Jewess. Mary, look place nine months earlier in the year, or sometime in December. Nevertheless Christ Jesus and his heavenly Father m no part of the Bible command any true Christian to celebrate either of these events, and in harmony therewith the dates thereof were withheld The celebration of &quot;Christmas&quot; is a concession to the heathen, pagan holiday and is a compromise with demonism winch is religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The etergreen tree, besides piettiring to the heathen sunworshipers that Sol did not really die. was used by other idolateis to show that Nimrod, called the &quot;lather of the gods&quot;, did not really die. when lie was slam by his enemies for his crimes His mother Semiranns (who had also become Nimrod's wife) announced that her son and husband had been made a god. a demon. The story is not easily-traced in history, but sufficient evidence remains in the mythology of various countries to enable students to piece together tlie story, as is done in the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Tao Babyions, </span><span class="font3">by Hislop. This accounts for it that while the pope and other religionists are celebrating ‘ Christmas” the Nazis of Hitler Germany can on the very same date celebrate with propriety the pagan rites of demon-worshipers of ancient Germany, who celebrated such evergreen-tree rites and carousing and other forms of self-indulgence centuries before Jesus’ birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Semiramis advanced the thought that she was really the &quot;woman” mentioned in Eden, at Genesis 3:15, and that her husband-son Nimrod was the “seed&quot; who would destroy the ‘‘serpent”. This “mother and son” or &quot;Madonna and bambino&quot; doctrine runs through all the false religions of earth, and is, no doubt, a part of Satan’s religions scheme to get people to lose sight of the real &quot;seed of the woman”, namely, Christ Jesus, the &quot;seed&quot; of Jehovah<sup>-</sup>'-organization Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The emphasis now is placed bv religionists upon Madonna and, secondly, upon the &quot;baby” Jesus, rather than on Jesus Christ, the glorified spirit who is the “express image of God's person&quot; and whose kingdom has begun with him in the throne as the highly exalted King and Servant of Jehovah God. In most Catholic churches there is a &quot;b. by Jesus’ at Christmas time Catholic Francis of Assisi began the &quot;baby” practice, and claims to have used an empty crib in which there appeared a real live baby Jesus at the opportune moment. Compare this emotional religious tradition with the plain statement of the apostle Paul at 2 Corinthians 5:16: “Yea, though we have known Chrst after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more &quot;&nbsp;Francis of Assisi evidently did not read the Bible or take that inspired scripture seriously; otherwise he would have known that he was a victim of the demons at the ‘baby Jesus&quot; trick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then, too, those “wise men”: the Bible does not say there were three of them Those ‘‘wise men” who traveie&lt;l to Bethlehem sometime after Jesus' birth were really magicians, or &quot;magi’’, and hence were astrologers, demonologists. concerning which religious sect see Deuteronomy 4 19 and Isaiah 47:13,14. Jehovah God ehose God-fearing Jewish shepherds to be witnesses to the birth of his Son at Bethlehem, and not those astrologers Such demon-woishipers. though sincere, w-ere driven by the superstitious fear of the &quot;star” or luminous body which the Devil demonized them to see in the sky. Thereby the Devil misled them and caused them to drop in on murderous King Herod and frighten him about the birth of a new-born king of the Jews and thereby arouse lus murderous passions Wheieas the shepherds had not informed Herod of the birth, these &quot;wise men” were obliged to first apply direct to Herod and get the location of the birthplace as at Bethlehem and thereafter the “star” led them to Bethlehem, with King Herod’s soldiers close on their heels to massacre the babes of Bethlehem, including Jesus, if possible (See Matthew 2.1-18) Who. then, sent those &quot;wise men' to seei. the child Jesus’ Was it Jehovah God, or was it the ’Serpent&quot; who God had foretold would bruise the heel of the seed of the woman! And who created that &quot;stai&quot; to lead them to Herod’ and why, then, should those ‘wise men’, three of them, and the &quot;star” be glorified so much by religionists at ‘Christmastide”’ What Christianity is theie in it'<sup>1 </sup>“Bewaic lest any roan spoil you through philosophv and vain deceit, after the tradition of men. after the ruuiments of the world, and not after Christ ” This is the warning given at Colossians 2.8 by an apostle of Jesus Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Religion’s annual celebration of the unscriptural holiday of “Christmas” lays the chief emphasis on the selfish matter of human salvation The true and pure Christianity now rejoices in and publishes world-wide the birth in A. D. 1914 of Jehovah God’s kingdom by- Christ Jous, which will vindicate Jehovah’s name at Armageddon, soon</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">S</span><span class="font3">INCE the Nazi hordes have penetrated so deeply into Russian territory, and since Adventists and other religious organizations, including Anglo-Israelites, have long taken the view that Gog and Magog are to be identified with Russia, some Adventists and others are now wondering why Soviet Russia has been losing up till now, and will it continue so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Foretelling things concerning &quot;the latter years”. Jehovah God told his prophet Ezekiel to turn his face toward Gog, the land of Magog, and to prophesy against him This must mean that Jehovah's witnesses, of whom Ezekiel was one in his time, must today declare the prophecy against that which Gog represents Ezekiel 38:1-3 reads: “And the wind of Jehovah came unto me. saying. Son of man, set thv face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince oi Rush [not Russia], Meshech [not Moscow], and Tubal | not Tobolsk], and prophesy against him, and say, Thus s.nth the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against thee, 0 Gog.&quot;—.Im </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rev Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">L'p to this point in his prophecies Ezekiel had prophesied in symbol against the visible religious, commercial and political elements of Satan the Devil's organization, and against Satan himself. However, aside from Satan himself there was no specific prophecy against the invisible part of Satan's organization of demons, the wicked angels, and the officers m his invisible realm. These invisible powers have had much to do with debauching the human race and have had much to do with the ruling of the nations on earth, and it is certain that these demons will be destroyed with Satan because they are enemies of Jehovah God. It is reasonable, therefore, to expect to find in the book of Ezekiel some prophecy setting forth Jehovah's judgment and the execution thereof against these wicked angels or invisible powers. The apostle Paul called attention to the fact that in these latter da&gt; s God's people would be warred against by these invisible powers and principalities, and facts now prove this—Eph 6.10-12</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Based upon the certain truths that are revealed by the Scriptures the following conclusion a.-, to the meaning of Gog and Magog is here set forth in brief Gog is one of the princes in Satan's organization, invisible, of course, to human eyes, with a possibility of the power to materialize in human form should God permit such Hence the &quot;land of Magog” pictures the invisible spirit realm of Satan, whose inhabitants include Gog and all the wicked angels within Gog's division of Satan's organization. According to Ezekiel’s prophecy, Gog forms and organizes a conspiracv against God's anointed remnant of witnesses and the persons of good-will who take their stand alongside the remnant as representatives of Jehovah's Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus These have not been gathered to Palestine wherein was situated Megiddo of old, but they have been gathered unto the Theocratic organization of Jehovah God and there worship him in spirit and in truth Into the demon-eontrolled conspiracy are drawn many cieatures on earth as well as wicked angels, and the overt acts committed with mutual understanding by them recently show that this conspiracy includes Big Business elements. the chief political rulers of the earth, and the practitioners of and leaders in religion inside of “Christendom&quot; a» well as without.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The mass of evidence published in the newspapers, and elsewhere all combines to show that all the afore-mentioned conspire and come against Jehovah’s organization, including the remnant and their companions on earth , and that such conspiracy is carried out by the committing of secretly planned acts This has been done, as foretold m Ezekiel, chapters 38 and 39, since the close<sup>1</sup> of the World War in 1918 and the restoring of the faithful remnair of Jehovah's witnesses to the freedom of fearless activity ir worshiping and serving Hun and His Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEERING IN ARIZONA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Just as I was finishing the street work a lady in a pas&gt;u.u ear called When I discovered she was calling me I went to the ear, and she said. ‘I want one of those magazines ’ Her husband asked what it was all about, and was told the magazine would explain it. The lady said that Oklahoma City, whence they came, was full of people offering the magazines, but they did not pay attention, as they thougnt it was just in Oklahoma City. They took a trip to California, and wherever they went there were Jehovah's witnesses with the magazines. So they wanted to find out what it was all about. After they got home they said, they were going to inquire more about it. At one house I called three times and could not place the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> Saturday, on the street a man ran his car up close to me and I tried to get out of the way. He called me over and asked if I had </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font3">I did. and was told to come to his house at three o’clock, liesuit One subscription and a bound book. He said he 'a anted to investigate furtner. as every place he went he saw a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> book or a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and he had picked up a tew and liked what he had read. A lady I met was quite interested and came to one study but could not come to any more because of her children and opposition. She really was studying, and one day thought she would read « little in the new </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> as her husband had just none to work and the children were still asleep. ‘I couldn't find a place to stop.’ she said. ‘So I read it all the way through, and now I am going back over some of the points ’ Iler brother was killed on the battleship Arizona at Pearl Harbor, and she showed me a picture of a fine-looking group of men m his company most of whom are now dead as a result of the treacherous attack there. She is now a Kingdom publisher.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AT A COUNTY SEAT IN ARKANSAS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“While working in regular door-to-door work in Clinton, the county seat, three men came to me and ordered me to leave town I said. ‘Who are you”’ One answered, ‘We are from the American Legion, and we don’t want you here.’ I said. ‘If I were you I wouldn’t tell anybody I belonged to the American Legion.’ They said, ‘Humph<sup>1 </sup>Why'” I told them my wife and I came here from the next county north. Last year while she was siek with malaria some members of the American Legion found that the only place we got our water from was a near-by spring. They put human excrement in the water, thereby making it necessary for me to carry water a quarter of a mile while she was sick: ‘Nobody else would do a trick like that ”. No further conversation was necessary. We continued our work, placing nine books, magazines, and many booklets. One Legionnaire that took </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> dropped Ins membership with them and told us two more were doing likewise. The leading preacher (Baptist) invited us to his study. During our conversation he said: ‘I wish the members of my congregation were as sincere about coming to church as you are in your work I know you are just about through with the town here, because I have been either just ahead or right behind you in every home of members of my congregation ' I asked if he had told his congregation not to read the Lord's books. He said not.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW CAN I UNDERSTAND EXCEPT—’ (BRITAIN)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“About three months ago a young lady said both she and her husband had read one of our books but could not understand it. We promised to call back one evening when her husband would be at home. We received a real welcome. Mr. L----had quite a lot of questions regarding</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">our work and organization, but seemed perfectly satisfied with the answers we were able to give Anyway, we agreed to call the following week, after having assured him he had no obligation to ‘join’ anything. Next week, after a most interesting model study and answering more questions we left a copy of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> On our next visit not only did they subscribe for a year, but Mr L----</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">stated he had read how the Society sent </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">free to those too poor to subscribe for themselves He gave us a further six shillings to be used m this manner. Meanwhile, Mrs. L----was also demonstrating intense interest,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and promised to attend the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study the next Sunday. Since then they have attended regularly. Nov they are both regular publishers. Although they have two kiddies, Mrs. L----put in thirty hours of Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">service last month, and comes with me in every phase of Kingdom service. The first time out she asked what she would have to do to be worthy of a magazine bag<sup>1</sup> Three months ago they knew nothing of the Bible, not even the story of David and Jonathan' How the Lord rewards an honest seeker for the truth 1”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mold, North Wales: “In this little country town it was local market day. The one main street was lined with stalls and barrows, and the narrow pavements were thionged with shoppers and country folk. Our bags, never seen there before, attracted much attention and there were manv curious gazes. After always working with a company, we were feeling rather strange on our own. A lady elbowed her way through the crowd towards us and excitedlx exclaimed: ‘Is it </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower f’</span><span class="font3"> On being assured it was, she quickly told us how she had read the Society's publications, but had never been visited at her home Ia any brethren for about six years and had had no opportunity to study with them. We at once arranged a mode<sup>1 </sup>study with her for the same afternoon, and now we ha\c a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> study with her regularly She invites her friends and neighbors to share with her in receiving the spiritual food provided by God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RELIGION’S PASTURES SPOILED IN CALIFORNIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The man at first seemed prejudiced, but as he showed good-will I engaged him in conversation. He invited me inside. He had been reared a Catholic, but for some time he has not been associated with them. Evidently the truths we discussed appealed to him and he volunteered some interesting information. ‘Do you know,’ he asked, to what extent the Catholic people are leaving that institution” Then he related a conversation he had recently with a bishop, who, though lamenting the fact, stated that more than three thousand Catholics (about fifteen hundred of them Mexicans) had left his diocese during the past three years. More power to the truth, the spreading of which is doubtless the cause, directly or indirectly, for the deliverance of those people from that terrible prison-house ”</span></p>

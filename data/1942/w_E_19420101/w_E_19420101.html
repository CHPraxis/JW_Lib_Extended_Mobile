<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RE TBE 1942 YEARBOOK</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Due to the uncertain and disrupted conditions on earth over which we have no control the information for the compilation of .1 report of the work world-wide for the service year 1940-1941 is belated. Hence the production of the 1942 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’: witnesses</span><span class="font2"> has been unavoidably held up Announcement of its publication will be made shortly, and which report, we believe, «ill be well worth waiting for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1942 CALENDAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The text chosen for the year 1942, to wit, “Blameless in the day of our Lord” (1 Cor. 1: 8), provides the theme for a calendar picture which is most befitting these days of decision. Highly artistic and novel, the picture clearly and eloquently sets out the choice God’s covenant people must make concerning the great issue of world domination. Beneath is a neat calendar pad, indicating the line of activity of Jehovah’s blameless ones for each month of 1942, naming the special Testimony Periods and also the special endeavors to be made during the intervening months. The contribution for this service calendar is 25c each, or $1.00 for 5 copies mailed together to one address. Companies should send m combination orders, with remittance to cover, through their local company servant.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>MICAH</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘Hear, ye peoples, all of you; hcaiken, 0 earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord Jehovah be uit-ness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.”—Mic. 1:2,</span><span class="font5"> A.I?.T<sup>7</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH’S judgment day is here. He appears in his high court representatively by his commissioned High Judge, Christ Jesus, to whom he has committed full power and authority to render judicial decisions and to execute the judgments rendered. (John 5: 22, 27) Jehovah is no respecter of persons and shows no partiality toward anyone in judgment. Knowing the end from the beginning, Jehovah in the centuries past caused his judgments to be written, and which judgments apply to those who come within the scope or terms thereof. When the time comes to take account with his creatures he causes his law to be proclaimed, and this becomes a witness for or against those who hear. The creatures themselves have much to do in putting themselves in position to receive the judgment of condemnation or the judgment of approval. This is especially true at the present time, for the reason that Christ Jesus, the great Judge, now sits upon his judgment seat and before him all nations and peoples are gathered. The nations are now being judged and separated, and this is done just preceding the execution of the final judgments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Judgment, as the Scriptures declare, begins “at the house of God”. (1 Pet. 4:17) That means that the judgment of the Lord first takes account with those covenanting to do the will of God, including both those in the expressed covenant and those in an implied covenant with Jehovah. It means the taking into account the true and faithful followers of Christ Jesus, and the “evil servant” class, and all those who hold themselves out as the people of God and the followers of Christ Jesus. The judgments of the Lord must of necessity be announced and executed after the great Judge comes to his temple, because there is the place of judgment. It was in 1914, as shown by the Scriptures and the physical facts, that Jehovah placed his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, upon his throne and directed him to rule while the enemy was still carrying on his wicked work. (Ps. 110:2) It was in 1918, as shown by both the Scriptures and the physical facts, that Christ Jesus came to the temple of Jehovah for judgment. (Mal. 3:1) There are those even at the present time who claim to have made a covenant with Jehovah to do his will but who do not see and appreciate the evidence showing the presence of Christ Jesus. Such are described by the apostle as “ever learning [making a pretense of learning], and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth”.—2 Tim. 3: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>s</sup> During the past few years the Lord has furnished such an abundance of proof showing the presence of Christ Jesus at his temple that it would appear to be a waste of time to discuss in detail at this time the evidence concerning his presence, and especially when there is so much that we must now get in mind. Those who truly love the Lord’s appearing, as mentioned by the apostle (2 Tim. 4:8), are of the temple company and appreciate the light that shines in their hearts; but all others are in the dark, some in gi eater darkness than others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> The Lord’s Word says: “Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.” (Ps. 97: 11) The righteous here mentioned are not those who merely express their faith in Christ Jesus as the Savior, but the righteous are those whom the Lord ‘hath clothed with the garments of salvation and covered with the robe of righteousness’. (Isa. 61: 10) Such are the ones who are in the temple and are righteous by reason of having received the favorable judgment of approval by the Lord, and are made a part of his organization. Such approved ones by reason of being covered with the robe of righteousness now “greatly rejoice in the Lord”, and continue to serve with joy. It is for such that the light shines in the temple, and for such the light was sown. It is the light of Jehovah’s glory shining in the face of Christ Jesus, his great High Priest, and which light is reflected or mirrored to those in the temple, and who are therefore in the covenant for the Kingdom. (2 Cor. 4:4-6, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> The light is veiled from the eyes of those who are moved by selfishness, envy’, covetousness or ambition. Such persons do not see and appreciate the unfolding of prophecy which the Lord God is unfolding in these days of judgment. To those who have a pure heart the light shines upon their countenance, illuminating their minds and filling the heart with joy. The pure in heart is one who is wholly devoted to God and his kingdom, and who is free from selfish exaltation or a desire to receive the plaudits of men. Those who possess an upright and pure heart are the ones to whom God’s light at the temple now brings great gladness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ As </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font5"> has heretofore said, there is now a war on, in which the forces of Satan attempt to accomplish the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses and all others who worship and serve Jehovah in spirit and in truth and who associate with Jehovah’s witnesses. (Rev. 12:17) One who has made a covenant to do the will of God, and who then is envious, covetous and ambitious, shows that he has yielded to the seductive influence of Satan. He does not appreciate the real issue that is now to be finally determined. It is the name of Jehovah that is involved; and the holy name of Almighty God will be vindicated, and that within a short time. It is the will of God that his name shall now be proclaimed throughout the earth as a witness to the people. After this is done, God declares, he will demonstrate his supreme power to all creation. (Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser)</span><span class="font5"> To be faithful to God, and to continue to have a part in the proclamation of his truth, the creature must put self entirely in the background and must delight to do whatsoever is the will of God, even though in the doing of the same he is placed in a position of less honor amongst men than that occupied by others. In order to see and appreciate the issue, and in ol der to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might, those in the covenant for the Kingdom must continue to obey the injunction written by the apostle to &quot;study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth”. (2 Tim. 2:15) In order to divide and properly apply the truth one must see and appreciate that Jehovah is God and that his name is above all others; that it has been defamed and must now be vindicated; that Christ Jesus is the great Vindicator; and that he is now at the temple conducting judgment for the vindication of Jehovah’s name; that those of the temple class constitute his “faithful and wise servant”, to whom the Lord has committed the work of delivering his message of the Kingdom, and hence to them is committed all of his Kingdom interests on earth; that the preaching of this gospel is (1) to notify the people that Jehovah is God and that his kingdom is here, and (2) to give warning and information to those who desire to be on the side of Jehovah; and that by this means Jehovah through Christ Jesus is gathering unto himself his “other sheep”, and that this work must be done before the wrath of God breaks upon the enemy organization.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> If one becomes imbued with the thought that he is singled out to do a certain and a great work, and he proceeds upon that theory, he thus shows himself to be a fool, within the meaning of the Scriptures: “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.” (Ps. 53:1) He does not say this in words uttered by his mouth, but by his course of action he shows that his motive is to ignore God. He does not have in mind that God has put in his organization his creatures as it pleases him (1 Cor. 12:18), and that those who are of that organization gre taught, not by men, but by Jehovah and by Christ Jesus. (Isa. 30:20; 54:13) Such selfish persons disregard the instructions of Jehovah and Christ Jesus, and pursue a course of lawlessness or iniquity. “A fool despiseth his father's instruction; but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.” (Prov. 15:5) Such person disregards what God gives his people through Christ Jesus at the temple, and in the place thereof he sets forth his own wisdom, speaking of a great work that he as a man is delegated to do in behalf of those who shall be saved, and he further says that he is not doing such work because his hands are tied. Those who are wise hear the words of the Lord and follow his Word. Such study the prophecies and watch carefully the events that come to pass showing the fulfillment of prophecy. The prophecies were written for the very purpose that the man of God might be fully furnished and prepared for the work that is now being done at the end of the world and which must be completed before Armageddon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>T</sup> Complainers say of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font5"> that it contains nothing new and of interest but continues to harp on the same thing, and that such shows that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> contains only the opinion of man. Let God’s people be.reminded that Jehovah caused a number of his prophets to write about the same thing, each one disclosing a picture of what shall come to pass in the future. To be sure, the Lord knows how difficult it is for imperfect men to keep in mind the things which God caused to be recorded, and he continues to give instructions, causing the light to shine upon his prophecy and exhibiting it to the view of his people that they may learn and keep in mind what the issue now is and what they must do. For this reason a number of the prophets wrote or prophesied about the same thing, and the facts come to pass in fulfillment of such prophecies in order that the man of God may have proof upon proof that is corroborative evidence of the fulfillment of the prophecy, and this in order that the man of God may be kept strong in faith and in hope. To this end we must be diligent in the study of God’s Word, that our hope may be strong: “And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end.”—Heb. 6:11,12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> AVitli this issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver</span><span class="font5"> a study of the prophecy of Micah is undertaken. Those who possess a pure heart and mind will pursue this study and find much corroborative proof of what has heretofore been learned, and therefore will have more evidence to make strong their hope of accomplishing that which the Lord has committed to his people who love him and who serve him. The record of the prophecy written aforetime by Micah, and for the benefit of the remnant, opens with the statement: “The word of the Lord that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.” (Mic. 1:1) Not the word of man, but the Word of Jehovah God, hence as from the oracle or most holy of the temple, and therefore the sure and safe guide to the one who has undertaken to serve Jehovah. It is the authoritative word of God, therefore, that came to Micah and comes to the people whom Micah foreshadows and represents. That Word of God is always a safe guide. “The word of the Lord is right.” (Ps. 33: 4) “Thy word is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments. Thy word is true from the beginning; and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.”—Ps. 119:105,106,160.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> It clearly appears that Jehovah by Christ Jesus is doing his work on earth among his people and hence is guiding his people in the right way according to his promise. (Prov. 3:5,6) Jehovah always performs his promises faithfully. To his covenant people Jehovah says: “I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand.” (Isa. 51:16; Jer. 1:9) Thus the Lord declares he has entrusted his people with the privilege and obligation of telling his message: “Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God.” (Isa. 43:10,12) Jehovah having thus favored his people, they must be true to him and speak his word to others: “He that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully.” (Jer. 23:28) The Lord does not say to speak the words of wisdom of man, nor to be influenced or guided by the word of man. Those who are convinced that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> is publishing the opinion or expression of a man should not waste time in looking at it at all, because a man’s opinion proves nothing except when that opinion is based wholly upon the Word of God. Those who believe that God uses </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> as a means of communicating to his people, or of calling their attention to his prophecies, should study </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> with thankfulness of heart and give Jehovah God and Christ Jesus all the honor and credit and give neither honor nor credit to any man. The prophecy of Obadiah shows clearly that the identity of the persons or individuals engaged in God’s service is not now material. To highly esteem men or for one himself to seek high esteem from men cannot be pleasing to the Lord, and such persons could not receive the Lord’s blessings. Likewise the man who seeks to justify himself in the eyes of men that they might approve and honor him could not have the Lord's favor in so doing. “And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts; for that which is highly esteemed among men, is abomination in the sight of God.”—Luke 16:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The time when the word of God came to Micah, together with the surrounding conditions, fixes or locates the time when the prophecy is in course of fulfillment. It is there written that it was “in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah”, that Jehovah sent his word to Micah. The facts relating thereto and immediately following show the time of the fulfillment is after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple, which occurred in 1918. The names by which Jehovah’s prophets are identified are always significant. The name “Micah” is an abbreviation of the name “Micaiah”, and which means “Who [is] like Jah?” (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version,</span><span class="font5"> margin, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham,</span><span class="font5"> margin, at Jeremiah 26:18.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> A prophecy usually has at least a partial fulfillment before God's people discern the same. Prior to the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple in 1918 the faithful servants of God on earth looked for the establishment of the Kingdom and for their own going to heaven, and the “restitution” of mankind in general. It was after 1918 that God’s people on earth began to realize that the name of Jehovah is the all-important issue, and then they began to ask, as Micah asked, “Who is like Jah?” The word “Jah”, or Hebrew </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yah,</span><span class="font5"> is an abbreviation or contraction of the word “Jehovah” and means the same thing. (Ps. 68: 4, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> The remnant now see that there is none like Jehovah; and therefore they have set this question before all the world, and particularly by bringing this question before “Christendom”, as being the main or chief issue now to be settled for ever. None of the remnant saw that this is the great issue until after Satan was cast out of heaven and Christ Jesus came to the temple for judgment. The proof increases, as progress is made in the study of prophecy, and shows beyond all doubt that the prophecy began to have fulfillment after the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> The prophet Micah was “the Morasthite” (“Morashtite,” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)-,</span><span class="font5"> hence he was from the town of Moresheth-gath. (Vs. 14) That town was near the Philistine city of Gath. Micah, who was God’s witness, pictures Jehovah’s witnesses now in close contact with the modern-day Philistines, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allied clergy, otherwise called “organized Christianity’. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Moresheth</span><span class="font5"> means “possession”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Gath</span><span class="font5"> means “vat”, as a place for the pressing of grapes, that is, a winepress. The Philistine giant Goliath came from the city of Gath. (1 Sam. 17:4) King Uzziah of Judah “warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath” and other cities of the Philistines. (2 Chron. 26: 6, 7) That was just before Micah became a prophet. Micah appears to have been a Judean, of the tribe of Judah. Micah began to prophesy in the reign of Jotham, the son of Uzziah. The name “Jotham” means “Jehovah [is] perfect”. He succeeded his father Uzziah, who was stricken with leprosy from the Lord and died of that malady. This suggests the period of time after “Christendom” was similarly smitten spiritually in the year 1918. (2 Ki. 15: 7, 3638; 2 Chron. 26:23; 27:1-9) Because of his faithfulness to Jehovah Jotham became mighty. “So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> his God. He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.” (2 Chron. 27 : 6, 8, 9) This was long after King David defeated the Philistines at Mount Perazim and at Gibeon. The fact that the Philistines still manifested themselves against the Israelites after David defeated them does not at all alter the fact that those two battles were typical of what would come to pass at the end of the world. Each prophetic picture or drama is separate and distinct from the others and manifestly is recorded for a specific reason, and the chronological happening thereof has nothing to do with the real meaning of the picture.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> Uzziah made war with the Philistines and broke down their wall (2 Chron. 26:6,7); and after that his grandson, Ahaz, the son of Jotham, reigned, and •luring his reign the Philistines came and made war upon the Israelites. The Edomites made war against Judah. &quot;The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof; and they dwelt there.” (2 Chron. 28:18) This strongly supports the conclusion that in the day of Jehovah’s witnesses, the remnant, whom Micah pictured, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies would make war against the people of God, which war we now see in progress.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> The name “Ahaz” means ‘Tie hath grasped”. He was a wicked ruler. “For the Lord brought Judah low, because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the Lord.” (2 Chron. 28:19) He wrongfully grasped that which belonged to the Lord and gave it to a heathen king: “For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the Lord, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria ; but he helped him not. And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the Lord: this is that king Ahaz. For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.&quot; —2 Chron. 28:21-23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“ Isaiah prophesied during the reign of Ahaz and pronounced doom upon the confederacy that Israel made with Assyria, saying, “Associate yourselves, 0 ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces.” The World War came suddenly to an end in 1918, and at once the League of Nations began to be formed. It was in 1919 that the clergy issued a manifesto declaring that “the League of Nations is the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth”. In other words, the clergy, representing “Christendom”, so called, and which is unfaithful Israel, entered into a confederacy with the Devil’s organization, substituting the Devil’s makeshift for and in the place and stead of the kingdom of heaven under Christ Jesus. The prophet Isaiah continued the warning to Israel, declaring that the confederacy with the heathen king would be disastrous under the rule of Ahaz. The prophet Isaiah, in prophesying concerning the confederacy, said: “Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand; for God is with us [that is to say, Isaiah and all who stood faithful to Jehovah God], For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of thi-people.”—Isa. 8:10,11.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Ahaz ignored the warning given by Isaiah, just as “Christendom” ignored the warning given by God's people at the end of the World War, and turned awaj from Christ Jesus the King and made an alliance with the Devil or otherwise openly declared for the Devil. It was the fear of man that drove “Christendom’s” leaders fully into the Devil’s camp. Continuing then his prophecy, Isaiah addressed his words to the faithful servant of Jehovah: “Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling, and for a rock of offence, to both the houses of Israel [both houses, that is, natural Israel and unfaithful spiritual Israel, which is ‘Christendom’ and which entered into the confederacy of the nations under the Devil’s control] ; for a &quot;in and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many among them [including Ahaz; the modern clergy leaders or religionists in particular] shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken. Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.” (Isa. 8:9-lG) All this strongly supports the conclusion that the prophecy of Micah is fulfilled and applies after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple and after the setting up of “the abomination of desolation”, which occurred early in the year 1919 according to the world calendar.—Dan. 12:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> It was about that time (A.D. 1919) that the so-called “Protestantism”, represented by the “Protestant” clergy, died completely out. The “young lion”, mentioned in the Scriptures, that roared against God’s antitypical Samson, ceased to exist at that time and the “Protestant” clergy went over, body and breeches, to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the modern Philistines. (Judg. 14:5,6) Since then the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has considered that they have a clean field to shortly conquer and rule the whole world, and in this they are making particular progress in America at the present time. Ahaz, who also pictured the so-called “Protestant” clergy, who had grasped that which had belonged to the Lord and turned it over to the Devil, died; and that also pictured the end of “Protestantism”. Prophetically concerning this it is written: “In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden. Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of thee, because the rod that smote thee is broken; for out of the serpent’s root shall come forth an adder, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent. And the first-born of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety; and I will kill thy root with famine, and thy remnant shall be slain. Howl. 0 gate; cry, 0 city; thou art melted away, O Philistia, all of thee; for there cometh a smoke out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks.” (Isa. 14:28-31, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev.</span><span class="font5"> Ter.) If the Roman Catholic Hierarchy had any vision whatsoever of Jehovah’s purposes that crowd would not now be boasting and felicitating each other, because their days are numbered and the end thereof is near, and this is shown by the prophecies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, then came to the throne of Israel, and Micah continued to prophesy during his reign. (2 Chron. 28: 27) The name Hezekiah means “Strength of Jah”, and, true to his name, Jehovah did strengthen him. ‘“Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. And he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, according to all that David his father had done.” (2 Chron. 29:1, 2) This Hezekiah also fought against the enemy of God, including the Philistines: “And the Lord was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he went forth; and ho rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not. He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.” (2 Ki. 18: 7, 8) Hezekiah followed in the steps of David: “He, in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the Lord, and repaired them”; this because Hezekiah told the priests that they must cleanse the house of the Lord. “For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord, and turned their backs. Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place, unto the God of Israel. Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the Lord God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us. My sons, be not now negligeut: for the Lord hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense.” “And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king by the words of the Lord, to cleanse the house of the Lord.”—2 Chron. 29:3, G, 7,10,11,15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> Micah was prophesying during that time, and this apparently supports the conclusion that the prophecy of Micah began to have fulfillment with the coming of Christ Jesus, and after the coming of the Lord to the temple, and while the remnant is being taken into the Kingdom covenant and the sanctuary is cleansed. Now the Micah class, that is, the remnant, see and appreciate that there is a war in progress against the modern Philistines, and they greatly rejoice as they contemplate the Lord’s complete victory over that wicked croud in God's own due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ARMAGEDDON’ FORESHADOWED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> It was during the reign of King Hezekiah that Jerusalem was assaulted by the enemies of the Lord. Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, took the fenced cities in the land of Palestine, and then sent Rab-shakeh, his messenger, to Jerusalem and there tried to induce the Jews to forsake Hezekiah and willingly surrender to Sennacherib. Likewise Satan's emissaries have employed many devices in an attempt to seduce God's people and cause them to forsake the kingdom of God and go over to the Devil's organization. At the present time the Devil’s representative, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allied clergy, working behind the scenes, are trying to induce God's people to bow to men and images and to salute them and to salute flags, and to thereby attribute salvation to things rather than to God, the purpose of the enemy being to cause men to be unfaithful to the Lord and to thereby bring about their own destruction. The boastful threats of Rabshakeh and his principal, Sennacherib, being told to Hezekiah, that king sent a messenger to the prophet Isaiah, asking him to inquire of the Lord what he must do: “And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the Lord, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. Behold, I will send a blast upon him; and he shall hear a rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.” (Isa. 37: 6, 7) In this prophetic picture it is clearly seen that Jehovah will fight the battle of Armageddon and destroy the enemy and preserve alive those who faithfully stand with him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> It was “in the days of . . . [the] kings of Judah” that the word of Jehovah came to Micah. Antityp-ically this means that in the day of the coming of Christ Jesus the King, and of the gathering unto himself of all others who praise and serve Jehovah, the prophecy has fulfillment. At the same time the unfaithful rulers in “Christendom” (like Ahaz the unfaithful) are in power, ruling the nations of the earth. Jehovah’s witnesses are now in the land of “praise”, for which “Judah” stood, and they are seen actively engaging in praising and serving Jehovah God. The word of Jehovah came to Micah at a time in which “he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem”. Micah prophesied within twenty-one years, up until the destruction of Samaria and the carrying away of the ten tribes of Israel. “And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it. And at the end of three years they took it, even in the sixth year of Hezekiah (that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel) Samaria was taken. And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in llalah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.”—2 Ki. 18:9-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> Samaria means “watch station”. It was the capital city of the ten tribes, which composed one of the two houses of Israel, and concerning whom Isaiah prophesied that Christ would be a stone of stumbling. (Isa. 8:14) Therefore Samaria well pictures the “Catholic population”, which is under the domination of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and also the laity or common people of the so-called “Protestant” religious organization; and also includes all those who are guilty of the “sin of Samaria”, that is, the worshipers of religious leaders or so-called “heroes”. Micah prophesied up to within 110 years of the destruction of Jerusalem, the name of which city means “possession of peace”. Unfaithful Jerusalem pictures the ruling class of “organized religion” (otherwise called “Christendom”, in which the clergy are the chief actors) and also pictures the “man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” or the Judas class.—2 Thess. 2:3-12; John 13:26,27; 17:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2S</sup> Jehovah by his prophet now addresses his command to all the religionists, as well as to all other peoples of the earth, and says to them: “Hear, all ye people [Hear, ye peoples, all of you </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rev.</span><span class="font5"> Per.)] ; hearken, 0 earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord God be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.” (Micah 1: 2) That means Catholics and “Protestants”, so called, and all other religious systems, including laymen and clergymen or shepherds, and the “principal of the flock”, the “elective elder” class, and the “man of sin” class, and all who follow after or associate with them. Otherwise stated, the command is addressed to all of Satan’s organization, including the leading men or the rulers thereof, and all supporters thereof, that is, all to whom the Devil has come down in wrath and for all of whom it is now a time of woe. (Rev. 12:12) To all of such Jehovah says: “Let the Lord God [sovereign Jehovah] be witness against you”; “and let my Lord Jehovah be among you for a witness.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font5"> Christ Jesus had then been enthroned by Jehovah, had cast Satan out of heaven, and now began to give his attention particularly to the things of the earth, when this part of the prophecy specifically began to apply. The World War was stopped by Jehovah in order that the peoples of earth might have an opportunity to hear Jehovah’s testimony, which he would deliver by and through his witnesses, before he executed Satan’s organization at Armageddon. The time had come to hear, and they must “hear” and “hearken”, though they forbear, that is, desist or refuse to give heed to the commandment. This gospel of God’s kingdom must now 'be preached as a witness to all the nations before the end comes, as the Lord Jesus subsequently stated.—Matt. 24:14,21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> Mark this, that the command comes “from his holy temple”. That exactly corresponds with the time when the “Messenger of the covenant” has suddenly or straightway come to the temple, having finished the work of preparing the way before Jehovah. (Mal. 3:1) It is the time when Jehovah has ‘brought forth his servant </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Branch’</span><span class="font5"> at the temple. (Zech. 3: 8) Jehovah’s great Vindicator, the High Priest after the order of Melchizedek, has come to the temple and hence ‘the desire of all nations has come’. (Hag. 2:7) The great High Priest is now “a priest upon his throne”, ministering to the things of Jehovah God according to His sovereign will. (Zech. 6:12,13) Therefore in the representative capacity of his Christ, and clearly in line with the prophecy uttered by Micah, “Jehovah is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before him” and bear the testimony which the Lord has commanded his witnesses to deliver: “But Jehovah is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.” (Hab. 2:20, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> It is the time of judgment: “The Lord is in his holy temple, the Lord's throne is in heaven; his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men. The Lord trieth the righteous; but the wicked, and him that loveth violence, his soul hateth. Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest; this shall be the portion of their cup. For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness ; his countenance doth behold the upright.” —Ps. 11:4-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> The judgment begins at the house of God. (1 Pet. 4:17) Then the judgment proceeds to the separating of the nations and identifying and marking each class. (Matt. 25: 31-46) It is the time when the temple of God is opened in heaven and the ark of the covenant is seen therein, which denotes the presence of Jehovah. (Rev. 11: 19, J.1?.F.) These scriptures are all in exact harmony, to be sure; all bear testimony not only that the Lord Jesus is present as King and that the end of Satan’s rule is at hand, but that the Lord Jesus, as the great and duly commissioned Judge of Jehovah, now carries forward his work of judgment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>26</sup> Heretofore students of the Scriptures have relied upon chronology to prove the presence of the Lord, but the strongest evidence, and the most conclusive proof of his presence, is the fulfillment of prophecy, which has taken place and which could take place only after the coming of the Lord to the temple. Some persons who think themselves in Christ Jesus will now quibble over the word “sign” as that word is found in Matthew 24: 3, and will say that ‘the word is in the singular, showing that there is but one sign, and therefore there is no evidence of Christ’s presence’. Such a conclusion is entirely without reason and is exactly contrary to the Scriptures. The apostles propounded the question to Jesus, “What shall be the sign of thy coming?” (Matt. 24: 3) The word “sign” used therein,' while in the singular, does not denote merely one thing. The word means, and is so defined by lexicographers: “An indication, token or proof of a fact.” Many witnesses may be called to testify to establish a certain thing or fact, and their testimony as a whole is referred to as the proof, indication, token or sign in support of the question at issue. It is not the purpose here to discuss the proofs of the Lord’s presence at any length, because that question is now fully and completely settled to the entire satisfaction of those who love and serve Jehovah and requires no discussion by those who are thus fully consecrated and devoted to doing the will of God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> The Lord God now gives the warning and commands the attention of all, saying, “For, behold,” thus drawing the clear and undivided attention to what is about to be said. The Lord is at his temple, and now the people must receive notice of warning because the ‘day of the vengeance of our God’ is here, and those commissioned by the Lord God must now bear testimony of and concerning Jehovah’s vengeance against Satan’s organization and give warning thereof to the people. (Isa. Gl: 2) It is a time to be most serious, attentive, and obedient to the Lord God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup>’ The prophecy then announces why the Lord is commanding attention: “For, behold, the Lord cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.” (Mic. 1:3) “The Lord cometh forth out of his place,” says the prophecy, which place is Zion, his official habitation, and in which he has been since 1918 and where he is located permanently: “For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell; for I have desired it.”—Ps. 132:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> At this point of the prophecy Satan has been cast out of heaven and down to the earth and Jehovah now’ gives his attention to the things of the earth, acting, as he always does, through his great High Priest, to w’hom he has committed all power in heaven and earth. This is the time to which Jehovah’s prophet referred when he wrote these words: “0 that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence, as when the melting fire burnetii, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!”—Isa. G4:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>50</sup> It is the time for the giving of testimony of warning and for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The earth, as the Scriptures clearly declare, is the footstool of Jehovah, and now the time has come for the enemies of God to be trodden under foot by Christ Jesus, his Executor. (Ps. 110:1-5) Therefore Jehovah has come down to “tread upon the high places of the earth”. No religionists, rulers, organizations or persons may now act proudly before Jehovah and get away with it, because the time has come to bring the high and mighty, the haughty and scornful, down to the dust. Regardless of how lofty and high anything in the earth may be, still it is beneath the heel of Jehovah and that of his Christ. No rulers of the wicked world constitute the “higher powers” (Rom. 13:1), regardless of all the fuss that has been made about this, because Jehovah God and Christ Jesus are the Higher Powers, and Jehovah alone is supreme, and he makes all the earth to be the footstool of his Christ: “The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down; and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> alone shall be exalted in that day. For the day of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he shall be brought low.”— Isa. 2:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” The kingdoms and the rulers of the earth have long been the backbone of Satan's earthly organization, but now the time has come when those scornful and haughty men, who have hardened their hearts like stone against Jehovah, must be and will be broken and brought down to the dust: “And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that are poured down a steep place.”-Mic. 1:4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>82</sup> The backbone of Satan’s organization is represented by the “mountains”, which stand out above the other parts of the ground. Jehovah is as “a consuming fire” to his enemies, which fire will quickly melt down the powers that now rule the nations. “But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burned up.” “Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat.”—2 Pet. 3:10,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>83</sup> The great governments and rulers of the earth, likened unto the mountains, shall be split and valleys shall be cleft in them, destroying their adhesiveness, dividing and breaking their unity, and leaving them in ruin. Their leagues and treaties and alliances and confederacies will not hold. Jehovah caused his prophet to utter a prayer which shows his purpose to destroy all these wicked earthly powers: “As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; as wax mclteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.”—Ps. 68:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>84</sup> The Lord also uses a flood of waters as a figure of speech, saying: “As the waters that are poured down a descent.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Margin)</span><span class="font5"> This shows that when Jehovah God begins the execution of his judgments the earthly organizations will be dissolved quickly and shall melt away like a mountain torrent, which rushes down and sweeps everything that is in its path.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> This prophecy is also a statement of Jehovah’s judgment and determination to destroy all of Satan’s organization at Armageddon and is another positive and conclusive statement that the witness work to be done by Jehovah’s witnesses must be completed before Armageddon, which is great tribulation falling upon Satan’s organization. This is an urgent reason why Jehovah’s witnesses must be diligent in the performance of their commission now and continuously until Armageddon. If the battle of the great day of God Almighty is merely to accomplish the destruction of the wicked, then why should the Lord command all to hear and to give heed to what he is about to do? To be sure, Jehovah could have destroyed the Devil and his organization long ago; but it clearly is his will that something else must be done. Here again appears the supreme issue, which is strongly emphasized, that is, the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Satan has builded a mighty organization in defiance of Jehovah God. He and his agents have brought great reproach upon the name of Jehovah, and this he has accomplished chiefly by employing religionists to carry on a racket in the name of the Lord God and in the name of Christ. The effect upon the common or ordinary people has been and is that they have been deceived, being given entirely the wrong impression of Jehovah and his purpose, and this has caused them to disregard God’s Word and to curse his name. Now Jehovah brings about the end of all the wicked rulers and the ruled. His purpose is to destroy the enemy, not merely to get the enemy out of the way, but that his name may be vindicated, and that all creation that lives may know and understand that he is God, whose name alone is Jehovah, and those that live can receive life only from Jehovah through Christ Jesus our Lord and Redeemer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>88</sup> The Devil and his crowd, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allied clergy, fight from behind, because they are the cowards working in the darkness under the forces of darkness. They take advantage of their adversary and stab him in the back. Jehovah proceeds exactly in a contrary manner, because Jehovah is righteous, always right. When the time comes for him to fight he gives the enemy full and fair warning and then tells him to get ready and to do his worst, because the enemy is going to be destroyed. At the same time he gives fair warning to the people, including all those of good-will who desire righteousness, warning them of the day of the expression of his wrath upon Satan and his organization; and this he does in order that those of good-will who hear and give heed may flee “into the mountains” (Matt. 24:15,16), to the “cities of refuge” (Num. 35:11-15), the only place of safety, that is, to God’s kingdom under Christ. This favor and blessing the people can have only by placing themselves with God’s organization and rendering themselves in obedience to his commandments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>81</sup> This is a most solemn time and requires the most serious consideration to be given to God’s Word, not only by the people of good-will who are thus warned, but also by those who are commissioned by Jehovah to give the warning. God commands his witnesses to go throughout the land and give the warning by informing the people of his vengeance that will shortly be expressed. Christian people formerly thought that God’s purpose is chiefly to save them and give them life; but now it appears that there is much more involved. Those who do get life with Christ Jesus must fully obey the commandments given by the Lord. He tells his witnesses in plain phrase that if they fail to give the warning, as commanded, they shall suffer destruction. “’So thou, 0 son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. When I say unto the wicked, 0 wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in liis iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.”—Ezek. 33: 7, 8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> There are those who claim to be followers of Christ Jesus and in line for the Kingdom who seem to have no appreciation of these and like texts in the Scriptures. They go to a convention of God’s people and apparently listen to some speaker whom they fancy deliver his speech, and when it comes to serious consideration of what God commands them to do they are wholly indifferent. They seldom take part in the witness work, saying that someone else may do that. Whether such indifferent ones are in the temple or not, they have been informed of God’s purpose and commanded to make that purpose known unto others. (Rev. 22:17) Therefore there rests upon such a very grave responsibility of participating actively in the witness work. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> calls attention to these things because it seems clearly to be necessary to repeatedly warn some of the consecrated that there now rests upon them a very great obligation and duty, and their failure to give heed to the Scriptures, which Jehovah has caused to be written by hi-prophets, will bring all such negligent ones clearly to the point of adverse judgment, which they will receive. God is no respecter of persons, and each one who hears his commandments is responsible to the Lord. Further consideration of this prophecy that follows discloses that Jehovah assigns a reason why he gives the warning, and why he will execute his vengeance upon the various ones who do not heed his Word and show their complete willingness to obey and then obey the commandments of the Most High.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>DUAL POWER FORESEEN</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">A ND I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">two iiokns</span><span class="font3"> like a lamb, and he <sup>x</sup> spake as a dragon And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast [that rose up out of the sea] before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. And he docth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.”—Rev. 13:11-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here the apostle John, representing God’s anointed witnesses on earth today, beheld “another beast” having “two horns like a lamb” and “coming up out of the earth”, and its speech was like a “dragon”, which is a symbol of Satan. Within the meaning of the prophetic Scriptures, “beast,” briefly defined, means a rule by violence; that is, (1) a violent coercion of the conscience of the governed, the people ; and (2) a rule over or control of the person by the exercise of force in a violent manner. Gradually the Lord God has made known to his people on earth the identity of this two-horned beast, as well as the wild sea beast. In God’s organization the symbol of “the wheels” is found. (See Ezekiel 1:16.) In an assembled and operating machine there are wheels within wheels. Every great organization has parts, and the wheels represent important parts. Satan, the mimic god, we might expect to try to follow in his organization a course similar to that of Jehovah God. Satan brought “out of the sea” his “wild beast” organization, and this dates from ancient Egvpt forward and continue-, down to the seventh world power today. Satan built up a puv, er-ful organization with many parts thereto. That v isible earthly organization is otherwise symbolized by “the earth”, and which, according to 2 Peter 3:10, is marked for destruction. The two-horned beast comes up out of the earth, that is to say, grows up out of the organization that already existed. The two-horned beast then directs the making of the “image of the beast”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That “wild beast” that came up “out of the sea” is Satan’s entire visible organization on earth. It had one of its seven heads wounded in the World War of 1914-1918. and the wound was healed. The two-horned beast is the Anglo-American imperialism, that is to say, the combined powei of Britain and America, and which is a part of the organization of “the god of this world”. (2 Cor. 4:4; Luke 4 : f&gt;-7) The British Empire is the seventh of the world powers listed in the Bible (Rev. 17: 9, 10), and it is the most powerful of all. That world pow'er grew up out of the nations and peoples that had already been organized into Satan's visible organization, symbolized by “the earth”. Hence the Scriptures say that ‘the two-horned beast came up out oi the earth’. This does not at all militate against the fact that it was and is a part (the seventh head) of the wild beast that came up out of the sea. Growing up out of this Devil organization (the ‘sea beast’) came the two-liorncd beast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “two horns” would symbolize a dual power. It is to be noted that these horns are like a lamb’s. A lamb’s horns are just beginning to sprout; they are not very much in evidence. This would seem to suggest that the power exercised by the Anglo-American imperialism would be exercised in an apparently innocent way. A lamb is an apparently innocent beastie. It is well known that the British are past masters at diplomacy. They are suave and exercise their power in a diplomatic manner. In other words, this symbolic beast has tremendous forces at work, silently exercising influence where few suspect it is active. The apostle John says that this “beast” spoke “as a dragon”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The British Empire really started as an empire when its ruling sovereign chartered the English East India Company in A.D. 1600. Centuries before that England was a part of the Roman Empire; therefore, as an empire she grew up “out of the earth”, that is to say, out of Satan’s visible organization already in existence. Within seven years after the beginning of the empire, to wit, May 13, 1G07, the first permanent settlement in America was founded at Jamestown, Virginia. That marked the beginning of the thirteen colonies of the British Empire in America; and for 169 years thereafter these colonies were an integral part of the British Empire. Even today in America Great Britain is referred to as “the mother country”. The revolution of 1776, and the subsequent establishing of the independent government of the United States, does not at all militate against the fact that the symbol of ‘the two-horned beast’ refers to Britain and the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The two nations or countries have had too many contacts and important and related interests, to separate them English is the common language of the two nations, and is today the dominant language of the earth. Some British imperialists view the United States as one of the integral parts of the British Empire, now the British Commonwealth of Nations since 1931. By act of the British Parliament the various countries forming the empire, or commonwealth, have each a recognized measure of independence and autonomy, and each has had a separate seat in the League of Nations. To be sure, the United States stands out in a class all by herself amongst the English-speaking people, and that makes of her distinctly one of the “horns” of the twohorned beast and also a part of the seventh world power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is true that there was war between Britain and the United States in 1812, but it is also true that there have been many rebellions in Ireland. At the time of the World War the United States and Britain were so interconnected in their financial relationships that they were practically one. The commercial interests of the two countries are vitally tied together. The sinking of a British vessel was the real pretext for America to enter the World War, and during the war most of the American troops and supplies were carried in British ships. It was the British-owned American newspapers that took the lead in the propaganda campaign carried on to put America in the World War, and she went in as an ally of Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is today a reciprocity agreement between the United States and Canada, a part of the dominion of the British Commonw<sup>r</sup>ealth of Nations. The Latin countries of South America have feared the imperialistic aims of the United States. In the Pan-American Union the United States is the dominant figure, of course. The imperialism of America dates from December 2, 1823, with the “Monroe Doctrine”, which doctrine does not declare against the United States^ enlarging her territory on the Western Continent at the expense of minor American republics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A religious tie binds the British and American nations as one. Although the Catholics are strong in Britain and America, these two countries are the bulwark of Protestantism. No Catholic has ever been able to be elected president of the United States. Nominally, England has a king; yet in fact it is a democratic representative government in form and is ruled by the commercial and political interests in which the clergy unite; the Protestant clergy constitute an important part. There are in the official government lords temporal and lords ecclesiastical. There is also a financial or commercial relationship between the two countries of Britain and America that binds them together. They are in fact one great country, acting separately and distinctly and yet together, and fitly represented by the “two horns”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning American imperialism as dating from the “Monroe Doctrine” of 1823, that doctrine is, in substance, that European monarchies or governments must not by conquest acquire territory and rulership over the countries of North and South America and make them colonics and thereby enlarge the territory of the European nations. The doctrine does not declare, however, against enlargement of United States territory on the Western Continent at the expense of smaller American republics, and history records that America did make war with Mexico and took over Texas; she made war with Spain and established a pio-tectorate over Cuba and Puerto Rico. For a time she established a protectorate over Santo Domingo, Haiti, and put in operation a military policy in Nicaragua. In co-operation with Brazil and the Netherlands government in exile the American army troops took up positions in Dutch Guiana (Surinam) on November 23, 1941, allegedly to guard the aluminum ore deposits there, for the duration of the present war or of the emergency. America acquired the Canal Zone and Alaska. She also acquired title to the Philippine Islands, to the Hawaiian Islands, and to Samoa and Guam, and thereby enlarged her territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">True to the traditional policy (to wit, diplomatic hypocrisy) of the two-horned beast, the ostensible reason for the Monroe Doctrine was to protect the infant republics of the American continent. The real reason was in the interest of Britain and America. In support of this conclusion the following historical fact is related, as quoted from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font3"> Volume 19, pages 373, 374: “This feeling of confidence in the continuance of the new governments [Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Brazil, and LaPlata] received a severe shock when the combination of central European powers, commonly called the Holy Alliance [the chief amongst which was Germany], after crushing several attempts at liberal government in Europe, turned its attention to Spain and to the Spanish colonies . . . The United States feared that France would undertake this commission also and would claim Cuba as the price of service to Spain, thereby securing a broader foothold in America.” To show that Great Britain was deeply interested in the policy of the Monroe Doctrine, and that Britain and America were working in conjunction with each other, the following historical fact is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The time seemed to have eome in 1823 for some sort of action that would head off the threatened invasion of Latin America by third parties in behalf of Spain. Something was also needed to check the Russian advance into North America, and the opportunity was convenient for expressing the undying love of Americans for the popular government that they had chosen. At this moment George Canning, Foreign Minister of Great Britain, stepped into the controversy. England was interested in unrestricted trade with the Spanish-American countries and was extremely opposed to the constricting policy of the Holy Alliance, both in Europe and America. Hence, in August and September 1823, Canning four times proposed to Richard Rush, our Minister in London, that the United States join England in a declaration against intervention, and [President] Monroe was inclined to accept the proposal. After long Cabinet discussions John Quincy^ Adams, Secretary of State, convinced the President that it would be better to make an independent declaration. Adams’ papers show that he not only suggested but formulated most of the important presidential message of 2 Dec. 1823, several passages in which, construed together, constitute the original and genuine Monroe Doctrine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As with the League of Nations compact of 1919, an American president got the credit for writing the Monroe Doctrine, but it really emanated from a fertile British mind. In support of this conclusion the following historical fact is important:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">‘‘The original Monroe Doctrine was at once effective. Canning [the Foreign Minister of Great Britain] was so much interested in the result that he claimed it for himself and said (21 Dec. 1826) : ‘I looked another way ... I sought for compensation in another hemisphere. ... I called the new world into existence to redress the balance of the old.’ ” (Page 374) The same authority further says: •'During the Spanish War of 1898 Great Britain made it clear that other European powers must not interfere with the American policy of the United States.” (Page 375) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font3"> Volume 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This shows that both of the horns of the “beast” were working together, and the physical facts of 1941 show they continue to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There never before was a land monster like the 'two-homed beast’. Says </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font3"> Vol. 4, page 558, under the title “British Empire”: “It is the largest body of land and of people under any one jurisdiction on the globe, comprising about one-fourth of the earth's surface, and one-fourth of its inhabitants. Extensive portions of it lie in each of the five grand divisions of the globe. Its organization is entirely different from that of any other 'empire’ in history.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If to the above are added the vast domains of the United States and its territories it is seen that this two-horned “beast” governs and easts a shadow over a large part of the earth’s surface. This imperialism dating from A.D. 1G00 is unparalleled and is the greatest empire of all time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The vision shows this beast with “two horns like a lamb”. A lamb is an inoffensive creature and acts only on the defensive. It is the boast of the British that England has always waged a defensive warfare. The Americans claim that America is always on the defensive. Both Britain and America claim to be always on the defensive and as harmless as a lamb. Revelation 13:11 proceeds with the description: “And he spake as a dragon.” Concerning the Dragon, Revelation 12: 3,4 says: “And the dragon stood before the woman [God’s organization] which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child [The Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus] as soon as it was born.” Thus it makes a vicious attempt to destroy God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the names of the Dragon is that of Serpent, which means deceiver; and while this two-horned ‘'beast” has had a lamb-like appearance, its words have been deceptive. 'Thy speech betrayeth thee.’ Its speech shows it to be the offspring of the great Dragon, the Devil, because history shows it is poisonous, deceptive and devouring, and making a vicious attempt to destroy Jehovah’s kingdom and the witnesses thereof, in order to gain world domination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ shall gain the world domination and exercise it forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s faithful witnesses have become instructors of many by visiting them at their homes and by holding study meetings and aiding them in studying God’s Word. Such has been and is a tremendous witness work, carried on in divers ways, to wit, by use of books, booklets, magazines, radio, phonographs, and by traveling from place to place and from house to house, speaking to those willing to hear. They have met with many who have had a hearing ear, and these the witnesses have instructed in the way of the Scriptures. Their journey and work as Jehovah’s servants are along the rough and rugged way, viewed from the human viewpoint, but always the way of joy of heart to those who willingly engage in the field witness work. It is not expected it would be easy on the human organism; it has not been. It has been too hard for some.

<p><span class="font3">It is the Theocratic Government that is of paramount importance. Therefore the prophetic drama of Job includes the Head and body members of that government, also the faithful men of old who will be the earthly representatives of that government and rule amongst men, filling the places of visible governors; and also those who receive the divine commission from Jehovah and who act under that government to carry out that divine mandate to fill the earth. The severe test to which Job was subjected foretold the test to which the members of The Theocracy are put; and a like test is put upon every one who holds an official position under that righteous government. Each and every one under the test must hold fast his integrity in order to receive the approval of the Lord Jesus Christ the King and of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah will vindicate his name by destroying all those who work against his government under Christ Jesus. It is Satan, that wicked one, operating his religious-totalitarian conspiracy against The Theocracy that is now desperately fighting against Jehovah’s kingdom. There is no compromise and no possibility of peace between God and the wicked. Today the Vatican officials, together with the dictators, are moving with all their power to destroy everything in the earth that will not submit to the devilish rule. All this is in defiance of Almighty God and a reproach upon his name. Jehovah’s name must be vindicated It shall be vindicated! The only possible way to bring about the vindication of Jehovah’s name is the complete destruction of the wicked, every part of Satan’s organization.

<p><span class="font3">The true followers of Christ Jesus are begotten or accepted by Jehovah and acknowledged by him as his children orsons, and these must be obedient to Jehovah God their Father if they would receive life everlasting. These become new creatures in Christ Jesus, who is the Head of the new creation or spiritual Israelites: “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.’’ (2 Cor. 5:17) Having received the spirit of God, these are led by his spirit and are his sons. (Rom. 8:14-16) As children they must be obedient to his commandments; they could not live otherwise. Such are and must be witnesses to Jehovah and bear testimony to 1ns name and to his kingdom, and hence they are called by the Lord Jehovah “My witnesses’’.-Isa. 43:10-12.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah's Word makes it impossible for the faithful servant to doubt the establishment and complete domination of The Theocracy. Not only has Jehovah given his unchangeable word, but he has confirmed his word by his oath that he will build up his capital organization Zion with his beloved One, Christ Jesus, as the Head thereof, upon the throne of the organization, and that his good and righteous government shall rule the world in righteousness and that rule shall never end. King David stood as the representative of Christ Jesus, and the words above are the response of Jehovah to David’s prayer ; which words He binds with his oath, thus making doubly sure that He will bring forth his government, The Theocracv, to complete victory and glory.

<p><span class="font3">It is not sufficient for one to say, “I am a Christian; I love Ihe Lord’’; but in judging himself one must ask himself : &quot;Am I proving my faith and devotion by joyfully and enthusiastically obeying the commandments of Jehovah and his King? Am I giving my entire and undivided devotion to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Theocracy! If I am not wholly and entirely for The Theocracy I am against The Theocracy.” One cannot be negligent or indifferent to God’s commandments concerning The Theocratic Government and expect to receive God’s approval. Jael was put to the test, and she without hesitation put herself entirely on the side of Jehovah and his typical covenant people, who there remained faithful to God.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah set Noah before men as an example for those to follow who have faith in God and in his kingdom and who would be faithful. When God puts his approval upon a man, others who come afterwards do well to give consideration as to why God marks that man with approval. God never changes, and when he approves one man we may be sure that his approval will be placed upon other men who likewise do well before him. God is no respecter of persons. What is required of one to merit God’s approval he likewise requires of all others who receive his approval. The Scriptures disclose the reason why God approved Noah He was just, was blameless in his conduct, maintained his integrity, was a man of faith, and was faithful under the test, being obedient to God.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah, the Almighty God, has announced his purpose concerning man and has caused that announced purpose to be recorded in the Bible, which is His Word Jehovah’s expressed purpose concerning man constitutes or is God’s covenant concerning man. A “covenant” is a binding promise, or a declaration of purpose, to do or not to do a &lt;’cr-tain thing. When God makes a covenant he binds himself to keep it faithfully. Nothing any creature can do would hinder God in carrying out his announced purpose Every expressed purpose of Jehovah concerning man is a covenant which Almighty God performs in his own due time If God takes a man into covenant with him, that is called a two-sided or bilateral covenant.

<p><span class="font3">Such is the statement of the divine rule, from which Jehovah never deviates, and everyone who believes God can rely upon that rule. Jehovah does not arbitrarily compel any man to take a specific course. God made man a fiee creature with the privilege of choosing to obey the great Creator or to take an opposite course. That rule applied to Adam, the first man. It is the fixed rule of Jehovah, and he never changes. Jehovah’s purpose is to give men a full and fair opportunity to gain life by choosing the same or to choose the very opposite of life, which is extinction. Knowledge is required to make the choice, and God affords every opportunity for man to gain such knowledge Jehovah furnishes the opportunity to man to know which is the right way.

To receive his approval even- creature who has made a solemn covenant to do Uis will must act, not with sullenness or stubbornness, but with a burning zeal and genuine joy. Such a one has a heart full of gratitude which leads to unselfish devotion and zeal for the Lord. With Jehovah there is a fixed time for everything. When that time arrives it is the duty and privilege of his covenant people to quickly respond to his commandments. In the hour of gross darkness upon Satan’s organization and all people under it the great Vindicator of Jehovah appears and makes himself manifest to his faithful servants, and his glory and power are seen to be on those who faithfully follow his lead.

<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures are provided by the Lord for his covenant people that they may be fully equipped for every good w ork One who neglects to study the Scriptures and to be guided by the advice and admonition there given cannot have the Lord's approval. We must study his Word and do his works, that we may receive his approval. Study classes and service meetings are regularly held amongst God’s people for the purpose of enabling them to keep in mind the proper things and their mind fixed upon the righteous things of the Lord Even’ one of God’s covenant people should attend such meetings when it is reasonably possible and take an active part in them. One who is negligent and not attending .&gt;ueh study classes is failing to seek righteousness and meekness, which the Lord requires of all he approves IV </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">5 '15'11</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">These words, tvhich I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thu children —Deut. 6: 6, 7, A.R</span><span class="font3"> r.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s words are not altered and are heard with compelling force now by every one who has given his devotion to The Theocratic Government. Today the obligation is laid upon every parent who is in a covenant to do Jehovah’s will to bring his children into the congregation, that they may learn the Lord’s words and see their privilege of serving The Theocratic Government The parents that serve Jehovah and love their children will be diligent to instruct them in the way of righteousness, that they may serve the Lord and live. Parents who neglect this divine obligation drclose thereby that they have not a proper appreciation oi their relationship to God nor of their obligation to the children they brought into the world.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">My covenant will I not break, nor alte&gt; the thiny that</span><span class="font3"> i-</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">gone out of my lips.—Ps 89: 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s covenant cannot be altered or hindered lib covenant here named is his unbreakable word that his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, his Beloved One, shall be established and rule the world in righteousness. The Theocratic Government is of greatest importance, because by it Jehovah’s name shall be vindicated, Ihe completion and operation of that Theocracy is about to be revealed to all creation, and now the demons have mustered all their force and power to resist The Theocracy that they might continue to rule the world in wickedness. The controversy is that all the demons are against The Theocracy, and this controversy will be settled finally at Armageddon Individual salvation, while important to creatures, is of small importance when compared with The Theocratic Government.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JUVENILE ENTHUSIASTS, SALT LAKE CITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Saturday mornings, 9 a.m., I have been meeting with a group of school children (average attendance 14) and studying the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font3"> for one hour before going into field service. These children are enthusiastic; some have started into service for the first time in such features of the work as back-calls, street work, and delivering </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font3">Study Courses to homes. They are so eager to write bookstudy questions that we hax e questions for two weeks ahead and are now taking turns on handing in questions. The children willingly worked the very block they live on, and yesterday I saw two little girls playing the phonograph for another little girl on a porch. &quot;When they returned to my car I asked about their experience, and one said: ‘Oh, she is a school chum of mine Her father doesn’t believe there is a God, so we played the record for her and gave her a booklet to read and then give to her father.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I took a little boy, age eight, on the street with me. Timid at first, he held my hand tightly. Pretty soon he was calling out </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">‘Consolation!’</span><span class="font3"> himself; so I placed him by a post a few feet from me. He continuing offering the magazine even though one ‘goat’ rebuffed him. Soon I saw a well-dressed man talking to him and a small crowd of boys around him. I first thought I should go over and help him; then I recalled ‘Wisdom uttereth her voice in the streets’ (Proverbs 1:20) and how the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> urged the young people to place themselves in the Lord’s hands in street work. So I watched the scene until the man walked off </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">carrying a magazine.</span><span class="font3"> The boys remained; so I walked over to see if they were bothering the little publisher. On the contrary, they were asking questions and gladly accepted a sample copy. Then the little publisher repeated this conversation with the well-dressed man: Alan asked, ‘Who arc you serving<sup>?</sup> Hitler?’ Boy replied: ‘No, God.’ Man: ‘Who is God?’ Boy: ‘Jehovah.’ Man: ‘Who is Jehovah?’ The boy, in an exasperated manner, said: ‘So I just pointed up into the sky, and finally he caught on.’ The gentleman contributed five cents for the magazine, insisting the boy take one penny for himself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DELIVERING “THEOCRACY” TO BRITISH CLERGY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I called upon one rector of a near-by village [near Thornhill, Dewsbury, England], with whom I have previously held conversations regarding the truth. On this occasion I was invited into his study to discuss the presentday problems and their relation to Bible prophecy. The rector agreed to read the booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satisfied. </span><span class="font3">I noticed a set of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font3"> on his bookshelves. I referred him to Christ’s words at Matthew chapter twenty-three, pointing to its present-day application. I invited him to study the command at Revelation 18:4: ‘And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.’ On leaving he accompanied me to the car, where he carried on conversation with my wife and daughter, with the result that he asked us to spend an evening by appointment with him. A week later we were all three working from door to door in this village, and these remarks were passed to us: ‘Are you the Bible people that the rector mentioned in his sermon on Sunday last?’ On questioning we found the rector had told his congregation that that afternoon he had had a visit from Jehovah’s witnesses who were going around with books explaining the Scriptures. He said what these books contained was true and that Jehovah’s witnesses were doing a fine work. The result was that in one hour’s calling, at no more than thirty houses, seven bound books were placed. Rest of village is still to do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">INTERESTED INQUIRY FOR STUDY CLASS (ENGLAND)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Dear Sir: I have read your pamphlet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy,</span><span class="font3"> and I understand that your Association sponsors groups to study the Bible; will you therefore please give me the address of a group in or near Sanderstead or Croydon (Surrey) so that I may get in touch with them. Will you please send me another 6 copies of your pamphlet, for which I enclose 1/-; if this is not sufficient I will send the balance when I know how much is due. I enclose a stamped and addressed label.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">IN THE RURALS OF SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The first house I stopped at in the morning was a small farm house. There was a group of people on the porch, so I played them the recording “Message of Hope’, and then presented the books </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Theocracy.</span><span class="font3"> One of two men in the group, whom I had thought were politicians or preachers and who turned out to be preachers, took the books to examine them. Then both began to ask me questions and to answer them </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font3"> way, refusing to take my answers. They belittled me and my work and the ‘damnable doctrine’ I was distributing, one of them saying: ‘I wouldn’t carry old Judge Rutherford around in a box; if I was going to preach I would not use a second-hand sermon.’ The one who had the books handed me a quarter and said to the other: ‘I want this book; it is a new one.’ They had evidently read the other books too. They then advised me, very seriously, to stop this work. The one who had taken the books said: ‘I wouldn’t carry that around for a thousand dollars a day.’ I told him I would not stop for a thousand a day. Their parting words were: ‘I am going to fight this damnable doctrine in this community while we are holding this revival here.’ He did. The next day, and the second house we stopped at, we were met with these words: ‘I heard you preached about last night, but I have been reading these books for four years, and I know he was lying.’ This was from a lady of seventy years. It developed that she was visiting her daughter and lived six miles up the way we were working, and she asked to ride with us After leaving her daughter’s home, who had believed the preacher, our friend said: ‘My son was coming by for me, but I wanted to get off and talk with you folks and to be with someone who is trying to do right.’ She stayed with us the balance of the day, and most of the ones we called on were her relatives and opposed the truth. She has never been associated with Jehovah’s witnesses, but she will be hereafter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO INTERESTED THE NEW PUBLISHER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“One new one reports for the first time this month. (Mt. Pleasant, Utah) This new publisher is the party where our 10-year-old publisher started a model study about two months ago. The little children are now doing things that many experienced publishers have thought difficult.”</span></p>

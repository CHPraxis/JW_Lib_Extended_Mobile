Do You Remember?
Have you given careful thought to recent issues of The Watchtower? If so, you will find it interesting to recall the following:
□ What are some questions that two Christians might ask themselves before they begin thinking of engagement?
‘Am I really sure of the other’s spirituality and devotion to God? Can I envision serving God with that one for a lifetime? Have we been adequately exposed to each other’s personality traits? Am I confident that we will be lastingly compatible? Do we know enough about the past actions and present circumstances of each other?’​—8/15, page 31.
□ What did Jesus mean when he said to his followers: “You are the salt of the earth”? (Matthew 5:13)
Jesus implied that his followers’ preaching to others about God’s Kingdom would have a potentially preserving, or lifesaving, influence on their hearers. Indeed, those who applied Jesus’ words would be protected from the moral and spiritual decay in the world.​—8/15, page 32.
□ How can courting couples avoid the snare of sexual immorality?
If you are dating, you are wise to avoid being alone with your prospective mate under inappropriate circumstances. It is best to enjoy each other’s association in a group setting or in public places. Place limits on displays of affection, each respecting the other’s feelings and conscience.​—9/1, pages 17, 18.
□ What is understanding?
It is the ability to see into a matter and discern its composition by grasping the connections between its parts and the whole, thus getting the sense of it. (Proverbs 4:1)​—9/15, page 13.
□ What is Jehovah asking of us today?
Basically, what Jehovah is asking of us is to listen to His Son and follow his example and teachings. (Matthew 16:24; 1 Peter 2:21)​—9/15, page 22.
□ Who only can experience peace?
Since Jehovah is “the God who gives peace,” peace can be experienced only by people who love God and deeply respect his righteous principles. (Romans 15:33)​—10/1, page 11.
□ How did Joseph acquire the moral strength to say no to Potiphar’s wife day after day?
Joseph valued his relationship with Jehovah far more than he valued momentary pleasures. Also, although he was not under a divine law code, Joseph had a clear grasp of moral principles. (Genesis 39:9)​—10/1, page 29.
□ How important is our willingness to forgive our brothers?
Our prospects for continuing to receive God’s forgiveness are to a large extent contingent on our being willing to forgive others. (Matthew 6:12, 14; Luke 11:4)​—10/15, page 17.
□ To what sort of sins was Matthew 18:15-17 pointing, and what indicates that?
The sins Jesus meant were sufficiently grave that they could lead to the wrongdoer’s being viewed “as a man of the nations and as a tax collector.” Jews would not socialize with Gentiles, and they avoided tax collectors. So Matthew 18:15-17 refers to serious sins, not mere personal offenses or hurts that you can simply forgive and forget. (Matthew 18:21, 22)​—10/15, page 19.
□ What does truly loving God’s Word involve?
Loving God’s Word leads one to live in harmony with its requirements. (Psalm 119:97, 101, 105) This requires constant adjustment of one’s thinking and way of living.​—11/1, page 14.
□ Having received so much at Jehovah’s hand, what can we give in return to the greatest King and Giver?
The Bible reveals that the best gift we can give to Jehovah is “a sacrifice of praise.” (Hebrews 13:15) Why? Because this sacrifice is directly linked to the saving of life, a major concern of Jehovah in this time of the end. (Ezekiel 18:23)​—11/1, page 21.
□ What did Solomon mean when he wrote: “The words of the wise ones are like oxgoads”? (Ecclesiastes 12:11)
The words of those possessing godly wisdom prod the readers or the listeners to make advancements in harmony with the wise words read or heard.​—11/15, page 21.
□ What is godly discernment?
It is the ability to distinguish right from wrong and then to choose the correct course. The study and application of God’s Word imparts discernment.​—11/15, page 25.
□ With what should a willingness to accept responsibilities be tempered? (1 Timothy 3:1)
This should be tempered with good judgment. Nobody should take on so many assignments that he loses his joy in Jehovah’s service. A willing spirit is commendable, but willingness must also reflect modesty and “soundness of mind.” (Titus 2:12; Revelation 3:15, 16)​—12/1, page 28.
□ How may the challenge of parenting be met?
God counsels parents to be examples, companions, communicators, and teachers. (Deuteronomy 6:6, 7)​—12/1, page 32.

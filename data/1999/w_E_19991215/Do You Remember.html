<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you given careful thought to recent issues of <em>The Watchtower? </em>If so, you will find it interesting to recall the following:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>□ What are some questions that two Christians might ask themselves before they begin thinking of engagement?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">‘Am I really sure of the other’s spirituality and devotion to God? Can I envision serving God with that one for a lifetime? Have we been adequately exposed to each other’s personality traits? Am I confident that we will be lastingly compatible? Do we know enough about the past actions and present circumstances of each other?’​—8/15, page 31.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>□ What did Jesus mean when he said to his followers: “You are the salt of the earth”? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:13-40:5:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 5:13</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">Jesus implied that his followers’ preaching to others about God’s Kingdom would have a potentially preserving, or lifesaving, influence on their hearers. Indeed, those who applied Jesus’ words would be protected from the moral and spiritual decay in the world.​—8/15, page 32.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>□ How can courting couples avoid the snare of sexual immorality?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">If you are dating, you are wise to avoid being alone with your prospective mate under inappropriate circumstances. It is best to enjoy each other’s association in a group setting or in public places. Place limits on displays of affection, each respecting the other’s feelings and conscience.​—9/1, pages 17, 18.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>□ What is understanding?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">It is the ability to see into a matter and discern its composition by grasping the connections between its parts and the whole, thus getting the sense of it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:1-20:4:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:1</a>)​—9/15, page 13.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>□ What is Jehovah asking of us today?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">Basically, what Jehovah is asking of us is to listen to His Son and follow his example and teachings.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>□ Who only can experience peace?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">Since Jehovah is “the God who gives peace,” peace can be experienced only by people who love God and deeply respect his righteous principles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:33-45:15:33" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Romans 15:33</a>)​—10/1, page 11.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>□ How did Joseph acquire the moral strength to say no to Potiphar’s wife day after day?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">Joseph valued his relationship with Jehovah far more than he valued momentary pleasures. Also, although he was not under a divine law code, Joseph had a clear grasp of moral principles. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:9-1:39:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Genesis 39:9</a>)​—10/1, page 29.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>□ How important is our willingness to forgive our brothers?</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn">Our prospects for continuing to receive God’s forgiveness are to a large extent contingent on our being willing to forgive others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:12-40:6:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 6:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:14-40:6:14" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:4-42:11:4" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Luke 11:4</a>)​—10/15, page 17.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn">The sins Jesus meant were sufficiently grave that they could lead to the wrongdoer’s being viewed “as a man of the nations and as a tax collector.” Jews would not socialize with Gentiles, and they avoided tax collectors. So <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:15-40:18:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 18:15-17</a> refers to serious sins, not mere personal offenses or hurts that you can simply forgive and forget. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:21-40:18:22" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 18:21, 22</a>)​—10/15, page 19.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn"><strong>□ Having received so much at Jehovah’s hand, what can we give in return to the greatest King and Giver?</strong></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn">The Bible reveals that the best gift we can give to Jehovah is “a sacrifice of praise.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:15-58:13:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:15</a>) Why? Because this sacrifice is directly linked to the saving of life, a major concern of Jehovah in this time of the end. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:18:23-26:18:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ezekiel 18:23</a>)​—11/1, page 21.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sn">It is the ability to distinguish right from wrong and then to choose the correct course. The study and application of God’s Word imparts discernment.​—11/15, page 25.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sn"><strong>□ With what should a willingness to accept responsibilities be tempered? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:1-54:3:1" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 3:1</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sn">This should be tempered with good judgment. Nobody should take on so many assignments that he loses his joy in Jehovah’s service. A willing spirit is commendable, but willingness must also reflect modesty and “soundness of mind.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:12-56:2:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Titus 2:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:15-66:3:16" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Revelation 3:15, 16</a>)​—12/1, page 28.</p>

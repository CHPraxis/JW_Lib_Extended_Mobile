<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HUNDREDS of millions of men and women born after World War II have now reached middle age. Although many feel content with what they have accomplished, some feel disappointed. They have married, worked, borne children, and raised families, and some have seen their parents die. Today, as their hair turns gray, waistlines expand, and knees begin to creak, some feel that they have failed to reach their goals in life. In frustration, they may ask, ‘What is the meaning of life?’ Perhaps you too have asked that question.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">No doubt it is of great value to reflect on your life from time to time. On the other hand, dwelling on past decisions that you regret can leave you frustrated. Instead of telling yourself, ‘If only I had . . . ,’ how much better it would be to focus on the wise decisions you can still make in the future. One such decision would be to examine information that answers questions about life’s meaning. We invite you, therefore, to read the publication <em>Does God Really Care About Us? </em>Accepting our invitation is a decision you will not regret.</p>

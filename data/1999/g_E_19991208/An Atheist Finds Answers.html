<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“THE articles published in your <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines are incredible! Your latest issues are irresistible! They answer very many questions and also give peace of mind.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">So stated a reader from south India. He was born a Hindu, but his father raised him as an atheist. He says: “I found no purpose in life. Darwin’s theory of evolution sounded absurd. For years questions have taunted me, such as Who is God? Why is this world corrupt? Where do we go after death? Are wicked spirits real?”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Having found the answers to his questions in <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>this reader subscribed to both magazines, sent gift subscriptions to his sister, and now passes on the magazines to people he meets. Being a photographer and an artist, he expressed appreciation for the magazines’ artwork, which “speaks for itself.” By reading these fine magazines, you can join the millions worldwide who have had their questions answered and have gained peace of mind.</p>

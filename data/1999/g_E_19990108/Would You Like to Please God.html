<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Are you conscious of a spiritual need in your life? Do you feel that something is lacking in a world where only material values seem to count? Would you like to get to know God and have a close relationship with him?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You might say, ‘Yes, but how do I go about it? Isn’t it complicated to read and understand the Bible?’ Some people, perhaps because of living under hard economic conditions, have had only a few years of schooling and may have difficulty in reading. How can they be helped to know God and his requirements for everlasting life?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In 1996 the Watch Tower Society released a publication, now available in 211 languages, called <em>What Does God Require of Us?</em> It is a 32-page, full-color brochure made up of 16 sections that give the Bible’s simple answers to such questions as: Who is God? Who is Jesus Christ? What is God’s purpose for the earth? How can you find the true religion? The brochure also considers how we can draw close to God in prayer and how we can enjoy family life that pleases God.</p>

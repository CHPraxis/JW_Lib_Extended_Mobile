Question Box
▪ What publications should we study with new ones prior to their baptism?
Before a person can dedicate his life to Jehovah and get baptized, he must take in accurate knowledge. (John 17:3) He will obtain the information he needs by studying both the brochure What Does God Require of Us? and the book Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. In most cases the Require brochure will be studied first. However, if the study was started in the Knowledge book, the Require brochure should be studied after the book is completed. Why is this necessary?
The Require brochure provides an overview of the basic teachings of the Bible. If studied first, it will give the student a fundamental understanding of the requirements for pleasing Jehovah. If studied last, it will serve as a fine review of what was covered in the Knowledge book. In either case, encourage the student to look up the supporting scriptures and to meditate on them. Be sure to highlight the pictures, as they are very effective teaching aids.​—See the January 15, 1997, Watchtower, pages 16-17.
Once a Bible student has completed a study of both publications, he may be able to answer all the questions that the elders will review with him in preparation for baptism. If so, it may not be necessary to conduct a formal study with him in any other publication, though the conductor should continue to take an active interest in his progress.​—See the January 15, 1996, Watchtower, pages 14, 17.

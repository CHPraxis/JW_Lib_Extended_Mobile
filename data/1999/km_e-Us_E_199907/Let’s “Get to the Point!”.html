<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Have you ever had a householder interrupt your carefully prepared presentation with the words: “What do you want? Get to the point!” What can we learn from such an experience?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Many people today are impatient. They want to know who we are and why we are there. When they find out that the purpose of our visit is to discuss the Bible, they may close their minds. Bible reading and spiritual conversations are not important things in the lives of many people. How can we convince such householders that they should take a few minutes to discuss a Bible topic with us?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>What Works Best: </strong>The key is to show the householder that the Bible provides practical solutions for the problems that concern him and to do so in as few words as possible. The most effective presentations feature a specific question designed to make the householder think, followed by a scripture that answers the question. You may enjoy trying some of the following suggestions. They are designed to help us “get to the point” quickly while arousing the interest of the householder.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>In territory where people often say that they are not interested, raise a question that involves them personally:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “As we approach the next millennium, do you feel hopeful or doubtful? [Allow for response.] The Bible predicted the unsettling events we see today as well as their outcome.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:5-55:3:5" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 5 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:21-20:2:22" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Proverbs 2:21, 22</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ “There is much concern in this country about health care. Did you know that God promises that he will permanently solve all health problems?” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “How do you think our community would benefit if everyone who lives here applied Bible principles?” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:39" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 22:37-39</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>Since our commission is to preach the good news of the Kingdom, whenever possible we should call attention to what the Kingdom will accomplish. You might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ “Did you know that the world’s oldest book, the Bible, foretold that there will be one government for the whole world?” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">▪ “What do you think conditions would be like if Jesus Christ ruled the earth?” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:7-19:72:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 72:7, 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong><em>In territory where people are religious, you could try one of these introductions:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn">▪ “Many people suffer discrimination because of their gender, religion, or skin color. How do you think God feels about such prejudice?” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">▪ “We know that Jesus Christ performed many miracles in his day. If you could ask him to perform one more miracle, what would it be?” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:12-19:72:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 72:12-14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:16-19:72:16" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup><strong><em>If the householder is reluctant to open the door, you might start a conversation by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">▪ “Most people today are tired of hearing about problems. They want to hear about solutions. No doubt that is true of you. But where can we find real solutions to our problems?” Allow for response. Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup><strong>Why Not Try It? </strong>Oftentimes a simple, concise question is all that is needed to arouse a householder’s interest. One woman who was formerly opposed invited two sisters into her home after one of them asked the question: “Can you identify the Kingdom that you pray for in the Lord’s Prayer?” The woman was intrigued by the question, and she accepted a Bible study. She is now a dedicated servant of Jehovah!</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>When you are speaking to a householder, be genuine with your expressions. Speak from your heart. People are more likely to respond favorably when they are convinced that we are truly interested in them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:46-44:2:47" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 2:46, 47</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The work of preaching the good news is a challenge today. Some householders are suspicious of strangers. Others lead hectic lives and have little time to spare. Yet, we can be sure that there are still many deserving ones to be found. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:11-40:10:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 10:11</a>) Our efforts to search for them are likely to be more successful if we keep our presentations brief and “get to the point!”</p>

New Circuit Assembly Program
What practical benefits do you receive now from walking with Jehovah? How can you resist the temptation to allow nontheocratic pursuits to crowd Kingdom interests out of first place in your life? (Matt. 6:33) Do you find it difficult to discern right from wrong in a world that makes wrong appear right? (Heb. 5:14) These matters will be addressed at the “Benefit Now by Walking in God’s Ways” circuit assembly, beginning in September 1999.​—Ps. 128:1.
A new feature on Saturday of this circuit assembly will be the presentation of a model Service Meeting. Your circuit overseer will inform the congregations of what is planned so that all can come prepared to enjoy the program to the full.
The part entitled “Pioneers​—Keep Strict Watch on How You Walk” will show us how to exercise wisdom and reasonableness in order to buy out the opportune time for the pioneer ministry. (Eph. 5:15-17) The subject “Beware of Ways That Merely Seem Right” will teach us how to make sure of what is acceptable to God in every aspect of life. The talk “How Fulfilled Prophecy Affects Us” will help to fill our minds and hearts with a love for God’s Word. The public talk “God’s Ways​—How Beneficial!” will emphasize the practical benefits received now from keeping in step with Jehovah’s righteous requirements.
Is it your desire to demonstrate publicly by water baptism that you want to walk in God’s ways as one of his dedicated servants? Then speak with the presiding overseer so that the necessary arrangements can be made.
Make it your resolve not to miss this timely circuit assembly. Be present for the entire two-day program, for “happy is everyone fearing Jehovah, who is walking in his ways.”​—Ps. 128:1.

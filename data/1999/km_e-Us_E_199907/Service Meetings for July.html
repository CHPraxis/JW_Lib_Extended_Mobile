(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:11-40:10:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 10:11</a>) These are the ones who are sighing because of all the wicked and ungodly conditions they see around them and who are apt to seek Jehovah before the day of his anger breaks. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:4-26:9:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ezek. 9:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:2-36:2:3" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Zeph. 2:2, 3</a>) Among them are ‘those who are rightly disposed for everlasting life.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 13:48</a>) Our commission is to be disciple makers, teaching people all the things that Jesus commanded.

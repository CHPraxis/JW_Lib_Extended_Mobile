Her Professor Was Impressed
IN May 1998, the new 192-page paperback book Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? began to be released in countries around the world. By now, well over ten million copies have been printed in 33 languages. Appreciation for this faith-strengthening publication has come from many quarters.
A nursing student from South Carolina, in the United States, exclaimed about the book: “I could not believe my eyes to open to chapter 4 and read a quote from the book that we are using in class!
“The following Monday, I asked my professor if I could talk to him for just a minute. I gave the book to [him] and told him I knew that he would find the information refreshing. I showed him page 54 about the brain. He read it to himself and said, ‘This is interesting! I’ll check it out.’ After giving a copy of the book to my professor, I also left one with each of two fellow classmates who wanted a copy.”

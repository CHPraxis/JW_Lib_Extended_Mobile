It Can Improve Your Family Life
A MOTHER of four children between the ages of 12 and 22 wrote: “I know there will be many families wishing they could do it all over again with the aid of this book.” She was referring to The Secret of Family Happiness.
The 49-year-old mother from New Zealand said of the book: “It truly is written with great depth and an understanding of matters relating to the family.”
The Family Happiness book can benefit all members of the family—husbands, wives, parents, children, grandparents—yes, everyone. Among its instructive chapters are “Preparing for a Successful Marriage,” “How Can You Manage a Household?,” “You Can Overcome Problems That Damage a Family,” and “Growing Older Together.”

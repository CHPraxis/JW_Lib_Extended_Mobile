<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A MOTHER of four children between the ages of 12 and 22 wrote: “I know there will be many families wishing they could do it all over again with the aid of this book.” She was referring to <em>The Secret of Family Happiness.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The 49-year-old mother from New Zealand said of the book: “It truly is written with great depth and an understanding of matters relating to the family.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The <em>Family Happiness </em>book can benefit all members of the family—husbands, wives, parents, children, grandparents—yes, everyone. Among its instructive chapters are “Preparing for a Successful Marriage,” “How Can You Manage a Household?,” “You Can Overcome Problems That Damage a Family,” and “Growing Older Together.”</p>

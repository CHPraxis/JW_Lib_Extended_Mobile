<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A GERMAN-SPEAKING man went went to a convention organized by Jehovah’s Witnesses in order to “spy” on the Witnesses. Why? His goal was to “unmask this sect and save his friends from going astray.” After attending the convention, he wrote the following letter to his friends:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“When I approached the convention site, I wondered if this was the correct place. Not a person was in sight, and no litter or beer cans were on the floor. As I got closer, I saw two gentlemen at the stadium entrance. They greeted me and let me in.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I expected to hear noise from the thousands who were supposed to be there, but it was very quiet. ‘Well,’ I thought, ‘probably there is just a handful of people scattered over the whole place.’</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“When I entered, my attention was immediately captured by a drama that was being enacted on the platform. Only later did I realize that the stadium was filled to capacity with thousands of attentive listeners. I could feel the peaceful atmosphere. What I heard, saw, and felt during the remainder of the convention left a deep impression on me.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“Mingling with the Witnesses, I couldn’t help but notice their happy faces and loving expressions. Suddenly, I could not suppress the thought, ‘These really are God’s people!’”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Instead of ‘saving his friends from going astray,’ the young man asked them to study the Bible with him. The result? Today, he is a Christian elder. He and his family are active in one of the congregations in Zug, Switzerland.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Keep zealously seeking the greater gifts. And yet I show you a surpassing way.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:31-46:12:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 CORINTHIANS 12:31</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu">1-3. (a) How is learning to express love much like learning a new language? (b) What factors can make learning to express love a challenge?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">HAVE you ever attempted to learn a new language? It is challenging, to say the least! Of course, a young child can learn a language just by being exposed to it. His brain fairly soaks up the sounds and meanings of words, so that before long the tot is expressing himself quite adeptly, perhaps incessantly. Not so with adults. We search a foreign-language dictionary repeatedly, just to master a few basic phrases in a foreign tongue. In time and with enough exposure, though, we start to think in the new language and speaking it becomes easier.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Learning to express love is much like learning a new language. True, a measure of this divine quality is inherent in humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:27" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>.) Still, learning to express love takes extraordinary effort​—especially today, when natural affection is in such short supply. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>) This is sometimes the case right in the family. Yes, many grow up in a harsh environment where loving words are hardly ever expressed​—if at all. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:29-49:4:31" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:29-31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 6:4</a>) How, then, can we learn to express love​—even if we have rarely experienced it?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span><sup>3 </sup>The Bible can help. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4-8</a>, Paul provides, not a mechanical definition of what love is, but a vivid description of how this highest form of love acts. A consideration of these verses will help us grasp the nature of this divine quality and better equip us to express it. Let us consider some facets of love as described by Paul. We will group them broadly according to three categories: our conduct in general; then, more specifically, our relationships with others; and, finally, our endurance.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Love Helps Us Conquer Pride</strong></p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 4. The Bible provides what insight into jealousy?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>After his initial comments about love, Paul wrote to the Corinthians: “Love is not jealous.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>) Jealousy can manifest itself in envious discontent at the good fortune or attainments of others. Such jealousy is destructive​—physically, emotionally, and spiritually.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:30-20:14:30" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:13-45:13:13" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Romans 13:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:14-59:3:16" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> James 3:14-16</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 5. How can love help us to conquer jealousy when we are seemingly passed over for some theocratic privilege?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>In view of this, ask yourself, ‘Do I become envious when I am seemingly passed over for some theocratic privilege?’ If the answer is yes, do not despair. The Bible writer James reminds us that “a tendency to envy” is present in all imperfect humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:5-59:4:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">James 4:5</a>) Love for your brother can help you to restore your balance. It can enable you to rejoice with those who rejoice and not to view it as a personal affront when someone else receives a blessing or a compliment.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:18:7-9:18:9" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Samuel 18:7-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6. What severe situation developed in the first-century Corinthian congregation?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Paul adds that love “does not brag, does not get puffed up.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>) If we have some talent or ability, there is no need to flaunt it. Evidently, this was a problem with some ambitious men who had slipped into the ancient Corinthian congregation. It may be that they had superior abilities in expounding ideas or a more efficient way of doing things. Their calling attention to themselves may have contributed to splitting the congregation into factions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:3-46:3:4" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 3:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:20-47:12:20" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 12:20</a>) The situation became so severe that Paul later had to chastise the Corinthians for ‘putting up with unreasonable persons,’ whom Paul critically described as “superfine apostles.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:5-47:11:5" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 11:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:19-47:11:20" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu">7, 8. Show from the Bible how we can use any inherent talents we possess to promote unity.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span><sup>7 </sup>A similar situation can develop today. For example, some might have a tendency to boast about their accomplishments in the ministry or their privileges in God’s organization. Even if we do have a particular skill or ability that others in the congregation lack, would that give us license to become puffed up? After all, we should use any inherent talents we possess to promote unity​—not ourselves.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:12-40:23:12" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 23:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:6-60:5:6" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Paul wrote that although a congregation has many members, “God compounded the body.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:19-46:12:26" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 12:19-26</a>) The Greek word translated “compounded” signifies harmonious blending, as in the mixing of colors. So no individual in a congregation should feel puffed up about his abilities and try to dominate over others. Pride and ambition have no place in God’s organization.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:19-20:16:19" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:12-46:14:12" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 14:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:3" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 1 Peter 5:2, 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 9. What warning examples does the Bible provide of individuals who were looking out for their own interests?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Love “does not look for its own interests.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:5-46:13:5" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>) A loving person does not manipulate others in order to get his way. The Bible contains warning examples in this matter. To illustrate: We read of Delilah, Jezebel, and Athaliah​—women who manipulated others for their own selfish causes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:16:16-7:16:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Judges 16:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:21:25-11:21:25" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 1 Kings 21:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:22:10-14:22:12" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 2 Chronicles 22:10-12</a>) There also was King David’s son Absalom. He would approach those who came to Jerusalem for judgment and slyly insinuate that the king’s court lacked genuine interest in their problems. Then he would state outright that what the court really needed was a warmhearted man like him! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:15:2-10:15:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Samuel 15:2-4</a>) Of course, Absalom was interested, not in the downtrodden, but only in himself. Acting as a self-appointed king, he swayed the hearts of many. But in time, Absalom met a crushing defeat. At his death, he was not even deemed worthy of a decent burial.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:18:6-10:18:17" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Samuel 18:6-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">10. How can we demonstrate that we are keeping an eye on the interests of others?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>This is a warning to Christians today. Whether male or female, we may by nature have persuasive powers. It may be easy for us to get our way, so to speak, by dominating a conversation or by wearing down those who have a different view. If we are truly loving, however, we will keep an eye on the interests of others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:2-50:2:4" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Philippians 2:2-4</a>) We will not take advantage of others or promote questionable ideas because of our experience or our position in God’s organization, as if our views are the only ones that carry weight. Rather, we will remember the Bible proverb: “Pride is before a crash, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:18-20:16:18" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Paul also wrote that love is “kind” and that it “does not behave indecently.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:5" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4, 5</a>) Yes, love will not allow us to act in a rude, vulgar, or disrespectful manner. Instead, we will take others’ feelings into consideration. For example, a loving person will avoid doing things that would disturb the consciences of others. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:13-46:8:13" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>.) Love “does not rejoice over unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:6-46:13:6" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:6</a>) If we love Jehovah’s law, we will not wink at immorality or be entertained by things that <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>God hates. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:97-19:119:97" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalm 119:97</a>) Love will help us find joy in things that build up rather than tear down.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:2-45:15:2" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Romans 15:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:23-46:10:24" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 10:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:26-46:14:26" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 14:26</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:5-46:13:5" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>) Granted, it is only normal for us imperfect humans to become agitated or to feel a degree of wrath when someone offends us.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Some have allowed the imperfections of others to affect their decision to attend Christian meetings or to share in the field ministry. Previously, many of these put up a hard fight for the faith, perhaps bearing up under family opposition, ridicule from workmates, and the like. They endured such obstacles because they viewed them as tests of integrity, and rightly so. But what happens when a fellow Christian says or does something unloving? Is this not also a test of integrity? Indeed it is, for if we remain in a provoked state, we could “allow place for the Devil.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:27-49:4:27" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:27</a>.</p>

Is it loving to make a permanent mental record of the hurtful word or deed, as if we will need to refer to it at some future time? How glad we can be that Jehovah does not scrutinize us in such a merciless manner! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:130:3-19:130:3" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 130:3</a>) Yes, when we are repentant, he blots out our errors.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Acts 3:19</a>.</p>

Sometimes, to endure means simply to last, to continue on a set path whether trying situations are present or not. Endurance includes maintaining a good spiritual routine. For example, are you having a meaningful share in the ministry, in accord with your circumstances? Are you reading and meditating on God’s Word and communicating with your heavenly Father through prayer? Are you regularly attending congregation meetings, and do you benefit from an interchange of encouragement with your fellow believers? If so, then whether presently in favorable season or in troublesome season, you are enduring.

Well, Paul had just enumerated the gifts of the spirit, which were common among first-century Christians. Some were enabled to prophesy, others were empowered to heal sicknesses, many were given the ability to speak in tongues. Astounding gifts, indeed! Yet, Paul told the Corinthians: “If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become a sounding piece of brass or a clashing cymbal. And if I have the gift of prophesying and am acquainted with all the sacred secrets and all knowledge, and if I have all the faith so as to transplant mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:1-46:13:2" data-bid="48-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:1, 2</a>) Yes, even acts that might otherwise be of value become “dead works” if the motive for them is not love for God and for neighbor.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:1-58:6:1" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:1</a>.</p>

Paul admonished the Ephesians: “Become kind to one another, tenderly compassionate, freely forgiving one another just as God also by Christ freely forgave you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:32-49:4:32" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:32</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>Even as learning to express yourself in a new language eventually becomes easier, in time you will likely find that expressing love will become easier. Paul assures us that “love never fails.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:8-46:13:8" data-bid="52-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>) Unlike the miraculous gifts of the spirit, love will never cease to exist. So continue learning to express this divine quality. It is, as Paul calls it, “a surpassing way.”</p>

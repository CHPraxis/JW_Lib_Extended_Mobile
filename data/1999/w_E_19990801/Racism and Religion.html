<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHEN I came to the U.S. in 1978, I believed that America had long since resolved its racial problems, that blacks were equal citizens,” stated Mark Mathabane, a South African-born author, in an interview by <em>Time </em>magazine. “In many ways, I found that to be true. The U.S. seemed to be a hundred years ahead of South Africa. Then I discovered, to my horror, that not much had changed in people’s hearts.” What brought him to that startling discovery?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“One of the most segregated hours in America is 11 a.m. on Sunday,” said Mathabane. He noted that even in church, people cannot bring themselves to join in worship with those of another race. “How can they feel on the other days of the week?” he asked. Calling for education as a catalyst for change, Mathabane said: “With education you are made to accept the universality of human beings.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses agree that education is the answer, but they especially recommend education based on God’s Word. Yes, the Bible helps them to break down the barriers of racial prejudice​—even in lands where ethnic hatred is rampant. Each week in their Kingdom Halls, people of various races and nationalities gather together to be educated in the laws and principles of God’s Word, the Bible. No collections are taken at these meetings. You are welcome to attend!</p>

God’s Name Restored
“AFTER the name Jehovah has been omitted from Bibles for many years and maybe centuries, his modern-day witnesses are the only Christian religion to take a stand and restore the tetragrammaton.”a
The above words are from the book Jeová dentro do Judaísmo e do Cristianismo (Jehovah in Judaism and Christianity), by Brazilian writer Assis Brasil. But the question may be raised, Although a few Bible translations use the divine name in one form or another, why have other religions omitted it from their Bibles? “The name of God was removed,” says Brasil, “either because of superstition . . . , ulterior motives, or a desire to exalt the names of Jesus and his mother, Mary.”
However, as Mr. Brasil rightly points out: “The omission of the [divine] name has been completely corrected in Portuguese by the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.” How so? In that the name Jehovah has been restored to its rightful place in that Bible. The name Jehovah appears over 7,200 times in the New World Translation.
Since its first release, well over six-and-a-half million copies of this modern, literal translation in Portuguese have been distributed. Thus, a journalist writing in the Brazilian newspaper Diário do Nordeste was prompted to ask, “Did you know that God has a name?” Thanks to this modern Bible translation, millions can now answer, “Yes. The divine name is Jehovah.”
[Footnote]
In the Hebrew language, God’s name is written יהוה. These four letters (read from right to left) are commonly referred to as the Tetragrammaton.

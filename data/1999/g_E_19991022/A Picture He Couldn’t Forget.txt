A Picture He Couldn’t Forget
KAREN, who has been one of Jehovah’s Witnesses for over two decades, found that her father was never interested in talking to her about religion. Recently, though, that changed. He spent time in a hospital, recuperating from surgery. One day, out of sheer boredom, he read an entire newspaper. He was horrified. Later, after returning home, he called his daughter. Karen relates: “On the phone Dad said to me, ‘Karen, the world has gone to pot.’ He was especially upset by the ways that children are mistreated.
“Before I even had a chance to encourage him, he suddenly said: ‘Two ladies came to my house today. I’m usually out back in my garden, but they caught me when I was out front. One lady showed me a picture of a beautiful garden. I wanted to tell her, “Well, you should see my backyard—it’s a beautiful garden,” but I didn’t. Then she said that soon the whole world will have peace. She said it will be like that garden, for everyone to enjoy. I didn’t take the book. But after they left, I couldn’t get that picture out of my head. I just kept thinking about it and the idea of peace for everyone. Do you know what book I mean? Can you get me a copy?’”
Karen was happy to oblige. The picture her father referred to is the one that you see here. The book is entitled Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A 17-year-old girl wrote to the office of the Watch Tower Society in Moldova, a former republic of the Soviet Union, to express appreciation for an article that appeared in the June 8, 1998, <em>Awake! </em>The article was entitled “My Choice Between Two Fathers,” and it related the personal experiences of an Armenian youth.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“While I was reading the article,” the girl explained, “my eyes filled with tears because his story is similar to mine.” She continued: “When I was 15, I started to study the Bible, and my parents did not object at first. But when I began attending the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses, they strongly disapproved. Then, in 1997, when I started to share what I was learning with others, they told me: ‘Go to your Witness friends and let them feed you, dress you, and give you a job. You are a very bad daughter!’ My parents even punished me physically, banging my head against the wall.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“That was a difficult test for me. I often had the feelings expressed by that Armenian youth, who said that he sometimes wondered whether Jehovah was pleased with him. I thought to myself, ‘Am I good for nothing? Will Jehovah forgive me for my former sins? Does Jehovah love me anymore?’</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“It was very difficult, especially when I thought that Jehovah did not love me anymore. I often implored Jehovah in my prayers, with tears in my eyes, to help me, to strengthen me so that I would never leave him. And, indeed, I saw that Jehovah heard my prayers and answered my supplications. He gave me steadfastness, resoluteness, and courage. Especially did he do this through his Word, where the psalmist confidently proclaimed: ‘In case my own father and my own mother did leave me, even Jehovah himself would take me up.’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:10-19:27:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 27:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“On September 27, 1997, I symbolized my dedication to Jehovah by being baptized at a circuit assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Kagul. I can clearly see that Jehovah, our loving heavenly Father, fulfills his promise spoken about at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:84:11-19:84:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 84:11</a>: ‘Jehovah God is a sun and a shield; favor and glory are what he gives. Jehovah himself will not hold back anything good from those walking in faultlessness.’</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“I am very thankful to that Armenian youth who shared his faith-strengthening story in the <em>Awake! </em>magazine. I hope that my parents and his will eventually show interest in the teachings of the Bible.”</p>

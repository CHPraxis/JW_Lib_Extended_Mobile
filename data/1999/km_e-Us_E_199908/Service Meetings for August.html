<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Are You Having a Share in Making Disciples? Audience discussion. In view of the great amount of literature being placed, our aim should be to start Bible studies so that we can help people benefit from the publications they receive. Have publishers comment on the problems that hinder them from conducting more studies: (1) It is difficult to find people who are willing to study. (2) Some people who show interest say that they are too busy to study. (3) After a study is started, it is hard to find the person at home to keep the study regular. Also address the feelings that some publishers may have about the Bible study work: (1) ‘I don’t feel qualified as a teacher.’ (2) ‘I don’t have the time to conduct a weekly study.’ (3) ‘I hesitate to obligate myself to another person.’ (4) ‘I’m satisfied to share in the other features of the ministry.’ Offer positive suggestions on how to overcome these obstacles in order to share personally in the disciple-making work. Have successful publishers relate the joy that they have experienced in the Bible study work.​—See April 1998 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>insert, paragraphs 3-8, 15.</p>

We encounter couples who respond to the Kingdom message but who are slow to make progress because they are living together without the benefit of a legal marriage. Discuss how to help them understand why Christians must uphold honorable marriage. (See <a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:101992009/1-17">January 8, 1992, <em>Awake!, </em>pages 26-7</a>.)

This article begins a five-part series on this subject. Demonstrate a well-prepared presentation. For more information on Buddhism, see February 1998 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>insert; <a class="xt" data-xtid="14" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989203/53:143-58"><em>Reasoning </em>book, page 21;</a> and <a class="xt" data-xtid="15" href="jwpub://p/E:1101990038/"><em>Mankind’s Search for God, </em>chapter 6</a>.</p>

<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sn"><strong>18 min: </strong>Give a Reason for Your Hope. An elder interviews one or two exemplary teenagers who are in public school. They are continually confronted with situations in which worldly peers want to know why our teenagers choose not to join them in their activities. While taking advantage of such opportunities to explain their Bible-based convictions, our youths need to be firm in their resistance. The group discusses how they might respond if they are offered tobacco or drugs. Review the reasoning presented in the <em>Young People Ask </em>book, pages 277-81. Explain how defending their resolve to do what is right serves as a protection and gives a good witness.</p>

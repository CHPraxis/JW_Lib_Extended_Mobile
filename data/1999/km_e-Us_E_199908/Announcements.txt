▪ In every community at various times during the year, there are secular holidays for which children are excused from school and employees are given time off from work. These are excellent opportunities for the congregation to have an increased share in the field ministry. The elders should plan ahead for these occasions and notify the congregation well in advance of the arrangements that are being made for group witnessing during holiday periods.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting the 2000 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses with their September literature request. The calendars will be available in Albanian, Arabic, Armenian, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Ukrainian.
▪ From August 27, 1999, to August 31, 1999, the Society will be taking an inventory of all literature on hand at Brooklyn Bethel. Because of this inventory, no congregation literature requests will be processed for shipment or for pickup during those days.
▪ Adjustments have been made to the telephone numbers for the Society’s facilities in Brooklyn and Patterson, New York. The new telephone numbers are as follows: Brooklyn (718) 560-5000 and Patterson (914) 306-1000. The telephone number for Wallkill, New York, (914) 744-6000, remains the same. As a reminder, correspondence with the Society regarding congregation matters should be handled through the local body of elders.
▪ An adequate supply of forms for use during the 2000 service year is being sent to each congregation. These forms should not be wasted. They should be used only for their intended purpose.

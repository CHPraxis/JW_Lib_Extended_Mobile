Secular Education and Your Spiritual Goals
1 Obtaining a good fundamental education when you are young can provide the academic skills needed for you to read and write well and to get a general understanding of geography, history, mathematics, and science. In the process, you can learn how to think clearly, analyze facts, solve problems, and generate productive ideas. Such schooling will serve you well throughout your life. How can your secular education relate to your spiritual goals in life and help you to gain “practical wisdom and thinking ability”?​—Prov. 3:21, 22.
2 Become Useful in God’s Service: While you are in school, pay attention in class and do your homework assignments well. If you master good reading and study habits, you can more easily examine God’s Word and keep yourself spiritually strong. (Acts 17:11) Well-rounded knowledge will help you relate to people of various backgrounds, interests, and beliefs as you meet them in the ministry. The education that you acquire in school will be useful as you carry out your Christian responsibilities in God’s organization.​—Compare 2 Timothy 2:21; 4:11.
3 Learn to Support Yourself: If you apply yourself, you can also learn the skills needed to earn a living after graduation. (Compare 1 Timothy 5:8.) Choose your subjects carefully. Instead of focusing on a field that has limited employment opportunities, consider learning a trade or a skill that will enable you to find suitable work anywhere. (Prov. 22:29) Such training will make it possible for you to support yourself should you decide to serve where the need is greater.​—Compare Acts 18:1-4.
4 Getting a good basic education while in school can help you to expand your ministry. Work hard to acquire skills needed to support yourself while you advance in Jehovah’s service. Thus your schooling will serve to aid you in reaching your spiritual goals.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The special assembly day program beginning in September 1999 has as its theme: “Searching Into the Deep Things of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:10-46:2:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:10</a>) What valuable things will we learn?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In their quest for knowledge, many people are not refreshed by what they find. The Bible invigorates us, as will be shown by the circuit overseer in his part entitled “Searching God’s Word Brings Refreshment.” The visiting speaker will make the connection between searching into the deep things of God and preaching the good news as he addresses the question “How Do You View Kingdom Preaching?”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How can parents help their children to dig deep into God’s Word? Practical suggestions will be provided in the part “Inculcate God’s Word in Your Children.” Christian youths are influenced in a wholesome way by association with spiritually mature ones in the congregation. Examples of how they are favorably affected will be highlighted in the portion “Youths Who Learn From Older Ones.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Why should we diligently search for hidden spiritual treasure at this time? Jehovah is a Revealer of secrets. The visiting speaker will explain what Jehovah has revealed in ancient and modern times in the talk “Jehovah Progressively Reveals Deep Things.” This will strengthen our resolve to continue “searching into the deep things of God.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Plan now to attend. Those who wish to symbolize their dedication to Jehovah by baptism should inform the presiding overseer as soon as possible. Our earnest desire to delve into God’s Word will be fortified by what we hear. So do not miss this special day of spiritual instruction!</p>

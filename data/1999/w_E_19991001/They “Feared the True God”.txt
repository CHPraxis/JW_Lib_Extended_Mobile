They “Feared the True God”
WHILE the Israelites were in slavery in Egypt, the Hebrew midwives Shiphrah and Puah were put in a distressing position. In an attempt to control the mushrooming foreign population, Pharaoh commanded these women: “When you help the Hebrew women to give birth . . . , if it is a son, you must also put it to death.”​—Exodus 1:15, 16.
Shiphrah and Puah “feared the true God,” so they took courage and “did not do as the king of Egypt had spoken to them.” Instead, they preserved alive the male infants, though this bold stand could have put them in danger. Jehovah “dealt well with the midwives,” and he rewarded them for their life-saving acts.​—Exodus 1:17-21.
This account underscores Jehovah’s appreciation for those who serve him. He could have viewed what Shiphrah and Puah did, though courageous, as simply humanitarian. After all, no woman of sound mind would murder infants! Still, Jehovah no doubt took into consideration the fact that some humans, out of fear of man, have committed heinous acts. He knew that these midwives were motivated not only by human kindness but also by godly fear and devotion.
How grateful we can be to serve a God who takes note of our faithful acts! True, perhaps none of us have faced the test of faith that was thrust upon Shiphrah and Puah. Yet, when we stand firm for what is right​—whether in school, at our place of employment, or in any other situation—​Jehovah does not take our loyal love for granted. On the contrary, he “becomes the rewarder of those earnestly seeking him.” (Hebrews 11:6) Yes, “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work and the love you showed for his name, in that you have ministered to the holy ones and continue ministering.”​—Hebrews 6:10.

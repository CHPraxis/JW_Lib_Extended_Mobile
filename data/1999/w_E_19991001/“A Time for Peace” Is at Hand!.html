<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“For everything there is an appointed time, . . . a time for war and a time for peace.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">ECCLESIASTES 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:8-21:3:8" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 1. What ironic situation has existed during the 20th century as regards war and peace?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">MOST people yearn for peace, for good reason. The 20th century has experienced less peace than any century in history. Ironically so, because never before was so much done to secure peace. In 1920 the League of Nations was formed. In 1928 the Kellogg-Briand Pact, called by one reference work “the most grandiose of a series of peacekeeping efforts after World War I,” was subscribed to by “nearly all the nations of the world . . . agreeing to renounce war as an instrument of national policy.” Then, in 1945 the United Nations organization was set up to replace the defunct League of Nations.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 2. What is the professed goal of the United Nations, and to what extent has it had success?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Like the League, the professed goal of the United Nations is to secure world peace. But its success has been limited. Granted, the world is nowhere experiencing war on the scale of the two world wars. Nevertheless, dozens of smaller conflicts are still robbing hundreds of thousands of their peace of mind, their belongings, and often their very lives. Dare we hope that the United Nations can turn the 21st century into “a time for peace”?</p>

<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 3. Why can genuine peace not exist alongside hatred?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Peace between peoples and nations requires <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>more than just toleration. Can anyone really be at peace with someone he hates? Not according to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:15-62:3:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 John 3:15</a>: “Everyone who hates his brother is a manslayer.” As recent history proves, deep hatreds easily escalate into acts of violence.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 4. Who only can experience peace, and why?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Since Jehovah is “the God who gives peace,” peace can be experienced only by people who have love for God and deep respect for his righteous principles. Clearly, Jehovah does not grant peace to everyone. “‘There is no peace,’ my God has said, ‘for the wicked ones.’” This is because the wicked refuse to let themselves be guided by God’s holy spirit, a fruit of which is peace.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:33-45:15:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 15:33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:57:21-23:57:21" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Isaiah 57:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:22" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Galatians 5:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 5. What is unthinkable for true Christians?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>To wage war on fellow humans​—as so-called Christians have so often done, particularly in the 20th century—​is unthinkable for genuine Christians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:1-59:4:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">James 4:1-4</a>) True, they war against <em>teachings </em>that misrepresent God, but this warfare is designed to help individuals, not to harm them. To persecute others because of religious differences or to inflict physical harm for nationalistic reasons stands in sharp contrast with true Christianity. “If possible, as far as it depends upon you,” Paul instructed Christians in Rome, “be peaceable with all men.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:17-45:12:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 12:17-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:24-55:2:25" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 2:24, 25</a>.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 6. Where only can genuine peace be found today?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Today, divinely granted peace is to be found only among true worshipers of Jehovah God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:165-19:119:165" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 119:165;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:18-23:48:18" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Isaiah 48:18</a>) No political differences disturb their unity, since they are everywhere politically neutral. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:19-43:15:19" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 15:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:14-43:17:14" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 17:14</a>) Because they are “fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought,” no religious differences threaten their peace. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:10-46:1:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>) The peace Jehovah’s Witnesses enjoy is a modern-day miracle, one brought about by God in harmony with his promise: “I will appoint peace as your overseers and righteousness as your task assigners.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:17-23:60:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 60:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:10-58:8:10" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Hebrews 8:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Why “a Time for War”?</strong></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">7, 8. (a) Despite their peaceful stand, how do Jehovah’s Witnesses view the present time? (b) What is the chief weapon of a Christian’s warfare?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Despite their peaceful stand, Jehovah’s Witnesses nevertheless consider the present to be predominantly “a time for war.” Not literal warfare, of course, since forcing the Bible’s message upon others by armed might would contradict God’s invitation to “let anyone that <em>wishes </em>take life’s water free.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Revelation 22:17</a>) No forced conversions here! The warfare Jehovah’s Witnesses wage is strictly spiritual. Paul wrote: “The weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful by God for overturning strongly entrenched things.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:10:4-47:10:4" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 10:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:18-54:1:18" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 1:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Chief among “the weapons of our warfare” is “the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:17-49:6:17" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:17</a>) This sword is powerful. “The word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of joints and their marrow, and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>) By using this sword, Christians are able to overturn “reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:10:5-47:10:5" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>) It enables them to expose false doctrines, harmful practices, and philosophies that reflect human rather than divine wisdom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:6-46:2:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 2:6-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:11-49:6:13" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Ephesians 6:11-13</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 9. Why can there be no letup in our war against the sinful flesh?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span><sup>9 </sup>Another type of spiritual warfare is the one waged against the sinful flesh. Christians follow the example of Paul, who admitted: “I pummel my body and lead it as a slave, that, after I have preached to others, I myself should not become disapproved somehow.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:27-46:9:27" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>) The Christians in Colossae were admonished to deaden their “body members that are upon the earth as respects fornication, uncleanness, sexual appetite, hurtful desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5</a>) And Bible writer Jude exhorted Christians “to put up a hard fight for the faith that was once for all time delivered to the holy ones.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:3-65:1:3" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Jude 3</a>) Why must we do so? Paul answers: “If you live in accord with the flesh you are sure to die; but if you put the practices of the body to death by the spirit, you will live.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:13-45:8:13" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Romans 8:13</a>) In view of this clear statement, there can be no letup in our war against bad tendencies.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">10. What occurred in 1914, leading up to what in the near future?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Yet another reason why the present can be viewed as a time for war is that “the day of vengeance on the part of our God” is imminent. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:1-23:61:2" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isaiah 61:1, 2</a>) In 1914, Jehovah’s appointed time had arrived to establish the Messianic Kingdom and to authorize it to wage active war against Satan’s system. The allotted time period for humans to experiment with man-made rule without divine interference expired at that time. Instead of accepting God’s Messianic Ruler, most people continue to reject him, even as most did in the first century. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:27-44:28:27" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Acts 28:27</a>) Consequently, in the face of Kingdom opposition, Christ has been forced to “go subduing in the midst of [his] enemies.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:2-19:110:2" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 110:2</a>) Happily, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:2-66:6:2" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Revelation 6:2</a> promises that he will “complete his conquest.” This he will do during “the war of the great day of God the Almighty . . . , called in Hebrew Har–Magedon.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:14" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Revelation 16:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Since the 1914 turning point in human affairs, 85 years have passed. Jehovah has been extremely patient with humankind. He has made his Witnesses fully aware of the urgency of the situation. Millions of lives are at stake. These multitudes deserve to be warned because “Jehovah . . . does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:9-61:3:9" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:9</a>) Nevertheless, soon will come “the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels.” Then, all those who have willfully rejected the message of God’s Kingdom will experience the “vengeance” that Jesus will bring “upon those who do not know God and those who do not obey the good news about our Lord Jesus.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:6-53:1:9" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Thessalonians 1:6-9</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>When will Jehovah’s patience finally run out? Any speculation as to when the “great tribulation” might begin is of no value. Jesus clearly stated: “Concerning that day and hour nobody knows.” On the other hand, he admonished: “Keep on the watch, therefore, because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. . . . Prove yourselves ready, because at an hour that you do not think to be it, the Son of man is coming.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:36-40:24:36" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 36,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:42-40:24:42" data-bid="27-3" class="b"> 42,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:44-40:24:44" data-bid="27-4" class="b"> 44</a>) Plainly expressed, this means that every day we should remain watchful of world events and reckon with the outbreak of the great tribulation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:1-52:5:5" data-bid="28-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:1-5</a>) How dangerous to think that we can take it easy, living so-called normal lives, waiting to see how <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>things might develop! Jesus said: “Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:34-42:21:35" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Luke 21:34, 35</a>) Of this we can be sure: The “four winds” of destruction presently being held back by Jehovah’s “four angels” will not be held back forever.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:1-66:7:3" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Revelation 7:1-3</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Attend what? The Friday sessions of the 1999 “God’s Prophetic Word” District Convention. Last year in the United States branch territory, the peak attendance on Friday was 233,186 less than the peak attendance on Sunday. This means that over 16 percent of the total number attending on Sunday missed about one third of the convention program. Will you arrange your affairs to be present for all three days of the 1999 convention? We hope so.</p>

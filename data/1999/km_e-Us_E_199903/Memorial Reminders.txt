Memorial Reminders
The Memorial observance this year falls on Thursday, April 1. The elders should give attention to the following matters:
▪ In setting the time for the meeting, make sure that the emblems will not be passed until after sundown.
▪ Everyone, including the speaker, should be informed of the exact time and location of the observance.
▪ The appropriate type of bread and wine should be obtained and made ready.​—See the February 15, 1985, Watchtower, page 19.
▪ Plates, glasses, and a suitable table and tablecloth should be brought to the hall and put in place in advance.
▪ The Kingdom Hall or other place of meeting should be thoroughly cleaned ahead of time.
▪ Attendants and servers should be selected and instructed in advance about their duties and the proper procedure.
▪ Arrangements should be made to serve any of the anointed who are infirm and unable to be present.
▪ When more than one congregation is scheduled to use the same Kingdom Hall, there should be good coordination among congregations so as to avoid unnecessary congestion in the lobby or entryway, on the public sidewalks, and in the parking lot.

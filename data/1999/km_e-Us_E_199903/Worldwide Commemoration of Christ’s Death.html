<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jehovah has showered us with many gifts. The sum total of his goodness and loving-kindness is eloquently described as “his indescribable free gift.” Yes, the “undeserved kindness of God” is so marvelous that to describe it surpasses our ability.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:14-47:9:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 9:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>His Greatest Gift: </strong>Jesus Christ, as mankind’s Ransomer, is the greatest gift of all.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) Such an undeserved blessing from God deserves worldwide commemoration. When and how? On the evening of Thursday, April 1, 1999, Christians around the world will commemorate the Lord’s Evening Meal, observing the Memorial of the greatest of all sacrifices.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:20-46:11:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 11:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:23-46:11:26" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 23-26</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Christ died for us even “while we were yet sinners,” and we can show our personal gratitude by observing the Memorial of his death and by inviting others to be present with us on that all-important occasion.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:8-45:5:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 5:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Love for our neighbors is manifested in our inviting them to observe the Lord’s Evening Meal with us. The benefits of the ransom remain available to millions who learn of its excelling value. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:8-50:3:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Phil. 3:8</a>) Those exercising faith in Christ’s sacrifice can gain the firm hope of everlasting life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p>

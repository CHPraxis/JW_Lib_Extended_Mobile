<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Everyone has the same amount of time at his disposal each week. The portion that we devote to spreading the good news is especially valuable because it is time spent in a life-saving work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:16-45:1:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 1:16</a>) We show our appreciation for this by preparing well for the service planned, arriving at meetings for service on time, and leaving promptly for the territory. We would rather be preaching than waiting. Since Jehovah has taught us that “for everything there is an appointed time,” we need to make the time that we have set aside for the ministry really count.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Manage Your Time Wisely: </strong>Many blessings come to us when we steadfastly hold to a schedule that allows for regular participation in the field ministry. Naturally, the good results that we achieve in the ministry should be proportionate to the amount of time spent in the service. With some slight adjustments to our routine, could we devote more time to the field service? For example, after magazine activity on Saturday, could we take some additional time to make a few return visits? If we have been in the field ministry for a while on Sunday, could we spend some time also making return visits or conducting a Bible study? Would it be possible to supplement our house-to-house activity with some street witnessing? In these or other ways, we may be able to improve in our service.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>When we are out in the ministry, we can lose valuable time if we are not careful. Of course, when weather conditions are severe, a short break will refresh us and help us to keep going. Be balanced, however, since such breaks may not always be necessary.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>In recent years it has become increasingly difficult to find people at home. To cope with this situation, many publishers do their door-to-door witnessing at a different time of day. Why not try witnessing in the late afternoon or early evening?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>It is better if we do not visit with one another while engaging in street work. Instead, stand apart from one another and approach the people so as to start conversations with them. Thus time will be managed more effectively and greater joy will be derived from the work.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong>Seize Opportunities to Witness: </strong>When a householder said that she was not interested, a Witness asked if there was anyone else in the house with whom she might talk. This led to a conversation with the man of the house, who had been ill for many years and was largely confined to bed. The hope set out in God’s Word renewed his interest in life. He was soon out of bed, attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall, and sharing his newfound hope with others!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>A teenage sister applied the suggestion to engage in field service during the hour before the Congregation Book Study. At her first door, she met a 13-year-old girl who listened intently and took literature. The next day at school, the young sister saw this same girl. Soon thereafter, she offered to study the Bible with her, and the girl accepted.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup><strong>Make It Quality Time: </strong>Having a regular share in field service helps us develop our skills in presenting the good news. Can you improve your ability to start a conversation at the door by using a more effective introduction? Could you become a more skillful teacher when conducting a home Bible study? By doing so, you can truly make your time in the service count and make your ministry more productive.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Since “the time left is reduced,” our lives should be filled with Christian works. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:29-46:7:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:29</a>) Allotting time for the preaching activity should be high on our list of priorities. Let us have a healthy, zealous share in the ministry. Time is a wonderful asset that Jehovah has given us. Always use it wisely and make it count.</p>

Could the 10 videos and 11 sound drama audiocassettes provided by the Society be put to better use? Have you and your family watched or listened to every one of them? Review several titles, pointing out how they can enhance our reading of the Bible, strengthen our spirituality, and give a fine witness to the truth. Play brief excerpts from two or three audiocassettes. Ask the audience to comment on which video or sound drama they found especially effective in encouraging their own family or in directing new ones to the organization. Relate some experiences showing good results. (See the <a class="xt" data-xtid="7" href="jwpub://p/E:301999007/23-26:500"><em>1999 Yearbook, </em>pages 51-2</a>.)

Talk by an elder, based on <a class="xt" data-xtid="11" href="jwpub://p/E:1101993040/125:423-133"><em>Jehovah’s Witnesses​—Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom, </em>pages 676-7</a>. As Jesus foretold, we are ‘hated by all the nations.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:9-40:24:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:9</a>) We may face opposition when we share in the ministry, associate with worldly relatives, or deal with non-Witnesses in the workplace or at school.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Go Where the People Are! A talk based on the <a class="xt" data-xtid="12" href="jwpub://p/E:301997003/1-23"><em>1997 Yearbook, </em>pages 42-8</a>. While we should continue sharing regularly in house-to-house witnessing, we eagerly look for opportunities to do informal witnessing​—anytime, anywhere. Relate experiences from the <em>Yearbook </em>showing how others have done so with good success while riding a bus, walking on the street or beach, approaching parked cars, going to truck stops, using the telephone, and writing letters. As time permits, invite audience to relate some experiences of their own. Encourage all to take advantage of every opportunity to give a witness wherever the people are.</p>

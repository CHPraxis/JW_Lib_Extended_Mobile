<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The apostle Paul admonished congregation members to “have the same care for one another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:25-46:12:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 12:25</a>) Hence, we should show a personal interest in one another and be willing to render loving help when it is needed. As one example, some of the spiritual sisters in our midst are raising their children in the truth single-handedly. These sisters are carrying the full load of responsibility for the spiritual training of their offspring. Certainly they are worthy of our kind encouragement and practical assistance “according to their needs.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:13-45:12:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 12:13a</a>) Can you give them a helping hand?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Ways You Might Help: </strong>Offering rides to meetings and assemblies to those who must rely on public transportation may result in considerable financial savings for that family. Helping a mother care for her small children at meetings may mean that she can benefit more fully from the program. Likewise, offering to assist her when she takes the children out in field service may provide her some relief. Displaying a genuine interest in the children​—befriending them—​can do much to influence our youths in a positive way. Occasionally inviting a single-parent family to sit in on your family study would provide a refreshing spiritual lift.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Be Discreet: </strong>We should be careful not to force our help upon one who does not feel the need for it. Nor would we want to intrude into a person’s family affairs while rendering needed help. Of course, sisters and married couples would be in the best position to come to the aid of a sister who is in need.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>All Christians are encouraged to “follow the course of hospitality” toward one another. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:13-45:12:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 12:13b</a>) Giving a helping hand to our spiritual brothers and sisters is one of the many ways we show the Christlike love that we have among ourselves.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>.</p>

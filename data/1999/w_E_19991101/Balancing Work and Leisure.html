<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“LEISURE is a beautiful garment, but it will not do for constant wear.” With these words an anonymous writer aptly illustrates the value of leisure. He shows, however, that it should be balanced with productive activity.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This matter was also addressed by the inspired Bible writer Solomon. This wise king identified two extremes to be avoided. First, he noted: “The stupid one is folding his hands and is eating his own flesh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:4:5-21:4:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 4:5</a>) Yes, sluggishness can bring one into poverty. As a consequence, it can endanger the lazy one’s health, even his life. On the other hand, there are some who sacrifice everything on the altar of hard work. Solomon described their ceaseless toiling as “vanity and a striving after the wind.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:4:4-21:4:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 4:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">With good reason, Solomon recommended a balance: “Better is a handful of rest than a double handful of hard work and striving after the wind.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:4:6-21:4:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 4:6</a>) A person should “see good because of his hard work”​—that is, he should periodically take time to enjoy what he has earned. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:24-21:2:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>) And there should be other things in life besides secular work. Our family deserves some of our time. Solomon stressed that our primary obligation is, not secular work, but service to God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:13-21:12:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>) Are you among those who enjoy a balanced view of work?</p>

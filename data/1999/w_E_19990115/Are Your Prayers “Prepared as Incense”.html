<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">JEHOVAH GOD commanded his prophet Moses to have sacred incense prepared for use at Israel’s tabernacle of worship. The divine formula called for a fourfold aromatic mixture. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:34-2:30:38" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 30:34-38</a>) It proved to be sweet-smelling indeed.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:30:7-2:30:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus 30:7, 8</a>) Did the use of incense have special significance? Yes, for the psalmist sang: “May my prayer be prepared as incense before you [Jehovah God], the raising up of my palms as the evening grain offering.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:141:2-19:141:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 141:2</a>) In the book of Revelation, the apostle John describes those around God’s heavenly throne as having golden bowls full of incense. “And,” says the inspired account, “the incense means the prayers of the holy ones.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:5:8-66:5:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Revelation 5:8</a>) So, then, the burning of sweet-smelling incense symbolized acceptable prayers offered up by Jehovah’s servants both day and night.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:3:10-52:3:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 3:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:7-58:5:7" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Hebrews 5:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>If our prayers are to be acceptable to God, we must pray to him in the name of Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:16:23-43:16:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 16:23, 24</a>) But how can we improve the quality of our prayers?

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>If our prayers are to ascend to God as sweet-smelling incense, we must pray in faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:6</a>) When Christian elders find a spiritually sick person receptive to their Scriptural help, their “prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:15-59:5:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">James 5:15</a>) Prayers offered in faith are pleasing to our heavenly Father, and so is prayerful study of God’s Word. The psalmist manifested a fine attitude when he sang: “I shall raise my palms to your commandments that I have loved, and I will concern myself with your regulations. Teach me goodness, sensibleness and knowledge themselves, for in your commandments I have exercised faith.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:48-19:119:48" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 119:48,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:66-19:119:66" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 66</a>) Let us ‘spread out our palms’ in humble prayer and exercise faith by complying with God’s commandments.</p>

We need to show the sincerity of our prayers by doing what he expects all of his people to do. It is necessary for us to engage in faith-building study of the Scriptures with the aid of publications provided through “the faithful and discreet slave.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45-47;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:7-6:1:8" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Joshua 1:7, 8</a>) We also need to advance in knowledge by participating in meetings of God’s people on a regular basis.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hebrews 10:24, 25</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:1-19:110:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:3</a>) All of us should realize that such foretold events as the destruction of false religion​—“Babylon the Great”—​the satanic attack of Gog of Magog upon Jehovah’s people, and the rescue of them by God the Almighty at the war of Armageddon can strike with startling suddenness and can all occur within a comparatively short period of time.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>An important way to ‘prepare our prayers as incense’ is by expressing heartfelt praise and gratitude to God. King David offered such a prayer when he and the people of Israel contributed toward the construction of Jehovah’s temple. David prayed: “Blessed may you be, O Jehovah the God of Israel our father, from time indefinite even to time indefinite. Yours, O Jehovah, are the greatness and the mightiness and the beauty and the excellency and the dignity; for everything in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O Jehovah, the One also lifting yourself up as head over all. The riches and the glory are on account of you, and you are dominating everything; and in your hand there are power and mightiness, and in your hand is ability to make great and to give strength to all. And now, O our God, we are <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>thanking you and praising your beauteous name.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:29:10-13:29:13" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 29:10-13</a>.</p>

(b) If we share the sentiments expressed at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:4-19:27:4" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Psalm 27:4</a>, what will we do?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>What beautiful expressions of praise and thankfulness! Our prayers may not be as eloquent, but they can be just as heartfelt. The book of Psalms is filled with prayers of thanks and praise. Choice words of praise are found in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:1-19:150:6" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalms 148 to 150</a>. Gratitude to God is expressed in many psalms. “One thing I have asked from Jehovah,” sang David. “It is what I shall look for, that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the pleasantness of Jehovah and to look with appreciation upon his temple.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:4-19:27:4" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Psalm 27:4</a>) Let us act in harmony with such prayers by participating zealously in all the activities of Jehovah’s congregated throngs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:26:12-19:26:12" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 26:12</a>) Doing this and meditating on God’s Word daily will give us many reasons to approach Jehovah with heartfelt praise and gratitude.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>If we are serving Jehovah wholeheartedly as his Witnesses, we can be sure that he hears our prayers for help. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:10-23:43:12" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isaiah 43:10-12</a>) Consider King Asa of Judah. The first 10 years of his 41-year reign (977-937 B.C.E.) were marked by peace. Then Judah was invaded by a million-man army under Zerah the Ethiopian. Though greatly outnumbered, Asa and his men went out to meet the invaders. Before the battle, however, Asa prayed fervently. He acknowledged Jehovah’s power to deliver. Pleading for help, the king said: “Upon you we do lean, and in your name we have come against this crowd. O Jehovah, you are our God. Do not let mortal man retain strength against you.” Total victory resulted as Jehovah saved Judah for the sake of his great name. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:14:1-14:14:15" data-bid="25-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 14:1-15</a>) Whether God delivers us from a trial or strengthens us to endure it, there is no question that he hears our pleas for his assistance.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>If we do not know how to deal with a certain crisis, we can be confident that Jehovah will hear our petitions for help. This was illustrated in the days of Judean King Jehoshaphat, whose 25-year reign began in 936 B.C.E. When Judah was threatened by the combined forces of Moab, Ammon, and the mountainous region of Seir, Jehoshaphat pleaded: “O our God, will you not execute judgment upon them? For in us there is no power before this large crowd that is coming against us; and we ourselves do not know what we ought to do, but our eyes are toward you.” Jehovah answered that humble prayer, fighting for Judah by striking <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>the enemy ranks with confusion so that they slaughtered one another. As a result, the surrounding nations became fearful, and peace prevailed in Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:1-14:20:30" data-bid="26-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 20:1-30</a>) When we lack the wisdom needed to meet a crisis, like Jehoshaphat we can pray: ‘We do not know what we ought to do, but our eyes are toward you, Jehovah.’ The holy spirit may cause us to recall Scriptural points needed to solve the problem, or God may help us in a way that surpasses human reasoning.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:26-45:8:27" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Romans 8:26, 27</a>.</p>

One day Persian King Artaxerxes asked dejected Nehemiah: “What is this that you are seeking to secure?” “At once,” reports Nehemiah, “I prayed to the God of the heavens.” That short and silent prayer was answered, for Nehemiah was permitted to fulfill his heart’s desire by going to Jerusalem to rebuild its ruined wall.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:2:1-16:2:8" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Nehemiah 2:1-8</a>.</p>

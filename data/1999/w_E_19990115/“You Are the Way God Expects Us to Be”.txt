“You Are the Way God Expects Us to Be”
COOPERATING with secular authorities “for the Lord’s sake,” Christians can expect to receive “praise [as] doers of good.” (1 Peter 2:13-15) Jehovah’s Witnesses in South Africa experienced this a while ago at a district convention they held in a college campus hall.
On the first day of the convention, the college security police braced themselves for the usual number of irate and uncooperative delegates, such as they experienced with other sorts of conventions. Never having had dealings with Jehovah’s Witnesses, however, they were in for a pleasant surprise!
As part of their regular security checks at the gates, the security police searched every car entering and leaving the property. They were astonished when they were greeted with friendliness, patience, and respect, even though the searches delayed the delegates. There was none of the usual resistance, arguing, and abusive speech. “Unlike other visitors,” remarked one security officer, “you display a humble spirit and quiet dignity that are obvious to us all.”
Once the chief of security became aware of the cooperative conduct of Jehovah’s Witnesses, he decided that it was not necessary to search the cars “because,” he said, “you are so well disciplined.” Consequently, cars identified with “JW” parking stickers were granted entrance without being searched.
At the end of the convention, the chief of security said that he hoped to see the Witnesses back again soon. “We have never seen such well-behaved people,” he stated. “You are the way God expects us to be.” Such commendation is an added incentive for true Christians to ‘maintain fine conduct,’ so that people ‘may glorify God as a result of the fine works of which they are eyewitnesses.’​—1 Peter 2:12.
